      This is an observational, multicenter, single-day, Phase 2 study. This study will include a&#xD;
      14-day Screening Period and Study Day 1 clinic visit. Participants will be required to&#xD;
      perform an activity to induce symptoms of PAH, and participants' severity of self-reported&#xD;
      symptoms of PAH will be measured from pre-activity, immediately after the activity, and&#xD;
      through the 30-minute recovery. Participants will be asked about their PAH symptoms using 3&#xD;
      PGI-S questions that address their overall PAH symptoms, shortness of breath, and physical&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;

      This is an observational, multicenter, single-day, Phase 2 study. This study will include a&#xD;
      14-day Screening Period and Study Day 1 clinic visit. Participants will be required to&#xD;
      perform an activity to induce symptoms of PAH, and participants' severity of self-reported&#xD;
      symptoms of PAH will be measured from pre-activity, immediately after the activity, and&#xD;
      through the 30-minute recovery. Participants will be asked about their PAH symptoms using 3&#xD;
      Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) questions that address their overall PAH&#xD;
      symptoms, shortness of breath, and physical fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH symptoms will be induced via the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT). The ISWT used in&#xD;
      this study required the participant to walk back and forth on a 10-meter course. The total&#xD;
      number of shuttles completed by a participant during the Screening ISWT will be the maximum&#xD;
      targeted for that participant during the remaining ISWTs in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Screening, participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on PAH medications as&#xD;
      prescribed by their physician: Cohort A will include participants who are currently&#xD;
      prescribed and using inhaled treprostinil for the treatment of PAH and Cohort B will include&#xD;
      participants who are taking other PAH medications (instead of inhaled treprostinil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also includes 2 periods. One period for participants in Cohort A (Treprostinil&#xD;
      Users), included an ISWT initiated within 30 minutes of the previous dose (expected peak&#xD;
      level) and the other period included an ISWT within 3 to 4 hours of the previous dose of&#xD;
      inhaled treprostinil (expected trough level). Participants in Cohort B (Non-Treprostinil&#xD;
      Users), an ISWT will be initiated approximately 4 hours after the morning dose of PAH&#xD;
      medication (Period 1) and an ISWT initiated at least 1 hour following completion of the&#xD;
      previous ISWT (Period 2). Participants will be provided at least a 1-hour period for rest&#xD;
      between ISWTs (until participant feels they are rested enough to perform again at their&#xD;
      baseline level) prior to Period 2 assessments.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) Score in Cohort A Participants at Approximately 30 Minutes of Previous Dose of Inhaled Treprostinil (the Expected Peak Level) on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Approximately 30 m of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil (the expected peak level) on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>A global index that consists of 3 questions to which participants will rate the severity of 1) their PAH symptoms, 2) shortness of breath (SOB), and 3) fatigue. The minimum and maximum range of scores for each of the 3 individual questions was 1-5, with severity scale choices of 1=Not present, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe, and 5=Very Severe. A higher score indicated worse outcome. The Baseline is defined as the average respective severity rating measured at 15 minutes and 0 minute prior to the ISWT. In the case of a single, missing severity rating measured pre-ISWT, the other non-missing single severity rating would be used as baseline value. Only participants with both a measurement at baseline and at the given post-baseline visit are summarized. Change from Baseline = Post-Baseline value - Baseline value. Peak levels are the highest concentrations of a drug in plasma.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Borg Dyspnea Scores at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, ~30 m of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil, ~3-4 h of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil, ~4 h after morning dose of non-treprostinil PAH medication, and ≥1 h following completion of previous ISWT on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Borg scale allows participants to rate maximum level of dyspnea experienced during 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Scores ranged from 0 (best condition) to 10 (worst condition). Baseline defined as average from Borg Dyspnea Scores measured at 15 and 0 m prior to ISWT. If a single pre-ISWT Borg Dyspnea Score was missing, the other nonmissing single score was used as baseline value. Change from Baseline=Post-Baseline value - Baseline value. Data for participants in Cohort A with an ISWT initiated at 30 m of previous dose (expected peak level) and an ISWT initiated at 3-4 h of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil (expected trough level) on Day 1 are presented. Data for participants in Cohort B with an ISWT initiated at 4 h after morning dose of non-treprostinil PAH medication (Period 1) and with an ISWT initiated at least 1 h following completion of previous ISWT (Period 2) on Day 1 are presented. Peak and trough levels are highest and lowest concentrations of a drug in plasma.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pulse Oximetry at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, ~30 m of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil, ~3-4 h of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil, ~4 h after morning dose of non-treprostinil PAH medication, and ≥1 h following completion of previous ISWT on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse Oximetry includes the collection of saturation peripheral capillary oxygenation (SpO_2). Baseline was defined as the average from pulse oximetry measured at 15 minutes and 0 minute prior to the ISWT. In the case of a single, missing pre-ISWT pulse oximetry, the other non-missing single measurement would be used as baseline value. Change from Baseline = Post-Baseline value - Baseline value. Data for participants in Cohort A who had an ISWT initiated at 30 m of previous dose (expected peak level) and an ISWT initiated at 3-4 h of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil (expected trough level) on Day 1 are presented. Additionally, data for participants in Cohort B who included an ISWT initiated at 4 h after morning dose of non-treprostinil PAH medication (Period 1) and with an ISWT initiated at least 1 h following completion of previous ISWT (Period 2) on Day 1 are presented. Peak and trough levels are the highest and lowest concentrations of a drug in plasma.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, ~30 m of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil, ~3-4 h of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil, ~4 h after morning dose of non-treprostinil PAH medication, and ≥1 h following completion of previous ISWT on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate was captured as beats per minute (bpm). Baseline was defined as the average from pulse oximetry measured at 15 minutes and 0 minute prior to the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT). In the case of a single, missing pre-ISWT pulse oximetry, the other non-missing single measurement would be used as baseline value. Change from Baseline = Post-Baseline value - Baseline value.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study included a 14-day Screening Period and Day 1 clinic visit. Participants performed a Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) to induce symptoms of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The ISWT required participants to walk back and forth on a 10-meter course. Total number of shuttles completed by a participant during the Screening ISWT was the maximum targeted for the participant for remaining study ISWTs. Study also included 2 periods/cohort. There was ≥1-h rest period between ISWTs.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The 2 periods for Cohort A: an ISWT initiated at 30 minutes (m) of previous dose (the expected peak level period) and an ISWT initiated at 3-4 hours (h) of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil (the expected trough level period). The 2 periods for Cohort B: an ISWT initiated at ~4h after morning dose of PAH medication (Period 1) and an ISWT initiated at ≥1h following completion of previous ISWT (Period 2). Peak and trough levels are the highest and lowest concentrations of a drug in plasma.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>A global index that consists of 3 questions to which participants will rate the severity of 1) their PAH symptoms, 2) shortness of breath (SOB), and 3) fatigue. The minimum and maximum range of scores for each of the 3 individual questions was 1-5, with severity scale choices of 1=Not present, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe, and 5=Very Severe. A higher score indicated worse outcome. The Baseline is defined as the average respective severity rating measured at 15 minutes and 0 minute prior to the ISWT. In the case of a single, missing severity rating measured pre-ISWT, the other non-missing single severity rating would be used as baseline value. Only participants with both a measurement at baseline and at the given post-baseline visit are summarized. Change from Baseline = Post-Baseline value - Baseline value. Peak levels are the highest concentrations of a drug in plasma.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PGI-S Score in Cohort A Participants at Approximately 3-4 Hours of Previous Dose of Inhaled Treprostinil (the Expected Trough Level) on Day 1</title>
        <description>A global index that consists of 3 questions to which participants will rate the severity of 1) their PAH symptoms, 2) SOB, and 3) fatigue. The minimum and maximum range of scores for each of the 3 individual questions was 1-5, with severity scale choices of 1=Not present, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe, and 5=Very Severe. A higher score indicated worse outcome. The Baseline is defined as the average respective severity rating measured at 15 minutes and 0 minute prior to the ISWT. In the case of a single, missing severity rating measured pre-ISWT, the other non-missing single severity rating would be used as baseline value. Only participants with both a measurement at baseline and at the given post-baseline visit are summarized. Change from Baseline = Post-Baseline value - Baseline value. Trough levels are the lowest concentrations of a drug in plasma.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Borg Dyspnea Scores at Day 1</title>
        <description>The modified Borg scale allows participants to rate maximum level of dyspnea experienced during 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Scores ranged from 0 (best condition) to 10 (worst condition). Baseline defined as average from Borg Dyspnea Scores measured at 15 and 0 m prior to ISWT. If a single pre-ISWT Borg Dyspnea Score was missing, the other nonmissing single score was used as baseline value. Change from Baseline=Post-Baseline value - Baseline value. Data for participants in Cohort A with an ISWT initiated at 30 m of previous dose (expected peak level) and an ISWT initiated at 3-4 h of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil (expected trough level) on Day 1 are presented. Data for participants in Cohort B with an ISWT initiated at 4 h after morning dose of non-treprostinil PAH medication (Period 1) and with an ISWT initiated at least 1 h following completion of previous ISWT (Period 2) on Day 1 are presented. Peak and trough levels are highest and lowest concentrations of a drug in plasma.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate at Day 1</title>
        <description>Heart rate was captured as beats per minute (bpm). Baseline was defined as the average from pulse oximetry measured at 15 minutes and 0 minute prior to the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT). In the case of a single, missing pre-ISWT pulse oximetry, the other non-missing single measurement would be used as baseline value. Change from Baseline = Post-Baseline value - Baseline value. Data for participants in Cohort A who had an ISWT initiated at 30 m of previous dose (expected peak level) and an ISWT initiated at 3-4 h of previous dose of inhaled treprostinil (expected trough level) on Day 1 are presented. Additionally, data for participants in Cohort B who included an ISWT initiated at 4 h after morning dose of non-treprostinil PAH medication (Period 1) and with an ISWT initiated at least 1 h following completion of previous ISWT (Period 2) on Day 1 are presented. Peak and trough levels are the highest and lowest concentrations of a drug in plasma.</description>
