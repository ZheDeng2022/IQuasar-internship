  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to assess the agreement between INVU™ and IUPC (the&#xD;
      gold standard) during prenatal monitoring of uterine contractions and to assess the safety of&#xD;
      INVU™. Additional information comparing INVU™ to TOCO (the standard of care) was also&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, prospective, comparative, open-label study will be performed in two steps:&#xD;
      A training step where up to 40 subjects will be enrolled to confirm uterine contraction&#xD;
      performance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second, validation step, the performance of the uterine contraction detection&#xD;
      algorithm will be validated. The validation phase will involve up to 80 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study will be implemented in the sites that will monitor the uterine activity of the&#xD;
      subjects with TOCO, in addition to INVU™ and IUPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the screening process, participants subject will undergo continuous recording of&#xD;
      the uterine contraction and the fetal heart rate (FHR) for 30 to 60 min using INVU™,&#xD;
      Cardiotocograph ((TOCO / CTG), and Intrauterine Pressure Catheters (IUPC). The collected data&#xD;
      will be downloaded and comprehensive analysis of the values will be performed offline. Each&#xD;
      participant will undergo continuous monitoring by the medical team to identify any safety&#xD;
      issue, including but not limited to irritation, sensitization, and potential harmful misuse.&#xD;

    <time_frame>30-60 minutes per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Three blinded assessors will review the uterine contractions output data (the recordings) from the monitoring devices and determine for each time point whether a contraction occurred. The assessors will not have visibility to the source of the recorded data. Each assessor will review the sessions in a randomized order, while the evaluation will include: a contraction start point, peak, and endpoint. The actual presence of a contraction will be determined by the IUPC.</description>
