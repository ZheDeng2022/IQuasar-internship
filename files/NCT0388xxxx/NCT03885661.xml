  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1 pilot/feasibility mechanistic experiment to help clarify the&#xD;
      mechanism of action of an EPA-rich fish oil preparation, icosapent ethyl, on lipid changes in&#xD;
      statin-treated patients with residual triglyceridemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized, controlled pilot/feasibility experiment in a small number&#xD;
      of statin-treated patients with residual triglyceridemia assigned to chronic daily exposure&#xD;
      to icosapent ethyl 4 g daily vs usual care to get preliminary data to ultimately design a&#xD;
      definitive hypothesis-testing experiment to clarify the mechanism of action whereby icosapent&#xD;
      ethyl alters lipoprotein kinetics. The formal statistical aim is to develop statistical&#xD;
      parameters such as central tendency, dispersion, and distributional shape to design a robust&#xD;
      hypothesis-testing study. The primary outcome is based around stable-isotope lipoprotein&#xD;
      kinetics, specifically apolipoprotein B kinetics.&#xD;

               -  1. Diagnosis of idiopathic or otherwise active diabetes: History of resolved&#xD;
                  gestational or drug-induced diabetes is acceptable, but history Type I or Type II&#xD;
                  diabetes are exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Use of medications indicated for the treatment of diabetes within 6 weeks of&#xD;
                  the first experimental visit (see Prohibited Treatments) 3. History of a&#xD;

&#xD;
                  4. Known inefficacy to TG-lowering doses of fish oils (e.g. &gt;= 4 caps daily of&#xD;
                  prescription fish oil or &gt;= 6 caps daily of supplemental fish oil).&#xD;

&#xD;
                  10. Severe allergy to fish, unless non-allergic response to fish oil is&#xD;
                  established (n.b. most fish allergies are to the proteins as opposed to the fats,&#xD;
                  so with highly-purified oils the risk of a true allergy is remote).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  11. Known intolerance or contraindication to Vascepa, and if the former is&#xD;
                  unknown, known intolerance or contraindication to fish oil 12. Any surgical or&#xD;
                  medical condition that may interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism,&#xD;
                  or excretion of EPA or DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  13. History of extreme triglyceridemia (TG &gt; 1000 mg/dL) or pancreatitis from&#xD;
                  triglyceridemia, regardless of whether it is currently controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  14. Medical condition that would prohibit fasting (e.g. diagnosis of insulinoma&#xD;
                  or postabsorptive hypoglycemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  15. Significant disinclination to dairy products (e.g. lactose intolerance,&#xD;
                  inviolable dietary restrictions). All participants will receive a test dose of&#xD;
                  the fat challenge during the screening visit, which consists of heavy cream and&#xD;
                  lactase enzyme. Many people with lactose intolerance successfully avert symptoms&#xD;
                  by correcting their lactase deficiency with lactase supplements. We will allow&#xD;
                  these people to participate because we will allow them to take their preferred&#xD;
                  brand and dose of lactase supplement beyond the lactase in the fat challenge if&#xD;
                  needed. However, we still require that they are able to tolerate the test dose&#xD;
                  given during screening.&#xD;

                  any organ transplant. 21. History of illicit drug use within the past 3 years, or&#xD;
                  regular alcohol use of greater than 14 drinks per week. For clarity, illicit&#xD;
                  substances are per Federal law or regulations in effect at the time of first&#xD;
                  approval of this protocol.&#xD;

                  conditions, including known or suspected personality disorders, that could&#xD;
                  compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the study in the&#xD;
                  opinion of the investigator.&#xD;

                  26. Subject-reported history of HIV and/or use of HIV medications 27. History of&#xD;
                  symptomatic gallstone disease unless definitively treated (e.g. condition&#xD;
                  successfully treated with cholecystectomy without recurrent or residual biliary&#xD;
                  disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  28. History of bariatric surgery or other major gastrointestinal surgery&#xD;
                  associated with major disruptions to drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  29. Anticipation of major surgery during the screening or treatment periods of&#xD;
                  the study 30. Participants with the following conditions will opt out of heparin&#xD;
                  exposure for lipase determinations, but will be allowed to participate in the&#xD;
                  overall protocol.&#xD;

                  blood within 8 weeks prior to the first experimental visit. Participation in the&#xD;
                  screening phase is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  40. History of inherent unremediable risks for anemia, such as&#xD;
                  hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic disorders, and bleeding disorders, regardless of&#xD;

&#xD;
                  41. History of a large-volume gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, such as a bleed&#xD;
                  that required ER evaluation or admission, required acute endoscopic or surgical&#xD;

                  42. History of NSAID-mediated peptic ulcer disease is excluded, irrespective of&#xD;
                  current medical treatment. A history of peptic ulcer disease from H. pylori does&#xD;
                  not exclude participation provided H. pylori was successfully eradicated. Other&#xD;
                  causes of peptic ulcer disease may be allowable, especially if definitively&#xD;
                  treated or the risk of recurrence is otherwise low.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  43. Chronic, untreated conditions that predispose to anemia, such as significant&#xD;
                  iron or B vitamin malabsorption, persistent menorrhagia, or other chronic or&#xD;
                  intermittent bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  44. Participation in an investigational drug study concurrently; participants who&#xD;
                  previously completed an investigational drug study cannot participate in the&#xD;
                  first experimental visit until at least 6 weeks after the final dose given during&#xD;
                  the previous investigational drug study. For the purposes of this exclusion, an&#xD;
                  investigational drug is a new chemical entity or a pharmaceutical investigated to&#xD;
                  support an initial new drug application. Furthermore, herbal or other supplements&#xD;
                  already deemed &quot;generally regarded as safe&quot; or legally sold in the U.S. would not&#xD;
                  be considered an investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  45. Use of medications indicated for the treatment of diabetes within 6 weeks of&#xD;
                  the first experimental visit 46. Daily therapy with non-statin lipid-altering&#xD;
                  medications within 6 weeks of the first experimental visit is exclusionary,&#xD;
                  including long-term therapy with the agents listed below. Subjects may wash off&#xD;
                  these medications so long as the first experimental visit occurs at least 6 weeks&#xD;
                  after chronic therapy ceases. Following a washout period, fasting lipids will be&#xD;
                  repeated prior to the first experimental visit to assure that these are not&#xD;
                  exclusionary as defined above.&#xD;
