  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, double-blind study comparing SLI-F06 to vehicle formulation buffer for the&#xD;
      improvement in scar appearance and wound strength in routine surgical excisions, as well as&#xD;
      post-operative abdominoplasty scar appearance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into 2 parts where Part A is a Phase I safety/proof of concept study of&#xD;
      small scars pre-abdominoplasty, and Part B is a Phase IIa study of post-abdominoplasty scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A of the study, subjects will have their abdominoplasty site mapped to accommodate a&#xD;
      series of excisions depending on pannus size. All excisions to be treated with SLI-F06 will&#xD;
      be on one side of the mapped area (i.e., left side or right side) and vehicle treated&#xD;
      excisions will be on the other side of the mapped area. At time of abdominoplasty the&#xD;
      excision site will be harvested and processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B of the study, subjects who complete Part A will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      injections of SLI-F06 along one half (left or right) of the abdominoplasty incision and&#xD;
      control injections along the other half. The subject will undergo routine wound care and will&#xD;
      attend study follow-up visits following abdominoplasty. The entire incision will be treated&#xD;
      post-operatively in precisely the same manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study-approximately 15 months.&#xD;

          1. Outpatient, male or female of any race, 18 years of age or older. Female subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative UPT at Visit 1a and 1b and practice a&#xD;
             reliable method of contraception throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Seeking or scheduled for standard elective abdominoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing to undergo directed excisions and follow-up prior to abdominoplasty and to&#xD;
             undergo all follow-up visits after abdominoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing to undergo directed excisions under local anesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be able to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits.&#xD;

             abdominoplasty that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator (PI), could&#xD;
