    <textblock>
      Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common human malignant tumors. The&#xD;
      incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in our country are on the rise. Surgery-based,&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy comprehensive treatment, is the main treatment of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Surgical resection has been recognized as the primary treatment of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. However, due to the majority of patients already advanced at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis, some difficulties are brought to radical surgery. Therefore, the importance of&#xD;
      chemotherapy for colorectal cancer gradually been clinically recognized, But rarely survive&#xD;
      more than 18 months.&quot; In addition to chemotherapy, there is now a more ideal model of cancer&#xD;
      treatment- molecular targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibody drugs such as&#xD;
      cetuximab, as well as small molecule tyrosine kinases Inhibitors gefitinib and so on.&#xD;
      Molecular targeted drugs make use of the difference in molecular biology between tumor cells&#xD;
      and normal cells. Targeting drugs to tumor cells and inhibiting the growth and proliferation&#xD;
      of the cells can achieve the therapeutic effect, which has the advantages of high specificity&#xD;
      and low adverse reaction. The bio-targeted drug cetuximab is the first drug approved to&#xD;
      marketed as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting immunoglobulin&#xD;
      1（IgG1）monoclonal antibody. Cetuximab, either monotherapy or combined radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, can exert excellent anti-tumor activity in EGFR-positive malignant tumors and&#xD;
      can significantly enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference to cetuximab injection, guilin sanjin Co., Ltd. and dragonboat Co., Ltd. jointly&#xD;
      developed a recombinant anti-EGFR human mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (R &amp; D code:&#xD;
      CDP1).The primary structure of CDP1 is exactly the same with cetuximab, the higher structure&#xD;
      and Physical and chemical properties and cetuximab are highly similar. Pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      activity in vivo and in vitro, pharmacokinetic characteristics and toxicological reactions&#xD;
      are also similar to cetuximab. CDP1 selected with cetuximab consistent formulations,&#xD;
      prescriptions, specifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDP1 was approved by China Food and Drug Administration (No. 2016L06884) in August 2016 for&#xD;
      clinical studies. According to the contents of the document and guidelines for biological&#xD;
      analogs, the clinical pharmacokinetic and clinical effectiveness comparison tests of CDP1 and&#xD;
      the safety and immunogenicity assessment are planned.&#xD;
