      1. Background During the last years, the brain has been identified as a major&#xD;
           insulin-sensitive organ . The investigators and also other scientists identified&#xD;
           hypothalamus, fusiform gyrus and prefrontal cortex as major insulin-sensitivity brain&#xD;
           areas in humans . Brain insulin action regulates important physiological functions in&#xD;
           humans such as food intake, body weight regulation, and cognition. Furthermore, animal&#xD;
           studies suggest that insulin action specifically in the brain is involved in the control&#xD;
           of peripheral glucose metabolism via regulation of the sensitivity to insulin in the&#xD;
           rest of the body. Recently, the investigators were able to replicate these findings in&#xD;
           humans: The investigators measured whole-body insulin sensitivity in combination with&#xD;
           the well-established experimental delivery of human insulin to the brain via an&#xD;
           intranasal approach. Peripheral insulin sensitivity was profoundly improved by brain&#xD;
           insulin action in lean but not in obese healthy volunteers. What determines the&#xD;
           effectiveness of this brain-derived pathway is still unknown. Furthermore, insulin&#xD;
           resistance of the brain is linked to neurodegenerative diseases possibly explaining the&#xD;
           elevated risk for such diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to acutely modulate appetite- and reward-related&#xD;
           brain areas in humans. Research in animals suggest a close interaction between insulin&#xD;
           and GLP-1 action especially in homeostatic centers of the hypothalamus. In this context,&#xD;
           it is important that GLP-1 sensitivity of the brain is still present in the insulin&#xD;
           resistant human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators therefore hypothesized that GLP-1 agonists are able to improve insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity of the brain; this might be one mechanism how GLP-1 agonists lead to weight&#xD;
           loss and improved glucose metabolism. This might also have beneficial implications for&#xD;
           cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, at present, there are no human studies examining the effect of a GLP-1 agonist&#xD;
           on brain activity and especially insulin action in the brain in patients with type 2&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, there is no study in humans examining the effect of newly initiated insulin&#xD;
           therapy on brain activity and especially insulin action in the brain in patients with&#xD;
           T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale Based on the close interplay between hypothalamic insulin and GLP-1&#xD;
           signalling, the investigators hypothesize that the antidiabetic therapy with insulin&#xD;
           glargine/lixisenatide combination (iGlarLixi) induces improved hypothalamic and&#xD;
           prefrontal insulin sensitivity compared to a therapy with insulin glargine alone. This&#xD;
           could underlay iGlarLixi's beneficial effects on body weight and whole-body glucose&#xD;
           homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective To assess whether treatment with iGlarLixi versus insulin glargine changes&#xD;
           brain regional insulin sensitivity and thereby glucose metabolism, eating behaviour, and&#xD;
           cognition in patients with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled with oral&#xD;
           antidiabetic drugs (OAD).&#xD;
