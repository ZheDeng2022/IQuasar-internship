    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever is an infection caused by the bacteria Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi). S. Typhi&#xD;
      causes disease principally in developing countries where communities do not have access to&#xD;
      safe water or adequate sanitation. It is thought to cause illness in approximately 22 million&#xD;
      people every year and up to 200,000 deaths, mostly in children. The bacteria are spread when&#xD;
      faeces from infected individuals contaminate food and water sources. Symptoms of infection&#xD;
      include headache, fever and general aches and pains. If not treated properly typhoid&#xD;
      infection can lead to severe complications and even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to understand more about the S. Typhi bacteria and how S.&#xD;
      Typhi causes a bloodstream infection after it has been ingested and passed into the gut. In&#xD;
      spite of the extensive morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial blood stream&#xD;
      infections (BSI), comparatively little is known about the pathogenesis. At a time of&#xD;
      increasing antimicrobial resistance and a lack of new antimicrobial agents, understanding the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of BSI is essential for efforts directed at prevention both of Salmonella Typhi&#xD;
      and other bacterial species, particularly those that are restricted to humans.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of bacteraemia for human restricted pathogens such as Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (ST), have&#xD;
      thus far only been investigated in imperfect animal models. The Salmonella Typhimurium mouse&#xD;
      model is widely employed however there are key differences compared with S. Typhi. These&#xD;
      bacteria are both genetically distinct and cause a different human disease phenotype . Data&#xD;
      from a human model would be invaluable in furthering our understanding of bacteraemia in the&#xD;
      human host. Animal studies with Salmonella species and other bacterial species show some&#xD;
      evidence that there may be population bottlenecks in the development of blood stream&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inoculation with many microorganisms is often sufficient to cause a blood stream infection in&#xD;
      a susceptible host, typically inoculation with a single microorganism is not. There are two&#xD;
      principle theories as to how bacteraemia arises. The first is independent action whereby the&#xD;
      bacteraemia that results from bacterial inoculation is derived from a single founder organism&#xD;
      ('the bottleneck hypothesis'). Each organism has a chance of being that founder organism. A&#xD;
      greater number of organisms make bacteraemia more likely. The second theory is synergy where&#xD;
      there is cooperation between bacteria, multiple bacteria traverse the barrier to infection&#xD;
      and therefore the bacteraemia is composed of multiple variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research project is to investigate the population bottleneck theory in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of bacteraemia in human infection model using a challenge combination of two&#xD;
      isogenic strains of S. Typhi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the number of participants who develop&#xD;
      bacteraemia post challenge from each S. Typhi variant or a combination of the two strains.&#xD;
      From animal models the investigators hypothesize that in an individual participant a single&#xD;
      strain will be isolated more commonly than a combination of the two. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to quantify the burden of bacteraemia of the two strains and to characterise the stool&#xD;
      shedding in participants given a mixed inoculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives include comparison of the number of participants who develop&#xD;
      bacteraemia at various timepoints until 72 hours from each S. Typhi variant or a combination&#xD;
      of the two strains. From animal models it is expected that any so-called 'primary&#xD;
      bacteraemias' may involve a combination of the S. Typhi strains. The researchers also&#xD;
      anticipate that stool cultures from study participants may culture a combination of the S.&#xD;
      Typhi strains initially but that if a single isolate is cultured from the blood that this&#xD;
      will be reflected in stool culture. The investigators will explore if quantitation of S.&#xD;
      Typhi is possible in stool. They will also seek to evaluate the host immune response to&#xD;
      challenge in terms of cytokine and blood transcriptional signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time in which the bottleneck theory has been explored in a human model of a&#xD;
      bloodstream infection. It will not only be significant for understanding the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      S. Typhi but also for other bacterial pathogens. If this hypothesis is supported this implies&#xD;
      that the barrier for vaccine prevention of bacterial infection may be lower than previously&#xD;
      thought, perhaps only very few or even a single organism must be prevented from invasion to&#xD;
      provide individual protection.&#xD;
