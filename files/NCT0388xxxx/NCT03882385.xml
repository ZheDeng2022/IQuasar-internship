    <textblock>
      The congenital malformation (CMF) include disturbance in normal process of organogenesis&#xD;
      occurring before birth .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The (CMF) are structural ,functional, or (biochemical Molecular) defect presenting at&#xD;
           birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The structural defect resulting from prenatal insult during period of embryogeneses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The neonate with congenital malformation have differences in physiology, anatomy, in&#xD;
           response to stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The (CMF) are important causes of infant disability , illness, deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (CMF) classified into mild, moderate, severe and lethal&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The (CMF) may be structural abnormalities with significant effect on function (e.g) cleft&#xD;
      palate .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Or minimal effect on clinical function but may have cosmotic impact (e.g) pre-auricular pit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developed countries, outcome of neonatal congenital anomalies is favourable because of&#xD;
      availability of antenatal diagnosis, improved surgical skills and technologies, sophisticated&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit, availability of total parenteral nutrition and adequate staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developing countries, however, neonatal surgery is still fraught with a lot of problems&#xD;
      including late presentation and lack of medical facilities and human resources, thereby,&#xD;
      making newborn surgery to be associated with unacceptably high morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the burden of other neonatal and childhood diseases in developing countries, neonatal&#xD;
      surgery is often considered low priority in healthcare budget planning and allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effective live , saving medical treatment is available for survival birth defects with&#xD;
           functional disorders .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal with birth defect may be further referred to appropriate level of medical ,&#xD;
           surgical facilities .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unknown cause&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preconception causes are genetic and partially genetic, originating mostly before&#xD;
           conception. Birth defects are due to abnormalities of the genetic material-chromosomes&#xD;
           and genes including chromosomal abnormalities, single gene defects and multifactorial&#xD;
           disorders (which are caused by the interaction of genes and the environment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-conception causes develop after conception, but before birth. Birth defect is&#xD;
           caused by an intra-uterine environmental factor. This includes teratogens that interfere&#xD;
           with normal growth and development of the embryo or foetus, mechanical forces that&#xD;
           deform the foetus, and vascular accidents that disrupt the normal growth of organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socioeconomic and demographic factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital anomalies are more frequently seen among low income families and countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal age: advanced maternal age increases the risk of chromosomal abnormalities,&#xD;
           such as Down syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some Maternal infections during pregnancy can increase the risk of birth defects such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rubella infection (German measles-a viral infection) to pregnant mother can result in to&#xD;
      miscarriage, deafness, intellectual disability, heart defects and blindness in newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxoplasmosis (disease caused by parasite found in soil) infection during pregnancy can cause&#xD;
      birth defects such as hearing loss, vision problems and intellectual disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexually transmitted infections (STIs): such as syphilis, cytomegalovirus can cause serious&#xD;
      birth defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zika virus infection: during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects (microcephaly and&#xD;
      other abnormalities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Environmental factors: Maternal exposure to certain medications, psychoactive drugs,&#xD;
      tobacco, radiation and pesticides during pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital&#xD;
      anomalies in foetus or neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working or living near, or in, waste sites, smelters or mines may also be a risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain drugs when taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects; these drugs are called&#xD;
      teratogenic drugs (Category 'X' drugs). Categories 'X' drugs are contraindicated during&#xD;
      pregnancy. (Drugs are categorized into 5 categories according to the development of adverse&#xD;
      effects on the foetus, category A, B, C, D and X.)&#xD;
