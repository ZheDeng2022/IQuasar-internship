  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the aim of the study to investigate the functioning of a drug delivery system&#xD;
      (drug-rich particles forming hot-melt extruded amorphous solid dispersions) with respect to&#xD;
      mechanisms of bioavailability of poorly soluble drug substances.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor drug solubility, and therefore low bioavailability, remains a problem in drug&#xD;
      development that causes many drug candidates to drop out during drug development.&#xD;
      Bioavailability is linked to drug solubility and intestinal permeability. A promising method&#xD;
      to increase drug solubility, and therefore bioavailability, is the formulation of the drug as&#xD;
      hot-melt extruded amorphous solid dispersion drug delivery systems, which have been shown to&#xD;
      potentially increase in vivo and clinical bioavailability.The mechanisms that lead to&#xD;
      increased bioavailability are not understood completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators investigate the role of amorphous solid dispersions and thereof&#xD;
      generated drug-rich particles on bioavailability and their in vivo behaviour. Investigators&#xD;
      do so by administering the delivery system at different stages in the process of drug&#xD;
      availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives are the pharmacokinetic analysis of a model formulation using efavirenz as&#xD;
      model drug tracer in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters such as relative bioavailability and further&#xD;
           parameters derived from pharmacokinetic analysis and corresponding interpatient&#xD;
           variabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mechanistic analysis of pharmacokinetic data, such as determination of in vivo&#xD;
           dissolution from the solid formulation (study product 1) to drug rich particles (study&#xD;
           product 2) using numerical deconvolution or analysis of the effect of drug rich&#xD;
           particles on the absorption rate of Efavirenz in comparison to the solution of Efavirenz&#xD;
           (study product 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the comparison of obtained pharmacokinetic profiles to existing data&#xD;
      of a conventional formulation with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters such as relative bioavailability and further&#xD;
           parameters derived from pharmacokinetic analysis and corresponding interpatient&#xD;
           variabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extrapolation investigation from in vitro to in vivo data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety objectives are the recording of any side effects or tolerability issues of the&#xD;
      investigational drug delivery system.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention consists of a single oral administration of 3 different formulations containing Efavirenz as model drug tracer in sub-therapeutic doses:&#xD;
Hot-melt extruded amorphous solid dispersion of Efavirenz, 50 mg, oral administration (product 1)&#xD;
Hot-melt extruded amorphous solid dispersion of Efavirenz, 50 mg, homogenized to drug rich particles, oral administration (product 2)&#xD;
Efavirenz solution, 3 mg, oral administration (product 3) On the first visit, subjects will be randomized into three groups, starting with the ingestion of study product 1, 2, or 3 with subsequent collection of blood samples for 72 hours. After a wash out period of two weeks, participants will repeat the procedure in phase B with ingestion of the subsequent study product. After a second wash out the participants will receive the last study product in study phase C.</intervention_model_description>
