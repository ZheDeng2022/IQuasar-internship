      Rationale: The Emergency Department (ED) typically serves as the front line for patients with&#xD;
      acute fractures and tendon ruptures. Pain control for these patients is an essential task of&#xD;
      the ED physician. With the advent of the opioid epidemic, ED physicians are becoming more&#xD;
      inclined to prescribe non-narcotic pain medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs). Yet, the effects of NSAIDs on musculoskeletal healing are controversial. The&#xD;
      few human studies examining the effects of NSAID use on fracture healing have provided&#xD;
      conflicting results. Even less is known about the effects of NSAIDs on tendon healing as this&#xD;
      information has largely been gleaned from rodent studies with contradictory findings. There&#xD;
      has never been a large, prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to determine the&#xD;
      effects of NSAIDs on healing after fractures or tendon ruptures. Here, I propose to pilot the&#xD;
      first prospective, randomized, double-blinded study examining the effects of NSAID use on&#xD;
      healing after tibia fractures and Achilles tendon ruptures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 seeks to determine whether NSAID use is associated with an increased incidence of&#xD;
      fracture nonunion and worse functional recovery six months following tibia fractures. I&#xD;
      hypothesize that NSAID use after tibia fractures will be associated with an increased&#xD;
      incidence of fracture nonunion and worse functional recovery. Aim 2 seeks to determine&#xD;
      whether NSAID use is associated with worse functional recovery six months after Achilles&#xD;
      tendon ruptures. I hypothesize that NSAID use after Achilles tendon ruptures will be&#xD;
      associated with worse functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Emergency Department providers commonly prescribe NSAIDs for pain control&#xD;
      following fractures and tendon injuries. However, the implications of this practice on bone&#xD;
      and tendon healing are unknown. This proposal will pilot the first prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded study to determine whether NSAID use affects healing after tibia fractures and&#xD;
      Achilles tendon ruptures. Results from this study will impact NSAID prescribing patterns for&#xD;
      tibia fractures and Achilles tendon ruptures in the ED, either by demonstrating that they&#xD;
      impair recovery and should be avoided, or that they need not be withheld as an effective&#xD;
      non-narcotic form of pain control.&#xD;

      Specific Aims The Emergency Department (ED) typically serves as the front line for patients&#xD;
      with fractures and tendon ruptures. Pain control for these patients is an essential task of&#xD;
      the ED physician. With the advent of the opioid epidemic, ED physicians are becoming more&#xD;
      inclined to prescribe non-narcotic pain medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs). Yet, the effects of NSAIDs on musculoskeletal healing are highly&#xD;
      controversial. There is some evidence that NSAIDs may prevent osteoblasts from rebuilding&#xD;
      bone after fractures by inhibiting COX-2. Indeed, some retrospective studies have found NSAID&#xD;
      use to be associated with an increased incidence of fracture nonunion after acetabular,&#xD;
      tibial, and humeral shaft fractures, while other studies reported no difference. The only&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of NSAIDs on fracture healing&#xD;
      reported no effect of NSAID use on healing after Colles fractures; however, these trials were&#xD;
      likely underpowered to detect a difference in nonunion rates. Here, I propose to pilot the&#xD;
      first large, prospective, randomized, double-blinded study examining the effects of NSAIDs on&#xD;
      healing after tibia fractures, which are vulnerable to nonunion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to fractures, the effects of NSAIDs on tendon healing are unclear. Some studies&#xD;
      suggest that NSAIDs may inhibit proliferation and migration of tendon cells after injury,&#xD;
      while other studies indicate that NSAIDs enhance collagen synthesis. Rodent studies are&#xD;
      equally conflicting, with some reports of worse outcomes associated with NSAID use and other&#xD;
      studies showing no difference. Recently, I obtained preliminary data showing that NSAID use&#xD;
      after Achilles tendon ruptures is associated with worse functional outcomes as measured by&#xD;
      the Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS). While this was the first study examining the&#xD;
      effects of NSAID use on recovery after Achilles tendon rupture in humans, the data were&#xD;
      retrospective, observational, and not blinded. Here, I propose to pilot the first&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to determine the effects of NSAIDs on recovery&#xD;
      after Achilles tendon ruptures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine whether NSAID use is associated with an increased incidence of fracture&#xD;
      nonunion and worse functional recovery six months after tibia fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: I hypothesize that NSAID use after tibia fractures will be associated with an&#xD;
      increased incidence of fracture nonunion and worse functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine whether NSAID use is associated with worse functional recovery six months&#xD;
      after Achilles tendon ruptures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: I hypothesize that NSAID use after Achilles tendon ruptures will be associated&#xD;
      with worse functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Approach: Adult patients (18 years old and over) presenting to either the&#xD;
      University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Ronald Regan Emergency Department, the UCLA Santa&#xD;
      Monica Emergency Department, or the UCLA Orthopedic after hours acute care clinic within 24&#xD;
      hours of sustaining a tibia fracture or Achilles tendon rupture will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility to participate. Patients will be excluded if they have a contraindication to&#xD;
      Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen use, if they do not have access to e-mail, if they do not wish to&#xD;
      participate, if they require emergent surgery (such as an open fracture), if they have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of osteoporosis, or if they have already taken pain medication since their injury.&#xD;
      Pregnant women will be excluded due to their inability to take NSAIDs. Children will be&#xD;
      excluded due to differences in bone and tendon healing. The ED represents the optimal&#xD;
      environment in which to conduct this study because most patients will initially present&#xD;
      acutely to the ED with these injuries, often before taking any pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients elect to participate, they will be randomized to receive either Ibuprofen (600mg&#xD;
      by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain) or Acetaminophen (650 mg by mouth every 6 hours as&#xD;
      needed for pain). I will use a permuted block design to develop the randomization schedule.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by sex. Sealed envelopes will be used to conceal the&#xD;
      allocation. The treating physician will open the envelope and provide the assigned study&#xD;
      medication and prescription bottle at discharge. Patients will be provided a one-month supply&#xD;
      of their assigned pain medication. Patients and providers will be blinded to which medication&#xD;
      the patient received. The individual medication capsules will be formulated to lack&#xD;
      identifying information. Study coordinators will record the patients' randomly generated&#xD;
      study identification number and prescription bottle number in Qualtrics, a HIPAA-compliant&#xD;
      online resource that collects, stores, and analyzes data. Demographic information such as age&#xD;
      and sex will also be stored in Qualtrics. Each week for one month, patients will be sent an&#xD;
      email with a link asking them to complete a Qualtrics survey to report 1) the number of&#xD;
      remaining pills, 2) their average pain scale ranging from 1-9, 3) what additional medications&#xD;
      they took, if any, and 4) whether they have experienced any medication-related side effects&#xD;
      or complications. In this way, we will determine the timing of medication administration for&#xD;
      each patient and quantify each patient's level of pain, while assessing for patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months post-injury, patients who sustained tibia fractures will receive repeat X-rays.&#xD;
      One final Qualtrics survey will be e-mailed to these patients at this time to determine their&#xD;
      average degree of pain on a scale of 1-9, their functional recovery on a scale of 1 to 3&#xD;
      (mild, moderate, or severe impairment) and whether they underwent treatments such as physical&#xD;
      therapy or surgery. The survey will also assess for lifestyle factors known to increase&#xD;
      nonunion rates including body habitus, medical problems, and other medications taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months following enrollment, patients who ruptured their Achilles tendon will be sent a&#xD;
      link to a Qualtrics survey via email. On this survey, they will be asked 10 questions with&#xD;
      responses on a scale of 0 to 10 that comprise the ATRS (29). A higher score (out of 100)&#xD;
      indicates better functional outcomes. Patients will also be asked if they underwent&#xD;
      treatments such as physical therapy or surgery. Body habitus, medical problems, other&#xD;
      medications taken, smoking status, pregnancy status, and fluoroquinolone use will also be&#xD;
      assessed on this survey, as these factors may impact tendon recovery.&#xD;
