      Efficacy and tolerance evaluation of an intradermal injective HA and aminoacids based&#xD;
      treatment for the area around the eyes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary end point of this study was to evaluate clinically and by non-invasive instrumental&#xD;
      measurements the aesthetic performance on the area around the eyes of the&quot;SUNEKOS® 200&quot;&#xD;
      injective treatment. Precisely three micro-injection sessions with an interval of 15 days&#xD;
      were performed by a specialized dermatologist using periosteal and subepidermal injection&#xD;
      techniques, on the area around the eyes of female volunteers with dark circles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional aim of this study is to evaluate the product tolerance by both the investigator&#xD;
      and volunteers.&#xD;

    <description>The intradermal injection procedure was performed bilaterally, on the area around the eyes including the eyelids, using periosteal and subepidermal injection techniques. This injective procedure consists of micro-wheals of 0.2 ml just above the periosteum and micro-wheals of 0.1 ml very superficially, just under epidermis.</description>
