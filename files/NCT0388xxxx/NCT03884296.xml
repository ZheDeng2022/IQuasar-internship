  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is one project of a larger ongoing study related to the immune system's response to the&#xD;
      flu virus. This study is designed to investigate the immune response to a nasal flu&#xD;
      immunization in tonsillar tissue compared to what can be measured in the blood.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV study of licensed influenza vaccines with up to 50 male and female&#xD;
      volunteers, 2-49 years of age. Volunteers were patients undergoing tonsillectomy for&#xD;
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other non-infectious indication as part of&#xD;
      their routine medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator intends to collect blood and lymphoid tissues routinely discarded during&#xD;
      surgery from adults and children after routine seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccination&#xD;
      (LAIV) to determine how immune memory develops at the actual site of infection, and how&#xD;
      immunization may alter this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first research study visit will take place approximately 3-14 days prior to the scheduled&#xD;
      date of tonsillectomy surgery. During this visit, 20 mL blood sample will be obtained and&#xD;
      participants will receive FluMist (intranasal, quadrivalent, live-attenuated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine). This is one of the routinely available and recommended vaccines for the age groups&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second study visit will take place on the same day of the scheduled surgery for the&#xD;
      tonsillectomy. Another blood sample (maximum volume of 20 mL) will be collected along with&#xD;
      the discarded tonsillar tissue. Blood and tissues will be sent to the lab.&#xD;

             study vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Life-threatening reactions to previous influenza vaccinations&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Asthma (contraindication for receipt of LAIV4)&#xD;
