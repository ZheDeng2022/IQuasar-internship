  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies olaparib and temozolomide in treating patients with uterine&#xD;
      leiomyosarcoma (LMS) that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic) or&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA&#xD;
      mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells&#xD;
      can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving olaparib and&#xD;
      temozolomide may work better than giving either drug alone in treating patients with LMS.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether combination treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) + olaparib shows&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of clinical activity among patients with advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma&#xD;
      (LMS) as measured by the confirmed objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile associated with the combination treatment. II. To&#xD;
      evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) associated with the combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate what proportion of uterine LMS tumors exhibit homologous recombination (HR)&#xD;
      deficiency as measured by (1) genomic alterations in HR components at baseline and (2)&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair protein RAD51 homolog (RAD51) foci formation at baseline&#xD;
      and while on study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the feasibility of these assays in human tissue, and to preliminarily&#xD;
      evaluate for any association between presence of HR deficiency as measured by each assay and&#xD;
      increased clinical benefit from the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate what proportion of uterine LMS tumors exhibit HR deficiency as measured by&#xD;
      Schlafen family member number 11(SLFN11) protein expression at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the feasibility of these assays in human tissue, and to preliminarily&#xD;
      evaluate for any association between presence of HR deficiency as measured by this assay and&#xD;
      increased clinical benefit from the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate MGMT protein expression in uterine LMS tumors, and to preliminarily evaluate&#xD;
      for any association between MGMT expression and increased clinical benefit from the study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To perform an optional third tissue biopsy in patients who initially benefit from study&#xD;
      treatment but later show early evidence of disease progression to evaluate for changes in the&#xD;
      status of the RAD51 foci, MGMT, and SLFN11 assays at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice per day (BID) and temozolomide PO once daily (QD)&#xD;
      on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months until death or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Within first 6 months of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria. A response rate of 10% is considered inactive and unworthy of further study. A response rate of 35% would be promising for further study among patients with advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) treated with at least one prior systemic regimen. A response rate of 35% for the temozolomide (TMZ) + poly(adenosine diphosphate[ADP]-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) combination would also be suggestive of superior efficacy over TMZ monotherapy in sarcoma. Will be reported with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by genomic alterations in HR components at baseline and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair protein RAD51 homolog (RAD51) foci formation. The two integrated assays are genomics for alterations in HR genes and RAD51 foci formation. Both of these assays report binary results. The rate of response will be compared between binary variables using the Fisher's exact test. The log-rank test will be used to compare PFS between binary variables. Additional results from whole exome sequencing and ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) analysis on study samples will be reported in a descriptive fashion.</description>

    <description>Will be assessed by immunohistochemistry (ICH). Macro ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression may also be performed. Expression are reported as a continuous variable. Logistic regression will be used to estimate the odds of response for every unit increase in protein expression. Cox-regression will be used to evaluate the association between PFS and protein expression. Graphical displays such as box plots and Kaplan-Meier plots will be used to visualize the data. Evaluate for any association between presence of HR deficiency and increased clinical benefit from study treatment.</description>

             the prevention of opportunistic infections and (c) have a CD4 count above 250 cell/mcL&#xD;
             and an undetectable viral load on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests&#xD;
             within 1 month of initiation of study treatment. Other patients with clinically&#xD;
             significant immunosuppression, e.g. organ transplant patients, are not eligible. If&#xD;
             clarification is needed, this may be discussed with the medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to have temozolomide provided as a standard of care medication.&#xD;

             treatment but which are controlled with replacement therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior to initiating study treatment, at least 28 days must have elapsed from the last&#xD;
             dose of systemic anti-cancer treatment (cytotoxic, biologic or immunotherapeutic) or&#xD;
             radiation therapy (except for palliative radiation, in which case a 14-day washout&#xD;
             applies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment&#xD;
             and must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery that occurred &gt; 2 weeks&#xD;
             before starting study treatment.&#xD;

             non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ (DCIS), any other malignant condition considered indolent and&#xD;
             unlikely to require active therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
             at the time of enrollment. Patients with a history of such disease previously treated&#xD;
             with curative intent (such as with surgery or radiation) that have not progressed on&#xD;
             subsequent imaging, have been clinically asymptomatic, and have not received systemic&#xD;

             moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole,&#xD;
             verapamil). The required washout period for strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors prior&#xD;
             to starting olaparib is 2 weeks. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.&#xD;
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled&#xD;
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need&#xD;
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must refrain from concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inducers (e.g.,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine,&#xD;
             carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g.,&#xD;
             bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period for strong or moderate&#xD;
             CYP3A inducers prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital&#xD;
             and 3 weeks for other agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited&#xD;
             to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal&#xD;
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, or psychiatric illness&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib is a PARP inhibitor with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with olaparib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption&#xD;
             of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study.&#xD;
