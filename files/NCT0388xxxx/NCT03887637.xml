      This is a multi-center, open-label clinical study. This study was aimed to assess the&#xD;
      real-world effectiveness and safety of treatment with listed DAAs in patients with CHC and&#xD;
      cirrhosis in Southern area of China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To access the effectiveness and safety of 12-week/24-week treatment with listed DAAs in&#xD;
      patients with CHC and cirrhosis in real-world clinical practice in Southern area of China.&#xD;
      The proportion of participants with SVR12(Undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after treatment&#xD;
      completion RNA:Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid) was evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to enroll 30 patients with CHC and cirrhosis in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CHC and cirrhosis who fulfills the indication of antiviral therapy will be&#xD;
      administered with DAAs treatment. After 12-week/2-week treatment, all the patients will be&#xD;
      followed up for 12 weeks.&#xD;
