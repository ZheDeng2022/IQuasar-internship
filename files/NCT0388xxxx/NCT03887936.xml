    <textblock>
      Low testosterone and diabetes mellitus are each associated with increased risk for fractures.&#xD;
      Men with diabetes mellitus are commonly found to have low testosterone as well. Testosterone&#xD;
      has been shown to improve the bone health of patients with low testosterone but has not been&#xD;
      tested in patients who also have diabetes mellitus in addition to low testosterone. To date,&#xD;
      there is no treatment that is specifically recommended for bone disease among patients with&#xD;
      diabetes. This study will evaluate the effect of testosterone on the bone health of male&#xD;
      Veterans who have both diabetes and low testosterone, both of which are highly prevalent in&#xD;
      this subset of the population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An existing mutual influence between testosterone (T) and glucose metabolism has been&#xD;
      suggested by studies showing that men with low T have impaired glucose tolerance, while a&#xD;
      significant number of men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and obesity have low T. Thus,&#xD;
      it is not surprising that as much as 64% of men with T2D were found to have low T.&#xD;
      Hypogonadism and diabetes mellitus (DM) each is associated with increased risk for fractures.&#xD;
      While hypogonadism is associated with increased bone turnover and bone loss. DM is associated&#xD;
      with low bone turnover and normal or high bone mineral density (BMD) but paradoxically a high&#xD;
      risk for fractures. The preliminary data showed that compared to non-diabetic hypogonadal&#xD;
      men, men with both conditions have suppressed bone turnover, higher volumetric BMD (vBMD) and&#xD;
      smaller bone size. As the effect of T on the male skeleton is mainly mediated by its&#xD;
      conversion to estradiol (E2) by the enzyme aromatase, the possibility of further suppression&#xD;
      of bone turnover with T therapy in these patients would be a concern. However, the&#xD;
      investigators' initial data also showed that T therapy in men with both conditions resulted&#xD;
      in increased in markers of bone turnover and bone size compared to the decrease in bone&#xD;
      turnover and decrease in bone size in men with hypogonadism only, suggesting activation in&#xD;
      bone remodeling and improvement in bone geometry in the former. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators also found a trend for increase in bone strength (by finite element analysis or&#xD;
      FEA) in the limited number of men with both low T and T2D randomized to T compared to&#xD;
      placebo. These findings only suggest but do not prove with certainty that T therapy would be&#xD;
      beneficial to men with both low T and T2D. The central hypothesis of this study is that T&#xD;
      therapy will result in improvement in bone quality in patients who have both hypogonadism and&#xD;
      T2D. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to determine the effect of T therapy on&#xD;
      bone strength as assessed by finite element analysis ( FEA) using high-resolution peripheral&#xD;
      quantitative computer tomography (HR-pQCT), 2) to determine the effect of T therapy on&#xD;
      markers of bone turnover, and 3) an exploratory aim, to evaluate the mechanism for&#xD;
      improvement in bone quality from T therapy. The investigators hypothesize that because T&#xD;
      stimulates osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation, the ensuing increase in osteoblast&#xD;
      number will lead to an enhanced cross-talk between osteoblast and osteoclast resulting in&#xD;
      activation of bone remodeling and replacement of old with new bone, hence, improvement in&#xD;
      bone quality. In this study the investigators will enroll 166 men with T2D and hypogonadism&#xD;
      and randomize them to either testosterone gel 1.62% or placebo for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following main outcomes will be evaluated: aim# 1) change in the primary endpoint which&#xD;
      is FEA, by HRpQCT, #2) changes in C-telopeptide (CTX) a marker of bone resorption, and aim&#xD;
      #3) changes in circulating osteoblast progenitor (COP). The investigators anticipate an&#xD;
      increase in FEA at the tibia and radius suggesting improvement in bone strength, increase CTX&#xD;
      and increase in circulating osteoblast progenitors. The investigators further anticipate an&#xD;
      increase in other markers of bone turnover (both bone formation and resorption) and&#xD;
      osteoclast precursors in men with hypogonadism and T2D randomized to T compared to placebo.&#xD;
      Given the suppressed bone turnover at baseline in men with low T and T2D, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the beneficial effect of T is its effect in activating bone remodeling&#xD;
      ultimately resulting in improvement in bone quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will provide information on the utility of T not only in improving&#xD;
      quality of life but also in improving bone quality in hypogonadal men with T2D. Given the&#xD;
      relationship between glucose metabolism and testosterone production, and the increasing&#xD;
      number of male patients diagnosed with both hypogonadism and T2D, this study will benefit not&#xD;
      only the significant number of male Veterans who have both conditions but also men in&#xD;
      general.&#xD;

    <measure>Finite element analysis of bone to measure bone strength</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The FEA (or FEA) is a surrogate measure of strength using computational biomechanical principles and integrate bone morphology and bone mass to calculate bone strength under various loading conditions normally seen in daily living activities. In addition, the ratio of load to strength can be calculated by using patient information (i.e. weight and height) and FEA derived bone strength to mechanistically simulate bone failure and thus, whether fracture is likely during a given activity. Using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computer tomography we will compute for FEA, using finite element analysis software with images generated using Image Processing Language to estimate the biomechanical properties of the bone. Each bone voxel will be converted to hexahedral finite elements with linear-elastic and isotropic material behavior. The FEA model will be subject to uniaxial compression and stiffness and failure load will be estimated. FEA will be assessed at months 0, 6 and 12.</description>

    <measure>Markers of bone turnover to measure bone metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Two markers of bone resorption, serum C-telopeptide (CTX) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) and 2 markers of bone formation osteocalcin (OCN) and N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) will be evaluated. These markers will be obtained at months 0, 6, and 12. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay will be used to measure serum CTX (serum crosslaps, Osteometer, Hawthorne, CA), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) (EIA) (Microvue Bonehealth, Quidel Corporation, Biosource); and serum osteocalcin (ALPCO, Salem, NH). Serum P1NP will be measured by competitive radioimmunoassay (UniqTM P1NP RIA, Immunodiagnostic Systems, Scottsdale, AZ). Coefficients of variations for these assays are &lt;10%.</description>
