    <textblock>
      The main objective of Trial Parts 1 and 2 is to investigate the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      two tablet strengths (low dose and high dose) of the intended Commercial Formulation of BI&#xD;
      730357 (Test, T) versus with the corresponding tablet strengths of Trial Formulation 1&#xD;
      (Reference, R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of Trial Part 3 is to investigate the relative bioavailability of two iCF&#xD;
      side batches of BI 730357 with coarse milled Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)(Test&#xD;
      coarse milled, Tc) and unmilled API (Test unmilled, Tu), respectively, versus the final iCF&#xD;
      batch of BI 730357 with regularly milled API (Reference, R).&#xD;
