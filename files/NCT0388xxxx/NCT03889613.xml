      The main aim of the study is to evaluate the lielihood of panenteric mucosal healing in&#xD;
      Crohn's disease patients treated with vedolizumab The study will include patients with active&#xD;
      Crohn's disease who are starting treatment with vedolizumab. The patients will undergo&#xD;
      evaluation with panenteric capsule endoscopy, intestinal ultrasound and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers before treatment onset, at week 14 and week 52&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mucosal healing has been widely accepted as the ultimate therapeutic goal in treatment of IBD&#xD;
      patients and is associated with improved short and long-term outcomes in both ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis and Crohn's disease (CD). However, the vast majority of the available clinical data&#xD;
      pertains to colonic mucosal healing. In CD, the small bowel is involved in at least 75% of&#xD;
      the patients, frequently in locations that are not accessible to ileocolonoscopy Active small&#xD;
      bowel disease can be detected in at least 50% of CD patients in clinical remission[3].&#xD;
      Moreover, colonic and small bowel mucosal healing do not parallel each other, and it is quite&#xD;
      common to detect inflammation in one segment while the other demonstrates endoscopically&#xD;
      active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) is the prime modality for evaluation of the entire small&#xD;
      bowel[5]. It provides a safe and accurate way to screen and evaluate the entire small bowel,&#xD;
      using a clinically validated endoscopic score such as the Lewis score (LS). Several studies&#xD;
      evaluated the use of SBCE in monitoring mucosal healing in Crohn's disease, in both active&#xD;
      and quiescent disease. The safety profile of SBCE in CD is excellent, especially after&#xD;
      verification of small bowel patency using a patency capsule (PC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, prospective data pertaining to the efficacy of biologics in induction of small bowel&#xD;
      mucosal healing is very limited. The only prospective study to date was relatively small (36&#xD;
      patients) and demonstrated a significant improvement in mucosal inflammation and achievement&#xD;
      of mucosal healing in patients that received Adalimumab and were evaluated with SBCE at week&#xD;
      0, 12 and 52 The rate of mucosal healing increased significantly from week 12 to 54.. No such&#xD;
      data exists for other biologics. Recently, a combined pan-enteric capsule (PillCam Crohn's&#xD;
      capsule) was developed by Medtronic. The capsule is based on an existing PillCam Colon 2 with&#xD;
      a modified reading software. This capsule enables evaluation of mucosal inflammation and&#xD;
      healing in the entire digestive tract in a single safe and non-invasive procedure. The new&#xD;
      software of Rapid 9 includes a new method of describing the inflammatory burden on each of&#xD;
      the 3 tertiles of the small bowel and two of the colon as well as the &quot;old&quot; Lewis score. In a&#xD;
      feasibility 5 center prospective trial the capsule exited the colon while photographing in&#xD;
      83% of patients and reached the recto-sigma in 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is an accurate, safe and cheap modality for bedside evaluation of&#xD;
      the small bowel. It was evaluated for both diagnosis and monitoring of intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation in CD, and can be also utilized to assess the response to treatment. Recently, a&#xD;
      quantitative score (Limberg index (LI)) for quantification of small bowel inflammation on IUS&#xD;
      was validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to assess the utility of the Pillcam Crohn's capsule in assessment of&#xD;
      panenteric mucosal healing in CD patients treated with vedolizumab Study interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (before vedolizumab is started):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will perform patency capsule (PC) and give fecal sample for FC and microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If PC is safely excreted within 30 hours and FC &gt; 100 mg/kg, the patient will undergo&#xD;
           SBC and will be enrolled if LS ≥ 220 or CDEIS&gt;5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn for measurement of CRP levels and complete blood count (CBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IUS will be performed. Second visit and third visit(week 14 and 52): will include&#xD;
           clinical evaluation, CBC, CRP, FCP, microbiome, SBC and IUS.&#xD;
