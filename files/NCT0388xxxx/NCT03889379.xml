      The aim of this pilot study is to determine the effects of albuterol on the composition of&#xD;
      immune cells in the bloodstream for possible future use in patients with neuroblastoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is a cancer that typically affects the nerves of children. Sometimes the&#xD;
      treatment required for neuroblastoma is an autologous stem cell transplant, where patients&#xD;
      who are experiencing neuroblastoma will undergo an expansion of their blood system and&#xD;
      collect their peripheral blood to later infuse back into them after chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
      radiation. However, up to 14% of individuals experience complications with this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that certain drugs that cause similar effects on the body to that of acute&#xD;
      exercise can elicit a more favorable donation. However, these drugs are very costly.&#xD;
      Albuterol, on the other hand, is a regularly used drug that may have a similar effect on the&#xD;
      body as adrenaline and is used to treat individuals who are experiencing respiratory airway&#xD;
      distress. The benefit of albuterol is that it can be administered through inhalation, further&#xD;
      reducing patient burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to determine the effects of albuterol on the composition of&#xD;
      immune cells in the bloodstream. Five healthy volunteers (age 21-44 years) will be recruited&#xD;
      to participate in this study. Each participant will donate a 6ml blood sample before and&#xD;
      during a 20-minute continuous albuterol nebulization through an IV catheter. During the last&#xD;
      10 minutes of the nebulization, participants will submit to another 6mL blood draw.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will collect a 6mL blood sample into EDTA anti-coagulant tubes before and during the last five minutes of an albuterol nebulization to assess the quantification in both absolute number and proportion of NK cells (CD3-/CD56+) using a MACSQuant flow cytometer and subsequent analysis on FlowLogic Software (v7.2.1). The last five minutes of nebulization of blood sample will be directly compared to the pre nebulization blood sample in the same participants in the same research arm.</description>
