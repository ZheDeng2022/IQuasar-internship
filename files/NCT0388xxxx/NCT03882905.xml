  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the lipid-altering efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      ezetimibe when added to ongoing therapy with an 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A&#xD;
      (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) in participants with primary hypercholesterolemia,&#xD;
      multiple cardiovascular risk factors, or known coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD-equivalent&#xD;
      disease. The statin and dose in use by the participant at screening will be maintained at the&#xD;
      same dose for the 8-week treatment phase of the study. Following the treatment, there will be&#xD;
      a 6-week cholesterol reversibility phase to determine the rebound effect on cholesterol after&#xD;
      ezetimibe is discontinued, but the participant is still on their statin therapy. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the addition of ezetimibe 10 mg/day to ongoing statin monotherapy will&#xD;
      result in a further reduction in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) compared with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was amended to include an extension for participants who complete the base&#xD;
      study. The extension will evaluate the safety and tolerability of concomitant treatment of&#xD;
      simvastatin with ezetimibe10 mg/day over a 1-year period. All participants in the extension&#xD;
      will be converted from current statin to an equivalent dose of simvastatin for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants then will be randomly assigned to receive simvastatin coadministered with either&#xD;
      with Ezetimibe 10 mg daily or matching placebo for the reminder of study.&#xD;
