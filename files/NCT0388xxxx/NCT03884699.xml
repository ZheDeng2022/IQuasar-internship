  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Maxillary transverse deficiency, is waverless lefort I multiple pieces osteotomy using&#xD;
      virtually planned patient specific titanium implants feasible and does it provide accuracy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective case series study evaluating the postoperative outcomes and accuracy of&#xD;
      preoperatively planned positional changes together with virtually designed drilling and&#xD;
      fixation guides for the waferless positioning and fixation of the multiple pieces Le Fort I&#xD;
      of the maxilla using CAD-CAM designed patient-specific implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to develop and validate an orthognathic CAD/CAM patient specific&#xD;
      implant together with template that can guide both the osteotomy and the repositioning of the&#xD;
      maxilla during the correction of transverse maxillary deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the traditional model and the additional preparation for CAD/CAM surgical splints&#xD;
      including scanning dental casts, and recording and moving virtual dental casts, were not&#xD;
      required. The preoperative and laboratory procedures were simplified, and the intermediate&#xD;
      splint technique was eliminated, so the associated potential errors were avoided.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of planned waferless positioning of lefort&#xD;
      I multiple piece osteotomy in maxillary deficient patients using CAD-CAM patient-specific&#xD;
      implants together with virtually designed drilling and fixation guides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnostic procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All Patients will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria &amp;&#xD;
           Comprehensive clinical examination and understanding of patients' chief complains and&#xD;
           needs will be carried out Preoperative patient photographs (Frontal, Profile, 45°,&#xD;
           smile, and dental occlusion) Alginate Impressions† of upper &amp; lower jaws for acquiring&#xD;
           diagnostic dental casts Cone Beam Computed Topography (CBCT) for the patients §&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Planning procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-aided planning: All planning will be done using specialized Mimics software** Import&#xD;
      CBCT into virtual planning software. Segmentation: highlighting and selection of the bony&#xD;
      anatomy based on bone density (Hounsfield Units).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D reconstruction: virtual 3D model. CT scanning of the dental stone casts. Image fusion: to&#xD;
      combine the virtual casts onto the 3D bony model to obtain a composite artifact-free skull&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual planning: based on clinical evaluation and 3D cephalometric analysis. Virtual&#xD;
      osteotomies mimicking segmental Lefort I and a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Designing the virtual cutting guide. Virtual movement into the desired positions of the&#xD;
      segmented maxilla and mandible, based on: clinical evaluation, 3D cephalometric analysis and&#xD;
      the desired occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the optimal position of the maxilla is achieved, a patient specific implant will be&#xD;
      virtually designed to fix the segmented maxilla in its new position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fabrication of the cutting guide using additive manufacturing technique from polymer&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fabrication of PSI from titanium alloy using additive manufacturing technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Intra operative procedures The surgical procedures will be carried out by RT under the&#xD;
      supervisor of AH in the Oral &amp; Maxillofacial operating floor on the 8th floor of the faculty&#xD;
      of Oral &amp; Dental Medicine new building.Scrubbing and draping of the patient will be carried&#xD;
      out in a standard fashion according to Anon 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthesia (lidocaine 2%, 1/100000 adrenaline) will be injected intraorally along the&#xD;
      incision lines for hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access through a vestibular intraoral incision for maxilla &amp; Sagittal split incision for&#xD;
      mandible will carried out. Dissection and reflection to reach the bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral Sagittal Split mandibular osteotomies will carried out. The osteotomy guide 2 parts&#xD;
      will into fit the left and right side the anterior maxillary walls separately during the&#xD;
      operation for ease of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Le Fort I Maxillary osteotomies will carried out using the osteotomy guide. Complete&#xD;
      mobilization of maxillary segments. Reposition and fixation of the maxillary segments into&#xD;
      the planned position will be done by the Patient Specific Implant (PSI) using the drilling&#xD;
      site done by the osteotomy guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reposition and fixation of the mandibular segments using bicortical screws. The incisions&#xD;
      will be closed with continuous mattress absorbable sutures††. 4. Postoperative care &amp; Follow&#xD;
      up Post-operative treatment will start immediately postoperative (4 hours) Patients will&#xD;
      start antibiotics 4 hours after the last intraoperative dose (Amoxicillin / Clavulanic acid&#xD;
      625 mg every 8 hours) for 5 days Patients will start analgesics (NSAIDs every 6 hours) for 3&#xD;
      days Mouthwash (Chlorhexidine 0.12%) will be prescribed for 2 more weeks. The patients will&#xD;
      be scheduled for follow-up visits weekly for a month then on a monthly basis for 5 more&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 to 3 weeks postoperatively CBCT using same parameters will be ordered to calculate the&#xD;
      difference between surgical plan and actual outcome will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be referred back to the orthodontist to receive his postsurgical orthodontics.&#xD;
