        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject (or legally acceptable representative) must give written informed consent&#xD;
             (and assent for subjects ≥ 12 years or country specific age as appropriate). For&#xD;
             subjects less than 18 years of age, parent or guardian will provide informed consent&#xD;
             and the subject will provide witnessed verbal assent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects ≥ 5 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Urinary oxalate excretion of &gt; 1.0 mmol/1.73m2/day at Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documentation of diagnosis of PH I or PH II by any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Liver biopsy confirmation of deficient liver specific peroxisomal&#xD;
                  alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase, (AGT) or mislocalization of AGT from&#xD;
                  peroxisomes to mitochondria (PH I) or deficient glyoxylate&#xD;
                  reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GR/HPR) activity (PH II)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a known mutation in the causative&#xD;
                  genes for PH I and PH II&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Increased glycolate excretion for PH I or increased L-glycerate excretion for PH&#xD;
                  II&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects receiving pyridoxine must be receiving a stable dose for at least 3 months&#xD;
             prior to entry in to the study and must remain on the stable dose during the study.&#xD;
             Other (non-pyridoxine naïve) subjects (e.g. Pyridoxine non-responder: &lt;30% reduction&#xD;
             of the urine oxalate levels) not receiving pyridoxine at study entry must be willing&#xD;
             to refrain from initiating pyridoxine during study participation. Note: There will be&#xD;
             no pyridoxine-naïve subjects enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Renal function defined as an estimated GFR ≥ 50 ml/min normalized to 1.73m2 body&#xD;
             surface area&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant, lactating, or actively menstruating women and women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential who are not using adequate contraceptive precautions. Sexually active&#xD;
             females, unless surgically sterile or at least 2 years post-menopausal, must be using&#xD;
             a highly effective contraception (including oral, transdermal, injectable, or&#xD;
             implanted contraceptives, IUD, abstinence, use of a condom by the sexual partner, or&#xD;
             sterile sexual partner) for 30 days prior to the first dose of OxabactTM and must&#xD;
             agree to continue using such precautions during the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a&#xD;
             low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly,&#xD;
             such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine&#xD;
             contraceptive devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomised partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Positive serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in any study of an investigational product, biologic, device, or other&#xD;
             agent within 30 days prior to randomization or not willing to forego other forms of&#xD;
             investigational treatment during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.&#xD;

          5. Subjects who have undergone transplantation (solid organ or bone marrow).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Chronic gastrointestinal disease associated with enteric hyperoxaluria, e.g. history&#xD;
             of inflammatory bowel disease, colostomy. Note: For clarity, existence of Secondary&#xD;
             Hyperoxaluria (e.g. with cystic fibrosis, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, short&#xD;
             bowel syndrome and/or deficiency of intestinal oxalate-degrading bacteria is included&#xD;
             (as an exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Current systemic (oral, IM, IV) antibiotic use or received systemic antibiotics within&#xD;
             14 days of study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of chronic, recurrent infections requiring &gt;2 courses of antibiotics in the&#xD;
             past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of malignancy except for basal or squamous cell skin cancer that has been&#xD;
             excised.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Unable to collect 24-hour urine samples or follow other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects who cannot swallow a size 2 capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Presence of a medical condition that the Principal Investigator considers likely to&#xD;
             make the subject susceptible to adverse effect of study treatment or unable to follow&#xD;
             study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who require immune suppressive therapy (including prednisone of &gt; 10mg daily&#xD;
             for more than 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects from correctional facilities or asylums.&#xD;
