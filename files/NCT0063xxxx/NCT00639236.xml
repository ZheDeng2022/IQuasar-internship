    <textblock>
      The use of inhaled hypertonic saline has been extensively documented in asthma,&#xD;
      bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and COPD as method of bronchial challenge and sputum&#xD;
      induction, but studies that evaluated others endpoints are required. The objective of this&#xD;
      study was to analyse the effects of inhaling hypertonic saline compared with placebo with&#xD;
      respect to functional exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life. In a double-blind&#xD;
      randomised parallel placebo-controlled trial, conducted at the Clínicas Integradas of the&#xD;
      Evangelical Faculty of Paraná,sixty-eight patients (age 67 ± 6.5 years; FEV1 38.9 ± 16.2&#xD;
      predicted) were randomised to inhale 3% hypertonic saline (n=34) or placebo (n=34), combined&#xD;
      with a program of exercise, three times a week, for 8-weeks.&#xD;

      Background: The use of inhaled hypertonic saline has been extensively documented in asthma,&#xD;
      bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and COPD as method of bronchial challenge and sputum&#xD;
      induction, but studies that evaluated others endpoints are required. Objective: To analyse&#xD;
      the effects of inhaling hypertonic saline compared with placebo with respect to functional&#xD;
      exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life. Design and Setting: This was a double-blind&#xD;
      randomised parallel placebo-controlled trial, conducted at the Clínicas Integradas of the&#xD;
      Evangelical Faculty of Paraná. Methods: sixty-eight patients (age 67 ± 6.5 years; FEV1 38.9 ±&#xD;
      16.2 predicted) were randomised to inhale 3% hypertonic saline (n=34) or placebo (n=34),&#xD;
      combined with a program of exercise, three times a week, for 8-weeks. Results: After the&#xD;
      8-weeks the treatment period, both groups showed significant changes in functional exercise&#xD;
      capacity (p&lt;0,001), dyspnoea (p&lt;0,001) and quality of life. When compared both groups, there&#xD;
      was a significant improvement in placebo group in functional exercise capacity (p&lt;0,001).&#xD;
      Conclusion: the present study concluded that inhaling HS reduces the functional capacity,&#xD;
      compared to placebo and being associated with the appearance of coughs and bronchial spasms.&#xD;
