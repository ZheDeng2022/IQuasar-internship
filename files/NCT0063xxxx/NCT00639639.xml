      RATIONALE: Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer&#xD;
      cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving vaccine therapy&#xD;
      together with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in&#xD;
      treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme recovering from lymphopenia&#xD;
      caused by temozolomide.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility and safety of vaccination with cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
           pp65-lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP) mRNA-loaded dendritic cells (DCs)&#xD;
           during recovery from therapeutic temozolomide-induced lymphopenia with or without&#xD;
           autologous lymphocyte transfer (ALT) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma&#xD;
           multiforme and who are seropositive or seronegative for CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess humoral and cellular immune responses in these patients to CMV pp65-LAMP&#xD;
           mRNA-loaded dendritic cell (CMV-DC) vaccine and to compare the impact of ALT and CMV&#xD;
           seropositivity on these parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if vaccination with or without ALT extends total time to progression or&#xD;
           overall survival of these patients when compared to a recent historical cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the differential ability of indium In^111-labeled DCs to track to the inguinal&#xD;
           lymph nodes under different skin preparative conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the differential ability of ^111In-labeled DCs to track to lymph nodes on the&#xD;
           tumor-bearing and non-tumor-bearing side of the cervical lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize immunologic cell infiltrate in recurrent tumors and seek evidence of&#xD;
           antigen escape in recurrent or progressive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo leukapheresis no more than 4 weeks after surgical resection to obtain&#xD;
      peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) for human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-autologous lymphocyte&#xD;
      transfer (ALT) and CMV-dendritic cell (DC) generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 2-6 weeks after resection, patients undergo external beam radiotherapy (RT) once&#xD;
      daily, 5 days a week, for up to 7 weeks. Beginning on day 1 of RT, patients receive oral&#xD;
      temozolomide (TMZ) once daily for up to 49 days. Patients with progressive disease during RT,&#xD;
      dependence on steroids above physiologic levels, intolerance to TMZ, or failure to meet cell&#xD;
      release criteria for DCs or PBLs are removed from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning within 2-4 weeks after completion of concurrent RT and TMZ, patients resume oral&#xD;
      TMZ once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 6 courses* in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 19-23 of course 1,&#xD;
      patients also receive an intradermal immunization. Patients are stratified by CMV serology&#xD;
      status (positive vs negative) and are randomized to 1 of 2 vaccine treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients may receive additional TMZ treatment at the discretion of the patient and&#xD;
      their treating neuro-oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (DC vaccination plus ALT): Patients receive CMV-ALT IV over 45-90 minutes (course&#xD;
           1 only) and 2 x 10^7 CMV pp65-LAMP mRNA-loaded DC (CMV-DC) vaccine intradermally and&#xD;
           administered in equal portions to each inguinal region. Vaccination repeats every 1-3&#xD;
           weeks for up to 3 doses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (DC vaccination alone): Patients receive CMV-DC vaccine as in arm I. At&#xD;
           approximately 2-6 weeks after the third vaccination, all patients undergo a second&#xD;
           leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells for immunologic monitoring&#xD;
           and additional DCs for continued vaccinations. Patients may undergo an additional&#xD;
           leukapheresis if they achieve a positive immunological response to therapy or if they&#xD;
           require additional DCs to be generated due to a prolonged progression-free survival.&#xD;
           Leukapheresis may be performed monthly, but will likely be performed every 4 months&#xD;
           throughout the study to generate enough DCs to continue monthly vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional cohort (GM-CSF): Patients receive CMV-DC vaccine as in arm II, except that&#xD;
           they will also receive GM-CSF in each vaccine. Vaccines continue for a total of 10&#xD;
           unless tumor progression occurs. Patients in this cohort may be enrolled at any point&#xD;
           prior to completion of adjuvant TMZ provided they meet all other eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the fourth vaccination, patients in both arms and patients with disease progression&#xD;
      determined prior to the first scheduled vaccination are stratified according to side of&#xD;
      inguinal injection (left vs right) and vaccination skin site preparation (unpulsed DCs vs&#xD;
      tetanus toxoid). Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (unpulsed DCs): Within 6 to 24 hours prior to vaccination, patients undergo skin&#xD;
           site preparation with 1 x 10^6 unpulsed DCs at the vaccination site in one inguinal&#xD;
           region. Patients then receive indium In^111-labeled CMV-DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (tetanus toxoid): Within 6 to 24 hours prior to vaccination, patients undergo&#xD;
           vaccination skin site preparation in the opposite inguinal region with tetanus toxoid.&#xD;
           Patients then receive indium In^111-labeled CMV-DC as in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of progression, patients receive a final intradermal vaccination comprising&#xD;
      ^111In-labeled CMV-DCs at the base of the jaw bilaterally and to the inguinal region, as a&#xD;
      control. Gamma camera images are then taken at 24 and 48 hours after the vaccination to&#xD;
      compare DC migration in the groin to each side of the neck injection sites and to observe&#xD;
      migration from the neck injection sites to the deep and superficial cervical lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of TMZ therapy, patients continue receiving DC vaccinations in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression (except GM-CSF cohort - total of 10 vaccinations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for immunologic studies. Samples are&#xD;
      examined for functional CD4 and CD8 immune response of patients by cytokine fluorescent&#xD;
      cytometry; enumeration of pp65 antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by tetramer analysis;&#xD;
      antigen-induced T-cell proliferation; cytokine secretion and quantitative anti-pp65 antibody&#xD;
      concentration in the serum by ELISA; and CMV pp65 quantitation in genomic DNA by reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Patients may also undergo stereotactic biopsy or&#xD;
      tumor resection to confirm tumor progression histologically and to assess immunologic cell&#xD;
      infiltration and pp65 antigen escape at the tumor site by immunohistochemistry and polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed by the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy-Brain questionnaire at initial leukapheresis, at the first vaccination, after the&#xD;
      third vaccination at the time of post-vaccine leukapheresis, and then with every&#xD;
      even-numbered vaccination thereafter. A neuropsychological assessment is also conducted prior&#xD;
      to the first vaccine and then with every second vaccination thereafter in order to monitor&#xD;
      for any changes in neurocognitive or affective changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
