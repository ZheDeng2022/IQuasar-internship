    <textblock>
      The incidence of ileus after laparoscopic colectomy continues to pose complications for the&#xD;
      patient, staff, and the healthcare system. Postoperative ileus remains a source of morbidity&#xD;
      and a major determinant of length of stay after abdominal surgery. Clinicians have devised&#xD;
      strategies that minimize postoperative ileus. Gum chewing, an inexpensive intervention, is&#xD;
      theorized to activate the cephalic- vagal reflex and increase the production of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal hormones associated with bowel motility. Four studies examining gum chewing&#xD;
      as an intervention to prevent ileus were found. These relatively few studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated inconsistencies. Because of the small sample size of the four studies and the&#xD;
      inconsistencies of the results, there is not enough evidence to change practice. There are no&#xD;
      indications of risks associated with gum chewing as an adjunct therapy along with standard&#xD;
      postoperative interventions. The purpose of this prospective, randomized control study is to&#xD;
      examine if chewing gum in adult patients after elective laparoscopic colectomy decreases&#xD;
      ileus compared with standard post-operative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized by weeks admitted and the patients in the gum chewing group&#xD;
      (intervention group) will chew one stick of gum the first post-operative day, after the&#xD;
      nasogastric tube is removed or if they patient does not have a nasogastric tube, with the&#xD;
      head of bed elevated a minimum of 30 degrees for 30 minutes, three times a day at set&#xD;
      intervals: 0900, 1400, and 2100. The gum will be kept in the Accudose cabinet and distributed&#xD;
      by the medication nurse. The gum chewing regimen will continue until the first bowel&#xD;
      movement. All patients in the non-intervention group will receive standard preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics that will be collected include gender, age, current medical condition,&#xD;
      pre-operative medications, type of surgery, operative duration in minutes, anesthesia&#xD;
      duration in minutes, estimated operative blood loss, whether they had an epidural or a PCA,&#xD;
      date and time nasogastric tube was discontinued, length of stay, date of discharge,&#xD;
      complications, and whether or not they had an ileus. Patients (if appropriate) and nurses&#xD;
      will be instructed on how to complete the bedside bowel record to the nearest hour.&#xD;

      Postoperative ileus remains a source of morbidity and a major determinant of length of stay&#xD;
      after abdominal surgery. This unfortunate complication may certainly affect patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction with their postoperative course. The postoperative care of a laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy patient includes interventions that are evidence-based. Despite the evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions, the incidence of ileus after laparoscopic colectomy continues to pose&#xD;
      complications for the patient, staff, and the healthcare system. In the time period from&#xD;
      January 1, 2006 to November 30, 2006 there were a total of 172 laparoscopic colectomies at&#xD;
      St. Joseph's Hospital and 28 patients developed an ileus. Six percent of colectomy patients'&#xD;
      recovery was altered by a prolonged ileus. This is comparably and slightly less then the&#xD;
      National Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program's data for postoperative ileus&#xD;
      of 7.5 % (Longo et al. 2000). However, the length of stay for patients with an ileus was 8.4&#xD;
      days greater then non ileus patients, with a significant increased cost per ileus patient of&#xD;
      $15,422.86. Clinicians have devised strategies that minimize postoperative ileus. Adjunct&#xD;
      therapies such as motility agents, early postoperative feeding regimens, and physical therapy&#xD;
      have been tested in clinical trials, but are not routinely used because of their limited&#xD;
      clinical efficacy (Matros, et al. 2006). Gum chewing, an inexpensive intervention, is&#xD;
      theorized to activate the cephalic- vagal reflex, which is usually activated by food, and to&#xD;
      increase the production of gastrointestinal hormones associated with bowel motility (Asao, et&#xD;
      al, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four studies examining gum chewing as an intervention to prevent ileus were found. These&#xD;
      relatively few studies with a sample of postoperative abdominal surgical patients have&#xD;
      demonstrated inconsistencies. Two studies found that the chewing gum group passed flatus and&#xD;
      had a bowel movement sooner than the control group. One of these studies found a decreased&#xD;
      length of stay. Two other randomized control studies found no statistical significance&#xD;
      between the gum chewing and control groups as far as post-operative ileus or length of stay.&#xD;
      Because of the small sample size of the four studies and the inconsistencies of the results,&#xD;
      there is not enough evidence to change practice. The inexpensive method of gum chewing may be&#xD;
      useful to decrease ileus in post-operative colectomy patients, which will decrease costs and&#xD;
      length of stay. It could also decrease pain, emesis, and morbidity for patients. There are no&#xD;
      indications of risks associated with gum chewing as an adjunct therapy along with standard&#xD;
      postoperative interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: In adult elective laparoscopic colectomy patients does chewing gum&#xD;
      decrease ileus compared with standard post-operative care? STUDY DESIGN: A prospective,&#xD;
      randomized control design&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT SELECTION: (Include inclusion/exclusion criteria) All participants will be recruited&#xD;
      at St. Joseph's Hospital. The sample will consist of all patients who are 18 years of age and&#xD;
      older and are identified as adults on admission, and/or pre-admission for elective&#xD;
      laparoscopic colectomy surgery. Inclusion criteria consist of all patients admitted to one&#xD;
      surgical unit (3-1) from November 1, 2007 to August 1, 2008 with a non- emergent laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy. Exclusion criteria consist of all patients with a history of metastatic disease,&#xD;
      history of inflammatory bowel disease, abdominal radiation treatment, mint allergy (the gum&#xD;
      is mint flavored), dentures, nasogastric tube drainage beyond the first postoperative&#xD;
      morning, more then one bowel anastomosis during this surgery, conversion to pen colectomy, or&#xD;
      admission to an ICI post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS, DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION: (Include the factors considered in&#xD;
      determining an appropriate sample size) Data will be analyzed statistically. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to describe the entire sample, appropriate to the level of&#xD;
      measurement of each. Independent t-tests for variables measured at ordinal or interval/ratio&#xD;
      levels and chi-square for dichotomous variables will be used to compare the two groups on all&#xD;
      demographic variables, hours since first flatus, and first bowel movement Analysis of&#xD;
      co-variance may be used to statistically control for medical conditions found in the sample&#xD;
      that were not excluded but could affect the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES: (Describe all study methods chronologically. Distinguish clearly between&#xD;
      treatment-related (standard care) and study-related procedures the subject will undergo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: If the proposal includes genetic testing, some information about the genetic testing&#xD;
      must be included. Please provide the following: 1. The type of study planned, 2. What genes&#xD;
      are the investigators looking for, if known, 3. Why the genetic testing is being done (i.e.,&#xD;
      how it is relevant to the overall protocol), and 4. Where the work will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval from St Joseph's IRB and SUNY Upstate's IRB, elective laparoscopic colectomy&#xD;
      patients will be identified by the participating surgeons. At the time of preoperative&#xD;
      instructions, a letter will be given or sent to the identified patient explaining the study&#xD;
      (Appendix C). The day of pre-admission testing, the patient will be contacted by a study team&#xD;
      member to review the study and will be asked to participate. If they agree, consent will be&#xD;
      signed and the subjects will be assigned a number to ensure confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 50 will be randomized in block format, utilizing the weeks by number. The&#xD;
      38 weeks will be placed in a box; the first 19 weeks selected will be the gum chewing group,&#xD;
      the second 19 weeks selected will be the non chewing group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant in the study will be educated to report to the nurse or self report on the&#xD;
      bed side bowel report sheet the exact time to the hour that flatus is passed and the first&#xD;
      bowel movement. The nursing staff on 3-1 will be instructed and monitored about documentation&#xD;
      of gum chewing, first flatus to the nearest hour, and first bowel movement to the nearest&#xD;
      hour. The data collection form will be completed. The length of the patients stay will be&#xD;
      generated on discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the gum chewing group (intervention group) will chew one stick of gum the&#xD;
      first post-operative day, after the nasogastric tube is removed or if they patient does not&#xD;
      have a nasogastric tube, with the head of bed elevated a minimum of 30 degrees for 30&#xD;
      minutes, three times a day at set intervals: 0900, 1400, and 2100. Sugar-free gum was used in&#xD;
      all previous studies. Therefore, sugar free gum (Orbit Spearmint Sugarless Gum) will be used&#xD;
      in this study. The gum will be kept in the Accudose cabinet and distributed by the medication&#xD;
      nurse. The gum chewing regimen will continue until the first bowel movement. All patients in&#xD;
      the non-intervention group will receive the standard preoperative and postoperative regimens.&#xD;
      Patient demographics that will be collected include gender, age, current medical condition,&#xD;
      pre-operative medications, type of surgery, operative duration in minutes, time left OR,&#xD;
      anesthesia duration in minutes, estimated operative blood loss, whether the patient had an&#xD;
      epidural or a PCA, date and time nasogastric tube was discontinued, length of stay, date of&#xD;
      discharge, complications, and post-operative ileus. Patients and nurses will be instructed on&#xD;
      how to complete the bedside bowel record to the nearest hour.&#xD;
