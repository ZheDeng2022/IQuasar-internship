      A Finnish Breast Cancer Group Study (BREX 01-2004). A multicenter phase III open randomised&#xD;
      trial of the efficacy of exercise in the prevention of long-term adverse effects of adjuvant&#xD;
      treatments and breast cancer recurrences in women with primary breast cancer. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to investigate whether regular exercise training could reduce the long-term side&#xD;
      effects of adjuvant treatments of primary breast cancer and improve quality of life and well&#xD;
      being.&#xD;

      A multicenter phase III open randomised trial of the efficacy of exercise in the prevention&#xD;
      of long-term adverse effects of adjuvant treatments and breast cancer recurrences in women&#xD;
      with primary breast cancer. The aim of the study is to investigate whether regular exercise&#xD;
      training could reduce the long-term side effects of adjuvant treatments of primary breast&#xD;
      cancer and improve quality of life and well being. Large controlled prospective studies are&#xD;
      needed to confirm the preliminary findings of exercises benefits in cancer patients, and to&#xD;
      investigate the type, the frequency, intensity and tolerability of exercise training in&#xD;
      cancer patients, before any clinical recommendations can be given. Prevention of&#xD;
      osteoporosis, improvement of weight control, and muscular and cardiovascular fitness is been&#xD;
      waited. The second aim of the study is to investigate, whether regular exercise training&#xD;
      reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence, prevents other diseases and reduce all-cause&#xD;
      mortality and is cost effective in women with primary breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Design: supervised training is organised for the exercise group once a week in groups of 10 to 15 subjects. The training is guided by an experienced physical therapist.Content: The supervised training of the exercise group consists of two different classes alternating at four week periods; step aerobics class and circuit training class. The 60-minute aerobics and circuit training classes also include warming-up and cooling-down periods both lasting 10-15 minutes.</description>
