      Purpose: To determine whether a fluocinolone acetonide sustained drug delivery implant is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of retinal vein occlusion that has caused persistent macular edema&#xD;
      and decreased visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A fluocinolone acetonide sustained drug delivery implant will be a safe and&#xD;
      effective method to treat patients with macular edema and decreased vision from retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is limited treatment for macular edema and vision loss due to retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion. Case reports have shown some benefit of intravitreal steroid injections in&#xD;
      improving vision and reducing macular edema in eyes with retinal vein occlusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a sustained drug release steroid implant has been investigated and FDA approved to&#xD;
      treat macular edema in patients with non-infectious uveitis, eye inflammation. This implant&#xD;
      is placed through an incision in the eye wall and is designed to deliver a steroid,&#xD;
      fluocinolone acetonide, for upto three years. In animal studies there was no detectable&#xD;
      steroid seen in the blood stream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial will recruit individuals who have had a retinal vein occlusion in at least&#xD;
      one eye. If the macular edema and vision improves with an initial intravitreal injection, the&#xD;
      eye will be considered to receive the sustained drug release device. The dosage of&#xD;
      fluocinolone acetonide used is 0.59 mg.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are eligible to receive an implant if they met all the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of retinal vein occlusion that had caused macular edema, based on clinical&#xD;
             evaluation and demonstrated on fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and&#xD;
             optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Macular edema at least one disc area in size that involved the fovea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and non-pregnant females at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraocular Pressure (IOP) controlled at &lt; 21 mmHg with no more than one topical&#xD;
             ocular antihypertensive agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to comply with treatment and follow up process and to&#xD;
             understand and sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initially, patients with vein occlusion were not required to have previous therapy.&#xD;
             However, the protocol was subsequently modified to require an intravitreal injection&#xD;
             of triamcinolone acetonide &gt; 12 weeks prior to study entry, with an initial decrease&#xD;
             in macular edema and improvement in visual acuity and subsequent decline in visual&#xD;
             acuity accompanied by increased macular edema. This modification was added to avoid&#xD;
             enrolling patients who might have had a long-lasting response to a single intravitreal&#xD;
             triamcinolone acetonide injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are excluded if they have an allergy to fluocinolone acetonide or any&#xD;
             component of the delivery system, a peripheral retinal detachment in the area of&#xD;
             implantation, or media opacity precluding evaluation of study eye status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patents with disciform scars of the fovea or atrophic changes of the macula that in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion would preclude benefit from treatment are excluded from the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who were pregnant or lactating or not taking precautions to avoid&#xD;
             pregnancy.&#xD;
