      This research is being done to find out if the Atkins Diet can be used safely and effectively&#xD;
      to reduce seizures in children who have Sturge Weber syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ketogenic diet is a proven therapy for epilepsy, but can be difficult to use in children.&#xD;
      The Atkins Diet is a high fat, high protein, low carbohydrate diet introduced in the 1970s to&#xD;
      help with weight loss. It is different from the ketogenic diet in four major ways: no calorie&#xD;
      restriction, no fluid restriction, no protein restriction, and is easy to start outside the&#xD;
      hospital. People on the Atkins Diet become ketotic (produce high levels of ketones, a certain&#xD;
      substance in the body), like patients on the ketogenic diet, and the investigators believe&#xD;
      this may lead to seizure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 2-18 with Sturge Weber syndrome and seizures at least monthly, who have used at&#xD;
      least two anti-seizure drugs may join. 5 children in total will be enrolled.&#xD;

      If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the diet is started:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will ask you to keep track of your child's seizures daily for 2 weeks before starting&#xD;
           the Atkins diet and provide us with a 3-day food record as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine work will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will give you a free copy of a carbohydrate-counting guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to fill out a 3-day food record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the diet:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give your child a daily calcium supplement and multivitamin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Keep a daily seizure log.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check urine for ketones (to make sure the diet is working) and specific gravity (to make&#xD;
           sure your child is well hydrated) twice a week and when you come to clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will ask you to weigh your child at home every week, and we will weigh him or her&#xD;
           when you come into clinic too.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not fluid restrict your child; please give plenty of carbohydrate-free fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will give 20 grams per day of carbohydrates. We will give you instructions on how to&#xD;
           measure daily intake of carbohydrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will not change medications for the first three months. Do not change your child's&#xD;
           seizure medicines without checking with our doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the first three months, we ask you to avoid store-bought low-carbohydrate products&#xD;
           (as they can have more carbohydrates than advertised).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being on the diet for one month, Dr. Kossoff will contact you by telephone to discuss&#xD;
      how your child is doing. You can also speak with one of our dietitians. We will discuss the&#xD;
      3-day food record with you&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to come to the clinic (outpatient center, 5th floor) for two follow-up&#xD;
      visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. after being on the diet for 3 months and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. after being on the diet for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these visits you will meet with one of our doctors and a dietitian. We will review&#xD;
      your child's seizure control and health. We may obtain blood (about 2 teaspoons). We will&#xD;
      check your child's urine for ketones and specific gravity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the diet is helping beyond 6 months, we will help your child continue on the diet with&#xD;
      clinic visits and labs as necessary, at a carbohydrate amount that is most helpful.&#xD;
