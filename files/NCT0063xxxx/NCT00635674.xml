  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increased risk of atherosclerotic morbidity and mortality in patients with obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to arterial hypertension, insulin resistance, systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, and oxidative stress in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to determine the effects of 8-weeks therapy with continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) on glucose and lipid profile, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and the global&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with severe OSA and metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at increased risk of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.OSA is associated with the development and/or worsening of arterial&#xD;
      hypertension, a traditional risk factor of atherosclerosis.Moreover, OSA has been linked to&#xD;
      novel factors related to atherogenesis - metabolic syndrome,systemic inflammation,6 and&#xD;
      oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have selectively examined the effects of continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) ventilation, the primary treatment for OSA, on the traditional and novel risk factors&#xD;
      of atherosclerosis. A recent metaanalysis of 16 randomized trials indicated that CPAP&#xD;
      decreases blood pressure in patients with OSA.9 Furthermore, reductions in serum total&#xD;
      cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-6 and IL-8 were demonstrated after effective CPAP therapy.In addition, CPAP was shown to&#xD;
      reduce systemic oxidative stress.Improvements in insulin sensitivity have been reported in&#xD;
      some,but not in all studies. Importantly, substantial evidence links the effects of CPAP to&#xD;
      compliance with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most observational studies examined the effects of CPAP across a broad-range of OSA severity,&#xD;
      and have included patients with and without the metabolic syndrome. Up to now, no study&#xD;
      analyzed the effects of CPAP on glucose and lipid metabolism, systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, and the global cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk within the same cohort of&#xD;
      subjects with severe OSA and concurrent metabolic syndrome. Importantly, the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome exacerbates CVD risk over and above that attributable to OSA alone. Therefore,&#xD;
      reduction of CVD risk in patients with OSA and concurrent metabolic syndrome is of paramount&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the present study was to determine, in patients with severe OSA and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome compliant to CPAP, the effects of 8-weeks therapy on the glucose and lipid&#xD;
      profile, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and on the global CVD risk. The secondary&#xD;
      goal was to analyze factors related to compliance with CPAP.&#xD;
