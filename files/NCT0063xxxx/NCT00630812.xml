  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of 26 weeks treatment with&#xD;
      inhaled mannitol in subjects with cystic fibrosis. Previous studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      improvements in lung function, mucociliary clearance, changes in physical properties of&#xD;
      mucus, 24 hour sputum weight and quality of life. The results of this study are to further&#xD;
      investigate and confirm these findings in addition to examine the effect on antibiotic use&#xD;
      and chest infections. It is hypothesised that inhaled mannitol will have beneficial effects&#xD;
      compared to a control treatment. An open label phase of 26 weeks duration will follow the&#xD;
      blinded 26 week phase. During the open label phase all subjects will receive active&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>Patients underwent a mannitol tolerance test (MTT) to gauge tolerance to a test dose of mannitol. 318 patients were then randomised - only 305 of the randomised patients went on to receive a dose of study medication.
