    <textblock>
      Assessment of segmental spine motion has been and continues to be, a difficult clinical&#xD;
      problem. Errors of up to 10 degrees for simple measurements of flexion, extension and side&#xD;
      bending have been recorded using conventional radiographs (xrays.) These errors are usually&#xD;
      associated with the inability to acquire three-dimensional positions and inaccurate reference&#xD;
      points. It has, therefore, been extremely difficult to measure small changes in vertebral&#xD;
      alignment, which may prove to be an early, clinically significant, indicator of potential&#xD;
      problems. Radiostereometric Analysis, or RSA, is an accurate in vivo measurement technique&#xD;
      using two simultaneous radiographs. It provides researchers with three dimensional motion&#xD;
      analyses to look not only at routine flexion/extension, but also other rotational and&#xD;
      translational changes. The measurement accuracy offered by this technique far exceeds the&#xD;
      manual techniques currently used. The purpose of this study is to assess the amount of motion&#xD;
      in the lumbar spine in patients with the AST Stabilimax BAR. The AST Stabilimax BAR is&#xD;
      designed to allow for motion in the spine while providing the necessary stability to the&#xD;
      spinal segment. The amount and degree of this motion is currently unknown clinically. By&#xD;
      using tantalum bead markers placed in the spine at the time of the surgery, RSA analysis can&#xD;
      determine the amount and degree of motion of the implanted construct. Two questions will be&#xD;
      examined with this data: 1) what is the amount of sagittal and coronal plane motion that&#xD;
      occurs in vivo with the AST Stabilimax BAR system? and 2) will this change over the 2 year&#xD;
      time frame for this study?&#xD;

      Radiostereometric Analysis, or RSA, is an accurate in vivo measurement technique using two&#xD;
      simultaneous radiographs. It provides researchers with three dimensional motion analyses to&#xD;
      look not only at routine flexion/extension, but also other rotational and translational&#xD;
      changes. The measurement accuracy offered by this technique far exceeds the manual techniques&#xD;
      currently used. Utilization of the RSA technology at the IHP and the United States is in its&#xD;
      infancy. The investigators have placed much effort over the past 2-3 years to put the&#xD;
      necessary dedicated resources and personnel in place. This has been a collaborative effort&#xD;
      between the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and the Imaging Core at IHP. Preliminary work on&#xD;
      the accuracy, reliability, and surgical planning for use of RSA has been completed and&#xD;
      presented at national conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the amount of motion in the lumbar spine in patients&#xD;
      with the AST Stabilimax BAR. The AST Stabilimax BAR is designed to allow for motion in the&#xD;
      spine while providing the necessary stability to the spinal segment. The amount and degree of&#xD;
      this motion is currently unknown clinically, but has been biomechanically tested in vitro. By&#xD;
      using tantalum bead markers placed in the spine at the time of the surgery, RSA analysis can&#xD;
      determine the amount and degree of motion the implant provides. Two questions will be&#xD;
      examined with this data: 1) what is the amount of sagittal and coronal plane motion that&#xD;
      occurs in vivo with the AST Stabilimax BAR system? and 2) will this change over the 2 year&#xD;
      time frame for this study?&#xD;

        This is a single-center, non-randomized study. 10 Subjects who are identified to receive&#xD;
        the AST Stabilimax BAR device will be approached to participate in this study. All subjects&#xD;
        will receive 10 RSA tantalum beads (5 in each vertebra) at the time of their lumbar&#xD;
        surgery. After surgery, subjects will have the biplanar xrays taken. The biplanar xrays&#xD;
        will be taken from 5 standing positions: neutral, flexion (bending forward), extension&#xD;
        (bending backwards), left side bending, and right side bending. RSA analysis will be&#xD;
        completed to determine the amount of motion on sagittal and coronal planes.&#xD;
