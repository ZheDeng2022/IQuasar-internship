      This is a prospective interventional study to test the hypothesis that just-in-time training&#xD;
      for pediatric airway management may improve patient safety and operational performance of&#xD;
      orotracheal intubation and decreases intubation associated events in pediatric residents in&#xD;
      the PICU. To test the hypothesis that high fidelity simulation may enhance the training&#xD;
      efficacy and patient safety in simulation settings.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate airway management is the most critical point in pediatric resuscitation and&#xD;
      pediatric critical care. It remains, however, a challenge for pediatric residents to learn&#xD;
      and retain this critical skill. Recent report from our PICU showed pediatric residents&#xD;
      participated only 28% of initial orotracheal intubation, and the rate of the first successful&#xD;
      endotracheal tube placement was only 38% of all orotracheal intubation attempt. Repetitive&#xD;
      poor-skilled intubation attempts may be associated with complication such as dental or&#xD;
      laryngeal contusion, and prolonged intubation attempt may be associated with hypoxia and&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability. In order to improve the operational performance in the efficacy&#xD;
      (first attempt success rate) and safety (minimizing the associated events which could&#xD;
      potentially lead to adverse events), a better training method is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that just-in-time training for pediatric airway management may improve&#xD;
      patient safety and operational performance of orotracheal intubation and decreases intubation&#xD;
      associated events in pediatric residents in the PICU. To test the hypothesis that high&#xD;
      fidelity simulation may enhance the training efficacy and patient safety in simulation&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective interventional study. During the eighteen months of study period, one&#xD;
      of two on-call pediatric residents from 7 south PICU (24 beds) will receive 20 minutes of&#xD;
      just-in-time pediatric airway management training. This training will occur before their&#xD;
      shift starts before the morning round. This training will cover direct laryngoscopy&#xD;
      technique, orotracheal intubation technique, confirmation of the tube placement and&#xD;
      recognition of associated events. This training will be done with or without high fidelity&#xD;
      simulation function. We will use SimBaby (Laerdal, Norway). The assignment will be&#xD;
      randomized. The clinical data of orotracheal intubation are collected through NEAR-4 KIDS&#xD;
      registry. Primary outcome is a change in a first attempt success rate by the residents in an&#xD;
      overtrained group (7 South PICU) compared to standard training group (7 East PICU). The&#xD;
      secondary outcome is the rate of resident participation in orotracheal intubation attempt,&#xD;
      the number of intubation attempt before successful intubation by residents and the number of&#xD;
      intubation associated events. The videotaped performance during the training is analyzed with&#xD;
      Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) and will be compared between high&#xD;
      fidelity simulation training group and low fidelity simulation training group. The evaluation&#xD;
      system developed by HFMEA will be validated by a performance of experienced and&#xD;
      non-experienced intubators. Furthermore, the real orotracheal intubation team performance in&#xD;
      both PICUs will be evaluated with scale by a research assistant. The demographic and training&#xD;
      data of participants of real PICU intubations will be collected. No patient identifiable&#xD;
      information will be collected. This data will also be kept in a password-protected research&#xD;
      computer.&#xD;
