      Intrarenal calcifications (nephrocalcinosis) is present in Dent's disease and likely&#xD;
      contribute to progression toward renal failure. In order to prevent this complication it is&#xD;
      usually proposed to treat affected patients during childhood with high doses of thiazides.&#xD;
      Indeed, this class of diuretics is used for years to treat hypertension, can lower urinary&#xD;
      calcium excretion. However the doses usually used are high, are known to be associated with&#xD;
      adverse events such as severe potassium depletion, decrease in blood pressure and&#xD;
      dehydration. The purpose of the study was to test whether lower dose of thiazides would be&#xD;
      better tolerated, with similar efficacy to lower urinary calcium excretion, as previously&#xD;
      demonstrated in other indication such as treatment of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment and clinical evaluation Eight subjects with genetically proven Dent's&#xD;
      disease were recruited through a French nationwide network for tubulopathies and were&#xD;
      enrolled between July 2003 and December 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients met at least three standard criteria for the disease including hypercalciuria,&#xD;
      low molecular weight proteinuria and one of the following disorders: nephrocalcinosis,&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis, renal failure, aminoaciduria, glucosuria, renal phosphate wasting, or&#xD;
      familial history of Dent's disease. The disease was confirmed in all patients by direct&#xD;
      sequencing of the CLCN5 gene according to Lloyd et al. (25) Patients presenting hyponatremia&#xD;
      (&lt; 135 mM), hypokalaemia (&lt; 3.3 mM), severe fanconi syndrome, or chronic renal failure (GFR&#xD;
      estimated with the Schwartz formula &lt; 30 mL.min-1.1.73m-2) were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was approved by the &quot;comité de protection des personnes&quot; (Paris, Hôtel Dieu) and&#xD;
      all subjects and/or their parents gave written informed consent for the participation in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium restriction test Because a renal loss of sodium was reported in the disease, the&#xD;
      pharmacological study was preceded by a sodium restriction test involving NaCl intake&#xD;
      equivalent to 0.3 mmol/kg BW) and an age-adjusted calcium intake of 1200-1500 mg/day, to&#xD;
      assess the tolerance to sodium depletion and its effect on calcium excretion. Sodium&#xD;
      restriction was stopped after 5 days or when 24h urinary sodium excretion matched theoretical&#xD;
      salt intake. Blood and urine samples were taken in the morning, two hours after a light&#xD;
      calcium-free breakfast and after a 30 minute rest in the supine position on the first and&#xD;
      last days of the low sodium diet determining electrolytes, plasma proteins, hematocrit, and&#xD;
      plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY After completion of the sodium restriction test, the seven remaining&#xD;
      patients entered a three-period, forced titration sequential open-label trial. They were&#xD;
      instructed to follow normal sodium, isocaloric diet, with an age-adjusted calcium intake of&#xD;
      1200 to 1500 mg/d. One patient had a tendency to hypokalaemia (3.3 mM), requiring potassium&#xD;
      chloride salt supplementation before entering the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a one month run-in phase, the patients received sequentially a low dose (6.25 mg/day),&#xD;
      an intermediate dose (12.5 mg/day), and a high dose (25 mg/day) of hydrochlorothiazide&#xD;
      (HCTZ), each dose being administered for a period of two months. Amiloride (5 mg/day) was&#xD;
      started at the beginning of the study, and continued throughout the sequential trial to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of HCTZ-induced hypokalaemia. For safety reasons, two patients did not&#xD;
      receive the last 25 mg dose of HCTZ because of a body weight (BW) &lt; 25 kg. The last HCTZ dose&#xD;
      was followed by a one month withdrawal period (phase E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical (blood pressure and BW), biological and hormonal evaluations were conducted at&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of each treatment period, between 9:00 and 10:00 hours, two hours&#xD;
      after a light calcium-free breakfast and a one hour-rest in a reclined position. At the end&#xD;
      of the baseline and washout periods and each treatment period, two successive 24-h urine&#xD;
      collections were obtained, and a morning spot urine sample was collected on the day of&#xD;
      investigation for measurements of urine electrolytes (Na, K, calcium) and creatinine.&#xD;
      Hematocrit, and electrolyte, creatinine, proteins, renin and aldosterone concentrations were&#xD;
      measured in blood samples. Additionally, Blood Pressure, Body Weight and biological tolerance&#xD;
      was assessed 15 days after each increase in the HCTZ dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical methods Methods for the determination of plasma sodium, potassium, creatinine,&#xD;
      magnesium, PTH, 25-OH vitamin D, renin, aldosterone and calcitriol levels have been described&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods The effects of sodium restriction and HCTZ on clinical and biological&#xD;
      markers were first evaluated by Friedman's tests. If a global time-effect was significant,&#xD;
      the change between baseline and the last measurement of the treatment period was tested by a&#xD;
      Wilcoxon's paired test. All data are expressed as median range [minimum; maximum], except&#xD;
      otherwise specified. Values of 24h-urine collection of each period used for analyses were&#xD;
      mean of the measurements made on the two consecutive daily collections. Values for a given&#xD;
      24-h collection were excluded from analysis if the creatinine excretion on that collection&#xD;
      varied by more than 15% or the sodium excretion varied by more than 25% from the mean of&#xD;
      values for other collections by that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses were carried out using SAS Statistical Software (Version 8.2, Cary, NC, USA) and&#xD;
      STATVIEW(SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC) and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
