      This study was designed to explore the changes brought about by gelatin encapsulated extract&#xD;
      of American Ginseng Root (LEAG) in breast cancer tumors and surrounding normal breast&#xD;
      epithelial cells. Various tumor biomarkers, as well as inflammatory mediators, will be&#xD;
      examined in tissue following LEAG treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) and its close relative American ginseng (Panax quinquefolium)&#xD;
      are perennial aromatic herbs that are widely used in Asian medicine. Ginseng root is used as&#xD;
      a tonic thought to increase the body's resistance to stress and fatigue, to increase&#xD;
      endurance under heavy physical activity, and to improve well-being in age-related&#xD;
      debilitation. Most of the ginseng consumed, even in Asian populations, is American ginseng,&#xD;
      and the majority of American ginseng is grown and processed in Wisconsin, with quality and&#xD;
      standardization overseen by the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin. Furthermore, in Asian medicine,&#xD;
      Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolium) are common&#xD;
      components in herbals used for cancer prevention and treatment. Indeed, retrospective studies&#xD;
      have shown that patients who consumed ginseng on a regular basis experienced cancers at a&#xD;
      reduced rate, however, breast cancer was not considered. Ginseng has been used medicinally&#xD;
      for over 2000 years and there are no substantiated serious adverse effects, and few, if any,&#xD;
      non-serious adverse effects. The World Health Organization lists ginseng as a traditional&#xD;
      medicine with very low toxicity. Clinical trials have also demonstrated an anti-hyperglycemic&#xD;
      action of American ginseng. These studies utilized capsules containing dried, ground&#xD;
      Ontario-grown P. qinquefolius L. root. The ground AG root preparation had an onset of action&#xD;
      of 40 minutes. They found no significant increase in anti-hyperglycemic action after 40&#xD;
      minutes and no significant increase in anti-hyperglycemic action using 1 gram versus 3 gram&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEAG is a standardized preparation of lyophilized water-extract of American ginseng root in&#xD;
      250-mg gelatin capsules. The ginseng was purchased through the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin and&#xD;
      the lyophilized extract has been certified for percentage of each and total ginsenoside&#xD;
      content and screened for safe levels of minerals, metals, and pesticides by ConsumerLab.com,&#xD;
      a leading testing service company of dietary supplements.&#xD;
