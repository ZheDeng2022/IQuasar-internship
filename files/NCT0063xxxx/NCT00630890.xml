  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of giving external beam radiation, followed&#xD;
      by a Cyberknife radiosurgery boost at different dose levels, together with a chemotherapy&#xD;
      drug called capecitabine. The dose of Cyberknife radiosurgery boost will be made higher&#xD;
      slowly in this protocol. Patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor), which is&#xD;
      not amenable for surgical removal, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that highly focused high dose radiation delivered using Cyberknife in&#xD;
      conjunction with traditional radiation and chemotherapy can improve outcome in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study which will escalate the dose of Cyberknife radiosurgery boost&#xD;
      after external beam radiation of 45 Gy with concurrent capecitabine. The three dose levels&#xD;
      are 4 Gy x5, 5 Gy x5 and 6 Gy x 5, with 3 patients at each dose level. Dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) is defined as acute grade 3 liver or intestinal toxicity or any acute grade 4 toxicity.&#xD;
      If one patient experienced a DLT at a particular dose level, the cohort should be expanded to&#xD;
      6 patients. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level below that which&#xD;
      results in DLT in 2 or more of the 6 patients in each cohort. At least 5 patients should be&#xD;
      enrolled in the cohort of 6 Gy x 5 even if none of the first 3 experienced DLT, as a means of&#xD;
      added verification of dose tolerance, at this upper limit of dose for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population includes any patients who have unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
      without any prior history of radiation. We anticipate accruing 1 patient every 2 months;&#xD;
      therefore, we estimate that it will require approximately 22 months to accrue 11 patients if&#xD;
      no DLT is experienced by any patients requiring expansion of the cohorts.&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients should have evaluable disease on one or more imaging modalities (CT scan,&#xD;
             MRI, and/or PET) since this will be necessary for radiation treatment planning.&#xD;
             However, because the borders of these tumors are sometimes difficult to define&#xD;
             precisely, measurable disease is not required (see Section 9.1 for definitions of&#xD;
             evaluable and measurable disease).&#xD;

             control during treatment and for six months after receiving their last dose of&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior chemotherapy&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not candidates for gold marker seeds placement due to position of the&#xD;
             tumor or co-existing medical condition.&#xD;
