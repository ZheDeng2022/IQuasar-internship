  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) determine the effects of the herbal formula Sho-saiko-to&#xD;
      (SST) compared to placebo in treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) in persons who have not&#xD;
      responded to the current conventional therapy (peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) or who have&#xD;
      relapsed or in those for whom conventional therapy is contraindicated; (2) determine the&#xD;
      influence that SST will have on participant reports of depression/sadness, fear and&#xD;
      uncertainty related to the HCV disease progression, and renewal of hope in these individuals;&#xD;
      and (3) collect preliminary data needed to examine feasibility, patient acceptance, and any&#xD;
      potential limitations of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) suffer from multiple symptoms caused by both&#xD;
      the disease and the current conventional treatment (peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) if they&#xD;
      can tolerate the treatment or have no contraindications to taking it. Most HCV-infected&#xD;
      individuals eventually develop chronic liver disease that may progress to complications such&#xD;
      as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, and cirrhosis. What is not known is&#xD;
      whether or not modulation of the HCV disease using the standardized herbal formulation&#xD;
      Sho-saiko-to (SST), 3 capsules containing 700 mg of the SST herbal extract/capsule and 28 mg&#xD;
      of the excipients, magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide/capsule 2 times a day, over 12&#xD;
      weeks might reduce or prevent the prevalence and severity of liver deterioration and&#xD;
      symptoms. Thus, the objectives of this project are to: (a) demonstrate quantitatively in a&#xD;
      sample of persons infected with HCV expected SST treatment-driven changes in serum levels of&#xD;
      liver enzymes, viral load, and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts by longitudinal statistical&#xD;
      modeling, and to correlate these to the severity of individual symptoms, liver enzyme levels,&#xD;
      and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as measured at screening, 4, 8, and 12 weeks; (b) examine in vitro&#xD;
      the response of a line of HCV-infected cells to the standardized herbal formulation; and (c)&#xD;
      assess the mechanism by which the herbal formulation may affect the HCV-infected cells in&#xD;
      vitro. Taken together, the clinical and laboratory components of the study should provide a&#xD;
      strong test of our primary hypothesis that compared to placebo a standardized combined herbal&#xD;
      formulation, SST, will reduce viral load, liver enzymes, and improve CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell&#xD;
      counts in persons infected with HCV who did not respond or have relapsed after peginterferon&#xD;
      alfa and ribavirin or in those for whom this conventional therapy is contraindicated. Our&#xD;
      long-term objectives are to identify the basic mechanisms underlying chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection-related cytokines and immune mediators and to provide a rationale for&#xD;
      mechanism-driven SST disease treatment. Confirming the effect of SST in chronic HCV infection&#xD;
      will create a foundation for a potentially supportive approach to managing HCV&#xD;
      disease-related and treatment-related symptoms. Ability to reduce liver damage or even&#xD;
      prevent the side effects of conventional therapy through the use of a standardized herbal&#xD;
      formula, SST, would be of potential benefit to thousands of persons infected with HCV by&#xD;
      providing an herbal treatment when the current conventional therapy is not effective or is&#xD;
      contraindicated.&#xD;
