  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac&#xD;
             monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the&#xD;
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the&#xD;
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle&#xD;
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed to confirm a post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status. For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml is confirmatory. Females on&#xD;
                  hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, HRT&#xD;
                  should be discontinued for 2 weeks and then the subject rescreened, as HRT can&#xD;
                  suppress FSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol.&#xD;
             This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication&#xD;
             until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;/ 50 kg for men and &gt;/ 45 kg for women and BMI within the range 18.5-31.0&#xD;

             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that&#xD;
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,&#xD;
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             result within 3 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise&#xD;
             subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal&#xD;
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history&#xD;
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;

             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History/evidence of symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass&#xD;
             grafting surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or any clinically&#xD;
             significant cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History/evidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
