    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which dose of prucalopride is safe and effective in&#xD;
      patients with chronic constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prucalopride 1 and 2 mg bid are safe and effective for the treatment of chronic constipation&#xD;
      whereas 0,5 mg is a suboptimal dose.&#xD;

      This is a phase II trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a drug-free run-in phase&#xD;
      (phase 1), followed by a placebo controlled double-blind phase (phase 2). Patients will&#xD;
      receive either R093877 0.5 mg b.i.d., 1 mg b.i.d. or 2 mg b.i.d. or placebo for a period of&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is a run-in period of 4 weeks duration, during which the bowel habit is documented&#xD;
      and the existence of constipation confirmed. At the start of this period all existing&#xD;
      laxative medication is withdrawn and patients will be instructed not to change their dietary&#xD;
      habits, in particular their fiber intake during the trial. Patients will enter the&#xD;
      double-blind phase if constipation has been shown to be present during the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the definition of constipation was not met during the 4 weeks of the run-in period, the&#xD;
      patient will be considered ineligible for the double-blind period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase, in which patients will be&#xD;
      treated for 12 weeks with either 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg of R093877 or placebo given twice daily&#xD;
      (one capsule is taken before breakfast and one is to be taken before the evening meal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the double blind treatment period will be randomly allocated to one of&#xD;
      the 4 treatment arms.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Age between 18-70 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of constipation, i.e., the subject reported the occurrence of two or more of&#xD;
             the following criteria for at least 6 months before the selection visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  two or fewer spontaneous* bowel movements a week,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  lumpy (scyballae) and/or hard stools at least ¼ of the stools,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  sensation of incomplete evacuation after at least ¼ of the stools,&#xD;

                  period by the intake of a laxative agent. Subjects who never had a spontaneous&#xD;
                  bowel movement were considered constipated and eligible to enter the double-blind&#xD;
