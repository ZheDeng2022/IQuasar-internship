  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the cardiac adaptive changes of professional&#xD;
      Israeli bicyclists by using echocardiography.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adaptive cardiac changes, such as enlargement of left ventricle mass and enlargement of left&#xD;
      ventricular wall was observed in athletes. The physiological limit of remodeling changes in&#xD;
      accordance to sex, type of activity, intensity of activity, genetics and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many studies were conducted on this subject, it is still impossible to predict if an&#xD;
      athlete from a certain sport will develop cardiac changes and their what will those changes&#xD;
      characteristics will be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death among young athletes, this is because of&#xD;
      high physical activity in the presence of a hidden heart disease, therefore there is much&#xD;
      debate about the needed screening tests for athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Israel, there is only one study in this subject that showed no significant cardiac changes&#xD;
      in Olympic athletes of various types of sports. the study didn't focused on high endurance&#xD;
      sport athletes such as professional bicyclists although cardiac endurance is a main factor in&#xD;
      cardiac changes.&#xD;
