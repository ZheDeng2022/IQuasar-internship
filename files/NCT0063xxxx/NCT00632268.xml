      The primary end-point of this study is to evaluate the objective response rates, and the&#xD;
      secondary end-points are overall survival, progression-free survival and safety profile of&#xD;
      low-dose RAD001 (everolimus) plus cisplatin and HDFL (weekly 24-hour infusion of high-dose&#xD;
      5-FU and leucovorin) chemotherapy in the first-line treatment for patients with unresectable,&#xD;
      recurrent, or metastatic gastric cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-resectable gastric cancer is an incurable disease, with a median survival of 4 months if&#xD;
      untreated. Systemic chemotherapy confers prolongation of survival and improvement of quality&#xD;
      of life. Regimens containing cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are widely adopted in the&#xD;
      world. The overall response rate and median overall survival of the P-HDFL regimen (cisplatin&#xD;
      and weekly 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU and leucovorin) for advanced gastric cancer are&#xD;
      60% (45%-76%, 95% C.I.) and 10 months, respectively. This regimen (P-HDFL) is very popular in&#xD;
      Taiwan because of high objective response rates and low treatment-related toxicities. Adding&#xD;
      a third active chemotherapeutic agent to cisplatin and 5-FU doublet does not seem to improve&#xD;
      efficacy. Further, most of the patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer are&#xD;
      frequently associated with a poor general condition which prohibits intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Therefore, combination of P-HDFL with biologic agents(such as everolimus, etc.)is an&#xD;
      attractive alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is actively participating in cell proliferation and survival of human&#xD;
      gastric cancers. We have recently demonstrated that RAD001(everolimus),an mTOR inhibitor,&#xD;
      although with only modest growth inhibitory effects as a single agent, has significant&#xD;
      synergistic cytotoxicity with cisplatin and 5-FU in gastric cancer cells. The concentration&#xD;
      of RAD001 needed for synergism with cisplatin and 5-FU is as low as 0.5 to 5 nM. And, as&#xD;
      expected, RAD001 has significant inhibition of downstream molecules such as 4E-BP1 and&#xD;
      S6Kinase, in human gastric cancer cells. It is therefore reasonable to conduct a phase II&#xD;
      study to examine if the combination of a relatively low dose of RAD001 and P-HDFL may improve&#xD;
      the outcome of advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multi-center, phase II trial using low-dose RAD001 (10 mg po on&#xD;
      D1,D8,&amp;D15) plus P-HDFL chemotherapy (cisplatin 35 mg/m2 ivd 24 hrs on D1 &amp; D8; 5-FU 2,000&#xD;
      mg/m2 and leucovorin 300 mg/m2 ivd 24 hrs on D1,D8,&amp;D15) in chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with&#xD;
      unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer. The treatment will be&#xD;
      repeated every 28 days. The primary end-point is objective response rates evaluated by RECIST&#xD;
      criteria, and the secondary end-points are overall survival, progression-free survival and&#xD;
      safety profile. Approximately 41 patients will be enrolled in order to obtain the 37&#xD;
      evaluable patients required by Simon two-stage minimax design. All enrolled patients will be&#xD;
      subjected to toxicity evaluations, but optionally to the correlative translational study of&#xD;
      biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with massive malignant ascites&#xD;
      will optionally participate the study of biomarkers in neoplastic cells in ascites.&#xD;
