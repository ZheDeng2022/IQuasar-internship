  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4, 24-week, randomized, parallel, open-label study of a meal replacement&#xD;
      program with Glucerna SR in obese Asian participants with type 2 diabetes. The duration of&#xD;
      each subject's participation will be approximately 28 weeks, including a lead-in period of 2&#xD;
      weeks and a 2-week post-treatment telephone follow-up. A sufficient number of Asian subjects&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes who have a BMI 18 between 25-40 kg/m2 and meet all the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study to randomize&#xD;
      approximately 60 subjects. Approximately 60 participants will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      (1) a meal replacement program with Glucerna SR on top of the Exchange-diet plan (EDP) or (2)&#xD;
      an caloric-matched EDP only. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      a diet program including Glucerna SR as a meal replacement on postprandial glucose response&#xD;
      after using Glucerna SR for 24 weeks in obese Asian subjects with type 2 diabetes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sufficient number of Asian subjects (expected to be approximately 90) with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      who have a BMI 18 between 25-40 kg/m2 and meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be entered into the study to randomize approximately 60 subjects. The&#xD;
      eligible obese subjects with type 2 diabetes will be entered into a 2-week lead-in period&#xD;
      with EDP after individual diet/lifestyle consultation to implement nutrition therapy into&#xD;
      their existing diabetes management. The diet recommendations of the EDP at the lead-in period&#xD;
      will be based on the nutrition recommendations from the ADA including carbohydrate and&#xD;
      monounsaturated fat together provided 60-70 % of energy intake, reduced intakes of saturated&#xD;
      fat (&lt; 10 % of total calories) and cholesterol (&lt; 300 mg/day) and protein intake around 15-20&#xD;
      % of total daily energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 60 participants will be randomized at Week 0 (Visit 3) in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either (1) a meal replacement program with Glucerna SR on top of the EDP or (2) an&#xD;
      caloric-matched EDP only. The participants will receive an educational program of diet,&#xD;
      exercise, and behavioral strategies at randomization. Each randomized subject in the meal&#xD;
      replacement group will receive Glucerna SR to replace one meal (breakfast) and one pre-sleep&#xD;
      snack for 24 weeks. The subjects in the group with EDP only will receive a meal plan like&#xD;
      they have in the lead-in period. All study subjects will be placed on a diet plan with 500 ~&#xD;
      800 kcal/day less than their estimated daily maintenance energy requirement and receive an&#xD;
      individualized exercise prescription to facilitate an optimal diabetes management. The&#xD;
      participants will visit the clinics at 4-week intervals for 24 weeks after randomization to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and the safety parameters. The participants will receive two different&#xD;
      meal tests at both the baseline and the end of the study. The macronutrient composition in&#xD;
      the meal test protocol 1 is a 480 Kcal Glucerna SR breakfast with 50 % CHO, 20 % protein, and&#xD;
      30 % fat. The test meal protocol 2 is a 480 Kcal sandwich breakfast with 63 % CHO, 20 %&#xD;
      protein, and 17 % fat. The primary efficacy variable will be the change from baseline in&#xD;
      incremental area under curve (âˆ†AUC) of glucose response after a Glucerna-SR test meal between&#xD;
      the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone follow-up will be performed 2 weeks after the study to evaluate any condition&#xD;
      related to the study.&#xD;
