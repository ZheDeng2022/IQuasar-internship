  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this psychosocial research study is to learn about the knowledge, beliefs, and&#xD;
      attitudes that people have toward screening for colorectal cancer. Another goal is to study&#xD;
      how families communicate about colorectal cancer risk and colorectal cancer screening, with&#xD;
      each other and with health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate psychosocial and external factors influencing colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
           patients' communication with their first-degree relatives (FDRs) about CRC risk and&#xD;
           screening information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using measures of knowledge, health beliefs and behavior, family closeness, openness and&#xD;
           motivation to discuss CRC and screening, distress, provider support and background&#xD;
           variables (sociodemographics, access to care, and medical history), we will conduct a&#xD;
           cross-sectional study to evaluate factors influencing CRC patients' communication about&#xD;
           CRC risk and screening information to their FDRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate psychosocial and external factors associated with CRC screening behavior&#xD;
           among first-degree relatives of CRC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using measures of knowledge, health beliefs and behavior, family closeness and subjective&#xD;
      norms, distress, provider interactions, benefits/barriers, and background variables&#xD;
      (race/ethnicity, sociodemographics, access to care, and medical history), we will conduct a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study of FDRs of CRC patients recruited under Aim 1 to evaluate factors&#xD;
      associated with CRC screening behavior (specifically, colonoscopy adherence).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      You will be interviewed by a member of the study staff over the telephone. You will be asked&#xD;
      about your awareness of screening tests for colorectal cancer, and your attitudes toward&#xD;
      colorectal cancer screening. You also will also be asked about your family's past use of&#xD;
      these screening tests, and how you discuss colorectal cancer risk and screening with your&#xD;
      family and health care providers. Some demographic information also will be collected (such&#xD;
      as your age or marital status). The questionnaire will take between 30 and 45 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your answers to the questions and your personal information will be kept strictly&#xD;
      confidential. Your questionnaire answers will be identified with a code number, rather than a&#xD;
      name, so that you cannot be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 325 colorectal cancer patients and their close&#xD;
      relatives may take part in the study. All will be enrolled MD Anderson.&#xD;

                  diagnosed between 6 and 12 months prior to being contacted about this study (to&#xD;
                  allow adequate time for dissemination of CRC risk to family members, and to avoid&#xD;
                  interference with care surrounding the initial diagnosis);&#xD;
