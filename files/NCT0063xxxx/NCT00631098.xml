    <textblock>
      International CPR guidelines recommend the cannulation of a peripheral vein (antecubital or&#xD;
      external jugular) during resuscitation. One reason for preferring the external jugular vein&#xD;
      over more peripheral veins is the faster circulation time of drugs during CPR. The&#xD;
      differences in circulation time may be over 90 seconds between peripheral and central&#xD;
      (internal jugular) veins. However, cannulation of the external jugular vein may be more&#xD;
      difficult and time consuming than cannulating cubital veins. There are no studies on the&#xD;
      success rate, cannulation time and reliability of venous access comparing central and&#xD;
      peripheral cannulation sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that cannulation of the external jugular vein (by paramedics and is a&#xD;
      demanding procedure in an emergency situation and should not be recommended during&#xD;
      resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to compare the feasibility of cannulating the external jugular&#xD;
      vein compared to the cubital vein in terms of attempts, cannulation time and reliability of&#xD;
      venous access.&#xD;

      The protocol includes measurement of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The time of cannulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of attempts of cannulation, Every piercing of skin is counted as one attempt.&#xD;
           Maximally three attempts will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Failures. Perforation of vein and subcutaneous hemorrhage, arterial puncture, the&#xD;
           appropriate vein is not found, free back flow of blood or free infusion of saline is not&#xD;
           achieved the attempt are considered as failures . Cannulation of another site is then&#xD;
           started or the study is ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final protocol of the study will be a paired control, randomized prospective study. The&#xD;
      randomization will be for the order of cannulation site (internal jugular or cubital vein&#xD;
      first) In the final study the cannulation will be performed by emergency department interns&#xD;
      and paramedics with advanced cardiac life support skills and licenced by Kuopio University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison and describing the experience of the paramedics an enquiry is accomplished and&#xD;
      the following data are collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experience as a paramedic (years after graduation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Theoretical guidance of cannulation (self estimated /hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Practical guidance of cannulation (self estimated/hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Experience of cannulation of the external jugular vein (self estimated/times)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison and describing the experience of the interns in the ER a similar enquiry is&#xD;
      accomplished,:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experience as an intern (years after graduation as MD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Theoretical guidance of cannulation (self estimated /hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Practical guidance of cannulation (self estimated/hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cannulation of external jugular vein (self estimated/times) Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint in this study is cannulation time of the two sites (internal jugular and&#xD;
      cubital vein). The secondary end points are failure/success of cannulation and reliability of&#xD;
      venous access as defined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics and anesthetic and operative variables are compared with the t-test&#xD;
      for independent samples (continuous variables), or the Mann-Whitney U-test and 2-test&#xD;
      (Pearson) or Fishers exact test when appropriate (categorical variables). Cannulation time&#xD;
      differences between the groups will be compared with the t-test for independent samples&#xD;
      (after tests for homoscedasticity and normality) or Mann-Whitney U-test if appropriate.&#xD;
      Success of cannulation will be compared with 2-test (Pearson) or Fishers exact test when&#xD;
      appropriate. A p value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Results are&#xD;
      given as mean (SD) or number of patients. All statistical analyses will be performed with&#xD;
      SPSS version 11.01 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
