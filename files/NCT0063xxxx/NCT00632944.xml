      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of hourly rounding on patient falls,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, and patient call light usage. This is a replication of research which&#xD;
      determined that hourly rounds conducted by nursing personnel decreased patient falls and call&#xD;
      light usage and increased patient satisfaction. The study design is quasi- experimental. One&#xD;
      unit will be used as its own control (4S). On this unit, hourly nursing rounds will be&#xD;
      implemented by Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, and Nursing Assistants. A second&#xD;
      unit, 6S, will maintain current practices and data from this unit will be used to determine&#xD;
      if there are any hospital-wide fluctuations for fall rates, patient satisfaction, or call&#xD;
      light usage. Data for patient falls, patient satisfaction, call light usage, and reasons for&#xD;
      call light use will be collected on both units using fall rate reports, patient satisfaction&#xD;
      survey data, and the call light system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls among hospital patients are a persistent problem, with 2.3 to 7 falls occurring in U.S.&#xD;
      hospitals every 1000 patient days. Approximately 30-48% percent of these falls result in&#xD;
      injury and 5 to 10 percent of them result in serious injury. Fall related deaths occurred at&#xD;
      a rate of 46.2 per 100,000 in 2003. Hospital falls affect both young and old patients and&#xD;
      many of them occur when the patient is alone or involved in elimination-related activities.&#xD;
      Falls that result in injury may lead to an extended hospitalization and increased costs.&#xD;
      Patients who fall and sustain injury are reported to have hospital charges of more than&#xD;
      $4,200 higher than patients who do not fall. Hourly nursing rounds have been shown to&#xD;
      decrease falls by 52%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients often require assistance with basic self-care tasks, such as using the&#xD;
      toilet, ambulating, and eating; they ask for assistance by using the call light. Therefore, a&#xD;
      patient's level of satisfaction with nursing care depends principally upon the patient's&#xD;
      perception of how well the nursing staff has been able to meet his or her needs. The call&#xD;
      light can be a lifeline for hospitalized patients, but it can also impose considerable&#xD;
      demands on nurses' time. Several studies have documented the unfavorable effects of patients'&#xD;
      frequent use of call lights on the effectiveness of patient-care management on inpatient&#xD;
      units, which may already be compromised by staffing shortages.&#xD;

      Falls among hospital patients are a persistent problem, with 2.3 to 7 falls occurring in U.S.&#xD;
      hospitals every 1000 patient days. Approximately 30-48% percent of these falls result in&#xD;

      many of them occur when the patient is alone or involved in elimination-related activities.&#xD;
      Falls that result in injury may lead to an extended hospitalization and increased costs .&#xD;
      Patients who fall and sustain injury are reported to have hospital charges of more than&#xD;
      $4,200 higher per admission than patients who do not fall. Hourly nursing rounds have been&#xD;
      shown to decrease falls by 52% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients often require assistance with basic self-care tasks, such as using the&#xD;
      toilet, ambulating, and eating; they ask for assistance by using the call light. Therefore, a&#xD;
      patient's level of satisfaction with nursing care depends principally upon the patient's&#xD;
      perception of how well the nursing staff has been able to meet his or her needs. The call&#xD;
      light can be a lifeline for hospitalized patients, but it can also impose considerable&#xD;
      demands on nurses' time. Several studies have documented the unfavorable effects of patients'&#xD;
      frequent use of call lights on the effectiveness of patient-care management on inpatient&#xD;
      units, which may already be compromised by staffing shortages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current data at Crouse Hospital show that the fall rate on 4S is 5.05 per 1000 patient days,&#xD;
      demonstrating significant opportunity for improvement. Data from the 6S shows a fall rate of&#xD;
      5.26 per 1000 patient days. As far as patient satisfaction, the percentage of patients who&#xD;
      gave the 4S a 9 or 10 out of a possible score of 10 for overall rating of care was 56.29%.&#xD;
      Likewise the number of patients who would definitely recommend Crouse Hospital to others was&#xD;
      56.25%. Both satisfaction questions (Core IP Key Results: I would prefer to return to X&#xD;
      without hesitation, if care is needed and I would recommend X without hesitation to others)&#xD;
      show significant opportunities for improvement. Preliminary call light usage gathered from&#xD;
      the Hill Rom call light system, which is currently available only on 6S, showed 6,909&#xD;
      individual uses of the call light within a 4-week period. One can surmise from this number&#xD;
      that patient issues are not being addressed in a timely manner and therefore significant&#xD;
      opportunities for improvement exist. Only aggregate data will be collected. No subjects will&#xD;
      be identified directly or through any identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Correlate the effects of hourly nursing rounds, if any, to patient falls and call light&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if there are any changes in patient satisfaction levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects 18 years and over admitted to 4 South Irving (Oncology/OBGYN) or 6 South Irving&#xD;
      (Orthopedic/Neurology) during the twelve month study will be included as research subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Any patient not admitted to 4 South Irving or 6 South Irving at Crouse&#xD;
      Hospital will be excluded from the study. Patients under the age of 18 years are not admitted&#xD;
      to these units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample sizes for the study were determined for call light usage rates, patient satisfaction&#xD;
      scores, and fall rates. Current process averages for sample size calculations were obtained&#xD;
      as follows: 1) fall rates from existing fall rate reports 2) patient satisfaction from Avatar&#xD;
      surveys, and 3) call bell usage from preliminary Hill Rom system data. For all sample size&#xD;
      calculations, α=0.05 and β=0.10 were used. Based on these calculations, the study baseline&#xD;
      data for patient satisfaction will be calculated using Avatar patient satisfaction data from&#xD;
      the six-month period prior to study initiation. The baseline data for falls will be collected&#xD;
      from existing fall rate reports using the six months of data prior to study initiation. Data&#xD;
      for these variables will continue to be collected for 6 months after the implementation of&#xD;
      nursing rounds. For call bell usage rates the data for 2 weeks prior to rounding&#xD;
      implementation will be collected as baseline data. Data will be collected for 4 weeks&#xD;
      following the implementation of nursing rounds. Data for average patient age, length of stay,&#xD;
      and severity of illness for both units will be obtained from Transition Systems, Inc. TSI, a&#xD;
      financial data base is a type of Decision Support System. In order to get the information on&#xD;
      a patient's age a query will be made of TSI. It will then print up average ages of a&#xD;
      particular unit within a specified time. Measures of central tendency and spread will be&#xD;
      calculated for these variables to compare both units. Chi-square tests, rank sum tests, and&#xD;
      tests of means will be used to compare baseline and post-intervention demographic&#xD;
      characteristics and reasons for call light usage on both units. Rate ratios comparing post-&#xD;
      to pre-intervention fall rates and call rates will be calculated on both. For both fall rates&#xD;
      and call rates, significance tests will be conducted to determine whether the rate ratios&#xD;
      differ between the two units. The change in the proportion of patients who indicated they&#xD;
      were satisfied with their care in each unit before and after the intervention will also be&#xD;
      calculated and compared. The data will be analyzed using SAS®9. No data involving individual&#xD;
      patient identifiers will be presented with the analysis. Findings from this study will&#xD;
      potentially be used to change nursing practice at Crouse Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4-South Irving, the experimental unit, will be used as its own control. A second unit, 6S,&#xD;
      will maintain current practices and data from this unit will be used to determine if there&#xD;
      are any hospital-wide fluctuations for fall rates, patient satisfaction, or call light usage.&#xD;
      Age, gender, and severity of illness of subjects on the control and experimental units will&#xD;
      be compared. Because the patient populations differ from the experimental to control unit,&#xD;
      the reasons why patients use the call light will be collected to verify that these two groups&#xD;
      use the call lights for similar reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal and co-investigators of this study will be educating all nursing personnel on&#xD;
      both units on how to collect and document call light data 1 week prior to the start of the&#xD;
      data collection process. Baseline call light data for the reasons why patients use the call&#xD;
      light and number of patient calls will then be collected for 2 weeks. After baseline call&#xD;
      light data are collected the principal and co-investigators will be educating all nursing&#xD;
      personnel on 4 South Irving on how to round on patients. Education will last for 2 weeks and&#xD;
      includes what questions to ask of the patient while in the room, what tasks need to be done&#xD;
      each time they are in the room, when to round on patients, and how to document rounds. An&#xD;
      hourly rounding toolkit purchased from the authors of the original study, which includes an&#xD;
      educational video, will be used to assist in this education phase. Nursing leadership, which&#xD;
      includes the nurse manager, Director of Medical-Surgical Nursing, the Chief Nursing Officer&#xD;
      and Clinical Nurse Specialists, will be educated on techniques to ensure rounding is&#xD;
      consistently completed by nursing personnel. The implementation of nursing rounds will begin&#xD;
      after the two weeks of rounding education is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One member of the nursing staff, including RNs, LPNs, and Nursing Assistants, will be&#xD;
      required to perform nursing rounds every hour on 4 South Irving Patients will not be awakened&#xD;
      if they are sleeping unless it is necessary for treatment. During nursing rounds, nursing&#xD;
      personnel will assess pain levels using a pain-assessment scale, offer toileting assistance,&#xD;
      assess the patient's position and position comfort, make sure the call light is within the&#xD;
      patients reach, put the television remote control and bed light switch within the patients&#xD;
      reach, put the bedside table next to the bed, put the tissue box and water within the&#xD;
      patient's reach and prior to leaving the room ask &quot;Is there anything I can do for you before&#xD;
      I leave? I have time while I am here in the room.&quot; Nursing personnel will also tell the&#xD;
      patient that a member of the nursing staff (name will be written on white board in room) will&#xD;
      be back in an hour to round again. Nursing staff members are expected to complete all&#xD;
      patient-care tasks, unless they are not authorized to dispense medication or work with IVs.&#xD;
      Laminated pocket cards will be given to nursing staff so they are continually reminded of the&#xD;
      actions to perform on the rounds. Patients will not be awakened to check for pain,&#xD;
      positioning, or the need to use the bathroom; however the environmental check can be&#xD;
      completed during rounds. Members of the nursing leadership team including the nurse manager,&#xD;
      Director of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Chief Nursing Officer, and Clinical Nurse Specialists&#xD;
      will be making frequent observations of staff, using rounding documentation sheets and&#xD;
      patient interviews, to verify that rounding is occurring as expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Call light usage will be collected through the use of the Hill Rom call light system.&#xD;
      Recently, Hill Rom Beds were added to 4 South. Now the two units are equipped with Hill Rom&#xD;
      Beds and corresponding Hill Rom call lights. All call lights placed from individual patient&#xD;
      rooms are recorded on a central server located in each nursing station. The central server&#xD;
      can generate and print reports for all call lights used in a user specified time frame.&#xD;
      Reports include the time a call light was placed, area it was placed from and call light&#xD;
      response time. Reasons for call light usage will be documented by bedside nursing personnel&#xD;
      on a standard sheet. The documentation forms will be collected every day at 7a.m. by the&#xD;
      principal investigator or co-investigators of the study. New documentation forms will be&#xD;
      posted daily at 7a.m. Inter-rater reliability will be performed by comparing manual call&#xD;
      light data to the computerized call light data collected within the Hill Rom call light&#xD;
      system. Documentation of rounding times and frequency will also be documented by nursing&#xD;
      personnel on a standard form . This form will be collected every day at 7a.m. by either the&#xD;
      principal investigator or co-investigator of the study. New rounding documentation forms will&#xD;
      be posted daily. Rounding documentation forms will be used to calculate the percentage of&#xD;
      rounds completed as expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On both units, baseline data collection for falls and patient satisfaction will be collected&#xD;
      for 6 months prior to the start of nursing rounds and 6 months after the start of the&#xD;
      implementation of nursing rounds. Fall rates will be collected through pre-existing fall rate&#xD;
      reports and reported as falls per 1000 patient days. Patient satisfaction will be collected&#xD;
      through pre-existing Avatar patient satisfaction surveys that are randomly sent to discharged&#xD;
      patients. All data will be analyzed to determine if statistically significant differences in&#xD;
      patient fall rates, satisfaction, or call light usage occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limitation in this study is that nurses from the medical surgical float pool may work on 4&#xD;
      South and subsequently be assigned to 6 South within the 6 month post-intervention time&#xD;
      period. This potential movement of nurses between the control and experimental unit may&#xD;
      influence the results on the control unit. This will be addressed by limiting the number of&#xD;
      float pool nurses who are scheduled to work on both the experimental unit and the control&#xD;
      unit for the six months following the education phase of the study.&#xD;
