  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-phase study during which patients with select myeloid leukemias or advanced&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), who have failed, refused or are not eligible for standard&#xD;
      treatment, will receive investigational study drug ARRY-520.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 3 parts. The first phase of the study, Phase 1, has 2 parts. In the first part&#xD;
      of Phase 1, patients with select myeloid leukemias or advanced MDS will receive increasing&#xD;
      doses of study drug on different schedules in order to achieve the highest dose possible that&#xD;
      will not cause unacceptable side effects. Approximately 30 patients (per schedule) from the&#xD;
      US will be enrolled in Part 1 (Completed). In the second part of Phase 1, patients with&#xD;
      advanced MDS will receive the best dose of study drug and schedule determined from the first&#xD;
      part of the study. Approximately 10 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2&#xD;
      (Completed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third part of the study, Phase 2, patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or&#xD;
      advanced MDS will receive the best dose of study drug and schedule determined from the first&#xD;
      part of the study and will be followed to see what side effects the study drug causes and to&#xD;
      see what effectiveness it has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 40 patients from&#xD;
      the US will be enrolled in Part 3 (Withdrawn).&#xD;
