  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to collect leukemia cell specimens from adults (18 years of&#xD;
      age) diagnosed with acute leukemia at time of initial diagnosis and, if applicable, at time&#xD;
      of first relapse. These specimens, in conjunction with a de-identified data set, will be&#xD;
      utilized prospectively to determine potential chemotherapy resistance in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect peripheral blood specimens from patients diagnosed with acute leukemia at time of&#xD;
      initial diagnosis and, if applicable, at time of first relapse To evaluate the leukemia cells&#xD;
      in the blood specimens for chemotherapy resistance utilizing the Hem(A)+ technology&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a body of evidence from acute leukemia patients that demonstrates the&#xD;
      applicability of the Hem(A)+ assay to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predict responders and non-responders to common chemotherapeutic agents Track treatment&#xD;
      results and comparison to prediction results from the assay Identify optimal chemotherapy&#xD;
      doses for each patient Identify the most efficacious pharmaceutical agent combinations&#xD;
