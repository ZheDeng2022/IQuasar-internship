  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase II study of locally advanced or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma&#xD;
      (NPC) with the single drug Alimta. The objective of this study is to assess efficacy and&#xD;
      safety profiles of Alimta as 2nd line treatment for patients with advanced NPC.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally recurrent or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have previously received one platinum based chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
             palliative therapy of locally advanced or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior platinum based chemotherapy completed at least 3 months prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment and the patient must have recovered from toxic effects of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiation therapy is allowed, but should have been limited and must not have&#xD;
             included whole pelvis radiation. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects&#xD;
             of the treatment prior to study enrollment (except for alopecia). Prior radiotherapy&#xD;
             must be completed 30 days before study entry. Lesions that have been radiated cannot&#xD;
             be included as sites of measurable disease unless clear tumor progression has been&#xD;
             documented in these lesions since the end of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease status must be that of measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation&#xD;
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status of 0 to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient compliance and geographic proximity that allow adequate follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function including the following: Bone marrow: absolute neutrophil&#xD;
             count (ANC) &gt;or= 1.5x10^9/L, platelets &gt;or= 100x10^9/L, hemoglobin &gt;or= 9g/dL.&#xD;
             Hepatic: bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase (AST) and&#xD;
             alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN (alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT &lt; 5 x ULN is&#xD;
             acceptable if liver has tumor involvement). Renal: calculated creatinine clearance &gt;&#xD;
             45 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men or women of at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women: Must be surgically sterile, post-menopausal, or compliant with a medically&#xD;
             approved contraceptive regimen during and for 3 months after the treatment period;&#xD;
             must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test and must not be lactating. For men:&#xD;
             Must be surgically sterile, or compliant with a contraceptive regimen during and for 3&#xD;
             months after the treatment period.&#xD;

          -  Signed informed consent from patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected brain metastasis. Patients who have clinical signs or symptoms that&#xD;
             are suspicious of brain metastasis must have a pretreatment computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
             or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. A patient with documented brain&#xD;
             metastasis, at the time of consideration for study entry or in the past, will be&#xD;
             excluded from entering in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study, or received Alimta previously&#xD;
             outside this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of any other tumor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection (at the discretion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious concomitant disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient or&#xD;
             compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant neurological or mental disorder, including seizures or&#xD;
             dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of consideration&#xD;
             for study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received&#xD;
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
             2 days before, the day of, and 2 days after the dose of Alimta. If a patient is taking&#xD;
             a NSAID (Cox-2 inhibitors included) or salicylate with a long half-life, it should not&#xD;
             be taken 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days after the dose of Alimta.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically relevant third-space fluid collections that cannot be&#xD;
             controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to take folic acid, vitamin B12 supplementation, or&#xD;
             dexamethasone.&#xD;
