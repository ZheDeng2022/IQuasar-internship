  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury from explosive blast is a prominent feature of contemporary combat. Although&#xD;
      protective armor and effective acute medical intervention allows soldiers to survive blast&#xD;
      events, a growing number of veterans will have disability stemming from blast-related neural&#xD;
      damage. Soldiers also return from combat with psychological disabilities caused by traumatic&#xD;
      war events. The clinical presentation of individuals with blast-related neural damage and&#xD;
      post-traumatic psychopathology are markedly similar and thus a clear description of the&#xD;
      direct consequences of explosive blast is complicated by the emotional and cognitive sequelae&#xD;
      of psychological trauma. We will use sophisticated measures of neural function and structure&#xD;
      to characterize brain injury from explosive blasts in a sample of Operation Iraqi Freedom&#xD;
      (OIF) National Guard soldiers who returned from deployment in the fall of 2007. Survey data&#xD;
      gathered near the end of deployment indicated that over 50% of the brigade had been exposed&#xD;
      to direct physical effects of explosive blasts. To fully characterize the effects of blast on&#xD;
      the brain and differentiate them from post-traumatic stress disorder, we will contrast groups&#xD;
      of soldiers exposed to blast and with groups experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;
      This investigation will improve the characterization of blast-related traumatic brain injury,&#xD;
      describe the essential features of the condition in terms of neural function and structure to&#xD;
      inform diagnosis, and characterize mechanisms of recovery after blast-related neural injury&#xD;
      to allow the creation of interventions that return soldiers to maximum levels of functioning.&#xD;

      Background: The clinical presentation of individuals with blast-related brain injury and&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress reactions can be markedly similar and thus a clear description of the&#xD;
      direct consequences of explosive blast is complicated by the emotional and cognitive sequelae&#xD;
      of psychological trauma. The inability to clearly separate the basis of symptoms for the two&#xD;
      conditions has hampered clinicians in prescribing effective treatments that return soldiers&#xD;
      to maximal functioning. Measures that directly assess neural disruption may be employed to&#xD;
      differentiate blast-related brain injury from post-traumatic psychopathology and guide&#xD;
      effective intervention..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypothesis: We propose to use quantitative indices of brain electrical activity and&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize the effects of blast injury on brain function&#xD;
      and structure. We hypothesize that Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) soldiers injured by&#xD;
      explosive blast will be distinguishable from those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&#xD;
      on measures of brain function and structure. Specifically, blast exposure will be associated&#xD;
      with diminished P3a amplitudes to target stimuli during sustained attention and diminished&#xD;
      lateralized frontal potentials during recognition of previously presented words. Individuals&#xD;
      with PTSD will exhibit normal amplitudes of P3 and lateralized frontal brain potentials.&#xD;
      Blast affected soldiers will also have compromised white matter integrity in supracallosal,&#xD;
      inferior frontal, and superior frontal brain regions while PTSD will not be associated with&#xD;
      these structural abnormalities. Finally, functional brain anomalies (e.g., P3a), and frontal&#xD;
      white matter fractional anisotropy will be associated with the adaptive functioning of&#xD;
      soldiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Using advanced quantitative analyses of electroencephalogram recordings we&#xD;
      will determine the nature of functional neural anomalies related to sustained attention and&#xD;
      memory deficits evident after injury from blast. We will determine white matter anomalies&#xD;
      that are unique to blast injury as compared to PTSD. We will also determine which aspects of&#xD;
      blast-related functional and structural brain abnormalities are associated with adaptive&#xD;
      functioning in post-deployment. The long-term goals for the proposed program of research are&#xD;
      to improve the characterization of traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to blast, describe its&#xD;
      essential features in terms of neural function and structure to improve diagnosis, and&#xD;
      characterize mechanisms of recovery after blast-related neural injury to facilitate the&#xD;
      creation of interventions that target pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: In May of 2007 over 2650 Minnesota National Guard troops of the 1/34 BCT&#xD;
      completed a within-theatre survey on health, exposure to blast, and traumatic events.&#xD;
      Fifty-one percent of surveyed troops reported being close enough to an explosive blast that&#xD;
      they felt a heat or pressure wave, had trouble hearing, or had subsequent problems with&#xD;
      attention or memory. The proposed study will be carried out over a four-year period and&#xD;
      include a total of 180 subjects. To determine the neural consequences of blast exposure we&#xD;
      will compare the functional and structural brain characteristics of individuals from the 1/34&#xD;
      BCT who have blast injury, blast injury and PTSD, PTSD, and no blast injury or PTSD. There&#xD;
      will be 45 demographically similar subjects in each group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A high level of posttraumatic stress will be operationally defined &quot;moderate&quot; levels&#xD;
             (a rating of 3 or more on a 1 to 5 scale) of the following symptoms according to Hoge&#xD;
             et al 4: one re-experiencing symptom, three avoidance symptoms, and two hyperarousal&#xD;
             symptoms. Staff will complete a screening interview via telephone in which the&#xD;
             potential participant answers questions from the Blast Exposure Screen. The Blast&#xD;
             Exposure Screen provides a comprehensive assessment of exposure to blast for the&#xD;
             duration of deployment. Blast events will be rated for physical effects (e.g., knocked&#xD;
             off balance, physically thrown by blast) and after effects (i.e., memory problems,&#xD;
             headache) on the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who report memory lapses,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensitivity to light or noise, headaches&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Difficulty with concentration shortly after the explosive blast and have any of the&#xD;
             same symptoms in the past month will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if they manifest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current substance induced psychotic disorder or psychotic disorder due to a general&#xD;
             medical condition than TBI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or past DSM IV defined substance dependence other than alcohol, caffeine, or&#xD;
             nicotine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current DSM IV substance abuse other than alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A neurologic condition or DSM Axis I mental disorder prior to deployment&#xD;
             (predeployment data from a sample of soldiers from the 1/34 BCT yielded an estimated&#xD;
             rate of 5% of either PTSD or depression)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or predeployment unstable medical condition that would likely affect brain&#xD;
             function (e.g., clear anoxic episode, cardiac arrest, current uncontrolled diabetes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant risk of suicidal or homicidal behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Head injury from a source other than blast that resulted in loss of consciousness for&#xD;
             more the 15 minutes, post-traumatic amnesia, skull fracture, or hospitalization. The&#xD;
             screening interview will include questions to assess subjects with respect to the&#xD;
             above exclusion criteria. During the telephone contact subjects will complete a&#xD;
             screening for MRI protocols in order to exclude individuals who may have metal&#xD;
             fragments in their bodies.&#xD;
