  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the local (cervico-vaginal) and systemic (whole body) safety of vaginal&#xD;
      immunisation with CN54gp140 glycoprotein administered 9 times over a 3 week period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study will primarily assess the local and&#xD;
      systemic safety and tolerability of CN54gp140 vaccine. We will also assess whether CN54gp140&#xD;
      vaccine is effective at inducing systemic and/or local specific immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty healthy women volunteers will be enrolled in this study, at 2 clinical sites. Twenty&#xD;
      will receive active CN54gp140 vaccine, and 10 will receive placebo. The placebo group will&#xD;
      help us identify side effects caused by CN54gp140. The study is double-blind to eliminate any&#xD;
      possibility of researcher or subject bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before administration, CN54gp140 or placebo will be mixed into an aqueous gel vehicle. The&#xD;
      treatments will be administered intravaginally in a regimen of 9 immunisations over 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Each immunisation of CN54gp140 vaccine will contain 100 µg of CN54gp140 protein, meaning that&#xD;
      a total dose of 900 µg will be given to subjects in the active treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to make a total of 15 outpatient visits to their local clinical&#xD;
      site, over 4 successive menstrual cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menstrual cycle 1: Screening visits There will be 2 screening visits, at about 4 and 2 weeks&#xD;
      before the first immunisation. During these visits the volunteers will be asked questions&#xD;
      about their health history and to give permission for us to contact their General&#xD;
      Practitioner. Blood and urine samples will be taken for routine laboratory safety tests, and&#xD;
      tests for HIV and hepatitis, sexual health, and pregnancy. Blood will also be collected for&#xD;
      immunology tests to establish the pre-immunisation state of the immune system. The volunteers&#xD;
      will also have a cervico-vaginal examination, and sampling of cervico-vaginal secretions and&#xD;
      cells will be done for immunology tests. A photograph of the cervix will be taken to help&#xD;
      identify any changes that might occur during the trial. Also, a full medical history and&#xD;
      examination will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers will be given a diary card to take home. They'll be asked to record in the&#xD;
      diary any symptoms they have, and medication they take, during the course of the trial. The&#xD;
      diaries be regularly checked by the trial staff, who will also make a symptom enquiry at each&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menstrual cycle 2: Immunisation visits There will be 9 immunisation visits, on successive&#xD;
      Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The 1st of these visits will be about 7 days after the start&#xD;
      of menses. At the 1st, 4th and 9th immunisation visits, blood and urine will be collected for&#xD;
      routine laboratory safety and pregnancy tests, and blood collected for immunology tests.&#xD;
      Subjects will also have a cervico-vaginal examination, and their temperature, blood pressure&#xD;
      and heart rate measured, before self-administering the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the rest of the immunisation visits, subjects will self-administer the vaccine. No other&#xD;
      procedures will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menstrual cycle 3: Sampling visits There will be 3 sampling visits, at about 9, 14 and 21&#xD;
      days after the start of menses. At each visit, subjects will have a cervico-vaginal&#xD;
      examination, during which sampling of secretions and cells will be done for immunology tests.&#xD;
      Also, blood will be collected for immunology tests, and subjects will have their temperature,&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate measured. At the 1st and 3rd sampling visits only, blood and&#xD;
      urine will be collected for routine laboratory safety tests also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menstrual cycle 4: End-of-study visit This visit will be about 10 days after the start of&#xD;
      menses. Blood and urine will be collected for routine laboratory safety and pregnancy tests,&#xD;
      tests for HIV, and immunology tests. The volunteers will also have a cervico-vaginal&#xD;
      examination, during which sampling of secretions and cells will be done for immunology tests,&#xD;
      and a full medical examination. A photograph of the cervix will be taken. This visit&#xD;
      concludes the subject's participation in the study.&#xD;
