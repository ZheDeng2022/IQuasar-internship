    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the model determined by the ability of botulism antitoxin (bivalent,&#xD;
           Aventis) to neutralize Botulinum toxin in the Extensor Digitorum Brevis model of muscle&#xD;
           paralysis in Stage A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the ability of botulism antitoxin (heptavalent, Cangene) to neutralize&#xD;
           Botulinum toxin in the Extensor Digitorum Brevis model of muscle paralysis in Stage B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Botulism is a rare disease; however Botulinum toxins (neurotoxins) may be used as biological&#xD;
      weapon especially in the form of aerosol. Botulism is caused by neurotoxins that are produced&#xD;
      by the obligate anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium Clostridium botulinum (1).&#xD;
      C. botulinum produces 8 serologically distinct neurotoxins identified as serotypes A, B, C1,&#xD;
      C2, D, E, F, and G (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy for botulism includes supportive care and passive immunization with antitoxin.&#xD;
      Antitoxin should be administered to patients with neurologic signs of botulism as soon as&#xD;
      possible after clinical diagnosis (3). Botulism antitoxin is prepared from plasma obtained&#xD;
      from horses that have been immunized with a specific subtype of botulism toxoid and toxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BT-002 is an exploratory pharmacodynamic study that is being performed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of Botulism Antitoxins in preventing paralysis of extensor digitorum brevis muscle&#xD;
      following BOTOX®/ MYOBLOC® administration. This study will compare bivalent and heptavalent&#xD;
      products to a placebo. Safety data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NP-018 (heptavalent equine-derived botulinum antitoxin) is prepared from plasma obtained from&#xD;
      horses that have been immunized with a specific subtype of botulinum toxoid and toxin. Each&#xD;
      individual horse is immunized against a single botulinum toxin subtype. Plasma is pooled from&#xD;
      horses that have been immunized with the same botulinum toxin subtype. For each antitoxin&#xD;
      serotype (A-G), a despeciated product will be produced by pepsin digestion of the IgG monomer&#xD;
      in the equine plasma, yielding predominantly F(ab')2 fragment. Following the formulation, the&#xD;
      seven antitoxin serotypes will be blended into a heptavalent product and filled into&#xD;
      single-use vials. '&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will be conducted in two stages - Stage A and Stage B. If enrolled in the&#xD;
      Stage A of the study, the subject will have an equal chance of getting either bivalent&#xD;
      botulism antitoxin or placebo. If enrolled in Stage B of the study, the subject will have an&#xD;
      equal chance of getting heptavalent botulism antitoxin (NP-018) or placebo. The subject will&#xD;
      be receiving injections of Botox and Myobloc on the next day after the antitoxin&#xD;
      administration in the left and right foot respectively. The subject's participation in this&#xD;
      study will be for maximum of 57 days.&#xD;
