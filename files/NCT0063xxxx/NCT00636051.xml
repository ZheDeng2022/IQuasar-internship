  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the introduction of an EBP text&#xD;
      for Nursing Research Council (NRC) members to use with RN staff to increase staff belief in,&#xD;
      knowledge of and implementation of EBP in providing patient care. The theory that will drive&#xD;
      this study is Disciplined Clinical Inquiry (DCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will use a quasi-experimental design plus DCI to engage unit RN staff in&#xD;
      deciding how they might learn about EBP in a feasible, useful way. After collection of&#xD;
      baseline data, the NRC member will introduce the text + solicit staff input into a plan for&#xD;
      using the text to increase understanding of EBP and use of evidence to make practice changes&#xD;
      on her/his own unit. Another unit in that service line or under the same Service Line&#xD;
      Administrator will serve as a comparison unit. Data collection will be conducted again after&#xD;
      4 and 12 weeks. At the 12 week point, the NRC member will introduce the text + solicit staff&#xD;
      input for a plan on the comparison unit. Data collection will be conducted on the comparison&#xD;
      unit at 16 weeks, and again on both units at 24 weeks. At the 24 week point, additional units&#xD;
      will be added and the process repeated until all units represented on the NRC have been&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will include: EBP belief and EBP implementation scales (Melnyk &amp;&#xD;
      Fineout-Overholt, 2003); EBP knowledge cognitive test; # of lit searches conducted by unit RN&#xD;
      staff ; # of requests for library support for lit searches or to obtain search-related&#xD;
      articles: # of unit clinical policies with documented levels of evidence &amp; research&#xD;
      references. EBP belief, EBP implementation and EBP knowledge variables will be analyzed at&#xD;
      both individual and unit levels of analysis. All other variables will be measured at the unit&#xD;
      level of analysis. Additional unit level variables will include the following data collected&#xD;
      annually as part of the National Database for Nursing Quality Indicator (NDNQI) RN&#xD;
      satisfaction survey: satisfaction with RN-RN interaction, satisfaction with autonomy,&#xD;
      satisfaction with practice decision-making, perceived quality of care delivered on the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary statistical procedures for analysis will be ANCOVA, ANOVAwith repeated measures,&#xD;
      and logistic regression.&#xD;

        All RN staff &amp; RN patient service leaders (PSLs) who are over 18 years of age, employed by&#xD;
        Upstate and working full or parttime on direct care units within service lines represented&#xD;
        on the Nursing Research Council (NRC) will be invited to participate. This target&#xD;
        population includes approximately 551 staff RNs &amp; PSLs. We expect to enroll a minimum of 5&#xD;
        and as many as 15 RNs on the 29 nursing units over the course of the study for a sample&#xD;
        size between 145 and 435&#xD;
