  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are seeking volunteers to participate in a research study to determine the optimal imaging&#xD;
      parameters for visualization of the heart and its great vessels so that errors in computer&#xD;
      data analysis is minimized and clinical accuracy is maximized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will involve having an MRI of the heart. This study will allow us&#xD;
      to determine the ability to measure the volumes of your heart chambers in both the left and&#xD;
      right side of your heart without using any aggressive (invasive) technique or the use of&#xD;
      ionizing radiation (x-rays or gamma rays). The study will also allow us to measure changes in&#xD;
      the cardiac chamber volumes during the cardiac cycle and determine whether this can be done&#xD;
      rapidly and accurately. The study will also allow us to determine whether this technique can&#xD;
      be used for routine clinical use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The ability to obtain accurate cyclical functional information of the cardiac chambers plays&#xD;
      a continuing important clinical diagnostic role in the evaluation and monitoring of patients&#xD;
      with a wide range of cardiac pathologies, including those embarking on or continuing&#xD;
      cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic regimes, as well as patients with lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current imaging modalities used for non-invasive imaging of the heart include&#xD;
      echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography. Echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac&#xD;
      function is primarily limited to the left ventricle and functional measurements are based on&#xD;
      volumetric estimates in turn based usually on geometric assumptions. That is, the volume&#xD;
      calculation is based on a limited number of non orthogonal linear measurements assuming a&#xD;
      regular (non complex) chamber morphology. This study technique provides no biologic hazard to&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radionuclide ventriculography does allow for 3D cardiac data acquisition and theoretical&#xD;
      evaluation of biventricular function. However, the technique does not provide the same degree&#xD;
      of spatial resolution that echocardiography can provide. Radionuclide ventriculography is a&#xD;
      commonly accepted diagnostic procedure but does involve use of ionizing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance imaging techniques (of the heart) allows relatively high resolution cross&#xD;
      sectional imaging. For example a 512X512 matrix over a 40cm field of view provides in plane&#xD;
      resolution better that 1mm. No assumptions are made in regard chamber cross sectional area&#xD;
      and hence volume morphology. The slice thickness is determined in advance and may be in the&#xD;
      range of 1-10mm. MR data ca be acquired sequentially throughout the cardiac cycle and thus&#xD;
      provide a time varying 3D map of the cardiac chambers and related structures during the&#xD;
      cardiac cycle.&#xD;
