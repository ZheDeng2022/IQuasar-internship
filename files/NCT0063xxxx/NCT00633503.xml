    <textblock>
      Tissue transfer flaps are a method of moving tissue from a donor location to a recipient&#xD;
      location. In the case of a free tissue transfer flaps, the blood vessels to the transferred&#xD;
      tissues are detached and then re-attached to different arteries &amp; veins at the recipient&#xD;
      site. The process of reconstructive surgery using tissue transfer flaps allows for improved&#xD;
      results in terms of functionality, aesthetic appearance, and psychological well-being in&#xD;
      patients requiring reconstructive surgery after cancer resection or trauma. The process of&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery using tissue transfer flaps is not without complications. These&#xD;
      complications may include acute arterial or venous occlusion, as well as the development of&#xD;
      late complications such as fat necrosis and flap atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if a novel, unique, portable, non-contact&#xD;
      optical imaging device developed at the Beckman Laser Institute called Modulated Imaging (MI)&#xD;
      can detect changes in a flap's optical properties, which can correlate with arterial or&#xD;
      venous occlusion or with the development of fat necrosis or flap atrophy. The study would&#xD;
      also evaluate if changes in the tissue transfer flap's optical properties, as detected by the&#xD;
      device could be employed as a monitoring device in the post-operative period after&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery. The MI device's detection of specific optical properties of a tissue&#xD;
      flap could also potentially be used as a diagnostic tool to predict the likelihood of the&#xD;
      development of fat necrosis or flap atrophy in a delayed fashion several months after&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior animal and clinical studies using similar devices have demonstrated that changes in the&#xD;
      total hemoglobin concentration and percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin in the tissue transfer&#xD;
      flap can be used to differentiate between arterial and venous occlusion. These other similar&#xD;
      devices have been shown to be able to detect venous occlusion prior to clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of venous occlusion using standard monitoring methods. This early detection of&#xD;
      venous occlusion has important implications. It is well established that early detection and&#xD;
      surgical re-exploration and correction of venous occlusion is associated with improved&#xD;
      survival and salvage rates of tissue transfer flaps. It has been suggested in the&#xD;
      reconstructive literature that the development of fat necrosis and flap atrophy are caused by&#xD;
      a relative arterial or venous insufficiency, which could be detected using the MI device&#xD;
      prior to the clinical manifestations of these complications.Patients undergoing&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery at UCI Medical Center will be recruited for enrollment into the study.&#xD;
      The study design requires following the patients and review their medical records in order to&#xD;
      determine the clinical outcomes of their reconstructive surgery. The process of review of the&#xD;
      medical record will require the review of both the in-patient medical record during the&#xD;
      hospitalization in which the reconstructive surgery takes place and the outpatient medical&#xD;
      record after surgery in order to observe for the possible development of the acute and&#xD;
      delayed complications of reconstructive surgery.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a safe, non-contact, intra-operative &amp; post-operative device, which can be&#xD;
           used as an adjunct to the clinical evaluation of tissue transfer flaps after&#xD;
           reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop an adjunctive device that can reliably detect and distinguish arterial and&#xD;
           venous occlusion before the clinical manifestations of such occlusions, and thus provide&#xD;
           the scientific basis for future studies which may use the device to potentially improve&#xD;
           the salvage rates after re-exploration for such complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate if changes in the optical properties of tissue transfer flaps during the&#xD;
           immediate post-operative period can be used to predict the development of late&#xD;
           complications of tissue transfer flaps, such as the development of fat necrosis and/or&#xD;
           flap atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To record intra-operative and post-operative images of pedicle and free tissue transfer&#xD;
           flaps used in reconstructive surgery with a device that shines low energy near infrared&#xD;
           light that is spatially modulated into a sinusoidal configuration of amplitude called&#xD;
           Modulated Imaging (MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study if the MI device described above is able to collect data regarding the optical&#xD;
           properties of the tissue transfer flaps, which can then be used to detect acute&#xD;
           post-operative occlusion of the artery or of the vein going to and from the tissue&#xD;
           transfer flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study if there is a correlation between the immediate post-operative optical&#xD;
           properties of tissue transfer flaps and the development of late complications such as&#xD;
           fat necrosis and flap atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior authors have demonstrated that tissue spectroscopy can be used in both animal &amp;&#xD;
           human experiments to detect and differentiate between tissue transfer flaps with&#xD;
           adequate vascular supply vs. flaps with either artery and/or vein occlusions prior to&#xD;
           the detection of such complications using standard clinical observation during the&#xD;
           post-operative period. These authors demonstrated that detection of the changes from&#xD;
           baseline values in the post-operative period of the total hemoglobin [Hb-total],&#xD;
           deoxygenated hemoglobin [Hb-deoxy], and oxygenated hemoglobin [Hb-O2] concentrations&#xD;
           using tissue spectroscopy correlated with the clinical development of arterial or venous&#xD;
           occlusion. 1,2 As the MI device developed at the Beckman Laser Institute has been&#xD;
           demonstrated to be able to detect the [Hb-total], [Hb-deoxy] and [Hb-O2] as well as the&#xD;
           concentration of water,[H2O] in a non-contact manner; we believe the MI device will also&#xD;
           be able to detect development of arterial and/ or venous occlusion in tissue transfer&#xD;
           flaps without requiring direct tissue contact with a tissue spectroscopy device, as was&#xD;
           the case with the instruments used by other authors.3, 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There are higher rates of fat necrosis and flap atrophy that occur after specific types&#xD;
           of free tissue transfer flaps, [i.e., higher rates occur with Deep Inferior Epigastric&#xD;
           Perforator (DIEP) flaps vs. Transverse Rectus Abdominis (TRAM) flaps.5, 6 Some authors&#xD;
           have suggested that early flap congestion and the development of late fat necrosis may&#xD;
           be due to venous insufficiency, without complete venous occlusion 7. We hypothesize that&#xD;
           early post-operative changes in the flap's optical properties may be used to predict the&#xD;
           development of late complications such as fat necrosis and flap atrophy, as these&#xD;
           complications are thought to be due to a relative arterial and/or venous insufficiency&#xD;
           to the tissue transfer flap; and thus should be reflected in the tissue's optical&#xD;
           properties as detected by the MI device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The use of tissue pedicle and free tissue transfer flaps allows for increased&#xD;
      reconstructive possibilities for patients that have had disfigurement or loss of function&#xD;
      after trauma or oncological surgical resection. Generally, the process of creating a pedicle&#xD;
      tissue transfer flap involves the isolation of tissues onto a single artery and vein and then&#xD;
      rotating this tissue from the donor site to the site requiring reconstruction. A free tissue&#xD;
      transfer flap involves a process similar to the creation of a pedicle flap except that the&#xD;
      artery and vein going to the flap's tissues are divided and re-implanted at the site of&#xD;
      reconstruction. This process of using tissue transfer flaps however has known complications,&#xD;
      including acute complications such as arterial or venous occlusion and late complications&#xD;
      such as the development of fat necrosis and flap atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute complications involving the vascular structures of the flap can be either partial or&#xD;
      complete occlusion of the artery or vein going to and from the tissue flap. Both pedicle and&#xD;
      free tissue transfer flaps can develop severe complications if either the artery or vein is&#xD;
      compromised, including complete death of the tissue in the flap. If the vascular structures&#xD;
      going to the flap(s) are compromised then the tissues used for reconstructive surgery may&#xD;
      undergo damage. This tissue damage can become extensive and result in the loss of part or the&#xD;
      entire tissue mass in the tissue transfer flap, which in turn can result in increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality to the patient. In the reconstructive surgery literature, it has been&#xD;
      shown that frequent monitoring during the first 48-72 hours after reconstructive surgery&#xD;
      allows for early detection and intervention when a vascular compromised flap occurs. This&#xD;
      earlier detection then can translate into earlier interventions including surgical&#xD;
      re-exploration, which has been shown to improve the salvage rates of vascular compromise of&#xD;
      the tissue transfer flaps.8, 9 It is generally known that venous thrombosis has a worse&#xD;
      out-come, when compared to arterial thrombosis after surgical re-exploration and&#xD;
      reestablishment of blood flow. This difference between arterial and venous thrombosis is&#xD;
      thought to be due to the differences in the pathophysiology involved in venous congestion. In&#xD;
      venous thrombosis tissue fluid content is increased due to initially continued arterial&#xD;
      inflow, thus when venous out-flow is re-established the tissue edema continues to inhibit the&#xD;
      diffusion of oxygen through the interstitial space from the capillaries to the tissue cells&#xD;
      in the vascular beds were edema remains. The fact that venous thrombosis is more difficult to&#xD;
      clinically detect early may also contribute to the poorer prognosis associated with venous&#xD;
      thrombosis when compared to arterial thrombosis.10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the difficulty of early detection of venous thrombosis, and of the decreased rates of&#xD;
      successful salvage after surgical re-exploration for venous thrombosis, authors have employed&#xD;
      successfully the use of tissue spectroscopy to detect venous thrombosis several hours before&#xD;
      the clinical manifestations of thrombosis 2. These authors employed a spectroscopy device,&#xD;
      which requires direct contact with the tissues being evaluated and only provided a small&#xD;
      surface area in which the tissue flap's optical properties were measured. The device,&#xD;
      however, is able to provide both diffuse optical tomography and rapid wide-field quantitative&#xD;
      mapping of the tissue's optical properties in a single measurement platform through a device&#xD;
      that does not require direct contact with the tissues being evaluated 3, 11. As theMI device&#xD;
      is a new novel device developed at the Beckman laser Institute and has not been used to&#xD;
      evaluate human tissue transfer flaps this would be a pilot study. This pilot study would seek&#xD;
      to determine if this specific device is also able to detect vascular occlusion prior to&#xD;
      clinical detection of such occlusion, as well as to differentiate between arterial and venous&#xD;
      occlusions in a similar manner to other devices used by other authors, which employed tissue&#xD;
      spectroscopy to monitor tissue transfer flaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, delayed complications can develop after tissue transfer flaps are used in&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery, which include fat necrosis and flap atrophy. These late complications&#xD;
      are thought to be caused by a relative vascular insufficiency supplying the flaps. It is&#xD;
      proposed that the increased venous congestion and increased rates of fat necrosis with the&#xD;
      use of DIEP flaps when compared to TRAM flaps in breast reconstruction is due to a relative&#xD;
      venous insufficiency that is not diminished enough to cause flap loss, but is on occasion&#xD;
      great enough to result in the development of fat necrosis 7. The late development of flap&#xD;
      atrophy may also be due to a relative arterial or venous insufficiency that occurs at the&#xD;
      time of surgical reconstruction, and results in a relative global tissue flap ischemia&#xD;
      leading to the development of flap atrophy. One of the goals of this experiment is to&#xD;
      determine if any characteristic of the optical properties in a tissue transfer flap in the&#xD;
      near post-operative setting can predict the development of either fat necrosis or flap&#xD;
      atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MI device is a novel unique device when compared to other spectroscopic devices used to&#xD;
      study tissue transfer flaps. MI uses a non-contact optical imaging technology developed at&#xD;
      the Beckman Laser Institute that has the unique capability of performing both diffuse optical&#xD;
      tomography and rapid, wide-field quantitative mapping of tissue optical properties within a&#xD;
      single measurement platform. While other non-contact spectroscopic devices use a&#xD;
      time-modulation methods, MI alternatively uses spatially modulated illumination for imaging&#xD;
      of tissue constituents. The MI system consists of 1) a light projection system that&#xD;
      illuminates the tissue with spatial sinusoid patterns, and 2) a CCD camera, which collects&#xD;
      the diffusely reflected light in a non-contact geometry. The wavelength of illumination can&#xD;
      be selected by bandpass filtering of a broadband source (i.e. tungsten lamp), or by use of a&#xD;
      monochromatic source (i.e. laser diode). Lastly, tissue fluorescence measurements can be&#xD;
      performed by placing a combination of source-blocking and bandpass emission filters in front&#xD;
      of the camera. 3, 11&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diffusely reflected amplitude of the modulated wave carries both optical property&#xD;
      (absorption, fluorescence, scattering) and depth information. Specifically, the sampling&#xD;
      depth of the spatially modulated wave is a function of the frequency of illumination and the&#xD;
      tissue optical properties. This shares many analogies to the broadband frequency-domain&#xD;
      photon migration (FDPM) approach. {12, 13} Consequently, measurement of multiple spatial&#xD;
      frequencies (periodicities) allows MI to perform two functions. First, use of a wide range of&#xD;
      frequency patterns allows depth-selective imaging and thus tomography of the internal 3D&#xD;
      tissue structure. Secondly, it can rapidly and quantitatively map optical absorption,&#xD;
      fluorescence yield, and scattering coefficients in near-real time, with high resolution and&#xD;
      over a wide field-of-view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to separate optical absorption from scattering distinguishes MI from conventional&#xD;
      planar reflectance imaging methods. Absorption and scattering maps can be used to&#xD;
      characterize the tissue's biochemical composition and structure. We have shown that these&#xD;
      intrinsic tissue contrast elements vary with tissue types, and their wavelength dependence&#xD;
      provides spectral &quot;fingerprinting&quot; that can be used to delineate the spatial relationships&#xD;
      among tissues with different optical properties and can be used to determine the amount of&#xD;
      H2O, [Hb-total], [Hb-deoxy], [Hb-O2] &amp; Tissue Oxygen Saturation [StO2]. MI is able to detect&#xD;
      the concentration of [Hb-total], [Hb-deoxy] &amp; [Hb-O2] in absolute amounts in units of&#xD;
      millimoles / unit volume of tissue measured. MI is also able to determine the percent&#xD;
      fraction of mass, which is comprised of H2O in terms of percent mass.11, 14. This feature is&#xD;
      critical to the performance of MI as a quantitative diagnostic method and, when combined with&#xD;
      its tomographic capabilities, underscores the uniqueness of the method, and its potential use&#xD;
      as a monitoring and diagnostic device to evaluate tissue transfer flaps after reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
