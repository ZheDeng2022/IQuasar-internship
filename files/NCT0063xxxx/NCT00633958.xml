  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In spite of numerous advances in neuroimaging techniques, the diagnosis of pediatric brain&#xD;
      tumors relies on the pathologic evaluation of material obtained at the time of the initial&#xD;
      operation. While 18F-FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) helps identify higher-grade&#xD;
      lesions due to their increased glucose metabolism, the high tracer uptake of the normal&#xD;
      adjacent brains makes this modality of limited value. Fluorine-18 fluorothymidine (FLT) is a&#xD;
      new imaging agent that has two significant advantages in the imaging of CNS tumors. First,&#xD;
      this agent detects cellular proliferation directly, and second, the normal brain does not&#xD;
      take up the agent, making a positive area(s) easy to identify. Before embarking on a large&#xD;
      pediatric disease stratified assessment of FLT imaging in pediatric neurooncology patients,&#xD;
      the investigators are proposing a limited patient pilot study to evaluate the&#xD;
      biodistribution, dosimetry and specificity of this compound when compared to&#xD;
      immunohistochemical assessment of mitotic activity in newly diagnosed patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgical resection.&#xD;

      Patients will undergo standard pre-diagnostic imaging of the sites of disease using standard&#xD;
      MRI techniques. If disease is suspected in both the brain and spine, then both imaging&#xD;
      modalities should be obtained. This imaging should be obtained no more than 21 days before&#xD;
      surgical resection. As close as possible to the completion of the MRI scans, patients will&#xD;
      undergo 18F-FLT imaging using a single administration of tracer, and PET image acquisition at&#xD;
      four different time points (baseline, 1 hr post injection, 2 hrs post injection and 4-6 hours&#xD;
      post injection). A whole body PET scan (top of the head to mid thigh) will be performed&#xD;
      immediately after injection (PET acquisition #1). These data will be acquired with a 2 minute&#xD;
      emission and a 2 minute transmission scan at each bed position. Following this acquisition,&#xD;
      the subject will empty his or her bladder. At 45 minutes post-injection, a brain and/or spine&#xD;
      (body) PET scan will be acquired with a 10 min emission scan and a 5 min transmission scan&#xD;
      (PET acquisition #2). This scan will include all areas of suspected tumor (brain, spine, or&#xD;
      brain and spine). Following PET acquisition #2, a whole body PET scan will be acquired&#xD;
      according to the same protocol as above (PET acquisition #3). If possible, a final whole body&#xD;
      scan will be acquired 4-6 h post-injection (PET acquisition #4). All PET acquisitions will be&#xD;
      acquired in 3D mode and reconstructed with the FORE re-binned OSEM algorithm with measured&#xD;
      attenuation correction. Blood samples will be obtained at the completion of each whole body&#xD;
      scan. Patients will receive the dose of 18F-FLT through a fresh intravenous catheter as per&#xD;
      standard PET procedures. Patients will then undergo maximal surgical resection. Pieces from&#xD;
      different areas of the tumor will be marked for correlation to imaging studies when possible.&#xD;
      Tumor samples will undergo standard immunohistochemical analysis for cellular activation&#xD;
      including mitotic index and MIB-1 proliferation staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial blood draws will also be obtained at four different time points (baseline, 1 hr post&#xD;
      injection, 2 hrs post injection, and 4-6 hours post injection) to evaluate clearance of&#xD;
      18F-FLT from the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the biodistribution, the 3D regions of interest (ROIs) will be drawn about each major&#xD;
      organ that is identified on the whole body scans. This will be performed on each of the whole&#xD;
      body scans and a time activity curve will be generated. The residence time for each organ&#xD;
      will be determined. The blood data will be pipetted and counted for estimates of activity in&#xD;
      the blood and bone marrow. For the brain and/or spine images, the PET data will be registered&#xD;
      to the subjects' MRI. The PET scan will be graded on a subjective 4-point scale. 3D ROIs will&#xD;
      be drawn around the tumor. In addition, an analogous ROI will be drawn in normal brain&#xD;
      background and about the whole brain for comparison. For the tumor, tumor-to-background,&#xD;
      tumor-to-whole brain ratios will be determined. In addition, standard uptake values (SUVs)&#xD;
      will be determined for the tumor and background.&#xD;
