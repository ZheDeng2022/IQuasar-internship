    <textblock>
      This study consists of two periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Run-in Period (7-14 days): During the Run-in Period, subjects will maintain their&#xD;
           current inhaled short-acting B2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapies. All&#xD;
           long-acting b-agonists (LABA) will be prohibited and replaced with a short-acting&#xD;
           B2-agonist (Ventolin-HFA) and an inhaled corticosteroid, for a minimum of 7 days. Such&#xD;
           LABA replacement therapy is not considered as violation of the asthma stability. The&#xD;
           current orally inhaled corticosteroids may be maintained at the prescribed dosing&#xD;
           regimen. All concomitant medications must be compliant or adjusted to the restrictions&#xD;
           and washout time limits per Appendix II. Subjects will document their daily asthma&#xD;
           symptom scores, treatment regimens, concomitant medications, PEF records, and adverse&#xD;
           events if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Period (4 wk): During the 4-week Study Period, subjects will be randomized into&#xD;
           one of the following 2 double-blinded treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment T (Albuterol-HFA, N=24): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 180 mcg&#xD;
                albuterol base), oral inhalation, QID;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment R (Proventil-HFA, N=24): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 180 mcg&#xD;
                albuterol base), oral inhalation, QID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Study Period, subjects will document their daily asthma symptom scores, treatment&#xD;
      regimens, concomitant medications, PEF records, and adverse events if any. Three Clinical&#xD;
      Visits are to be conducted, for measurement of treatment efficacy with serial spirometry (at&#xD;
      Clinical Visit 1 and 3); for monitoring safety and compliance (at Clinical Visit 1, 2 and 3);&#xD;
      and for evaluating pharmacokinetic profiles in part of the study population (greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 6 subjects per Arm) using a population PK approach (PPK) with a sparse blood&#xD;
      sampling regimen (at Clinical Visit 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sufficient enrollment will be planned to obtain 48 subjects as &quot;Per protocol population&quot;,&#xD;
      with 24 in Albuterol-HFA (Arm T) and 24 in the Proventil-HFA (Arm R). Qualified subjects&#xD;
      should be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male and female patients aged 4 - 11 years (upon screening), and female patients being&#xD;
           premenarchal upon Visit-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. With documented mild-to-moderate asthma for at least 6 months prior to screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Being able to reliably perform spirometric FEV1 test;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Consent, under supervision of a parent or a legal guardian, to participate in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Having a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) that is 50.0%-100.0% of&#xD;
           predicted values at screening (Screening Baseline FEV1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Demonstrating a greater than or equal to 12.0% FEV1 reversibility in the Reversibility&#xD;
           Test, at 30 min after inhaling 180 mcg of Ventolin-HFA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Satisfying the criterion of asthma stability, defined as no significant changes in&#xD;
           asthma therapy and no asthma-related hospitalization or emergency visits, over 4 weeks&#xD;
           prior to the screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Satisfying the Run-in Period requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Satisfying all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, as specified in Section 4.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT REGIMENS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive one of the 2 double-blinded treatments:&#xD;
      Albuterol-HFA (Treatment T) or Proventil-HFA (Treatment R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL VISITS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study consists of a Screening Period, a Run-in Period, and a Study Period which&#xD;
      consists of three (3) Clinical Visits. The three (3) Clinical Visits are scheduled with 14±3&#xD;
      days intervals, as Visit 1 (Day 0 of treatment), Visit 2 (Day 14), and Visit 3 (Day 28). The&#xD;
      Clinical Visit 1 will be held within 7-14 days after Screening Visit. Serial FEV1 are&#xD;
      performed at Visit 1 and 3. Safety and compliance are evaluated at all 3 Visits. Population&#xD;
      PK (PPK) blood sampling is conducted at Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGIES AND SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Forced Expiratory Volume at 1st Second (FEV1)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Spirometry is to be used to determine Forced Expiratory Volume in the 1st second (FEV1).&#xD;
           Patient may choose either a standing or a sitting position for FEV1. The position, once&#xD;
           chosen, should be kept consistent for the entire study. Nose clips will be worn for the&#xD;
           FEV1 measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each FEV1 is measured in triplicate at a given test or a given time point. The highest&#xD;
           FEV1 volume, from the triplicate attempts, is used as the representative value. The&#xD;
           highest and second highest FEV1 attempts should not differ by greater than 0.2 L. Up to&#xD;
           2 additional attempts may be measured if necessary, with a total of 3-5 attempts allowed&#xD;
           for a given test. The accepted attempts have to be technically conforming to the current&#xD;
           spirometry standards from the American Thoracic Society (ATS). The current clinical&#xD;
           normative lung volumes in conformity with the ATS guidelines will be used for&#xD;
           calculating the predicted percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEF will be measured as a means of monitoring safety and asthma control. PEF will be measured&#xD;
      in triplicate, with additional attempts if necessary. The highest PEF volume is used as the&#xD;
      representative value. Two measurements of PEF are made daily, once prior to the first AM dose&#xD;
      and once prior to the last PM dose of the study drug. Subject will be standing for PEF&#xD;
      measurements. No nose-clips will be needed for PEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Screening Baseline FEV1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passing the Screening Baseline FEV1 test is one of the prerequisites for enrollment, and is&#xD;
      to be conducted at the Screening Visit by all subjects. The Screening Baseline FEV1 should&#xD;
      fall within 50.0%-100.0% of the predicted value to qualify the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Reversibility FEV1 Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reversibility FEV1 Test will be performed at the Screening Visit. Within 30 min after the&#xD;
      Screening Baseline FEV1 is obtained, the subject will self-administer 180 to 360 mcg&#xD;
      Ventolin-HFA (2-4 inhalations). To qualify for the study, the subject needs to demonstrate an&#xD;
      FEV1 reversibility of greater than or equal to 12.0%, from the (same-day) Screening Baseline&#xD;
      FEV1, with 3 to 8 attempts, at 30 min after inhaling Ventolin-HFA. Reversibility is defined&#xD;
      as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      % Reversibility = [(FEV1 postdose ~ FEV1 predose)/FEV1 predose] x 100%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to two-time re-tests of the Reversibility FEV1 Test will be allowed if the highest&#xD;
      attempted reversibility value is less than 12.0% but greater than or equal to 6.0, if deemed&#xD;
      necessary by the investigator, with screening period extendable to a total of 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Serial FEV1 measurements of study drug efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to the study drugs (T and R) is examined by serial spirometric measurements of FEV1&#xD;
      post-dose. Serial FEV1 will be conducted at each of the following time points during Study&#xD;
      Visits 1 and 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. at baseline (within 30 minutes prior to study drug dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. at 10, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION PHARMACOKINETIC (PPK) EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      At clinical Visit 3, a sufficient number of patients will be subject to a population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PPK) study to obtain a minimum of 6 subjects per arm with complete and&#xD;
      correct 4 PK samples. An indwelling IV catheter may be used, as an alternative to repeated&#xD;
      venipunctures, for PPK samples. An appropriate anticoagulant may be used to maintain the&#xD;
      catheter patency. Four blood samples (~5.0 mL each) will be taken from a hand or forearm vein&#xD;
      of the subject, at pre-scheduled 4 time points: 2, 4, 6 and 8 hr post-dose (each with a ±15&#xD;
      min window). No inhalation of the study drug or rescue medication should take place until&#xD;
      completion of the 8-hr PK sampling, unless needed for rescue, at which point the subject will&#xD;
      not be considered evaluable for the PK endpoint.&#xD;
