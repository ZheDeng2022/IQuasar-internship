  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to test the performance of a novel optical imaging system for&#xD;
      real-time quantitative imaging of brain function through multiple hemodynamic measures during&#xD;
      neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study encompasses two sub-aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the ability of laser speckle contrast imaging to image cerebral blood flow&#xD;
           (CBF) intraoperatively. We will image the changes in CBF in response to somatosensory&#xD;
           stimulation. (5 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simultaneously image hemoglobin oxygenation, blood volume, blood flow, and cerebral&#xD;
           metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) changes during somatosensory stimulation using a&#xD;
           combined laser speckle and multi-wavelength reflectance imaging system. (5 patients).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A speckle-contrast imaging camera uses a low-power laser to check brain activity. The imaging&#xD;
      camera uses reflected red light to take a special kind of picture of the amount of blood&#xD;
      flowing in your brain, and the amount of oxygen in your blood. This is the first time this&#xD;
      device has been used in brain surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While &quot;asleep&quot; under anesthesia during an already scheduled surgery, the neurosurgeon will&#xD;
      position the microscope to take pictures of the surgery area. The pictures will be taken&#xD;
      after the brain is exposed, but before the rest of the surgery takes place. Researchers will&#xD;
      shine the red light onto the brain during your surgery. The light will then be seen by the&#xD;
      camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Cortical mapping&quot; will done, which is an established procedure used to detect important&#xD;
      areas of the brain. Usually, a nerve in the wrist is stimulated with a very small shock of&#xD;
      electricity and a response is detected in the brain by an electrode placed on the surface.&#xD;
      The electrical shock administered is not dangerous or painful. It will be given while&#xD;
      &quot;asleep.&quot; For the experimental procedure used in this study, the same stimulation will be&#xD;
      used, but the impulse detection will be performed using the speckle-contrast imaging camera.&#xD;
      Researchers hope to see if the change in blood flow gives the same information as if the&#xD;
      electrode was placed on the brain and used to detect the electricity. Doing both procedures&#xD;
      is expected to take no more than 20 minutes. During this time, continual monitoring done by&#xD;
      the surgeon and operating room staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will end when the surgery is finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will not be used by the surgeon during your surgery or any future&#xD;
      treatments. These measurements are being done for research only and will not be used by the&#xD;
      surgeon to make any decisions about your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. This device is investigational and has not been approved by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but it has been declared safe by the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health. Up to 10 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at&#xD;
      M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Location of planned resection near somatosensory cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Planned intraoperative electrocortical mapping.&#xD;

          3. Able to render written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a hemiparesis graded 3/5 (active movement against gravity) or worse.&#xD;
             Unpublished data from MDACC Department of Neurosurgery suggests that cortical mapping&#xD;
             is ineffective in these patients because an adequate cortical response is not detected&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a vascular malformation within the proximity of the cortex area imaged.&#xD;
