  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MT110 is a bispecific (anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3) T-cell engager (BiTE) designed to link EpCAM&#xD;
      (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) expressing cells and T-cells resulting in T-cell&#xD;
      activation and a cytotoxic T-cell response against EpCAM+ cells. In vitro and ex-vivo data&#xD;
      indicate that EpCAM+ tumor cell lines are sensitive to MT110 mediated cytotoxicity.&#xD;
      Furthermore, data from in-vivo experiments with both MT110 and a mouse surrogate molecule&#xD;
      (muS110) have confirmed the activity of these molecules in inhibiting the formation of&#xD;
      metastases but also against established tumors. In vitro and ex-vivo data suggest that a&#xD;
      prolonged presence of the drug in target tissues may result in significant T-cell&#xD;
      recruitment, activation and expansion to/in target tissues, potentially resulting in&#xD;
      substantial anti-tumor activity in man.&#xD;
