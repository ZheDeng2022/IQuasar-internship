  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare effectiveness of intravenous magnesium sulfate to that of intravenous&#xD;
      metoclopramide (Reglan®) for acute headache in pregnant women. We will randomize pregnant&#xD;
      women who present to our emergency department with chief complaint of headache to magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate 2 grams intravenously or metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously; both groups will receive&#xD;
      acetaminophen (Tylenol®) 1 gram orally and normal saline 1 liter intravenously. Headaches are&#xD;
      common during pregnancy, related to hormonal changes, altered sleep patterns and psychosocial&#xD;
      stressors. Common medications for headache such as non-steroidal antiinflammatories or&#xD;
      triptans are typically avoided during pregnancy due to concern for fetal effects. Women, and&#xD;
      their physicians, are often uncertain regarding available medication options with justifiable&#xD;
      safety profiles during pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metoclopramide and prochlorperazine (Compazine®), antiemetic dopamine receptor antagonists,&#xD;
      are widely used for headache treatment in North American emergency departments.&#xD;
      Metoclopramide, FDA pregnancy category B, is used in clinical practice for acute headache in&#xD;
      pregnant women. Small studies have found magnesium sulfate to be effective in migraine,&#xD;
      tension and cluster headaches, although there is no data regarding efficacy or tolerability&#xD;
      in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study would be similar to a Turkish study published in 2004 which compared magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate to metoclopramide for acute headache treatment in nonpregnant individuals; they found&#xD;
      the drugs equally effective 30 minutes after administration. Serum magnesium levels in&#xD;
      pregnant women are often lower than in nonpregnant women; magnesium deficiency has been&#xD;
      explored as contributing to headache frequency and severity. Magnesium sulfate use has been&#xD;
      well established during pregnancy for decades, administered intravenously to delay labor or&#xD;
      to women with preeclampsia for 24 to 48 hours, initially with 4 to 6 gram bolus then 2 grams&#xD;
      per hour. For headache treatment, magnesium sulfate dose would be far lower, 2 grams. We&#xD;
      would like to determine the efficacy and tolerability of magnesium sulfate for headache&#xD;
      relief in pregnant women, as well as evaluate efficacy of metoclopramide in pregnant women.&#xD;
      We do not find published randomized trials evaluating headache treatment in pregnant women.&#xD;
