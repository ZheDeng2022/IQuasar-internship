  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of&#xD;
      atorvastatin (Lipitor) may prevent breast cancer. This randomized phase I trial is studying&#xD;
      the best dose of atorvastatin in preventing breast cancer in women at increased risk for&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the minimum biological effective dose (MBED) of atorvastatin required to&#xD;
      induce modulation in the proliferation marker, Ki-67, in breast tissue of women who are at&#xD;
      high risk to develop breast cancer. We will evaluate pre- and post atorvastatin treatment (4&#xD;
      dose levels) expression of Ki-67 in samples obtained via FNA from breast tissue of women at&#xD;
      high risk for breast cancer. This specific aim tests the hypothesis that treatment with&#xD;
      atorvastatin will induce a decrease in Ki-67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate atorvastatin induced modulation of breast cancer biomarkers markers (EGFR,&#xD;
      P-EGFR, ER, p21, p27, bcl-2, CC3, cytology) and drug related markers (LXR, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      LDL, HDL, CRP) in women who are at high risk to develop breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine plasma and tissue levels of atorvastatin and two of its hydroxylated&#xD;
      metabolites (ohydroxyatorvastatin and p-hydroxyatorvastatin) in women who are treated with&#xD;
      atorvastatin and to correlate these levels with Ki-67 levels. III. To correlate changes in&#xD;
      Ki-67 and the above-described panel of biomarkers with HMG-CoA reductase genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants receive oral atorvastatin once daily for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants receive oral atorvastatin (at a higher dose than in arm I) once daily&#xD;
      for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Participants receive oral atorvastatin (at a higher dose than in arm II) once daily&#xD;
      for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV: Participants do not receive treatment. Participants undergo blood sample collection&#xD;
      and fine needle aspiration of breast tissue at baseline and at 3 months for correlative&#xD;
      biomarker studies.&#xD;

                  (LCIS) (per participating institution's pathology review), or ductal carcinoma in&#xD;
                  situ (participants could have received any type of surgery and radiation as long&#xD;
                  as they have an intact opposite breast)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must have been properly informed of the study and must sign an&#xD;
             informed consent to be able to be enrolled in the study; the informed consent document&#xD;
             must be signed, witnessed, and dated prior to start of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal physical exam and bilateral mammogram that shows no evidence of suspicious,&#xD;
             malignant disease, or uncharacterized lesions within last 12 months and no evidence of&#xD;
             any active other cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes greater than 3,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets greater than 100,000/uL&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  CPK, PTT, PT within normal institutional limits (up to 1 month prior to randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of atorvastatin on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control (IUD);&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her study physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any type of active invasive cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral mastectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of oral contraceptives; androgens; luteinizing-hormone-releasing-hormone (LHRH)&#xD;
             analogs, prolactin inhibitors, antiandrogens, tamoxifen, raloxifen, or aromatase&#xD;
             inhibitors; women who discontinue these drugs at least 3 months prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic medical condition that requires regular use of statins or steroids (unless&#xD;
             participants have discontinued these drugs 1 month prior to enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to atorvastatin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric condition, including history of clinical depression, or addictive disorder&#xD;
             that would preclude obtaining informed consent or would interfere with compliance;&#xD;
             uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because atorvastatin is a Class X agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with atorvastatin breast feeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with atorvastatin&#xD;
