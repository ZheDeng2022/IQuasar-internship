      1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Background: Dissociative Disorders are frequent, but poorly understood and&#xD;
                under-diagnosed [Foote et al., 2006; Spiegel, 2006], especially in psychiatric&#xD;
                emergency units [Lazignac et al., 2005]. The management of this is commonly mixed&#xD;
                up with psychotic, depressive and anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The treatment of the dissociative disorders remains controversial. The&#xD;
                psychotherapeutic guidelines proposed by International Society for the Study of&#xD;
                Dissociative Disorders (ISSD) were recently adapted for the French speaking users&#xD;
                [Damsa et al., 2005]. There is no consensus on which antipsychotic or&#xD;
                antidepressant would be preferable for those patients who suffer from dissociative&#xD;
                disorders, accompanied by depressive or psychotic symptoms. We have a very good&#xD;
                clinical experience with quetiapine and escitalopram for this specific group of&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Rationale for this study; Clinical [Lazignac et al., 2005] and neurobiological&#xD;
                [Kelley-Puskas et al., 2005] reviews on dissociative disorders emphasize the value&#xD;
                of a first open label study on the effects of specific combined psychotherapy and&#xD;
                pharmacotherapy in patients with dissociative disorders [Damsa et al., 2006].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The efficacy of specific combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in&#xD;
                     patients with dissociative disorders, in terms of favorable outcome (DES&#xD;
                     scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The efficacy of specific combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in&#xD;
                     patients with dissociative disorders, in terms of DES and CGI-I scales values.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The effects of the combined treatment on depressive features [Hamilton&#xD;
                     Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating&#xD;
                     Scale items for suicide (MADRS)].&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The occurrence of possible extra-pyramidal side effects (Barnes Akathisia and&#xD;
                     the Simpson and Angus Rating Scales).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The therapeutic alliance and clinical outcome (Helping Alliance Questionnaire&#xD;
                     of Luborsky), [Luborsky, 1976; Luborsky et al., 1996].&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The relationship between serum lipid levels and depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Tolerability and adverse effects of the quetiapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study design. Open single arm 'pilot' clinical trial in patients with dissociative&#xD;
                disorders, admitted to the psychiatric emergency unit of Geneva (general capacity:&#xD;
                20-30 patients/day). Patients will be interviewed according to Dissociative&#xD;
                Experiences Scale (DES) and, if their score is 30 or higher, the Structured&#xD;
                Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID) will be administered.&#xD;
                When the outcome on the SCID is positive, the patient can be included in the study.&#xD;
                The Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I), HDRS and the MADRS items&#xD;
                for suicide will be administered at entry and after 3 and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The patients will be treated by a psychiatrist who has experience with the use of&#xD;
                the specific combined treatment for dissociative disorders [Damsa et al., 2005].&#xD;
                The psychiatrist decides on the antidepressant/antipsychotic medication. In our&#xD;
                unit the first choice for this indication is quetiapine (400 mg/d) for&#xD;
                antipsychotic treatment, and escitalopram (10 mg/d) as antidepressant. The&#xD;
                quetiapine schedule is 50-100-200-300-400-600 mg/d (min. 300 mg), then 300-600&#xD;
                mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Therapeutic alliance will be assessed, both by the patient and the therapist&#xD;
                (Luborsky scales) at the end of the first interview, and at 3 and 8 weeks. Serum&#xD;
                lipids levels will be measured in blood samples [Agargun et al., 2004].&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Selection of study population&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Inclusion criteria: written informed consent, DES-score greater than 30 and&#xD;

                     with the study requirements, good physical health (medical history and&#xD;
                     physical examination). Female patients of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
                     negative urinary pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Exclusion criteria: pregnancy/lactation, suicidal behavior requiring&#xD;
                     hospitalization or borderline personality disorder, substance dependence,&#xD;
                     psychotropic or cholesterol-lowering medication, intolerance or lack of&#xD;
                     response to the study medication, unstable or inadequately treated medical&#xD;
                     illness (angina pectoris, hypertension, congestive heart failure), involvement&#xD;
                     in the planning and conduct of the study, participation in the present study&#xD;
                     or in another drug trial within 4 weeks prior enrolment in study or longer in&#xD;
                     accordance with local requirements, cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors and&#xD;
                     inducers, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) equal or less than 1.5 x 109/L,&#xD;
                     unstable Diabetes Mellitus (DM) or opposition of physician responsible for&#xD;
                     patient's DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Discontinuation of subjects from participation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Criteria: subject free withdrawal at any time, safety reasons, severe&#xD;
                     non-compliance to protocol, subject lost to follow-up, development or discover&#xD;

                     Event (AE) specially assessed].&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Procedures: subjects who discontinue will be asked on reason for&#xD;
                     discontinuation. If possible, they should be assessed by investigator. The&#xD;
                     investigational medication will be returned by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Identity of investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Doses and treatment regimens quetiapine will be used, only if patients need an&#xD;
                     antipsychotic. Escitalopram (10 mg/day) will be used, only if patients need an&#xD;
                     antidepressant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Labeling of medication is in local language and complies with local regulatory&#xD;
           requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The administration of investigational and other medication must be recorded the&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  CGI-I score at 3 and 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Barnes Akathisia and Simpson-Angus Rating Scales, Helping Alliance&#xD;
                     Questionnaire of Luborsky, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and&#xD;
                     Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale items for suicide (from baseline to&#xD;
                     3 and 8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Cortisol and Lipids&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Adverse Events&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  Partial remission (at least 15% reduction of CGI scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Safety measurements and variables: Cardiac frequency and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. DATA MANAGEMENT. The data will be confidentially treated and will be kept in a locked&#xD;
           room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Description of analysis populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The safety population consists of all patients who have taken at least one&#xD;
                     quetiapine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The intention-to-treat (ITT) population consists of all patients who have&#xD;
                     taken at least one quetiapine dose and who have at least one baseline&#xD;
                     assessment and one post-baseline DES assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The Per-Protocol (PP) population is a subset of the ITT population, and&#xD;
                     consists of patients who have no major protocol violations or deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Each patient will represent one observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The primary variable: proportion of patients who experience at least 20% DES&#xD;
                     score reduction at 8 weeks for 95 % confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  the change in DES score, in SAS, BARS, HAM-D and Luborsky scales and in CGI-I&#xD;
                     will be analyzed by a model of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Changes in MADRS suicidal items scores will be illustrated by descriptive&#xD;
                     statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The relationship between therapeutic alliance and clinical outcome and between&#xD;
                     serum lipid levels and suicidal behavior will be analyzed by repeated measures&#xD;
                     ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The DES score will be dichotomized into less than 25 and equal or greater than&#xD;
                     25 and presented in frequency tables for each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Changes in physical examination values and laboratory values will be shown in&#xD;
                     shift tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Adverse events will be summarized and shown in frequency tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Determination of sample size: As this is a single-arm, open labeled pilot study, no&#xD;
                formal sample size calculation is performed. In the expected sample size of 30&#xD;
                patients, for the proportion of patients achieving a 20% reduction in DES score,&#xD;
                the confidence interval can be estimated between -18 and +18%; the drop-out&#xD;
                patients will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. ETHICS The study protocol, including the Informed Consent Form, was approved by the&#xD;
           local IRB Ethical committee and by the Swiss Medic Authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The principal investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment&#xD;
           to the protocol in accordance with local requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles of the Declaration of&#xD;
           Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, and with local regulatory&#xD;
           requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed consent: The principal investigator at each centre will ensure that the subject&#xD;
           is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose,&#xD;
           possible risk and benefit of the study. Subjects must also be notified that they are&#xD;
           free to discontinue from the study at any time. The subject should be given the&#xD;
           opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           No study specific procedures or investigations will be performed before the subject has&#xD;
           signed and dated the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The principal investigator(s) will store the original, signed Informed Consent Form. A&#xD;
           copy of the signed Informed Consent Form will be given to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE The study will be monitored by a designated&#xD;
           monitor and the investigator will permit trial related audits, IRB/IEC review and&#xD;
           regulatory inspection(s). The investigator will provide direct access to source&#xD;
           data/documents for all quality control activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. PUBLICATION POLICY Two months after study completion, abstracts for congresses and&#xD;
           presentations will be available. Four months after study completion, a first draft of&#xD;
           the manuscript will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. FINANCING AND INSURANCE Partial financed by AstraZeneca Insurance: Zürich Versicherung&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. PROCEDURES IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, OVERDOSE OR PREGNANCY Procedures in case of medical&#xD;
           emergency: The principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures and&#xD;
           expertise are available to handle medical emergencies during the study. A medical&#xD;
           emergency usually constitutes a SAE and should be reported as such, see Section 4.&#xD;
