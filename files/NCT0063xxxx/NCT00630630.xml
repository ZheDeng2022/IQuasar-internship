    <textblock>
      The relationship between hormone cycling/fluctuations and the occurrence of seizures in women&#xD;
      has received considerable discussion in the medical literature. This study investigated the&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of LEV treatment for subjects with catamenial exacerbation of&#xD;
      partial onset seizures.&#xD;

             compared to the luteal and follicular phases combined;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  concurrent C2 catamenial epilepsy, defined as a 70% increase in daily seizure average&#xD;
             during the ovulatory phase in comparison to the follicular and luteal phases combined,&#xD;
             was permitted;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  taking a minimum of one and a maximum of two antiepileptic drugs at a stable dose for&#xD;
