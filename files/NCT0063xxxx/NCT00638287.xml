      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the degree of variability in commercially&#xD;
      available assays for Growth Hormone measurement in the context of clinical decision making&#xD;
      for Growth Hormone (GH) deficiency and Acromegaly and to determine variability among IGF-I&#xD;
      inter-assay samples obtained at the time of Growth-Hormone Releasing Hormone Arginine Testing&#xD;
      and Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research will explore the variability of GH and IGF-1 measurements by commercially&#xD;
      available tests. The hypothesis is that the variability in GH and IGF-1 measurement will be&#xD;
      sizable enough that different conclusions would be drawn in patient case decision making in&#xD;
      the diagnosis and management of GH deficiency and acromegaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to correctly diagnose disorders of growth hormone secretion, either deficiency or&#xD;
      excess, it is necessary to have the accurate measurement of GH (growth hormone) serum and&#xD;
      Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, subjects will be asked to give the Investigators additional blood during&#xD;
      either an OGTT (a test for acromegaly) or a growth hormone stimulation test (GHRH-arginine&#xD;
      stimulation). Ordinarily, blood would be measured at the beginning and end of the OGTT, and&#xD;
      for the GHRH-arginine it would be measured one half hour before the test and then every half&#xD;
      hour for 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, subjects will provide us with additional blood at the times when blood is&#xD;
      drawn for the clinically-indicated tests. No additional needle sticks will be necessary and&#xD;
      taking the additional blood will not interfere with the clinical test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test we will be doing with the additional blood will be identical to the tests we&#xD;
      ordinarily do, but will be done by a different lab. We are testing to see if these results&#xD;
      would be the same as our usual lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 1) subjects with pituitary disease undergoing testing for&#xD;
      GH deficiency (GHRH arginine stimulation test), 2) subjects with suspicion of acromegaly&#xD;
      undergoing the oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), and 3) normal controls undergoing both the&#xD;
      GHRH Arginine test and the oGTT. Patients from all groups will have their blood drawn for the&#xD;
      measurement of IGF-1. The serum from each test will be aliquoted and sent to the designated&#xD;
      labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subject groups 1 and 2, this study poses no more than minimal risk, as it involves&#xD;
      procedures that do not go beyond clinical care. For healthy controls, we know that&#xD;
      participants will be asked to undergo testing that would not normally be required, and&#xD;
      therefore feel that the study poses more than minimal risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary endpoint research samples will be compared to samples sent to the usual&#xD;
      clinical lab, and diagnoses made based on research samples will be compared to clinical&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary endpoints, each result from a commercially available assay will be correlated&#xD;
      to another corresponding method of analysis of the same hormone from the same time point by&#xD;
      using the Bland-Altman analysis wherein the difference between two methods is compared to the&#xD;
      mean of the two methods. Each sample will be compared to the sample used for clinical&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from the medical records will be obtained and correlated with the lab test&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
