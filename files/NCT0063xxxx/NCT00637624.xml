    <textblock>
      In this study we want to investigate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is an&#xD;
      anti-oxidant, in the prevention of cisplatin-induced neural toxicity, in patients treated for&#xD;
      lung cancer with chemotherapy containing cisplatin.&#xD;

      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin (CDDP) is a major compound in chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and malignant mesothelioma. Cisplatin is&#xD;
      associated with a number of side-effects, one of which is neurotoxicity. For a number of&#xD;
      patients this neurotoxicity is a dose-limiting side-effect. At this point no measures are&#xD;
      taken to prevent the occurrence of neurotoxicity during treatment with cisplatin. Recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that the association of anti-oxidants to the treatment with cisplatin has&#xD;
      a neuroprotective effect without loss of anti-tumour efficacy of cisplatin. One of these&#xD;
      anti-oxidants is glutathione (GSH), this is a natural anti-oxidant that is synthesized in all&#xD;
      cells, mainly in the liver and the muscles. This GSH plays a central role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology (of efficacy and of side-effects) of cisplatin. We want to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which serves as a substrate for the synthesis of GSH, in&#xD;
      the prevention of cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective is to establish the neuroprotective efficacy of NAC against&#xD;
           cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. Mainly the sensory neuronal guidance will be assessed&#xD;
           before and after treatment with cisplatin in a group of patients receiving NAC compared&#xD;
           to a control-group receiving placebo. If peripheral neuropathy can't be measured,&#xD;
           neuropathy will be assessed as ototoxicity through measuring audiograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary objectives are establishing the protective effect of NAC regarding other&#xD;
           cisplatin-induced side-effects such as haematological pathology (anaemia, leucopenia,&#xD;
           thrombopenia, febrile neutropenia), loss of creatinine clearance and occurrence of&#xD;
           liver-chemistry abnormalities. Secondary objectives include also establishing the effect&#xD;
           on tumour response, clinical performance (Karnofsky performance index) and quality of&#xD;
           life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocenter, non-academical teaching hospital, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 Consecutive patients, who will receive at least 4 cycles of cisplatin in the treatment of&#xD;
      NSCLC, SCLC and malignant mesothelioma, will be admitted, irrespective of the disease stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a placebo-arm and a NAC-arm. They will receive&#xD;
      study-medication (NAC or placebo) intravenously every 3 weeks, each time 6 hours after the&#xD;
      completion of the cisplatin-infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Burdens: Patients will have to undergo three electromyographic (EMG) tests, which will&#xD;
           normally take place during the course of the whole treatment, therefore patients will&#xD;
           have to visit the hospital to be measured. To minimize this burden, the EMG-measurements&#xD;
           will be planned on the same day, the patient has to visit the hospital for reasons&#xD;
           regarding his/her regular chemotherapy-treatment. Only surface patch electrodes will be&#xD;
           used (no needle electrodes). All other information will be obtained from the patients'&#xD;
           files (blood samples, physic evaluations, etc) these are considered to be part of the&#xD;
           routines of treatment. When EMG's can not be measured, audiograms will be used, these&#xD;
           audiograms are also part of the routines of treatment, so are not considered an extra&#xD;
           burden. Patients will have to fill in Quality of Life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risks: NAC is a well known drug, used for over thirty years, that is well tolerated. For&#xD;
           intravenous NAC, allergic reactions have been reported. There is also a theoretical&#xD;
           risk, that NAC may reduce anti-tumour efficacy of cisplatin, this risk will be&#xD;
           theoretically ruled out by appropriate dosing of NAC. After inclusion of the first 30&#xD;
           patients an interim analysis will be performed regarding the tumour response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Benefits: NAC will possibly prevent the occurrence of neurotoxicity, improving quality&#xD;
           of life. This may, in turn, result in less probability of dose-reductions and of preterm&#xD;
           arrest of treatment.&#xD;
