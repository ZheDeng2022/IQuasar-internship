      Primary Objective: To examine the effects of an exercise training program on cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      fitness in early-stage postoperative non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine patients' adherence levels to such a program during adjuvant chemotherapy Explore&#xD;
      the effects of exercise training on treatment compliance and toxicity, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the effects of exercise training on markers of inflammation (e.g., c-reactive&#xD;
      protein, immune response) in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;

      Using a single-group, prospective design, potential participants will be identified and&#xD;
      screened for eligibility by the PI (LWJ) via medical record review of patients scheduled for&#xD;
      their primary adjuvant chemotherapy consultation at DUMC and Durham VA. As a routine part of&#xD;
      clinical care, during the treatment consultation the attending oncologist will perform a&#xD;
      physical examination to screen for cardiovascular risk factors, the results of which will be&#xD;
      recorded in the patients' medical records. Immediately following their consultation and&#xD;
      oncologist approval, potential participants will be provided with a thorough review of the&#xD;
      study by the principal investigator (LJ) and asked if they are willing to participate.&#xD;
      Interested participants will be given an information package that provides further&#xD;
      information on study participation. Two to five days following their treatment consultation&#xD;
      and prior to the initiation of chemotherapy, interested participants will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone by the PI to answer any questions and to schedule the baseline assessment visit. At&#xD;
      the baseline visit, participants will be asked to sign the informed consent and will be given&#xD;
      a copy for their records. After consent, they will be given a baseline ECG and physician&#xD;
      monitored cardiopulmonary exercise test (stress test) to screen for undiagnosed&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Following the successful completion of baseline assessments, all&#xD;
      participants will be scheduled for their initial exercise training session. Finally, on a&#xD;
      different group of patients we will perform a random retrospective medical chart review of 50&#xD;
      completely-resected NSCLC patients who received usual care (i.e., no exercise training)&#xD;
      during the study period to obtain comparative information on the treatment&#xD;
      toxicity/compliance rate. The chart review will be performed by Drs. Jones, Garst and&#xD;
      Crawford and will assess treatment toxicity and compliance over the entire course of adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
