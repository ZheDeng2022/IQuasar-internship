  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RAD001 in combination&#xD;
      with low-dose cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
      The secondary goals are to investigate the likely causes of drug response or failure.&#xD;

      A multicentre 2-stage Phase Ib/II trial of 5-Azacitidine combined with Everolimus for AML&#xD;
      patients over the age of 60 or relapsed AML over the age of 18. The MTD and DLT of&#xD;
      5-Azacitidine (7 doses over 9 days) given monthly combined with Everolimus orally for 17 days&#xD;
      (day 5-21) each month (1 cycle) for a minimum of 6 cycles and for at least 2 cycles beyond&#xD;
      achievement of CR and for a maximum of 12 cycles. Everolimus maintenance therapy alone may be&#xD;
      continued at investigator's discretion until either progressive disease or dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity. Groups of 3 patients will be entered at each dose level. Dose escalation/stopping&#xD;
      rules to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number in cohort experiencing DLT by day 42 Action 2/3 or 3/3 No further dose escalation.&#xD;
      Previous level is defined as MTD 0/3 Dose escalate to next level 1/3 Expand cohort to 6&#xD;
      patients 1/6 or 2/6 Dose escalate to next level &gt;2/6 No further dose escalation. Previous&#xD;
      level is defined as MTD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that if dose escalation is still indicated at the highest dose level, then the MTD is at&#xD;
      or above the last dose level. If the trial stops at the first dose, then the MTD is below the&#xD;
      first dose level. In either of the above cases, the MTD is not determined from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the maximum dose level has been identified, a dose expansion phase will continue&#xD;
      recruiting patients at the MTD until a total of 40 patients for the entire study is accrued.&#xD;

    <description>In this study, 5-azacitidine will be administered sc for 7 doses over 9 days in a 28 day cycle. Everolimus will be administered orally with the first dose starting on day 5 (first Friday) of each cycle and continued until day 21 of each cycle. Patients will be treated with combined azacitidine + Everolimus for a minimum of 6 cycles and until at least 2 cycles after documentation of CR. Upon cessation of azacitidine, the patient will be permitted to take Everolimus maintenance therapy until progression at the investigator's discretion.</description>
