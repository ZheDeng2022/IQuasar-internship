    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, registry of at least 11,000 (and up to 15,000) consecutive patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease undergoing stent-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) using DES without major procedural complications.&#xD;

      To determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the frequency, timing and correlates (clinical and angiographic) of drug-eluting stent&#xD;
           (DES) thrombosis in a patient population with few clinical and angiographic exclusion&#xD;
           criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the relationship of aspirin and/or clopidogrel hyporesponsiveness, and general platelet&#xD;
           reactivity to early and late DES thrombosis in separate phases stratified by whether the&#xD;
           patient is taking dual (aspirin plus clopidogrel) or single (aspirin alone) antiplatelet&#xD;
           therapy, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. combining the findings from the above 2 objectives, to identify a cohort representing a&#xD;
           significant proportion of all patients at increased risk to have early and/or late DES&#xD;
           stent thrombosis.&#xD;

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patient undergoing PCI in whom at least one DES is implanted and in whom PCI of all treated&#xD;
        lesions is successful (diameter stenosis &lt;30% with TIMI 3 flow in all treated lesions)&#xD;
        without major complications (defined as freedom from procedural death, intraprocedural&#xD;
        stent thrombosis, procedural myocardial infarction or sustained vessel closure, or need for&#xD;
        emergency bypass graft surgery).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients undergoing PCI in whom at least one DES is implanted and in whom PCI of all&#xD;
             treated lesions is successful (diameter stenosis &lt;30% with TIMI 3 flow in all treated&#xD;
             lesions) without major complications (defined as freedom from procedural death,&#xD;
             intra-procedural stent thrombosis, procedural myocardial infarction or sustained&#xD;
             vessel closure, or need for emergency bypass graft surgery). One or more bare metal&#xD;
             stents (BMS) may be implanted, and other lesions may be treated without stenting as&#xD;
             long as at least one DES is implanted. However, the procedure must be successful and&#xD;
             uncomplicated (as defined above) for all lesions (DES + BMS + non-stent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Aspirin use: Adequate aspirin loading given prior to PCI: at least 300 mg non enteric&#xD;
             coated oral aspirin at least 1 hour prior to the procedure or 324 mg chewed or 250 mg&#xD;
             IV aspirin at least 30 minutes prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has Hematocrit between 30 and 52% and Platelet Count greater than 100,000/µl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For US sites: Only FDA-approved DES stents may be used in this study. For OUS sites:&#xD;
             Only DES stents that are CE marked for approval may be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. PCI performed with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin, or bivalirudin as&#xD;
             the procedural antithrombin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient or guardian able to provide informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients in whom blood for Accumetrics VerifyNow platelet function testing cannot be&#xD;
             drawn after the minimum clopidogrel loading duration and Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa&#xD;
             inhibitor washout duration as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Clopidogrel loading: Clopidogrel loading pre PCI is recommended, but post PCI&#xD;
                  clopidogrel loading is acceptable per standard of care. In all patients (whether&#xD;
                  or not clopidogrel is initiated pre or post PCI), prior to blood drawing for&#xD;
                  VerifyNow platelet function testing, a 600 mg loading dose must have been given&#xD;
                  at least 6 hours prior, or a 300 mg loading dose must have been given at least 12&#xD;
                  hours prior, or the patient must have been maintained on at least 75 mg of&#xD;
                  clopidogrel daily for at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor washout: Eptifibatide or tirofiban must have been&#xD;
                  discontinued for at least 24 hours prior to VerifyNow platelet function testing.&#xD;
                  Abciximab must have been discontinued for at 10 days prior to VerifyNow platelet&#xD;
                  function testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability of the VerifyNow system to measure either Aspirin, P2Y12 or IIb/IIIa&#xD;
             platelet responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe allergy to stainless steel, contrast dye, all anti-thrombin agents&#xD;
             (unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin and bivalirudin), aspirin or&#xD;
             clopidogrel that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent enrollment in another trial that involves an investigational stent,&#xD;
             antithrombotic or antiplatelet agent. Patient in other investigational trials that&#xD;
             have not reached their primary endpoint may be enrolled in ADAPT-DES as long as the&#xD;
             other trials do not involve an investigational stent, antithrombotic or antiplatelet&#xD;
             agent and inclusion of such patient will have no effect on the endpoint of either&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients in whom bypass graft surgery is planned within 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with stent thrombosis before the performance of pre-discharge VerifyNow&#xD;
             platelet function testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients unwilling or unable to complete clinical follow-up for the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
