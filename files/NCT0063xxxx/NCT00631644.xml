  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the eating habits of adolescents and determine if eating behavior is&#xD;
      linked to genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adolescents between 13 and 17 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      come to the NIH Clinical Center at 8:00 AM to be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and brief physical examination, including height, weight, and body fat&#xD;
           measurements. Body fat is measured using a device called a Bod Pod. The adolescent sits&#xD;
           inside the device for about 5 minutes and the machine determines body fat by measuring&#xD;
           air movement. The adolescent must wear a tight-fitting swimsuit for this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test to look for sugar or protein in the urine and to test for pregnancy in&#xD;
           females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for routine chemistries and for gene studies related to eating behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires and interviews about the adolescent s general health and eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acclimatization to test meal conditions for the study. The adolescent is given a&#xD;
           breakfast shake to drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center at 10:30 AM for laboratory meal testing. At this&#xD;
      visit, the adolescent does the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eats food from a buffet of everyday foods that most kids eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fills out questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tastes and rates the flavor of a variety of snack foods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the eating behaviors that place adolescents at heightened risk for&#xD;
      overweight. In the proposed study, we aim to investigate the role that eating behaviors and&#xD;
      genes may play in the development of overweight. Participants will be adolescent girls and&#xD;
      boys from a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adolescents from the DC Metro community.&#xD;
      Adolescent eating behavior will be observed during laboratory test meals. Adolescents will be&#xD;
      provided with a large buffet of foods or a standard meal and instructed to eat until you are&#xD;
      no longer hungry. Thirty minutes later, they will taste and rate a variety of highly&#xD;
      palatable snack foods. Blood tests will be conducted to examine genes related to eating&#xD;
      behavior. Assessments also will include affective states, degree of hunger, degree of&#xD;
      fullness, body image satisfaction, disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, and measures of&#xD;
      interpersonal interactions.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify for participation in the study if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. &lt;TAB&gt;Age 13-17 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. &lt;TAB&gt;Good general health as indicated by medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. &lt;TAB&gt;Negative urine glucose and normal electrolytes, hepatic, and thyroid function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. &lt;TAB&gt;For the fMRI portion only: right handedness (required for standardization of&#xD;
             responses).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. &lt;TAB&gt;For the fMRI portion only: female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. &lt;TAB&gt;For the fMRI portion only: overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 85th&#xD;
             percentile for age and sex).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will be excluded if they have any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. &lt;TAB&gt;Medical problem likely to affect caloric intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. &lt;TAB&gt;History of any condition including psychiatric disorders in either child or their&#xD;
             responsible parent that in the opinion of the investigators would impede competence to&#xD;
             sign consent, interfere with adherence to procedures, or possibly hinder completion of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. &lt;TAB&gt;Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. &lt;TAB&gt;Use of medication likely to affect caloric intake.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. &lt;TAB&gt;For the fMRI portion only: braces (or other metal) that would interfere with the&#xD;
             fMRI procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. &lt;TAB&gt;For the fMRI portion only: non-native English speakers (required for&#xD;
