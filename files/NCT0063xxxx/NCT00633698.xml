  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipoprotein (Lp)(a) has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Niacin&#xD;
      has been shown to lower Lp(a) in patients with normal or moderately elevated levels. However,&#xD;
      there are few studies assessing the effectiveness of niacin in Lp(a) levels above 30 mg/dl.&#xD;
      In addition, most studies investigating the effectiveness of niacin have only included small&#xD;
      numbers of patients. Also, Lp(a) was only assessed as a secondary endpoint. The aim of the&#xD;
      present study was, therefore, to evaluate whether Niacin is effective compared to placebo in&#xD;
      the reduction of an elevated Lp(a).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, parallel group, phase III,&#xD;
      intervention study. Following randomisation at visit 1, subjects will receive 20 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with niacin or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is: niacin therapy effective in lowering elevated Lipoprotein (Lp)(a)&#xD;
      levels in comparison to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is based on the t test of equal means with unequal group size (ratio:&#xD;
      treatment group / control group = 2:1). The significance level is α=0.05 and the power 90%.&#xD;
      Assuming a drop-out rate of 20%, sample size is 100 in the niacin group and 50 in the placebo&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active ingredient in the modified (prolonged, extended) release tablets is nicotinic&#xD;
      acid, a B-complex vitamin. Modified release tablets containing 500 mg nicotinic acid, once&#xD;
      daily for oral use, will be used.te of 20%, sample size is 100 in the niacin group and 50 in&#xD;
      the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited consecutively in the participating lipid clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed at week -4 (run-in / wash-out), 0a+b (screening phase), 1, 5, 9,&#xD;
      13, and 20. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous and categorical&#xD;
      variables. Mean change of Lp(a) levels will be compared between treatment and placebo group.&#xD;
      Subjects will be grouped according to treatment randomised (intention-to-treat, ITT&#xD;
      population). For missing data, the last observation will be carried forward (LOCF).&#xD;
      Comparisons between groups will be performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with&#xD;
      treatment as a factor, adjusting for baseline Lp(a) levels and other potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses will be performed according to Lp(a) phenotype, Lp(a) baseline level ( &gt;&#xD;
      30-60 mg/dl, &gt; 60 mg/dl), and concurrent statin therapy (yes / no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flushing is the most common side effect of niacin. Other side effects include&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders (common) (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or&#xD;
      dyspepsia) and cardiac disorders (uncommon) (tachycardia, palpitations). A reversible&#xD;
      elevation of liver enzymes has been reported, as well as a decreased glucose tolerance,&#xD;
      reductions in platelet counts, increases in prothrombin time, elevations in uric acid levels,&#xD;
      and reductions in phosphorous levels (uncommon or rarely). Hypersensitivity reactions have&#xD;
      been reported very rarely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single reports on rhabdomyolysis in patients on combined therapy with niacin and HMG-CoA&#xD;
      reductase inhibitors (statins) have been reported. Careful monitoring for any signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of myopathy such as muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness is therefore required in&#xD;
      the case of combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Niacin has been shown to improve the lipid profile in patients with reductions in total&#xD;
      cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and increases in HDL cholesterol. Niacin may&#xD;
      also reduce elevated Lp(a) levels and may thus lower cardiovascular events in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be assessed prior randomisation: socio-demographic factors,&#xD;
      physical examinations, medical history, concurrent medication, health-related quality of&#xD;
      life, costs prior study entry, and lipid as well as other laboratory parameters. Lipid&#xD;
      parameters include Lp(a), total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and&#xD;
      triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow-up, the respective laboratory analyses and physical examinations will be assessed&#xD;
      at each visit. Subjects will be investigated with regard to safety and tolerability.&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life and costs will be assessed at week 9 and 20.&#xD;
