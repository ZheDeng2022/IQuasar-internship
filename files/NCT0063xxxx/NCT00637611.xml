        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects, 15 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) during the fall pollen season, for at&#xD;
             least the previous 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of having a positive response to antihistamines for symptoms of SAR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be skin test positive to ragweed within the last 15 months with at least a&#xD;
             moderate reaction as defined by a wheal 7 mm greater than the diluent wheal after&#xD;
             intradermal skin test or a wheal 5 mm greater than the diluent wheal after skin prick&#xD;
             test. A skin test performed in the previous 15 months may be used to qualify the&#xD;
             patient if it was performed at the investigator's site and recorded in the subject's&#xD;
             medical record&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All females must have negative urine pregnancy test at screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to adhere to visit schedules and all study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant medical condition (such as cardiovascular, hepatic, neurologic,&#xD;
             hematological, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or other major systemic disease),&#xD;
             which, in the judgment of the investigator, might interfere with the study, require&#xD;
             treatment or make implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results difficult&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma that requires treatment with medication other than an inhaled, short-acting&#xD;
             beta agonist or asthma that will be exacerbated by exposure to ragweed pollen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to the study medications or to drugs with similar chemical&#xD;
             structures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nasal structural abnormalities, including large nasal polyps or marked septal&#xD;
             deviation, that significantly interfere with nasal air flow&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by&#xD;
             the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Upper or lower respiratory infection within 14 days of the first priming visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of sinusitis within 30 days of the first priming visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunotherapy, except those on a constant dose of immunotherapy that will be&#xD;
             maintained throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational drug in the last 30 days before study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent history of drug or alcohol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and&#xD;
             possible consequences of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unlikelihood to comply with protocol such as those with uncooperative attitude or the&#xD;
             inability to return for follow-up visits or to complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who were randomized into this trial will not be eligible to participate in&#xD;
             another fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg vs montelukast sodium 10 mg onset of action&#xD;
             study (planned to be conducted in 2003)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are research employees or relatives of study site staff involved in this&#xD;
             study or those who have or will read the protocol&#xD;
