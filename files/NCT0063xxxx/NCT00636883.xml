    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      Erlotinib in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer will provide increased clinical&#xD;
      benefits and improvement in their quality of life.&#xD;

      Treatment Plan GEMOX-Erlotinib consists of erlotinib 100 mg orally daily starting day 1,&#xD;
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 in 10 mg/m2/min (100 minutes) infusion on day 1 followed on day 2 by&#xD;
      oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 in a 2-hour infusion. Treatment will be repeated every 2 weeks. Each&#xD;
      two weeks is a cycle. Tumor response evaluation will be performed every 2 months. If tumor&#xD;
      progress, patient will be off study, but if the disease is stable or PR, CR obtained will&#xD;
      continue treatment for total of 12 cycles. If at end of 12 cycles response continues, will&#xD;
      administer Gemox and erlotinib till achieve maximum response. Then start Erlotinib&#xD;
      maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A total of 34 patients are needed assuming expected response is greater than 10%&#xD;
      (about 27%) and a power = 80%. Fourteen patients will be treated in the first stage; if one&#xD;
      patient achieved PR then additional twenty patients will be enrolled in the study for a total&#xD;
      of 34 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: Response rate with 95% CI and median time to progression of disease will&#xD;
      be calculated. Success will be declared if the lower limit of the 95% CI of the response rate&#xD;
      is greater than 10%. The 95% CI of the response rate will be calculated using exact methods.&#xD;
      Survival curve will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier Method. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      used to describe patient demographics, adverse events, serious adverse events and reasons for&#xD;
      termination. Two approaches to the efficacy and safety analyses will be done; the ITT&#xD;
      (intent-to-treat) for the efficacy analysis and safety. The ITT analysis consists of patients&#xD;
      who received at least one dose of the study drug and at least one on-treatment measurement of&#xD;
      the primary efficacy endpoint (overall response). The safety analysis consists of patients&#xD;
      who received at least one dose of the study drug and at least one safety measurement done. A&#xD;
      detailed description of the statistical methods, table and listing shells will be provided in&#xD;
      the statistical analysis (SAP) before database lock or data transfer to the study&#xD;
      biostatistician.&#xD;
