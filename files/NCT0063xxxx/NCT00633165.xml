    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Brostallicin when administered once every 3 weeks in patients with myxoid&#xD;
      liposarcoma with (12;16) translocation. The primary objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the response rate following Brostallicin administration.&#xD;
