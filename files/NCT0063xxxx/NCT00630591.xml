      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To explore the feasibility and acceptability of two distinctly different tailored,&#xD;
      home-based diet and exercise interventions (one that relies on a partner-assisted, team-based&#xD;
      approach that emphasizes the mother-daughter bond and one that is delivered to each&#xD;
      independently) vs. standardized materials (attention control). This aim will be accomplished&#xD;
      by assessing overall accrual, and by quantifying retention and adverse events in each study&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be deemed feasible if it achieves the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Accrual of 67 mother-daughter dyads into the intervention is accomplished within a&#xD;
           1-year period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An attrition rate of less than 20% is achieved; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The frequency of total adverse events is not significantly higher in either of the&#xD;
           intervention arms (as compared to the attention control arm), and there is no more than&#xD;
           one reported serious adverse event that is directly attributable to either of the&#xD;
           interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed process data also will be collected on each intervention, i.e., use and perceived&#xD;
      helpfulness of materials in promoting behavior change, frequency and quality of interaction&#xD;
      between members of the mother-daughter dyad, feedback regarding intervention materials, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To explore potential effects (and variation) noted among each of the three intervention arms&#xD;
      from baseline to 6 and 12- month follow-up on the following endpoints: BMI, energy intake and&#xD;
      nutrient density of the diet, exercise [min/week and metabolic equivalents (METs)],&#xD;
      self-efficacy to adhere to an energy restricted, plant-based, low saturated fat diet and&#xD;
      increased exercise, blood pressure, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), social support&#xD;
      (in general and as specifically related to healthful dietary and exercise behavior), and&#xD;
      characteristics of the mother-daughter bond (e.g., strength).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To explore potential mediators and moderators of healthful dietary and exercise behaviors,&#xD;
      such as the strength of the mother-daughter bond, geographic proximity of mothers and&#xD;
      daughters, self-efficacy for lifestyle change, etc.&#xD;

      DAUGHTER AND MOTHER - FULL INTERVENTION STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are overweight have a greater chance of developing breast cancer as they get older,&#xD;
      and also are at greater risk of developing more aggressive cancer. Researchers want to study&#xD;
      3 different home-based diet and exercise weight loss programs and find out the effect of the&#xD;
      programs on body weight, quality of life, and other health-related factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you and your mother agree to participate in this year-long research study, you will be&#xD;
      asked to sign this consent form and send it into our study office in the envelope provided.&#xD;
      As soon as the study staff receives these forms from both you and your mother, they will&#xD;
      contact you to schedule your first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you live within 60 miles of the clinic, you will be asked to come in for an in-person&#xD;
      appointment that lasts about 1 hour. During this visit, the study staff will measure your&#xD;
      height, weight, blood pressure, and your waist (using a tape measure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked to have cardiopulmonary exercise testing, also known as a &quot;stress&#xD;
      test.&quot; The purpose of this test is to check your fitness level. During this test, you will&#xD;
      pedal a stationary (exercise) bicycle. You will be asked to pedal at the same speed, as the&#xD;
      difficulty is increased every minute. It will feel like you are pedaling up a hill that gets&#xD;
      steeper and steeper. The test is stopped when you cannot pedal at the desired speed or you&#xD;
      become too tired to pedal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accurately measure your fitness level, the study staff will measure the air that comes in&#xD;
      and out of your mouth during exercise. You will be asked to wear a mouthpiece (similar to a&#xD;
      snorkel used in deep sea diving) which is connected to a tube that sends the air you breathe&#xD;
      out into a machine where it is tested. The exercise test will last about 8-12 minutes. As a&#xD;
      safety precaution, during the test the study staff will also monitor your heart rate using a&#xD;
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG--a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart).&#xD;
      This means that the study staff will place electrodes (sticky pads) at certain locations on&#xD;
      your body so that they can monitor how your heart responds to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do not live within 60 miles of the clinic, or if you do not or cannot report to these&#xD;
      medical centers, the study staff will send a study nurse to your house (or another location&#xD;
      easy for you to reach) to measure your height, weight, blood pressure, and your waist (using&#xD;
      a tape measure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the blood pressure measurement shows that your blood pressure is elevated (greater than&#xD;
      179/109), the study chair will need your personal doctor to say it is okay for you to take&#xD;
      part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity Monitor and Phone Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your first study visit, you will be given an activity monitor and instructions to wear&#xD;
      it on your waistband or belt (like a pedometer), during the time you are awake, for 7 days in&#xD;
      a row. The activity monitor will record your daily activity. At the end of the 7 days, you&#xD;
      will be asked to return the activity monitor using a pre-addressed, postage-paid return&#xD;
      envelope that you will be given to you with the monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also receive a food poster and survey guide after your first study visit. You will&#xD;
      use these to participate in 2 unscheduled telephone interviews within the next month. Each&#xD;
      interview will take about 30 minutes. At the beginning of the interview, the interviewer will&#xD;
      ask if the time is convenient for you, or if you need to reschedule the call for another time&#xD;
      when you are available. During these interviews, you will be asked questions about your&#xD;
      health and your diet and exercise behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After both you and your mother have completed your surveys and the information from your&#xD;
      activity monitor has been received by the study staff, both you and your mother will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned as a team (like drawing names from a hat) to 1 of 3 intervention groups.&#xD;
      All 3 interventions will not start sooner than 6 months after your mother's cancer diagnosis,&#xD;
      to allow time for her to recover from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized Materials Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to this group, you will be asked to exercise and to improve your diet to&#xD;
      the best of your ability. In order to do this, you will receive 7 sets of print materials&#xD;
      about diet, exercise, and other health information. These materials will be mailed every 6-7&#xD;
      weeks throughout the 1-year intervention period. After each mailing, you will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a short survey (16 questions) about the information you received and how useful it&#xD;
      was for you. You will be asked to return the survey in a prepaid, addressed envelope that was&#xD;
      sent with the materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Tailored Intervention Group If you are assigned to this group, you will be asked&#xD;
      to exercise and to improve your diet to the best of your ability. In order to do this, you&#xD;
      will receive a personalized notebook of diet and exercise information, which will be mailed&#xD;
      to you at the start of the intervention. About every 6-7 weeks throughout the 1-year&#xD;
      intervention period, you also will receive 6 personalized newsletters that will also provide&#xD;
      you with more information. After each mailing, you will be asked to complete a short survey&#xD;
      (16-20 questions) about the information you received and how useful it was for you. You will&#xD;
      be asked to return the survey in a prepaid, addressed envelope that was sent with the&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, you also will be given the following equipment and supplies to help you exercise&#xD;
      and eat better:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pedometer, which is a small device worn just like the activity monitor that counts the&#xD;
           number of steps you take each day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Apple Nike + iPod® Sport kit (including iPod) that will play music to exercise to and&#xD;
           record the time and distance you exercise;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food portion and fat information guides to help you make good food choices; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Logbooks that you will use to record what foods you eat and your exercise behaviors&#xD;
           while you are on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partner-Assisted Tailored Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to this group, you and your mother, as a team, will be asked to exercise&#xD;
      and to improve your diets to the best of your ability. In order to do this, you will each&#xD;
      receive a personalized notebook of diet and exercise information, which will be mailed to you&#xD;
      at the start of the intervention. About every 6-7 weeks throughout the 1-year intervention&#xD;
      period, you also will receive 6 personalized newsletters, which will also provide you and&#xD;
      your mother with more information. After each mailing, you will be asked to complete a short&#xD;
      survey (16-20 questions) about the information you received and how useful it was for you.&#xD;
      You will be asked to return the survey in a prepaid, addressed envelope that was sent with&#xD;
      the materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, you and your mother also will be given the following equipment and supplies to&#xD;
      help you exercise and eat better:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pedometer, which is a small device worn just like the activity monitor that counts the&#xD;
           number of steps you take each day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Apple Nike + iPod® Sport kit (including iPod) that will play music to exercise to and&#xD;
           record the time and distance you exercise;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food portion and fat information guides to help you make good food choices; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Logbooks that you will use to record what foods you eat and your exercise behaviors&#xD;
           while you are on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These materials that you will receive will emphasize a &quot;team approach&quot; to weight loss, and&#xD;
      will encourage you and your mother to support one another. If you are assigned to this group,&#xD;
      you will be encouraged to talk with your mother regularly. The study will reimburse you for&#xD;
      up to 20 minutes/day of telephone calls between you and your mother. You will be told how to&#xD;
      submit these phone charges if you are assigned to this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Interviews and Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At both 6 months and 1-year after you start this study, you will have a telephone interview&#xD;
      with a member of the study staff. Each interview will last about 30 minutes, and will involve&#xD;
      the same information collected during the 2 interviews at the beginning of study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked to take part in 2 more in-person visits (one at 6 months and another&#xD;
      after a year) that will be like the visits performed at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 134 women (67 mother-daughter pairs) will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 34&#xD;
      mother-daughter pairs will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson, and the rest will be enrolled at&#xD;
      the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center.&#xD;
