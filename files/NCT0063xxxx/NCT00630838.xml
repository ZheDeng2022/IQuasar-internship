      Prospective, randomized, controlled trial to test if post-operative administration of&#xD;
      probiotics in HD patients will lead to a reduction in the occurrence of HAEC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that probiotics will decrease the risk of post pull-through&#xD;
      enterocolitis by randomizing patients to receive either probiotics or placebo for the first 3&#xD;
      months after surgical treatment for HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.1. Design: This study will be a prospectively performed, multi-center, double blinded,&#xD;
      study drug versus placebo controlled study. It will test the hypothesis that post-operative&#xD;
      administration of probiotics in HD patients will lead to a reduction in the occurrence of&#xD;
      HAEC E.2. Study medication: VSL#3 (VSL Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL) was&#xD;
      provided in packets, each of which contained 900 billion viable lyophilized bacteria of 4&#xD;
      strains of Lactobacillus (L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp.&#xD;
      bulgaricus), 3 strains of Bifidobacterium (B. longum, L. breve, and B. infantis), and 1&#xD;
      strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (designated hereafter as S.&#xD;
      thermophilus). Maize starch was included as filler. Placebo was provided in identical bags&#xD;
      containing 3 g of maize starch. VSL#3 and placebo were administered once each night. The&#xD;
      taste and smell of the active drugs were not readily identifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.2.1. Formulation of the study drug: The drug will be delivered to patient's families in&#xD;
      individual packets. The families will be instructed to administer the probiotic as&#xD;
      appropriately diluted in 2 ounces of either expressed human milk or formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.2.2. FDA approval number: VSL#3 is now a &quot;medical food&quot; in the US and does not need FDA&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.2.3. Medication suppliers: VSL Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL E.2.4.Funds for&#xD;
      medication: It is anticipated that the VSL Pharmaceutical Corporation will donate sufficient&#xD;
      drug and placebo for the completion of this study. Additional funds for IRB approval and&#xD;
      costs of dispensing drug/placebo via the Investigational Drug Service are requested from the&#xD;
      VSL Pharmaceutical Corporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.2.5. Dosing and frequency: Dosing will be based on patient weight. For those infants&#xD;
      greater or equal to 5 kg, one gram (360 billion bacteria or 4 sachets) of VSL#3 will be&#xD;
      administered into 3 ounces of either expressed breast milk or formula daily. For patients&#xD;
      under 5 kg, 0.5 gm (180 billion bacteria or 2 sachets) daily in the same amount of formula or&#xD;
      breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.2.6. Time of start of probiotics: Probiotic vs. placebo will begin once the infant has&#xD;
      reached full oral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.2.7. Duration of the study: Upon initiation of probiotics vs. placebo administration,&#xD;
      administration will continue for 3 months. Follow up will continue for an additional 3 month&#xD;
      period after termination of probiotic administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3. Study population: Study candidates will include all infants (newborn to 1 year of age)&#xD;
      who undergo a definitive pullthrough for Hirschsprung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3.1. Study Sites: This study will be conducted in four large pediatric surgery centers&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children's Hospital of Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital for Sick Kids, Toronto, Ontario, Canada&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt&#xD;
&#xD;
      And the study will include all pediatric patients diagnosed to have HD and will be subjected&#xD;
      to definitive pullthrough procedure. Each of these sites contains a quaternary level of&#xD;
      pediatric surgical care, and treats a large number of patients with HD on a yearly basis. The&#xD;
      key advantage of Tanta University is that this Hospital group treats three-fold more HD&#xD;
      patients on a yearly basis than the other Sites, and has a very highly motivated staff with&#xD;
      research interests in HAEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3.2. Method of Patient Recruitment: The study coordinator, co-investigator and collaborator&#xD;
      at each site will conduct study orientations for the neonatal staff which will include staff&#xD;
      physicians, training-fellows, house officers and nurses who work in the unit. These&#xD;
      orientations will help alert the staff as to who are potential candidates for the study. In&#xD;
      addition, the study coordinator will check each day for new admissions to the neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit for potential candidates. It will be the study coordinator's&#xD;
      responsibility to consent the parent/guardian and write orders for the study. No preference&#xD;
      for a specific sex, race or ethnic background will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3.3. Randomization: the study will be double blinded study and the randomization will be&#xD;
      conducted by the hospital pharmacist whom will be responsible of dispensing the medication to&#xD;
      the patients after coding it with a special code related to the patient ID and the records is&#xD;
      kept with the pharmacist till the end of the study. Physicians and other caregivers will be&#xD;
      blinded as to who is receiving placebo or study drug. Only the pharmacist at the&#xD;
      Investigational Drug Service (or similar service) will be aware of the assignment. Each&#xD;
      patient will receive a study number which will identify the patient. The number will allow&#xD;
      for confidentiality while simultaneously allowing patient identification by the principal&#xD;
      investigator at each center if it should it be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3.4.Mechanisms of drug / placebo distribution: The anticipated number of patients to be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study in each participating center has been calculated according to previous&#xD;
      records of the center. According to this number, the drug/placebo distribution will be done.&#xD;
      The responsible group for the blindness of the study and distribution of the drug will be the&#xD;
      pharmacist in each center and he/she will keep codes for each patient not to be broken except&#xD;
      at the end of the study. The pharmacist is also responsible for dispensing the drug and&#xD;
      placebo packets to the patients as monthly supplies and should inform the patient guardian to&#xD;
      bring the empty packs before receiving the new medication to ensure compliance of the&#xD;
      patients to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3.5. Removal from protocol after enrollment: Although all patients will be treated as&#xD;
      intent to treat, physicians may remove infants from the protocol for a number of reasons:&#xD;
      First, if parent or guardian requests study withdrawal, and this will be honored. Second, if&#xD;
      it is the opinion of the caring physician that participation in the study protocol may lead&#xD;
      to undo harm of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3.6. Guidelines for uniformity of patient care: As these studies will be performed at a&#xD;
      multiple sites, a series of guidelines will need to be followed by each site. Prior to the&#xD;
      initiation of the study, investigators and their study monitor will meet and discuss&#xD;
      enrollment criteria, case report forms (CRF, see Appendix I) and review protocols for the&#xD;
      performance of probiotics administration and monitoring of infants. The treatment&#xD;
      specifications listed above will serve as an outline for definitive guidelines. Finally, a&#xD;
      firm agreement on the definition of HAEC will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3.7. Monitoring: Each site will specify a study monitor who will be responsible for data&#xD;
      collection and monitoring infants for protocol compliance and the development of adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs, see Appendix II). The study monitor will be responsible for data transmission&#xD;
      for data collection and analysis. He/she will also be responsible for informing the&#xD;
      Investigator and the respective IRBs of adverse events. When there is an adverse event which&#xD;
      is believed to have a relation to the performance of this study or a significant adverse&#xD;
      event (SAE), they will be responsible for reporting this within 48 hours to both their IRB,&#xD;
      and all other investigators. In a similar time, a report to the FDA will be done. Yearly&#xD;
      reporting of all AEs to each IRB and the FDA will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3.8. Safety and Regulatory Issues: Full IRB approval from each participating institution&#xD;
      will be attained, and IRB will be apprised of the multi-center design as well as names of&#xD;
      other participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.3.9. Data Obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.4.0. Primary Outcome Measure: The primary outcome measure will be the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of clinical episodes of HAEC will be stratified into three grades according to&#xD;
      established clinical grading system as follows (11):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade I: mild explosive diarrhea, mild to moderate abdominal distension, no significant&#xD;
      systemic manifestations (fever, anorexia, weight loss, tachycardia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade II: moderate explosive diarrhea, moderate to sever abdominal distension associated with&#xD;
      mild to moderate systemic manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade III: explosive diarrhea, marked abdominal distension, shock, or impending shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.4.1. Secondary Outcome Measures: Secondary outcome measures will be to measure the&#xD;
      expression of MUC-2 and MUC-3 expressed proteins in the stools of study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucins will be detected by using a modified Western immunoblot technique of stool specimens&#xD;
      as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we will attempt to correlate if there are additional clinical benefits of probiotics&#xD;
      in HD, by examining the number of un-scheduled clinic visits or emergency visits, the&#xD;
      stooling pattern, and the growth curve in probiotic treated group versus the placebo group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients eligible for enrollment will include all pediatric patients suffering from HD&#xD;
             at an age of 12 months or younger. All patients will require consent by either parent&#xD;
             or adult guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if children that are deemed hemodynamically unstable and&#xD;
             require immediate operative intervention, age more than one year of age, as this may&#xD;
             mean very delay in diagnosis and may affect the study results, or infants having major&#xD;
             congenital anomalies with short life expectancy. Additional exclusion criteria are&#xD;
             those patients' parents or adult guardian who refuse to undergo randomization.&#xD;
             Finally, those children who are transferred to another non-participating hospital will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
