  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether controlled infection with a clinically safe&#xD;
      number of larvae of hookworm results in an immune response that is protective in relapsing&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that there may be an inverse relationship between infections with worms&#xD;
      including hookworms and inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). This has&#xD;
      been explained by a protective immune reaction that is triggered by the hookworm in the body&#xD;
      that dampens inflammation. In mice with MS, infections with some mouse worms reduced the&#xD;
      inflammation and damage to their brain. The primary purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether people with MS who are exposed to a small number of hookworms will develop this&#xD;
      protective immune reaction that may reduce MS disease activity. We also plan to determine the&#xD;
      effect of the hookworms on relapses during 1 year study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of people with MS naturally infected with intestinal parasites did show significant&#xD;
      protection over 5 years, and the levels of biological markers of the infection and some&#xD;
      immune substances triggered by it were similar to the ones we obtained with controlled&#xD;
      infection in normal volunteers, allergic and asthmatic peoples. We think the study has a&#xD;
      genuine potential to benefit people with MS, and there is known interest in the MS patient&#xD;
      community. At the therapeutic doses proposed here, this is an innocuous infection. Natural&#xD;
      hookworm infection affects 1 billion people worldwide, often without symptoms unless the&#xD;
      parasite load is very high. Our controlled exposure studies have shown good tolerability and&#xD;
      safety; the risk of infecting others and auto-infection virtually is nil in Western standard&#xD;
      hygiene conditions. Many people with MS when asked stated they would prefer an innocuous&#xD;
      infection with microscopic larvae to a man-made product that may have more side effects. If&#xD;
      the protective mechanisms are determined these studies may also lead to new ways of treating&#xD;
      MS, possibly by selecting only the specific chemical components of the worms and the immune&#xD;
      response to them that confer protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in MS in the Western world, along with other autoimmune inflammatory diseases&#xD;
      and asthma may be attributed to decreased exposure to infections such as gut parasites due to&#xD;
      improved hygiene ('the hygiene hypothesis'). In animal models, controlled parasite infections&#xD;
      including hookworms and related worms protect against MS-like disease. Parasites have evolved&#xD;
      host-specific molecular mechanisms to dampen or condition the excessive immune responses&#xD;
      against them and thus survive. These parasites induce regulatory mechanisms including Treg&#xD;
      and a novel class of B cells that also dampen immune responses called Breg and were recently&#xD;
      shown to improve MS in natural infection. They may suppress a class of lymphocytes that cause&#xD;
      most damage in MS, Th17 cells. We will produce, with controlled exposure, a similar response&#xD;
      to those associated with protective natural exposure in MS. We have the unique combination of&#xD;
      expertise in hookworm biology, controlled parasite exposure and immunology of MS and MS&#xD;
      trials and our data from our other human studies indicate this is a safe and tolerable&#xD;
      intervention of significant potential.&#xD;
