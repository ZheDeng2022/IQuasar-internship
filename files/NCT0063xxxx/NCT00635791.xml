    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of giving vorinostat and sorafenib&#xD;
      tosylate together in treating patients with kidney or non-small cell lung cancer. Vorinostat&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
      Giving vorinostat together with sorafenib tosylate may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      The main purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety of vorinostat in combination with sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the largest dose of vorinostat + sorafenib that can be given safely to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if vorinostat + sorafenib are effective in stopping tumors from growing or in&#xD;
           decreasing their size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the side effects of vorinostat + sorafenib.&#xD;
