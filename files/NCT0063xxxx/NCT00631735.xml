      This study is a qualitative, phenomenological research design. The research question is the&#xD;
      lived experience of adult oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy being touched and&#xD;
      touching. The researcher will conduct minimally-structured interviews with a set of follow-up&#xD;
      interviews to verify interpretations and ascertain additional participant reflections on the&#xD;
      phenomenon of touch. The purpose of this study is to describe the sensation of touch in adult&#xD;
      oncology patients who are actively undergoing chemotherapy treatment. The primary objective&#xD;
      is to identify the essences of multiple meanings of touch to these patients. The importance&#xD;
      of touch in physiological development, learning patterns, and stress reduction has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in humans and animals through years of research (Field, 2000). Based on research&#xD;
      which indicates touch therapies provide a significant amount of symptom relief and reduction&#xD;
      in anxiety, a growing number of hospitals and clinics are integrating massage therapy into&#xD;
      services provided to patients in order to ameliorate many symptoms of diagnosis and/or&#xD;
      treatment-related discomfort. Examples are the integrative medicine programs at Memorial&#xD;
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and George Washington University Medical Center which include&#xD;
      touch therapy modalities. Research focusing on the embodied experience of sensory phenomena&#xD;
      such as touch is important to provide the basis for more effective care. No studies to date&#xD;
      have focused on the self-reported experience of the cancer patient with regard to what touch&#xD;
      means to these individuals, particularly those actively in treatment with intravenous&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The embodied sensation of touch in these people is important to understand in&#xD;
      order to provide more effective touch-based interventions and also to increase awareness of&#xD;
      direct care staff, including nurses, of the profound and complex effect that all forms of&#xD;
      touch have on those who are physically and psychically vulnerable.&#xD;

      The importance of touch in physiological development, learning patterns, and stress reduction&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in humans and animals through years of research. Based on research&#xD;
      which indicates touch therapies provide a significant amount of symptom relief and reduction&#xD;
      in anxiety, a growing number of hospitals and clinics are integrating massage therapy into&#xD;
      services provided to patients in order to ameliorate many symptoms of diagnosis and/or&#xD;
      treatment-related discomfort. Examples are the integrative medicine programs at Memorial&#xD;

      touch therapy modalities. Research focusing on the embodied experience of sensory phenomena&#xD;
      such as touch is important to provide the basis for more effective care. No studies to date&#xD;
      have focused on the self-reported experience of the cancer patient with regard to what touch&#xD;
      means to these individuals, particularly those actively in treatment with intravenous&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The embodied sensation of touch in these people is important to understand in&#xD;
      order to provide more effective touch-based interventions and also to increase awareness of&#xD;
      direct care staff, including nurses, of the profound and complex effect that all forms of&#xD;
      touch have on those who are physically and psychically vulnerable. The stress of the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment heightens patients' awareness of many taken-for-granted aspects of&#xD;
      daily interaction, including touching and being touched. The side effects of certain&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatments can create neuropathies that make the sense of touch diminished or&#xD;
      painful, even to the extent that putting on socks and shoes or taking a pulse or blood&#xD;
      pressure can become excruciatingly painful experiences. By allowing people who are actively&#xD;
      undergoing treatment for cancer to express the meaning of touch in their lives, a fuller&#xD;
      understanding of the multiple dimensions of the experience can be achieved. Using this&#xD;
      understanding, more effective nursing and touch interventions can be designed to enhance&#xD;
      patient comfort. One author notes a multitude of terminologies to distinguish types of&#xD;
      nursing touch in her literature review. She observes that, &quot;it is possible that touch is so&#xD;
      integral … that the need for serious research is not recognized … it is clear that more&#xD;
      research, and qualitative research in particular, is needed to better understand the effects&#xD;
      and meaning of touch…&quot; (p. 849). Chang (2001) stresses the need to treat physical touch in a&#xD;
      &quot;holistic way&quot; (p. 821) to positively impact the patient. She also stresses the meaning of&#xD;
      physical touch is &quot;dependent on reciprocal expectations about touch,&quot; (p.826). Based on the&#xD;
      importance of Chang's delineation of multidimensional aspects of perceptions of touch and the&#xD;
      mutual nature of the expectations, additional study is warranted to elucidate the perceptions&#xD;
      of touch in patients. This understanding can be used to facilitate increased quality of life&#xD;
      in patients with cancer through better education of health care providers and integration of&#xD;
      complementary modalities in a safe, effective plan of comprehensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design will be a phenomenological qualitative design. The purpose of&#xD;
      phenomenological research is the description of the experiential meanings we live as we live&#xD;
      them. The research question is the lived experience of adult oncology patients undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy being touched and touching. The researcher will conduct minimally-structured&#xD;
      interviews with a set of follow-up interviews to verify interpretations and ascertain&#xD;
      additional participant reflections on the phenomenon of touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will consist of participant interviews recorded and transcribed by the researcher.&#xD;
      Following the methodology of Colaizzi (1978), the interviews are read multiple times to&#xD;
      immerse the researcher in each participant's text and achieve a collective impression or&#xD;
      feeling for the whole. Following this, significant statements are selected from each&#xD;
      interview which pertain to the phenomenon under investigation. Meanings of these statements&#xD;
      are formulated hermeneutically (i.e., interpreted) by the researcher. These meanings are then&#xD;
      grouped according to themes identified by the researcher. All meanings must be considered. An&#xD;
      exhaustive description of the phenomenon under investigation is then written which focuses on&#xD;
      the universal, essence that lies on the other side of the concreteness of lived meaning. The&#xD;
      researcher then returns to the participants for validation of the meanings, clusters, and&#xD;
      descriptions. Finally, new data obtained from participants are incorporated into the&#xD;
      structure of the research. Prior to conducting interviews and throughout the entire research&#xD;
      process, a log is kept of the researcher's presuppositions about the investigated topic. This&#xD;
      acknowledgement of the researcher's viewpoint assists in setting these pre-conceived ideas&#xD;
      aside in order to come to direct terms and meanings as lived by the participants. One&#xD;
      author's contribution to the methodology comes in his approach to the interpretations of the&#xD;
      text. He describes the following components of phenomenological interpretation: 1. turning to&#xD;
      the nature of lived experience, 2. investigating the lived experience, 3. hermeneutical&#xD;
      phenomenological reflection, 4. hermeneutical phenomenological writing, 5. maintaining a&#xD;
      strong and oriented relation, and 6. balancing the research context by considering parts and&#xD;
      whole. These interpretive relationships are not linear steps; they form a guideline for all&#xD;
      phenomenological reflection and writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the concepts of reliability and validity can not be applied to phenomenological&#xD;
      research as they are for quantitative studies, the data trail and decisions regarding&#xD;
      interpretation are to be documented fully so that thought processes in the identification of&#xD;
      essential themes and meanings can be audited by outside reviewers. Trustworthiness of the&#xD;
      data and interpretations is paramount in qualitative inquiry. Lincoln and Guba (1985) set&#xD;
      forth four basic concepts to establish trustworthiness: truth value, applicability,&#xD;
      consistency, and neutrality. They discuss the divergence of the naturalistic paradigm of&#xD;
      qualitative research methods from the traditional or positivist paradigm of cause and effect.&#xD;
      The four concepts take on the following respective characteristics: credibility,&#xD;
      transferability (which requires contextual similarity), dependability, and confirmability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step of the study is the researcher's articulation of presuppositions regarding the&#xD;
      phenomenon of touch. This is carried out throughout the process of the study to ensure the&#xD;
      process of interpreting and defining essences of participants' experiences are not unduly&#xD;
      influenced by the experience of the researcher. Following approval from the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board, participants will be recruited from physician, nurse practitioner, and&#xD;
      physician assistant recommendations at the Regional Oncology Center and other central New&#xD;
      York oncology clinics. Each patient will be asked by his or her practitioner if he or she&#xD;
      wishes to take part in the study. If the person is interested, his or her phone number will&#xD;
      be forwarded to the researcher by the practitioner. The researcher will then contact the&#xD;
      patient to confirm his or her willingness to participate and understanding of the aims and&#xD;
      procedures of the study. For each patient who is confirmed as desiring participation, the&#xD;
      researcher will obtain informed written consent. Participants may withdraw at any time during&#xD;
      this study until the interview is transcribed, in order to maintain the integrity of the&#xD;
      study. All potential physical, social, legal, and other risks will be described and a phone&#xD;
      number given to the participants to contact the researchers in case of questions. Each&#xD;
      participant will be interviewed for approximately one hour in a private place and at a time&#xD;
      which is convenient to the participant and researcher. Before beginning the interview, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to choose a pseudonym. A second interview will take place several&#xD;
      months later (after the researcher has had sufficient time to fully immerse herself in the&#xD;
      data). This will give the participants a chance to reflect on their interview and review&#xD;
      interpretations of their information made by the researcher. Each interview will be taped and&#xD;
      field notes taken by the researcher. These will be transcribed soon after the interview to&#xD;
      allow initial impressions to be noted along with interview text. Subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      until saturation is reached (no new data obtained from initial interviews). Due to the need&#xD;
      for saturation, the number of interviews can not be planned beforehand; however, the number&#xD;
      is estimated to be between 8 and 12 participants. The interviews will be transcribed by the&#xD;
      researcher or other transcriptionist. To protect confidentiality, the participants' names&#xD;
      will not be attached to electronic or paper data; only pseudonyms will be used as interview&#xD;
      and data identifiers. All data will be stored in a locked file container accessible only to&#xD;
      the researchers. All audiotapes will be destroyed after completion of the research study. The&#xD;
      confidentiality agreements will be kept securely in a separate, locked file cabinet also&#xD;
      accessible only to the researchers. Participants' demographic information, including age,&#xD;
      gender, ethnicity, educational level, and employment (current or before illness) will be&#xD;
      collected and stored with the pseudonym.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will consist of broad open-ended questions. In order to establish rapport and&#xD;
      provide a foundation for more detailed questions, the initial questions will begin with the&#xD;
      experience of discovering the cancer, diagnosis, the experiences of treatment, and social and&#xD;
      personal consequences of the lived experience. Exploration of the initial diagnosis is&#xD;
      important because of the life-changing nature of the diagnosis and the accompanying feeling&#xD;
      of shock that many people experience at the moment of receiving the diagnosis (American&#xD;
      Cancer Society, 2006). The questioning will then focus on the experience of being touched by&#xD;
      others, first during the process of the diagnosis and treatment, then prior to this&#xD;
      experience. Questions will also be formulated during the interview on the sensation of touch&#xD;
      now and prior to treatment, including touching others. All questions will be broad to allow&#xD;
      the greatest possible latitude of participant interpretation; however, a general list of&#xD;
      questions will be formulated to ensure consistency and completeness of data collection across&#xD;
      participants. In general, the interview is paramount in data collection because it is the&#xD;
      intention of the researcher to be &quot;minimally intrusive&quot; while eliciting descriptions that are&#xD;
      robust and complete in describing each person's perspective of the phenomenon. In this study,&#xD;
      several broad questions will be asked at some point during each interview to ensure that&#xD;
      similar baseline data are collected for each participant. Questions to be asked will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Please tell me about some of the changes you have experienced since being diagnosed with&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Please tell me about how you have coped with the diagnosis and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How have people around you reacted to your diagnosis?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How important to you is being touched?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has your sense of touch changed in any way since you started chemotherapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has the amount of physical contact you have with others changed?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have you ever had any massage or other form of touch therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Please describe how it feels to be touched when you are going to the medical clinic or&#xD;
           having procedures such as CT scans done.&#xD;
