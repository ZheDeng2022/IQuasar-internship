  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gather data on feasibility and on immune and clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of intratumoral dendritic cell (DC) vaccination in combination with local radiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent lymphoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoma is extremely sensitive to radiation and is a commonly used therapy. The major issue&#xD;
      in application of local radiotherapy is the relative short duration of response and as a&#xD;
      consequence is used mainly for palliation. Therefore novel therapies are needed to improve&#xD;
      the outcome of patients with lymphomas. The potential specificity of the immune system to&#xD;
      recognize and eliminate tumor cells is especially relevant in lymphoma. Immune responses are&#xD;
      induced, coordinated and regulated by dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent&#xD;
      antigen-presenting cells. Based on the central role of DCs in initiating immune responses,&#xD;
      four vaccinations will be administered at intervals beginning two days after low dose&#xD;
      radiation is given to the tumor site.&#xD;

          -  Biopsy confirmed recurrent lymphoma of any initial stage, either Hodgkin's lymphoma or&#xD;
             the B cell or T cell NHL of an indolent nature. For B cell lymphoma, follicular&#xD;
             lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and those indolent&#xD;
             patients with mantle cell lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma will be included.&#xD;
             For T cell lymphoma, the patients with indolent cutaneous T cell lymphomas (mycosis&#xD;
             fungoides or primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma) who have failed or have&#xD;
             been intolerant of one systemic or two topical treatments will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed at least one line of prior treatment but not more than four&#xD;
             (including autologous but not allogeneic stem cell transplant).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one site of disease that is accessible for intratumoral&#xD;
