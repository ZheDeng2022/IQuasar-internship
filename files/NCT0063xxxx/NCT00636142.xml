    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test whether neutralizing TNF-alpha with infliximab affects&#xD;
      insulin resistance and phenotypical manifestations of the metabolic syndrome as fasting&#xD;
      plasma insulin, total body fat, plasma lipid profile or vascular endothelial function in&#xD;
      obese male subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are rapidly becoming one of the most pressing health problems. Obese&#xD;
      subjects face an increased risk for cardiovascular events that is closely related to a&#xD;
      cluster of metabolic disturbances (i.e. insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and&#xD;
      impaired fibrinolysis), collectively referred to as syndrome X. The actual mechanism&#xD;
      underlying development of syndrome X has not been elucidated. Increased TNF-alpha activity&#xD;
      has been proposed as a key factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to test whether neutralizing TNF-alpha with infliximab in&#xD;
      obese subjects affects insulin resistance and phenotypical manifestations of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fasting plasma insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ivGTT derived parameters of insulin resistance and beta-cell function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total body fat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plasma lipid profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vascular endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
