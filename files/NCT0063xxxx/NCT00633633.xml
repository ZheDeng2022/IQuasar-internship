      Baseline Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in the pretest portion of this study, your cardiology team will&#xD;
      look at a number of tests performed on your heart as part of your usual care, as well as your&#xD;
      complete medical history, to find out if you are eligible to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be scheduled for a visit&#xD;
      to the Behavioral Research and Treatment Center (BRTC) at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your first visit to the BRTC, you will complete the following tasks at home:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -You will wear an accelerometer to measure your physical activity for 1 week. An&#xD;
      accelerometer is a small device that you wear on your waist during the day. It records how&#xD;
      active you are. You will bring the accelerometer with you when you come for your first visit&#xD;
      in the BRTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your first visit to the BRTC, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG), which takes about 10 minutes. An ECG is a test&#xD;
           used to measure the electrical activity of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have your blood pressure and heart rate measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires about your symptoms, quality-of-life, psychological&#xD;
           distress, and exercise. These should take about 60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 2 reaction time tasks on the computer. In one task, you will press a&#xD;
           button on the keyboard to indicate the color of a word on the screen. In the other task,&#xD;
           the computer will present a statement and you will press a button on the keyboard to&#xD;
           indicate whether you think it is true or false. The statements are all opinions. It is&#xD;
           not a test of knowledge. The 2 reaction time tasks together should take a total of about&#xD;
           10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will do an exercise test on the stationary bicycle. You will ride on the stationary&#xD;
           bicycle for about 10-15 minutes while your heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing are&#xD;
           recorded by certified exercise specialists. While you are pedaling, the difficulty level&#xD;
           will be changed by the study staff. First, you will pedal at a low difficulty level.&#xD;
           After a 5-minute warm up period, the difficulty level will be slowly increased for about&#xD;
           3-5 minutes until you reach the point you cannot continue at that difficulty level.&#xD;
           After that point, the difficulty level will be lowered for about 5 minutes to allow you&#xD;
           to cool down. You can stop the test at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, you will repeat completing the exercise questionnaires and the reaction time tasks&#xD;
           on the computer, which should take about another 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the above test and procedures, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin)&#xD;
      to be in 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being in either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will receive the usual care as provided by the cardiology service,&#xD;
      and a booklet about coping with heart failure. Dietary counseling will be provided once a&#xD;
      month to encourage you to follow to a low sodium diet, with the goal of limiting sodium to 2&#xD;
      grams per day. The dietary counseling will include education about the effects of sodium for&#xD;
      patients with heart failure, sources of sodium in the diet, reading food labels, identifying&#xD;
      low-sodium alternatives to high-sodium foods, and using other types of flavorings rather than&#xD;
      salt and other high-sodium condiments. You will be given the booklet How to Follow a Low&#xD;
      Sodium Diet from the Heart Failure Society of America (appendix S and a copy of the American&#xD;
      Heart Association Low-Salt Cookbook, 3rd edition. If you are a tobacco user or have recently&#xD;
      quit, you will be referred to the MD Anderson Tobacco Treatment program. At the end of 16&#xD;
      weeks, after you have completed your 4 month visit in the BRTC, you will be offered exercise&#xD;
      training described below. If you want to participate in the exercise training, you may do so&#xD;
      at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will receive all the components of usual care, plus exercise&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will visit the BRTC 3 times a week for exercise training. For the&#xD;
      first 12 sessions, you will exercise on a stationary bicycle while your heart rate, ECG, and&#xD;
      blood pressure are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the cardiologist finds that you are able to exercise safely, you will use part of the&#xD;
      exercise session to do exercise without having your heart rate, ECG, and blood pressure&#xD;
      recorded. Your exercise sessions at the BRTC will be supervised by a study staff member at&#xD;
      all times. After you have exercised safely for at least 4 weeks, you will begin at-home&#xD;
      exercise program, which will be a series of exercises developed individually for you, in&#xD;
      addition to the supervised exercise sessions in the BRTC. You will be given an exercise log&#xD;
      to describe your at-home exercise, and any problems or symptoms you experience during or&#xD;
      after the at-home exercise sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visits to the BRTC for exercise training will last about 1 hour. You will come to the&#xD;
      BRTC for these visits 3 times a week for 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you have the option of choosing the exercise training described above&#xD;
      or a 12-week home-based exercise training program that you will start after your 4 - month&#xD;
      visit to the BRTC. You will be scheduled for an in-person exercise session with the exercise&#xD;
      physiologist at the BRTC at MD Anderson. During this visit, you will receive instructions on&#xD;
      how to complete your exercise sessions safely and effectively at home. This visit will take&#xD;
      about 1 hour to complete. You will be provided with an exercise recommendation that will help&#xD;
      you work up to 30 minutes of exercise, at least 3 times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise physiologist will call you once a week for 12 weeks to check on your progress&#xD;
      and answer any questions you may have about your exercise program. You will also have the&#xD;
      opportunity to come back to MD Anderson up to 1 time a week if you would like help from the&#xD;
      exercise physiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a pedometer to wear. A pedometer is a small device (about the size of a&#xD;
      deck of cards) that is worn on the belt and measures the number of steps you take each day.&#xD;
      You will record the number of steps and minutes of exercise for each day on an exercise log&#xD;
      sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 4 and 8 (+/- 7 days), you will have a telephone interview about any side effects you&#xD;
      may be having and how well you are able to function in daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be counseled on limiting how much sodium you consume. The dietary counseling&#xD;
      will include education about the effects of sodium on patients with heart failure, sources of&#xD;
      sodium in the diet, reading food labels, identifying low-sodium alternatives to high-sodium&#xD;
      foods, and using other types of flavorings rather than salt and other high-sodium condiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These calls should take about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in either Group 1 or Group 2, you will have an appointment with the MD Anderson&#xD;
      cardiology team 4 months from the baseline assessment. At this visit you will be asked about&#xD;
      your symptoms. Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure biomarkers at baseline and&#xD;
      at the 4 month visit. Biomarkers are chemical &quot;markers&quot; in the blood that may be related to&#xD;
      your heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1 or Group 2, you will have a follow-up visit in the BRTC about 16-18&#xD;
      weeks after your baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten (10) days before this visit, you will receive a new accelerometer in the mail. You will&#xD;
      be called and reminded to wear the accelerometer. You will wear the accelerometer for 7 days&#xD;
      and then bring it to the last visit to the BRTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your last follow up visit to the BRTC, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires about your symptoms, quality of life, psychological&#xD;
           distress, and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 2 reaction time tasks on the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After these questionnaires and reaction tests, you will have an ECG and your blood&#xD;
           pressure and heart rate will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will then do an exercise test on the stationary bicycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then you will repeat the exercise questionnaires and the reaction time tasks on the&#xD;
           computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also be asked to take part in an interview about what you thought of the&#xD;
           exercise program and the tasks you performed at home. This interview should take about&#xD;
           15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your 16-week visit, information about your cardiac tests, health problems, and&#xD;
      hospitalizations will be collected from your medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the waiting list group who choose to participate in the exercise program&#xD;
      after their 16 week assessment will complete questionnaires once a month to measure symptoms.&#xD;
      After 4 months of exercise (3 months for home-based) they will repeat all the follow-up tests&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 participants will be take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
