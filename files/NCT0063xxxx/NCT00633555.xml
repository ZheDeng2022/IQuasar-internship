      Patients who have undergone in vitro fertilization (IVF) and produced four or less follicles&#xD;
      or had four or less oocytes (eggs) retrieved are often referred to as poor responders. We&#xD;
      will refer to these patients from this point forward as &quot;low responders&quot; to avoid using a&#xD;
      potentially offensive label. We are currently using 2 different IVF medication protocols in&#xD;
      our practice to treat low responder patients with infertility: the &quot;Microdose Leuprolide&quot;&#xD;
      protocol and the &quot;Luteal Phase Ganirelix&quot; protocol. We would like to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial and randomize patients to one treatment group or the other to&#xD;
      determine which medication protocol is more effective in treating infertility in this group&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;

      Women who demonstrate a suboptimal response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) are&#xD;
      a challenge to treat with assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization&#xD;
      (IVF). Such patients are often referred to clinically and in the medical literature as poor&#xD;
      responders. A variety of different protocols have been studied and used to treat these&#xD;
      patients. One protocol used to treat poor responders is the microdose leuprolide flare&#xD;
      protocol 1,2. This widely-used protocol was first described in 1997 by Schoolcraft et al. 1&#xD;
      The microdose leuprolide flare protocol is so named because the administration of a&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) in the early follicular phase causes an&#xD;
      initial rise in endogenous gonadotropins called a &quot;flare&quot; before it causes downregulation and&#xD;
      suppression of gonadotropins. Use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) in the preceding cycle&#xD;
      prevents corpus luteum formation which could be supported by exogenous GnRH-a in the&#xD;
      subsequent cycle. The microdose leuprolide flare protocol has been shown to be a safe and&#xD;
      effective protocol which may lead to decreased cycle cancellation rates and increased&#xD;
      clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates in poor responders 2,3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of GnRH antagonists led to additional treatment options for poor responders&#xD;
      4. With GnRH antagonist use, suppression in the early follicular phase may be avoided. The&#xD;
      GnRH antagonist is then added in the late follicular phase to prevent an LH surge. This&#xD;
      protocol may enable a poor responder to recruit more follicles in the early follicular phase&#xD;
      and thus have a more optimal response to stimulation. A randomized-controlled multicenter&#xD;
      trial comparing the GnRH antagonist ganirelix to a GnRH agonist (Buserelin, intranasal&#xD;
      preparation) in patients using recombinant FSH (rFSH) showed that ganirelix was safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated 5. They found that the mean duration of stimulation was 1 day shorter in the&#xD;
      ganirelix group and that this group used significantly less rFSH. A randomized-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial of poor responders comparing the use of ganirelix to microdose leuprolide&#xD;
      acetate (GnRH-a) in patients undergoing COH for IVF found that the outcomes were similar in&#xD;
      both groups 6. There were no differences in total number of days of stimulation, amount of&#xD;
      rFSH used, peak estradiol levels, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate,&#xD;
      implantation rate, or pregnancy rate. However, this study was limited by a small sample size.&#xD;
      Another randomized-controlled trial by Akman et al. 7 compared the use of microdose&#xD;
      leuprolide to GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide) in poor responders undergoing IVF. They found no&#xD;
      difference in implantation rates and clinical pregnancy rates but were also limited by a&#xD;
      small sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In IVF cycles, poor responders often develop a dominant follicle and multiple small follicles&#xD;
      rather than multiple large follicles which is the goal of such treatment. In such cases, the&#xD;
      IVF cycle is often cancelled. The physiology behind such asynchronous follicular growth&#xD;
      during COH is poorly understood. Such discrepant growth may be the result of size differences&#xD;
      in early antral follicles 8. It is also possible that the premature FSH elevation that occurs&#xD;
      in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle plays a role in this process 9. FSH prevents&#xD;
      follicular atresia at the end of the luteal phase10. Some follicles are intrinsically more&#xD;
      sensitive to FSH and able to respond to low levels of this hormone than others. Given the&#xD;
      fact that larger follicles are often more FSH-responsive than small follicles, it makes sense&#xD;
      that exogenous gonadotropins may lead to worsening follicular asynchrony during COH 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been shown that the use of estradiol in the luteal phase of the preceding&#xD;
      menstrual cycle may facilitate growth of follicles in a coordinated fashion 8, 11. Fanchin et&#xD;
      al.11 prospectively studied 90 women who were undergoing IVF cycles using GnRH antagonists&#xD;
      and randomly assigned them to receive either 4 mg of oral micronized estradiol from cycle day&#xD;
      20 until day 2 of the next cycle or to serve as controls and receive no estradiol treatment.&#xD;
      They found that the group that received estradiol had significantly smaller follicles on day&#xD;
      8 of their cycle and had less of a discrepancy in follicle size.. The group that received&#xD;
      estradiol also had more follicles that were 16 mm or greater, more mature oocytes, and more&#xD;
      embryos than the control group. The clinical pregnancy rate was greater in the estradiol&#xD;
      group although this finding was not statistically significant (34 vs. 25%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, GnRH antagonists have also been shown to coordinate follicular size and subsequent&#xD;
      growth when used in the luteal phase of the preceding menstrual cycle 12,13. Dragesic et al.&#xD;
      13 developed a novel protocol for poor responders which incorporated both transdermal&#xD;
      estradiol (E2)and GnRH antagonist use in the luteal phase, followed by gonadotropin&#xD;
      stimulation in the follicular phase and the addition of a GnRH antagonist in the late&#xD;
      follicular phase. From this point on, this protocol will be referred to as the Luteal Phase&#xD;
      Ganirelix (LPG) Protocol. During the LPG protocol, subjects applied a 0.1 mg transdermal&#xD;
      estradiol patch on the 10th day after the LH surge and replaced this patch with a fresh 0.1&#xD;
      mg patch every other day. On the second day of patch use, subjects began taking daily&#xD;
      ganirelix acetate 0.25 mg subcutaneously for 3 days. Subjects presented for ultrasound on day&#xD;
      2 of menses for FSH, LH, E2 and an ultrasound and stimulation was started per protocol with&#xD;
      gonadotropins (rFSH and human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG)). Ganirelix was started when a&#xD;
      13mm follicle was measured on ultrasound, E2 exceeded 300 pg/mL, or on cycle day 7. Human&#xD;
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was given for final oocyte maturation and oocyte retrieval was&#xD;
      performed 35-36 hours later. All embryo transfers were performed 72 hours after oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval. This retrospective study of 68 subjects compared their responses to the LPG&#xD;
      protocol with their responses to a prior IVF cycle protocol, which included microdose&#xD;
      leuprolide, low-dose leuprolide, and coflare protocols. They found that when patients used&#xD;
      the LPG Protocol they had significantly lower cycle cancellation rates, more oocytes&#xD;
      retrieved, more mature oocytes, more normally fertilized oocytes, and more embryos available&#xD;
      for transfer compared to their prior cycles. Patients did use more gonadotropins during the&#xD;
      LPG protocol and had more days of stimulation, although the latter was not statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal in our proposed study is to determine whether the Microdose Leuprolide and LPG&#xD;
      Protocols are equally efficacious in treating poor responders.&#xD;
