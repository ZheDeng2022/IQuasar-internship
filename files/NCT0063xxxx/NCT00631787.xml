  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will try to determine what causes toxic side effects of stem cell transplantation,&#xD;
      such as increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, decreased kidney function and&#xD;
      abnormal heart rhythms. Stem cells are used to treat various diseases, including cancer,&#xD;
      aplastic anemia and sickle cell disease. The cells may be given fresh to the patient or they&#xD;
      may be preserved first with a chemical called DMSO and frozen for later use. Some stem cell&#xD;
      transplant procedures include infusion of red blood cells along with the stem cells. This&#xD;
      study will examine whether side effects of stem cell transplants are associated with the DMSO&#xD;
      preservative in frozen cells or with hemoglobin (a protein released from defrosted red blood&#xD;
      cells) or neither of these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients scheduled to receive a stem cell transplant may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Candidates must be between 10 and 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant patients will undergo a stem cell transplant. The cells are infused through a&#xD;
      catheter placed in a vein for the procedure. Depending on the patient s requirements, the&#xD;
      infusion may or may not include red blood cells and may or may not contain DMSO. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers undergo a 4-hour saline infusion. The saline (water mixed with salt) is infused&#xD;
      through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in a vein in the arm. In addition, all participants&#xD;
      have the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart monitoring: Healthy volunteers wear a portable heart monitor, attached to the&#xD;
           chest using four stickers, for 24 hours starting the morning of the infusion. Transplant&#xD;
           patients wear the same device for 48 hours, starting the morning before the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws and urine collections before, during, just after and the morning after the&#xD;
           infusion of saline or stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart ultrasound before, during or just after and the morning after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral artery tonometry: A small cup is placed on one finger of each hand to measure&#xD;
           blood flow in the finger. A blood pressure cuff is inflated around the lower arm and&#xD;
           tight pressure is maintained for about 5 minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation is currently the only curative option&#xD;
      for many patients with life-threatening hematologic illnesses and malignancies. Peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion has been associated with systemic toxicities including&#xD;
      arrhythmias, hypertension, and organ dysfunction. It has been thought that the preservative&#xD;
      dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) that is frequently used to store frozen PBSCs may be the etiology&#xD;
      of the adverse effects that occur during the infusion. However, we hypothesize that the red&#xD;
      blood cells that rupture upon thawing infused with the graft release free hemoglobin which&#xD;
      scavenges nitric oxide. This can lead to systemic vasoconstriction and organ dysfunction. In&#xD;
      this protocol, we will monitor subjects who are undergoing PBSC transplantation with either&#xD;
      fresh grafts that lack DMSO or frozen whole grafts. We will also evaluate patients who&#xD;
      receive purified stem cell grafts, which will contain negligible red blood cells and&#xD;
      associated free hemoglobin. We will then measure the frequency of infusion-related systemic&#xD;
      toxicity and organ dysfunction between the groups.&#xD;
