  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer cannot grow without recruiting new blood vessels. Studies in humans have&#xD;
      identified a novel cell population, termed vascular leukocytes (VLCs). While VLCs are not&#xD;
      cancer cells, they support the growth of ovarian cancer cells by stimulating the growth of&#xD;
      new blood vessels which provide the cancer with nutrients. VLCs make a protein termed CD52.&#xD;
      An antibody therapeutic, Alemtuzumab (also know as Campath), that kills cells that make the&#xD;
      CD52 protein has been successfully used to treat certain lymphomas (a type of blood cell&#xD;
      cancer) that make CD52 protein. The purpose of this study is to determine if Alemtuzumab&#xD;
      given subcutaneously (under the skin)can be safely given to patients with ovarian, fallopian,&#xD;
      or primary peritoneal cancers to kill VLCs and determine if Alemtuzumab, by eliminating VLCs,&#xD;
      can restrict tumor growth or increase response rates to chemotherapy given after the&#xD;
      discontinuation of chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a diagnosis of histologically confirmed ovarian, fallopian or&#xD;
             primary peritoneal cancer that has progressed or recurred in the abdomen or pelvis&#xD;
             after salvage chemotherapy as documented by either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Radiologic studies or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Rising CA125 levels on two independent measurements. If the patient's CA125 has&#xD;
                  fallen into a normal range, CA125 relapse will be defined as double the nadir&#xD;
                  CA125. However, if the patients CA125 nadir had fallen to less than 10, then the&#xD;
                  measurements documenting recurrence or progression must be greater than 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. There is no limit on prior courses of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have unidimensional measurable disease or elevated CA125&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age greater than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status less tha 2 (Karnofsky 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;
             sign an informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Timing guideline for pre-study labs and measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All pre-study labs required for determination of eligibility are to be completed within 28&#xD;
        days of treatment Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        X-rays and/or scans used for tumor measurement to determine disease status are to be&#xD;
        completed within 28 days of treatment Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with known immunosuppressive diseases are excluded from this trial due to the&#xD;
             known immunosuppressive nature of Alemtuzumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be receiving any other agents (investigational or otherwise) with&#xD;
             therapeutic intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell (or squamous&#xD;
             cell) skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer or other cancer for which the patient has&#xD;
             been disease free for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of allergic reactions to Alemtuzumab or other humanized&#xD;
             immunotherapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with unresolved bacterial, fungal, or viral infections requiring active&#xD;
             treatment. Patients may be registered two weeks after the conclusion of antibiotic or&#xD;
             anti-viral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with history of active CMV disease as Alemtuzumab therapy has been associated&#xD;
             with CMV reactivation.&#xD;
