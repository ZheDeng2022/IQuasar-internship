  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Military sexual trauma (MST) is a significant women's mental health issue. There is a crucial&#xD;
      need for effective therapies for MST-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that are&#xD;
      well-tolerated and can be flexibly administered in a variety of treatment settings. Guided&#xD;
      imagery is a novel, transportable intervention technique that meets these requirements and&#xD;
      warrants research in PTSD. The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial of the&#xD;
      Guided Imagery for Trauma (GIFT) intervention for women veterans with MST-related PTSD. This&#xD;
      minimal contact intervention is designed to increase coping, affect management and relaxation&#xD;
      skills, and to fostering more positive images and beliefs associated with surviving trauma.&#xD;
      The feasibility and tolerability of GIFT have already been demonstrated in an open-label&#xD;
      pilot of 15 women veterans with MST-related PTSD, with very promising initial results.&#xD;

      Study Aims: The primary aims of this study are: (1) To determine the efficacy of the GIFT&#xD;
      intervention for women veterans with MST-related PTSD. (2) To determine the effects of GIFT&#xD;
      on mental health and health services utilization, and neurobiological outcomes. (3) To&#xD;
      identify predictors of GIFT treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: We will conduct a 12-week randomized, controlled trial of GIFT in 38 women&#xD;
      veterans with MST-related PTSD. Half will be randomly assigned to GIFT and half to a music&#xD;
      control group. GIFT includes a pretreatment orientation and midpoint consultation session&#xD;
      with a clinician facilitator, a guided imagery audio, daily self-monitoring of audio use, and&#xD;
      weekly telephone coaching calls with the facilitator. The music control condition is designed&#xD;
      to control for all nonspecific aspects of GIFT and matches the GIFT protocol in all ways but&#xD;
      the two specific &quot;ingredients&quot; through which GIFT is hypothesized to have its effect: (1) the&#xD;
      guided imagery audio, and (2) the facilitator's help in structuring and focusing use of the&#xD;
      guided imagery audio. Thus, the key differences between the two groups are that controls will&#xD;
      receive an audio of the relaxing background music used on the guided imagery audio, but not&#xD;
      the guided imagery exercises, and controls' contacts with the facilitator is limited to&#xD;
      psychoeducational information and general support, and will not include help in structuring&#xD;
      and focusing use of the audio, which is a key component of GIFT.&#xD;
