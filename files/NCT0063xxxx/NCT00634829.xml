    <textblock>
      This clinical study will evaluate and establish the protective effects of Amphastar's&#xD;
      Albuterol Sulfate HFA Inhalation Aerosol (Albuterol-HFA), in preventing exercise-induced&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction (EIB) in adolescent and adult asthmatic patients, in comparison with (1)&#xD;
      Proventil®-HFA (Reference drug and Active Control ), and (2) Placebo-HFA control (HFA&#xD;
      propellant only). Safety of the test drug, Albuterol-HFA, will also be evaluated in&#xD;
      comparison to the Active and Placebo Controls. Analyses will be performed to determine if the&#xD;
      Armstrong's Albuterol-HFA has resulted in a significant bronchoprotective effect, with&#xD;
      attenuated Max % Fall in FEV1, in comparison to the Placebo-HFA control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) has been reported to be around&#xD;
      70% to 75% among patients with clinically established asthma. Airway cooling and drying are&#xD;
      thought to cause the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes,&#xD;
      which then mediate clinical EIB symptoms. Pretreatment with a variety of medications will&#xD;
      ameliorate EIB. Albuterol has been found to be more effective in minimizing EIB than&#xD;
      theophylline, ipratropiom, cromoglycate, etc. Tested using a treadmill exercise challenge,&#xD;
      the newer formulations of albuterol MDI with HFA as propellant have been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      as effective as those with CFC as propellant in protecting asthma patients from EIB in&#xD;
      children and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of the Amphastar Pharmaceuticals' clinical development plan, the current study&#xD;
      examines the clinical efficacy of A004, Armstrong Pharmaceuticals' Albuterol HFA oral&#xD;
      inhalation MDI, in preventing EIB in adolescent and adult asthmatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled, three-treatment,&#xD;
      cross-over study, to be conducted in adolescent and adult patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      asthma and demonstrable EIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment. A&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization code will be created by the Amphastar Pharmaceuticals' IT&#xD;
      Department, so that each enrolled subject will receive all three double-blinded treatments in&#xD;
      randomized sequence. Each treatment is followed by a standardized exercise challenge and a&#xD;
      series of FEV1 measurements during the 90 min post-exercise period. The three crossover&#xD;
      Treatment Arms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment T (Armstrong's Test Drug: Albuterol-HFA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment R (Reference Drug and Active Control: Proventil®-HFA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment P (Placebo-HFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the definition of the crossover design, the three Treatment Arms are expected to consist&#xD;
      comparably of 24 evaluable subjects. The consecutive study sessions will be separated by an&#xD;
      interval of 1-14 days.&#xD;
