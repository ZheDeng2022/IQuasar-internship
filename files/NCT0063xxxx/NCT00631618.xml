  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an investigational drug called sunitinib&#xD;
      malate is safe and effective in treating metastatic melanoma in patients with KIT mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KIT is a gene that &quot;codes for&quot; (contains the genetic code that the body uses to make) a&#xD;
      protein on the surface of cells in your body that is important in cell growth and cell&#xD;
      division. The KIT protein seems to play a role in abnormal cell growth seen in acute&#xD;
      leukemia, germ cell tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and certain melanomas.&#xD;
      Melanomas that arise on acral skin (palms, soles, nail beds), mucosal membranes, and&#xD;
      chronically sun damaged skin have recently been found to frequently contain mutations or&#xD;
      increased copy numbers of the KIT gene. Your tumor tissue has previously been tested and has&#xD;
      been found to contain abnormalities in the KIT gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib malate is drug that has been shown to inhibit the activity of the KIT protein. The&#xD;
      FDA approved sunitinib in 2006 for patients with GIST. It has been shown that sunitinib&#xD;
      malate works in these patients because of its activity against the KIT protein. The FDA also&#xD;
      approved Sunitinib malate in 2006 for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer, where its&#xD;
      effectiveness is probably due to its ability to block a different set of proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib malate has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed advanced stage III or IV melanoma with primary origin in&#xD;
             mucosal, acral-lentiginous, or chronic sun-damaged skin. Advanced disease is defined&#xD;
             as locally recurrent disease or metastatic disease not amenable to surgical therapy.&#xD;
             Patients may enter tumor-testing phase even if they do not have recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aberration of the KIT gene or KIT receptor on in-vitro testing of their tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of measurable disease by RECIST criteria [Appendix 2]. Bone lesions, ascites,&#xD;
             peritoneal carcinomatosis or miliary lesions, pleural or pericardial effusions,&#xD;
             lymphangitis of the skin or lung, cystic lesions, or irradiated lesions are not&#xD;
             considered measurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy or surgical procedures to NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade â‰¤1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery or radiation therapy within 2 weeks of starting the study treatment.&#xD;
             Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted, provided there is&#xD;
             at least one measurable lesion that has not been irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade 3 hemorrhage within 4 weeks of starting the study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of any second malignancy within the last 2 years, except for adequately&#xD;
             treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer, or&#xD;
             in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or evidence of symptomatic brain or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal carcinomatosis on screening CT or MRI scan. Patients who have had&#xD;
             central nervous system metastases treated by surgery or radiation therapy and with&#xD;
             those CNS metastases considered in control will be eligible, provided measurable&#xD;
             disease outside the CNS is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following within the 2 months prior to study drug administration:&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass&#xD;
             graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade &gt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prolonged QTc interval on baseline EKG (&gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 160/100 mm hg despite optimal medical therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial. Supportive care trials or&#xD;
             non-treatment trials, e.g., QOL, are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin (low dose warfarin up to 2 mg po&#xD;
             daily for thromboprophylaxis is allowed).&#xD;
