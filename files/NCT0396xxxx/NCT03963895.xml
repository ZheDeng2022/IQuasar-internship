  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of AB002 (E-WE thrombin) in patients with end&#xD;
      stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Two dose levels will be evaluated in two&#xD;
      cohorts. Within each cohort the patients will be randomized to receive either AB002 (E-WE&#xD;
      thrombin) or placebo (at a ratio of 2:1 active: placebo).&#xD;

             electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory and coagulation test results at&#xD;
             screening. Repeat assessments are permitted for any laboratory, coagulation, ECG, or&#xD;
             vital sign parameter required for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patients must be of non-childbearing potential and must have undergone one of&#xD;
             the following sterilization procedures at least 6 months prior to dosing:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hysterectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  bilateral oophorectomy;&#xD;

             or be postmenopausal with amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior to dosing and follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels consistent with postmenopausal status as per PI&#xD;
             or designee judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male patients must either be sterile (vasectomy with history of a negative sperm count&#xD;
             following the procedure); practice total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the&#xD;
             preferred lifestyle (periodic abstinence is not acceptable); use a male condom with&#xD;
             any sexual activity; or agree to use a birth control method considered to be&#xD;
             appropriate by the Investigator from the time of dosing until 90 days after study drug&#xD;
             administration. Male patients must agree not to donate sperm for a period of 90 days&#xD;
             after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Documented history of acute vasoocclusive thrombotic event (acute coronary syndrome,&#xD;
             stroke or transient ischemic attack, venous thromboembolic event), or vascular access&#xD;
             fistula or AV graft failure in the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. With the exception of unfractionated heparin during HD that is allowed until study&#xD;
             check-in, concomitant or prior use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents (e.g., low&#xD;
             molecular weight heparins, warfarin, apixaban, bivalirudin, ticagrelor, edoxaban,&#xD;
             dabigatran, rivaroxaban, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticlopidine, eptifibatide, tirofiban,&#xD;
             dipyridamole, diclofenac, and all other non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs) that may&#xD;
             affect hemostasis for 2 weeks prior to check in on Day -8 and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any clinically significant (CS) concomitant disease or condition (including treatment&#xD;
             for such conditions) that, in the opinion of the PI, could either interfere with the&#xD;
             study drug, compromise interpretation of study data, or pose an unacceptable risk to&#xD;
             the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any other CS abnormalities in laboratory test results at screening or Day&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  8 check-in that would, in the opinion of the PI, increase the patient's risk of&#xD;
                  participation, jeopardize complete participation in the study, or compromise&#xD;
                  interpretation of study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) at screening or check-in on Day -8. If serum human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test results are indeterminate, follow-up&#xD;
             testing should be performed to determine eligibility. All female patients will not be&#xD;
             pregnant and will have a negative pregnancy test at screening and check-in on Day -8,&#xD;
             with the following exception: females receiving dialysis with an indeterminate&#xD;
             pregnancy test result or persistently low hCG resulting in a false positive pregnancy&#xD;
             test may be included in the study at the discretion of the PI. Postmenopausal patients&#xD;
             with a result outside the postmenopausal range or an indeterminate pregnancy test will&#xD;
             undergo additional testing with FSH to confirm postmenopausal status prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment with another investigational drug or participation in a device study within&#xD;
             30 days (or 5 half lives, whichever is longer) prior to check-in on Day -8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Acute illness that is considered by the PI to be CS within 2 weeks of check-in on Day&#xD;
             8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Surgery within the past 90 days prior to dosing which in the opinion of the PI or&#xD;
             designee is clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Currently have established underlying inherited or acquired symptomatic bleeding&#xD;
             disorders and/or are at risk for excessive bleeding per PI judgment or current active&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2 x ULN at&#xD;

         11. Exclusion criteria for ECG at screening and check-in on Day -8:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Heart rate &lt; 45 and &gt; 110 bpm QTcF interval &gt; 500 msec bpm = beats per minute; msec =&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any significant arrhythmia or conduction abnormality, (including but not specific&#xD;
                  to atrioventricular block [2nd degree or higher], Wolff Parkinson White syndrome&#xD;
                  [unless curative radio ablation therapy]), which, in the opinion of the PI and&#xD;
                  Medical Monitor, could interfere with the safety for the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (&gt; 2 consecutive ventricular&#xD;
                  ectopic beats at a rate of &gt; 1.7/second).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of a CS allergy or a known sensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to any&#xD;
             compound known to be present in E-WE thrombin, its related compounds, or any compound&#xD;
             listed as being present in the study formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Hypersensitivity to ß-lactam / penicillin derivatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Participate in strenuous exercise from 72 hours prior to check-in on Day -8 and&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Positive test for drugs of abuse and/or positive alcohol test at screening or check in&#xD;
             on Day 8 if not accounted for by a prescription medication. Patients with a positive&#xD;
             test based on a prescribed medication may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Positive test at screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV). If a patient with ESRD has positive test results for&#xD;
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) but liver function tests are otherwise not clinically&#xD;
             significant, the patient may be included at the PI's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Receiving blood purification therapy other than HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing.&#xD;

             irradiation, or bone marrow irradiation, and may affect life expectancy in the&#xD;
             following 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Any other reason that would render the patient unsuitable for study enrollment at the&#xD;
             discretion of the PI.&#xD;
