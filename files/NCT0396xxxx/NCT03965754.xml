  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate, prospectively, the potential impact of different&#xD;
      email message conditions (no email, standard promotional email, social norms, and loss&#xD;
      framing) on enrollment in a wellness program (myHealth Rewards) by Geisinger Health Plan&#xD;
      (GHP) members.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The myHealth Rewards wellness program managed by GHP rewards those GHP members who carry&#xD;
      their insurance through employment at Geisinger with reduced health insurance premiums over&#xD;
      the course of the following year, if members register for the program and have their health&#xD;
      measures on file by the enrollment deadline and are then able to meet their health goals by&#xD;
      the respective due date. In spite of the potential savings to health plan members and the&#xD;
      wellness program's potential to motivate engagement in healthy activities (with consequent&#xD;
      improvement in health outcomes), over 20% of eligible GHP members have not yet enrolled in&#xD;
      2019, even after receiving promotional email communications and reminders. Therefore, the&#xD;
      current study was developed to test whether different versions of emails are more effective&#xD;
      than a standard reminder email or no-email condition in increasing myHealth Rewards login and&#xD;
      enrollment rates. The standard email reminder mentions the average premium savings, the ease&#xD;
      of the registration process, and the deadline for registering and having health measures on&#xD;
      file, plus it provides links for registering and finding free health screenings where health&#xD;
      measures can be collected and registered at one convenient time and location. The social&#xD;
      norms email notes that a majority (78%) of GHP members' colleagues had enrolled in 2018, it&#xD;
      provides a testimonial from a medical director at Geisinger's Commonwealth School of&#xD;
      Medicine, stating the ways in which myHealth Rewards helped that doctor personally, and it&#xD;
      emphasizes the simplicity and ease of taking the first step toward enrollment. The loss&#xD;
      framing email suggests that GHP members are currently &quot;throwing away&quot; a precise monetary&#xD;
      amount in savings by not participating and that they can therefore avoid missing out on&#xD;
      substantial gains (i.e., savings) by taking action. It is hypothesized that, on average, each&#xD;
      of the emails will increase enrollment compared with no email. Among GHP members who never&#xD;
      enrolled in the past, it is hypothesized that the standard email reminder will not be as&#xD;
      effective as the social norms and loss framing emails. Therefore, email conditions will be&#xD;
      compared separately among those who did and did not register in 2018. Findings will help&#xD;
      inform how best to increase enrollment in a wellness program among health plan members who&#xD;
      have already received past promotional communications and who may or may not have&#xD;
      participated in the past.&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Social norms</intervention_name>
    <description>This intervention introduces recipients to descriptive social norms specifying that a majority of their colleagues have signed up for the program, which sets a normative standard against which recipients are expected to compare themselves and to change their behavior accordingly (i.e., when they realize that their behavior is discrepant from that of relevant others). The personal testimonial from a Geisinger medical director serves as a personal exemplar intended to further enhance the effect of the social norms with an implicit indication that the intended behavior is desirable and feasible.</description>

    <intervention_name>Loss framing</intervention_name>
    <description>This intervention frames the status quo as a state from which recipients, via inaction, are slated to forfeit a sizable and precise monetary amount to which they should otherwise feel entitled (via loss aversion and the endowment effect). People tend to be risk-seeking in the domain of losses; therefore, this intervention is hypothesized to increase enrollment in the hope of achieving zero loss by meeting program goals, as opposed to a sure loss via inaction.</description>

        <title>Enrollment (7 Days)</title>
        <description>Enrollment in the myHealth Rewards program (yes/no) within 7 full days of the beginning of the intervention (i.e., when the emails are first sent).</description>
        <time_frame>7 days, from May 7 through 13, 2019</time_frame>
        <population>We planned a priori to specifically compare the conditions within two groups: employees who previously enrolled and employees who never enrolled.</population>

          <group group_id="O2">
            <title>Standard Email Reminder</title>
            <description>The standard email reminder mentions the average premium savings, the speed and ease of starting the process, and the deadline for registering and having health measures on file, plus it provides two button links for registering and finding free health screenings where health measures can be collected and registered at one convenient time and location.</description>
          </group>
          <group group_id="O3">
            <title>Social Norms Email</title>
            <description>The social norms email notes that a majority (78%) of GHP members' colleagues had enrolled in 2018, it provides a testimonial from a medical director at Geisinger's Commonwealth School of Medicine, stating the ways in which myHealth Rewards helped that doctor personally, and it emphasizes the simplicity and ease of taking the first step toward enrollment.</description>

          <group group_id="O4">
            <title>Loss Framing</title>
            <description>The loss framing email suggests that GHP members are currently &quot;throwing away&quot; a precise dollar amount (over $2,000) by not participating and that they can therefore avoid missing out on substantial gains (i.e., savings) by taking action.</description>
