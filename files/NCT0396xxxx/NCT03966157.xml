  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In critically ill patients, nutrition is a major part of healing and recovery. In patients&#xD;
      unable to tolerate oral feeding, nasoenteric tube feeding (a tube placed from the nose to the&#xD;
      stomach or small intestine) provides a safe alternative for feeding. Some patients require&#xD;
      these tubes to be placed endoscopically due to numerous patient factors including difficult&#xD;
      anatomy, need for post-gastric feeding, among others). In patients that require&#xD;
      endoscopically placed tubes, there is risk of perforation, infection, bleeding, aspiration,&#xD;
      and rarely even death. In patients that have recurrent dislodgement of endoscopically placed&#xD;
      tubes, the need for repeat endoscopy increases patient exposure to these risks. Traditional&#xD;
      securing mechanism with adhesive tape to reduce dislodgment often fail in critically ill&#xD;
      patients requiring patients to have repeat endoscopies to replace nasoenteric feeding tubes&#xD;
      and subjects patients potentially to increased cumulative risks associated with each&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to collect data for one year, the investigators will prospectively&#xD;
      follow via chart review endoscopically placed naso-enteric tubes placed with a Standard AMT&#xD;
      Bridle securement device and assess if there is a reduction in accidental tube removal&#xD;
      requiring replacement endoscopically.&#xD;

      Patients to be recruited are those who are scheduled to undergo routine upper endoscopy with&#xD;
      nasoenteric tube placement. Patients will be randomized into two groups: control arm and&#xD;
      device arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm includes patients that will have nasoenteric tubes secured with standard&#xD;
      protocol, adhesive tape. Device arm includes patients that will have nasoenteric tubes&#xD;
      secured with Standard AMT Bridle. The nasal bridles will be placed by the endoscopist. Upper&#xD;
      endoscopy will not be affected. Placement of nasal bridle will take 1-2 minutes after&#xD;
      endoscopic procedure completed. No addition sedation, medication or exposure necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized by sealed envelope randomization. Clinicians are given randomly&#xD;
      generated treatment allocations within sealed opaque envelopes. Once a patient has consented&#xD;
      to enter the study trial an envelope is opened and the patient is then offered the allocated&#xD;
      treatment regimen. Patients will be consented by a member of the research team prior to&#xD;
      endoscopy. Randomization will be singly blinded only to the the patient prior to endoscopy.&#xD;
      Endoscopist will not be blinded as they will be placing the securement device and in order to&#xD;
      reduce selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of tube dislodgment, the patient will receive same treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of patients will occur via chart review until the time of discharge, at 6 months&#xD;
      and at 12 months after feeding tube placement via chart review. Data collected with include&#xD;
      repeat EGD, length of endoscopy, length of hospital stay, and mortality. The number of&#xD;
      endoscopies and repeated nasoenteric tubes placed will be tracked at six and twelve months.&#xD;
