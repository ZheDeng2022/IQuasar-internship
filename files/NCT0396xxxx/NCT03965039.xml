    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (changes in dentinal&#xD;
      hypersensitivity) and safety (oral soft tissue evaluation) after use of one of four&#xD;
      dentifrices in subjects with pre-existing hypersensitivity over an 11-week period.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Schiff Sensitivity Scale will be assessed for each test tooth via an evaporative air challenge. The examiner will record the Schiff Index score corresponding to the response to the air challenge. The Schiff Index Sensitivity scale is scored as follows- 0: tooth/subject did not respond to stimulus, 1: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2: tooth/subject responds to stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves form stimulus, 3: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. The higher the Schiff score, the more sensitive the tooth. The least square mean will be calculated for this measure.</description>

    <measure>Baseline Yeaple Probe</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Tactile Threshold will be measured using a Yeaple probe. Testing is performed beginning at 10 g. The examiner records tactile scores for responding teeth. After treatment, testing begins at 10 g and increases by 10 g to a maximum of 50 g. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. Each successive challenge increases until a &quot;yes&quot; response is repeated. If a second &quot;yes&quot; is not obtained, the force setting is increased to the next step and continued until a force is found which elicits two consecutive &quot;yes&quot; responses and will be recorded as the threshold on the Tactile Sensitivity Score form.</description>

        <title>Air Challenge</title>
        <description>The Schiff Sensitivity Scale will be assessed for each test tooth via an evaporative air challenge. The examiner will record the Schiff Index score corresponding to the response to the air challenge. The Schiff Index Sensitivity scale is scored as follows- 0: tooth/subject did not respond to stimulus, 1: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2: tooth/subject responds to stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves form stimulus, 3: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. The higher the Schiff score, the more sensitive the tooth. The least square mean will be calculated for this measure.</description>

        <title>Air Challenge</title>
        <description>The Schiff Sensitivity Scale will be assessed for each test tooth via an evaporative air challenge. The examiner will record the Schiff Index score corresponding to the response to the air challenge. The Schiff Index Sensitivity scale is scored as follows- 0: tooth/subject did not respond to stimulus, 1: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2: tooth/subject responds to stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves form stimulus, 3: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. The higher the Schiff score, the more sensitive the tooth. The least square mean will be calculated for this measure.</description>

        <title>Baseline Yeaple Probe</title>
        <description>Tactile Threshold will be measured using a Yeaple probe. Testing is performed beginning at 10 g. The examiner records tactile scores for responding teeth. After treatment, testing begins at 10 g and increases by 10 g to a maximum of 50 g. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. Each successive challenge increases until a &quot;yes&quot; response is repeated. If a second &quot;yes&quot; is not obtained, the force setting is increased to the next step and continued until a force is found which elicits two consecutive &quot;yes&quot; responses and will be recorded as the threshold on the Tactile Sensitivity Score form.</description>

        <title>Tactile Threshold</title>
        <description>Tactile Threshold will be measured using a Yeaple probe. Testing is performed beginning at 10 g. The examiner records tactile scores for responding teeth. After treatment, testing begins at 10 g and increases by 10 g to a maximum of 50 g. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. Each successive challenge increases until a &quot;yes&quot; response is repeated. If a second &quot;yes&quot; is not obtained, the force setting is increased to the next step and continued until a force is found which elicits two consecutive &quot;yes&quot; responses and will be recorded as the threshold on the Tactile Sensitivity Score form. The least square mean will be calculated for this measure.</description>
