      This study evaluates the use of an oral multi-strain probiotic in the treatment of anxiety in&#xD;
      individuals with Parkinson's Disease. Participants will be randomized to either 12-week&#xD;
      multi-strain probiotic treatment or placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex condition that carries a high burden of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric comorbidities. About a third of individuals living with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      have one or more anxiety disorders, resulting in lower quality of life, greater care&#xD;
      dependency, and increased caregiver burden. Gastrointestinal dysfunction is very common in&#xD;
      Parkinson's. Constipation is experienced by the vast majority of patients and often manifests&#xD;
      years before onset of motor symptoms, symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome are&#xD;
      also commonly found in PD. Increased intestinal permeability has been demonstrated in PD.&#xD;
      Impaired intestinal barrier function can lead to chronic systemic low-grade inflammation,&#xD;
      which has been strongly associated with mood disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest a&#xD;
      link between the gut microbiome and Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiome has been linked to anxiety both in human and animal studies. Several studies&#xD;
      have found beneficial effects of probiotics on mood disorders in non-PD populations,&#xD;
      including stress and depressive behaviour in animal models, and sad mood reactivity and major&#xD;
      depressive disorder in humans. Specifically regarding anxiety, probiotics have shown benefits&#xD;
      in several animal models; human probiotic trials have demonstrated improvements in&#xD;
      psychological distress and anxiety in healthy controls, in mothers experiencing postpartum&#xD;
      depression and anxiety and in individuals afflicted with IBS-related anxiety without PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, given the high rate of anxiety in PD, the growing evidence that probiotics may&#xD;
      improve anxiety and mood disorders in non-PD populations, and the strong links between the&#xD;
      gut microbiome and PD, we will carry out a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study into&#xD;
      the use of a multi-strain probiotic to improve anxiety and Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Approximately 72 participants will be randomized to either the probiotic&#xD;
      intervention arm or placebo treatment. Participants will mainly be recruited from the Pacific&#xD;
      Parkinson's Research Centre movement disorder clinic at the University of British Columbia in&#xD;
      Vancouver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a detailed description of the study and will need to provide&#xD;
      informed consent for participation in the study. Participants will be screened for inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Clinical assessments of motor function, cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms&#xD;
      will be done before the 12 week intervention phase as well as following after the 12 week&#xD;
      intervention with regular check ins during the course of the intervention. Blood samples and&#xD;
      stool samples will be collected before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the difference between the probiotic vs. placebo groups in mean&#xD;
      Parkinson's Anxiety Scale (PAS) score pre/post-intervention. The primary analysis will be&#xD;
      based on intention-to-treat. Secondary analyses for anxiety will include assessing the&#xD;
      proportion of participants with a post-intervention PAS of ≤13 in each group. For other&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, the between-group difference analysis will be applied to the fatigue,&#xD;
      depression, PD motor function, severity (UPDRS I-III) and quality of life scores pre/post&#xD;
      intervention, respectively. Adverse events, tolerability and drop-out rates will be&#xD;
      registered and overall rates compared between the intervention groups. Furthermore,&#xD;
      differences and changes in blood markers and microbiome composition will be assessed.&#xD;
