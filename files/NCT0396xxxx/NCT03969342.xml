  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The POCUS training program aims to bring sustainable, affordable access to POCUS to patients&#xD;
      in need of diagnostic services in Uganda. This research study seeks to demonstrate that&#xD;
      Clinical Officers (COs) in rural Uganda can be trained on POCUS for pediatric pneumonia, and&#xD;
      that this training can be completed through remote monitoring and observation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Objectives To prove that mid-level providers in low-resource settings can be trained to use&#xD;
      POCUS to diagnose pediatric pneumonia through a five-day training program followed by six&#xD;
      months of remote analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methods The investigators propose a remote evaluation study assessing the&#xD;
      ability of POCUS program trainees in Kabale to obtain and evaluate pediatric lung scans. The&#xD;
      indicator of interest will be diagnosis of pneumonia or lack thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trainee Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trainees were selected from the pool of mid-level providers who work with Kigezi Healthcare&#xD;
      Foundation (KIHEFO) and who participated in needs assessment questionnaires in February 2018.&#xD;
      From those respondents who indicated that they would like to participate in the training&#xD;
      program, seven were selected based on their work ethic and their likelihood of working in the&#xD;
      Kabale region for the foreseeable future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection, Management, and Sharing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning will take place during the KIHEFO clinics in town and outreach. As well, some&#xD;
      scanning may take place during the Bridge to Health Medical and Dental (BTH) and KIHEFO&#xD;
      partnered brigade. Additionally, some scans will be collected at the Kabale Regional Referral&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KIHEFO is a Ugandan registered non-profit organization and a rural teaching site of Mbarara&#xD;
      University of Science and Technology. KIHEFO has organized all brigades for the past six&#xD;
      years and regularly conducts outreach clinics through a grant provided by the Ugandan&#xD;
      Government and USAID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trainees will ask to conduct an ultrasound scan for practice on pediatric (under 18 years)&#xD;
      patients with a cough, fever, and/or increased work of breathing. To avoid the possibility of&#xD;
      trainees diagnosing patients based on scans, trainees will not scan their own patients, but&#xD;
      rather, the patients of their peers. Ultimately, all trainees are Ugandan clinicians and&#xD;
      licensed and regulated by appropriate Ugandan agencies. While the investigators cannot&#xD;
      confirm that clinicians will act with integrity at all times, the investigators rely on the&#xD;
      good training and integrity of the trainees as well as the relevant Ugandan health agencies&#xD;
      to monitor care of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the patient provide informed consent, while scanning, the trainee will fill out a case&#xD;
      report form (CRF). The patient will be assigned an anonymous patient identification (ID)&#xD;
      number, and trainees have each received a unique trainee ID number in order to conceal their&#xD;
      identity from reviewers and maintain a blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans and CRFs will be uploaded to an online &quot;cloud.&quot; Each time a reviewer accesses a scan&#xD;
      from the cloud, the reviewer will fill out a CRF. The CRFs of the trainee and the reviewer&#xD;
      will later be compared to determine agreement or disagreement. As well, the trainee will&#xD;
      record their clinical management and whether or not antibiotics were prescribed. This&#xD;
      clinical information will be managed by the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once trainees reach a predetermined level of agreement with expert reviewers, trainees will&#xD;
      be considered standardized and permitted to use POCUS to diagnose pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expert reviewers will be blinded as to the identity of the trainees while reviewing scans;&#xD;
      this will ensure that reviewers remain impartial while reading images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identifying information will not be disclosed to reviewers, or to any other&#xD;
      non-essential parties. Each patient will be assigned an ID number upon receiving a scan,&#xD;
      which is used when uploading the scan and on the CRF. Should a reviewer have a concern about&#xD;
      a patient, the reviewer can give the patient's ID number to the local coordinator in Uganda,&#xD;
      who has a coded list of patient information. The local coordinator can use this information&#xD;
      to get in touch with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until they are standardized, trainees are not experts in POCUS, and are not allowed to use&#xD;
      POCUS to diagnose patients. All patients will receive a standard examination, and will be&#xD;
      diagnosed and treated as usual before being asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
