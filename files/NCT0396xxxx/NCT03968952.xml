  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pregnancy-related conditions including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs)&#xD;
      and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) carry independent risks for future cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease in women. Early identification, referral and management of pregnant women at&#xD;
      increased risk of future cardiometabolic disorders may offer opportunities for prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of the SMARThealth Pregnancy&#xD;
      intervention to improve the detection, referral and management of pregnant women at high-risk&#xD;
      of future cardiometabolic disorders in rural India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Cluster randomised pilot study of 4 primary care centres (PHCs) in two diverse&#xD;
      areas of rural India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The primary objective of this pilot study is to address the feasibility of the&#xD;
      SMARThealth Pregnancy intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women in India, and&#xD;
      the prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders is rising. Women in rural India (where two-thirds&#xD;
      of the population live), are particularly vulnerable due to limited knowledge and healthcare&#xD;
      access. Pregnancy-related conditions including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) and&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) carry independent risks for future cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      in women. Early identification, referral and management of pregnant women at increased risk&#xD;
      of future cardiometabolic disorders may offer opportunities for prevention. Innovative&#xD;
      solutions are required to address the needs of rural women, particularly during the&#xD;
      transitions between antenatal and postpartum care and adult health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of the SMARThealth Pregnancy&#xD;
      intervention to improve the detection, referral and management of pregnant women at high-risk&#xD;
      of future cardiometabolic disorders in rural India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a pilot study, using an un-blinded, parallel group, cluster randomised&#xD;
      controlled study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sites: Jhajjar District, Haryana and Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The primary objective of this pilot study is to address the uncertainties&#xD;
      around feasibility: (i) how many PHCs accepted the invitation to participate in a trial; (ii)&#xD;
      whether the intervention is feasible with respect to participant recruitment rates, (iii)&#xD;
      retention of pregnant women in the trial to 6 weeks postpartum; (iv) acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility of outcomes measures (to measure the efficacy within a definitive trial); (v)&#xD;
      fidelity to the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include: (i) Acceptability of the intervention. (ii) Process evaluation&#xD;
      measures including rates of detection, referral and follow-up of high-risk pregnant women.&#xD;
      (iii) Clinical outcomes of mean haemoglobin and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures&#xD;
      at 6 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Cluster randomisation will be conducted at the level of the PHC. Staff related&#xD;
      to each PHC will be allocated to either intervention or control groups. The study will&#xD;
      recruit 200 pregnant women across all 4 PHC clusters; 100 CHWs (known as ASHAs and ANMs) and;&#xD;
      up to 8 Primary Care Physicians (affiliated to the PHC clusters). The villages selected under&#xD;
      each intervention and control PHC will be non-contiguous to avoid contamination.&#xD;
