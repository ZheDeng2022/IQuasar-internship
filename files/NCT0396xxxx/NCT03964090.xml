      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary central nervous system lymphoma (sCNSL) is cancer that has spread to the central&#xD;
      nervous system. Most drugs used to treat it do not cross the blood-brain barrier. This makes&#xD;
      it hard to treat. Researchers hope that a new combination of drugs may be able to help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a better way to treat sCNSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with sCNSL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue or tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT, PET, and MRI scans: Participants will like in a machine that takes pictures of the&#xD;
           body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspirations or biopsies: A needle will be inserted into the participant s&#xD;
           hipbone. The needle will remove a small amount of marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drugs in 21-day cycles. They will take some drugs by mouth.&#xD;
      They will take others through a catheter: A small tube will be inserted into a vein in the&#xD;
      arm, neck, or chest. They may have drugs given through a catheter placed through the brain or&#xD;
      injected into the spinal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have regular visits during the study. These will include repeats of the&#xD;
      screening test. They may also provide a saliva sample or have a cheek swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 4 treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after their last treatment dose. Then they&#xD;
      will have visits every 3-6 months for 3 years and then yearly....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aggressive B-cell lymphomas with secondary involvement of the CNS (sCNSL) have a grave&#xD;
           prognosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No standard of care exists for sCNSL; treatment approaches include combination&#xD;
           chemotherapy regimens effective in primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and has demonstrated a high&#xD;
           response rate in PCNSL and sCNSL but with short response duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We developed a novel regimen that combines ibrutinib with a chemoimmunotherapy platform&#xD;
           maximized for CNS penetrance that includes temozolomide, etoposide, Doxil,&#xD;
           dexamethasone, and rituximab (TEDDI-R) for aggressive B-cell lymphomas in the CNS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A phase 1 study of TEDDI-R demonstrated durable remissions in refractory PCNSL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose a small phase 2 to study the safety and efficacy of TEDDI-R in sCNSL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) after TEDDI-R or TEDD-R in secondary CNS&#xD;
      lymphoma (sCNSL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aggressive B-cell lymphomas with secondary involvement of the CNS (sCNSL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapsed/refractory from prior therapy or untreated with CNS involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No pregnant or breast-feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function (defined in protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II study of 58 evaluable participants with untreated and relapsed/refractory sCNSL&#xD;
           (accrual ceiling will be set at 65 to allow for a few possible inevaluable participants&#xD;
           and screen fails)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will first be treated with a 14-day &quot;window&quot; of ibrutinib monotherapy in&#xD;
           combination with isavuconazole to establish efficacy of ibrutinib. Participants who are&#xD;
           known refractory to BTK inhibitors will skip the 14-day and proceed on to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the 14-day ibrutinib window, participants with at least a 20% reduction in&#xD;
           bidimensional masses on imaging scans or those without measurable disease will receive&#xD;
           ibrutinib with TEDD-R (TEDDI-R) chemotherapy for 4 cycles. Participants who are&#xD;
           previously known to be refractory to BTK inhibitors and those who have less than a 20%&#xD;
           reduction during the ibrutinib window will receive TEDD-R (without ibrutinib) for 4&#xD;
           cycles.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed secondary involvement&#xD;
             of an aggressive B-cell lymphoma in the CNS (eye, CSF, and/or brain parenchyma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: B-cell lymphomas that were previously indolent but now involve the CNS (i.e.&#xD;
        transformed from previous follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle&#xD;
        cell lymphoma) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have disease that is relapsed or refractory after initial systemic&#xD;
             treatment or participants without prior therapy for systemic DLBCL must have&#xD;
             concomitant involvement of the eyes, CSF or brain parenchyma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women age greater than or equal to18 years. NOTE: Because no dosing or adverse&#xD;
             event data are currently available on the use of ibrutinib and TEDDI-R in participants&#xD;
             &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for&#xD;
             future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to&#xD;
             60%) unless due to disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ function as defined below, independent of growth&#xD;
             factor or platelet transfusion support:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): greater than or equal to 750 cells/mcL (0.75&#xD;
                  (SqrRoot) 10^9/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets: greater than or equal to 50,000 cells/mcL (50 (SqrRoot) 10^9/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin: greater than or equal to 8 g/dL (transfusions permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin: less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN unless Gilbert s syndrome&#xD;
                  or disease infiltration of the liver is present)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT): less than or equal to 3.0 (SqrRoot) institutional ULN&#xD;
                  (less than or equal to 5 x ULN for participants with liver involvement by&#xD;
                  lymphoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine: less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance: greater than or equal to 40 ml/min/1.73m^2 unless lymphoma&#xD;
                  related&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin time/INR (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be &lt;&#xD;
             1.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN); except if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, the aPTT is prolonged because of a positive Lupus Anticoagulant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test upon&#xD;
             study entry. This is not required for female participants who are of non-reproductive&#xD;
             potential (i.e., post-menopausal by history - defined as: no menses for greater than&#xD;
             or equal to 1 year; OR, history of hysterectomy; OR, history of bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation; OR, history of bilateral oophorectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ibrutinib and TEDDI-R on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, male and female participants must agree to use highly effective methods&#xD;
             of birth control. A &quot;highly effective method of birth control&quot; is defined as a method&#xD;
             that has a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly and includes implants, injectables, birth control pills with two hormones,&#xD;
             some intrauterine devices (IUDs). Male participants cannot use highly effective&#xD;
             methods and are required to use barrier. The specific guidelines are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use a highly effective method&#xD;
                  of birth control and a barrier method, or sexual abstinence (which is defined as&#xD;
                  refraining from all aspects of sexual activity), while taking the study&#xD;
                  treatment, as well as for 12 months after the last dose of rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men: Men must use a barrier method to prevent pregnancy of their partner and&#xD;
                  should also not donate sperm while taking the study treatment and for 12 months&#xD;
                  after the last dose of rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of participants or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and&#xD;
             the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic chemotherapy less than or equal to 14 days prior to ibrutinib window study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ibrutinib or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are allergic to isavuconazole or any of its ingredients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who received a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor or inducer&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of protocol anti-fungal prophylaxis, or&#xD;
             participants who require continuous treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor/inducer&#xD;
             (i.e., with the exception of any medication to be specifically studied in this&#xD;
             protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: In addition, because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is&#xD;
        important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
        the Physicians Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
        enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participants will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
        interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or&#xD;
        if the participants is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive participants will be excluded because of their increased susceptibility&#xD;
             to fungal infections which outweighs the potential benefit of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection or an infection requiring systemic antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Recent infections&#xD;
             requiring systemic treatment need to have completed therapy &gt;14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. Pregnant women are&#xD;
             excluded in this study because ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with ibrutinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior malignancy, with the exception of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no evidence of active disease&#xD;
                  present for more than 2 years prior to screening and felt to be at low risk for&#xD;
                  recurrence by treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated non-melanomatous skin cancer or lentigo malignant melanoma&#xD;
                  without current evidence of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without current evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently active clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled&#xD;
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as&#xD;
             defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification, or history of&#xD;
             myocardial infarction unstable angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to swallow capsules, or disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal&#xD;
             function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel, or symptomatic inflammatory&#xD;
             bowel disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or complete bowel obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection. Participants that are&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Those who are (PCR positivewill be excluded.) Those with a negative PCR&#xD;
             for hepatitis B will be treated with antivirals designed to prevent hepatitis B&#xD;
             reactivation (e.g., entecavir) and have monitoring for hepatitis B reactivation with&#xD;
             PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 3 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
