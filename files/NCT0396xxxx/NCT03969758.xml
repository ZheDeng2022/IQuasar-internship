  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver abscess is purulent collections in the liver parenchyma that result from microbial&#xD;
      infection spread to the liver through the biliary tree, hepatic or portal vein and by&#xD;
      extension of adjacent infection or as a result of trauma. Liver abscesses are most commonly&#xD;
      pyogenic followed by amoebic and rarely tuberculous or fungal in immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
      In the developing country amoebic liver abscess is more frequent than the developed country&#xD;
      but secondary bacterial infection of amoebic liver abscess and polymicrobial pyogenic liver&#xD;
      abscess are also common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pyogenic liver abscess is commonly a polymicrobial infection caused by mixed enteric&#xD;
      facultative and anaerobic pathogens. The most commonly isolated organisms are Escherichia&#xD;
      coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus,&#xD;
      Streptococcus intermedius, Enterococcus and anaerobes, including Bacteroidesfragilis and&#xD;
      Fusobacteriumnecrophorum. Amoebic liver abscess most frequently occur following infection&#xD;
      with the parasite Entamoeba histolytica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver abscess is a common medical emergency. Prompt empirical antimicrobial with or without&#xD;
      percutaneous aspiration or drainage of the abscess is therapeutic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An empiric antimicrobial regimen for liver abscess should cover enteric gram-negative&#xD;
      bacilli, streptococci, anaerobes and antamoebahistolytica. Presently a Fluoroquinolone&#xD;
      (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin) or a Third or Fourth generation Cefalosporine (Cefixime,&#xD;
      Ceftriaxone, cefepime) or a Beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination&#xD;
      (piperacillin-tazobactam or ticarcillin-clavulanate) or a Carbapenem (Imipenem-cilastatin,&#xD;
      Meropenem, Doripenem, Ertapenem) are being used in combination with or without Metronidazole&#xD;
      as the empirical antimicrobial regime for the treatment live abscess. There is no randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial to evaluated and compare efficacy of the antimicrobial regimens for&#xD;
      the treatment of liver abscess as well as there is no specific treatment guideline for the&#xD;
      use of empirical antibiotics. There is also no definite proven rational for using&#xD;
      Cefalosporine, Beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination or Carbapenem upfront, not&#xD;
      using Fluoroquinolone in empirical antibiotic regimen for the treatment of liver abscess.&#xD;
      Injudicious use of broader spectrum antibiotics may also lead to rise in antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both ciprofloxacin and Cefixime are effective oral antibiotics as they are well-absorbed&#xD;
      orally with good oral bioavailability and achieve plasma concentration well above the minimal&#xD;
      inhibitory concentrations require for the killing of the microorganism. Using intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) antibiotics upfront, for the treatment of liver abscess in patients who can take orally&#xD;
      may unnecessary increase the duration of hospital stay, healthcare burden and the cost of&#xD;
      therapy, as well as the risk of hospital acquired infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the investigators have planned this randomized controlled double blind study to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of empirical Ciprofloxacin plus Metronidazole and Cefixime plus Metronidazole&#xD;
      therapy for the treatment of liver abscess and to compare the outcomes of two different&#xD;
      empirical antibiotics regimen.&#xD;
