  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional Endoscopic Sinus surgery (FESS) is a surgery done for chronic rhinosinusitis after&#xD;
      failure of medical treatment. Intraoperative bleeding poses a challenge to both the surgeon&#xD;
      and anaesthetist. Although blood loss is not massive during FESS, bleeding may obscure the&#xD;
      surgical field prolonging the time of surgery or even leading to incompletion of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different methods have been used to improve the surgical field but none without side effects.&#xD;
      The use of diathermy carries the risk of local tissue damage with the risk of subsequent&#xD;
      bleeding. Local vasoconstrictors carry the risk of systemic absorption. Induced hypotension&#xD;
      may not be suitable for all patients; besides, this may necessitates the use of more&#xD;
      anaestheic drugs with their associated side effects. In addition, none of theses methods have&#xD;
      provided ideal surgical field for the surgeon.1-3 Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent,&#xD;
      has been used to decrease surgical field bleeding in different surgeries showing&#xD;
      effectiveness in its topical, oral and intravenous use.4-6 The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of local, intravenous and combined use of tranexamic acid in&#xD;
      improving the surgical field quality during functional endoscopic sinus surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining local ethical committee approval and written informed consent from the&#xD;
      patients, 90 adult patients of both sex, aged between 18 and 50 years, ASA I-II, scheduled&#xD;
      for elective functional endoscopic sinus surgery in Ain Shams University hospitals will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this randomized, controlled prospective double blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included; patients with uncontrolled hypertension or coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, anaemia, end stage renal failure, liver cirrhosis, patients with coagulopathy or&#xD;
      receiving drugs influencing blood coagulation, cerebrovascular thrombosis or history of&#xD;
      thrombotic events, pregnancy, known sensitivity to any of the study drug and patients'&#xD;
      refusal to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will assess the degree of sinus involvement in each patient using the Lund-Mackay&#xD;
      scoring system. All the patients will be instructed to take prednisone 1 mg. kg-1 5 days&#xD;
      before surgery to reduce inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After applying basic monitors, all patients will be premedicated with midazolam 0.05 mg.kg -1&#xD;
      IV, ranitidine 50 mg IV and dexamethasone 10 mg IV, 15 min. prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room and after 5 min preoxygenation, general anesthesia will be conducted&#xD;
      using the same protocol for all patients: fentanyl 1 μg.Kg-1, propofol 2-2.5 mg.kg -1 and&#xD;
      atracurium 0.5 mg. Kg-1 to facilitate endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be maintained using isoflurane 1 -1.5% in oxygen and air mixture 1:1 and&#xD;
      atracurium 0.1 mg. Kg-1 every 30 mim. Positive pressure ventilation was set to maintain&#xD;
      normocapnia. Fentanyl bolus of 0.5 μg.Kg-1 to maintain MAP (60-70 mmHg), without exceeding a&#xD;
      total dose of 5 μg.Kg-1 for fast tracking and early extubation. Total dose of fentanyl will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A throat pack soaked with saline will be inserted in all patients to prevent blood from&#xD;
      reaching the gastrointestinal track. The surgeon will insert nasal pack (epinephrine 1/2000&#xD;
      soaked pack), Afterwards, he will inject 2 ml of epinephrine 1:100000 into the middle&#xD;
      turbinate and the junction of the middle turbinate to the lateral nasal wall. All patients&#xD;
      will be placed in the same position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomly and evenly assigned to one of the four groups, 30 patients&#xD;
      each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: patients will receive an intravenous dose of 15 mg.kg-1 of tranexamic acid in a 10&#xD;
      ml syringe. The irrigation fluid will be 400 ml of normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: patients will receive intravenous dose of 10 ml normal saline in 10 ml syringe.&#xD;
      Irrigation fluid will be 400 ml of normal saline with 2 g of tranexamic acid added to it. If&#xD;
      more irrigation is needed, normal saline will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group III: patients will receive an intravenous dose of 15 mg.kg-1 of tranexamic acid in a 10&#xD;
      ml syringe. Irrigation fluid will be 400 ml of normal saline with 2 g of tranexamic acid&#xD;
      added to it. If more irrigation is needed, normal saline will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group IV (control): patients will receive intravenous dose of 10 ml normal saline in 10 ml&#xD;
      syringe. The irrigation fluid will be 400 ml of normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done using computer generated list. A pharmacist will prepare the drugs, as&#xD;
      well as the irrigation fluid, which will only have the patient's number on them. In this way,&#xD;
      the anaesthetist and the surgeon will be blinded to the study groups. The same surgeon&#xD;
      performed all the operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups, if bleeding was uncontrollable and affecting the surgical field, loading dose&#xD;
      of esmolol 500 μg.Kg-1 will be started, followed by infusion of 100-300 mg.Kg-1.min-1. The&#xD;
      use and total dose of esmolol will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAP and HR will recorded before induction of anaesthesia (baseline), immediately after&#xD;
      induction, and every 15 mim till completion of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside the maintenance fluid infusion, intraoperative blood loss will be compensated with&#xD;
      crystalloids in a ratio of 1:3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and complete blood count (CBC) will&#xD;
      be measured before surgery and 6 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will be asked to estimate the surgical field on a 5-point Boezaart scale&#xD;
      immediately at the end of the surgery (table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Surgical field quality based on Boezaart scale. 7 Grade Assessment 0 No bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Slight bleeding, no suction of blood required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Slight bleeding, occasional suction required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Slight bleeding, frequent suction required. Bleeding threatens surgical field few&#xD;
           seconds after suction is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Moderate bleeding, frequent suction required. Bleeding threatens surgical field directly&#xD;
           after suction is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Severe bleeding, constant suction required. Bleeding appears faster than can be removed&#xD;
           by suction. Surgical field severely threatened and surgery not possible&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of postoperative complications including; epistaxis, nausea, vomiting and pain&#xD;
      (using VAS) will be evaluated in the PACU.&#xD;
