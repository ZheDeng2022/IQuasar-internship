      -  Primary purpose: To assess satisfaction with overall improvement in symptoms, including&#xD;
           individual bowel symptoms, after 4 weeks of administration of gQ-lab to patients with&#xD;
           irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary purposes: To assess the correlation between intestinal attachment and&#xD;
           therapeutic effects of gQ-lab through the visual analog scale (VAS) assessment of each&#xD;
           IBS-related symptom and measurement of changes in quality of life and fecal flora in the&#xD;
           placebo group and gQ-lab group after 4 weeks of gQ-lab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess safety, including adverse reactions, vital signs (including weight), physical&#xD;
      examination, and changes in blood test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the rate of positive gut quotient (gQ) values in patients diagnosed with IBS as&#xD;
      per the ROME III criteria. Further, to examine how the ROME III-based symptom scale score&#xD;
      compared with that of the quality of life scale in the gQ questionnaire.&#xD;
