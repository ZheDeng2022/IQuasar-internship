  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate patient perspective on telemedicine used in 3 week&#xD;
      post operative visits for knee and hip arthroplasty. It is hypothesized that patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with telemedicine follow-up is equal to patient satisfaction with in-office&#xD;
      followup. Patient satisfaction will be assessed at the 3-week and 9-week post-operative&#xD;
      timepoints.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 2014 there were 370,770 total hip replacements and 680,150 total knee replacements&#xD;
      performed in the United States. As the elderly proportion of the population continues to&#xD;
      grow, it is estimated that the number of total hip arthroplasty will grow by 71 percent and&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty will grow by 85 percent by the year 2030 (Sloan, M The Journal of&#xD;
      Bone and Joint Surgery 2018). As these numbers continue to rise, health care delivery must&#xD;
      evolve into a more efficient, cost effective system without compromising the quality of the&#xD;
      care delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine involves using electronic communications and software to provide clinical&#xD;
      services to patients in place of an in-person visit. Benefits of telemedicine include&#xD;
      avoiding unnecessary trips to hospitals, saving time, and reducing the number of working days&#xD;
      missed (Asiri, A Acta Inform Med 2018). Used in general surgery followup care, anonymous&#xD;
      survey responses demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction with 85% expressing a desire to&#xD;
      utilize telemedicine for followup care in the future (Nikolian, V Annals of Surgery 2018).&#xD;
      Postoperative telemedicine has been studied in many specialties, but literature exploring its&#xD;
      use in orthopedics has been scant.&#xD;

    <description>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) will be used to assess patient satisfaction of the 3 week encounter both at 3 and 9 weeks post-operatively.&#xD;
The scale of the survey ranges from 8-32, with 32 being the best score and 8 being the worst. The higher a patient scores, the more satisfied the patient is with the care provided.</description>
