    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of talazoparib in combination with&#xD;
      radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with gynecologic cancers&#xD;
      that have come back after previous treatment (recurrent). Talazoparib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving talazoparib in combination&#xD;
      with radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with gynecologic cancers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability, and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of talazoparib&#xD;
      combining talazoparib and fractionated radiotherapy in patients with refractory or recurrent&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, cervical, or vaginal or endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of talazoparib in combination with fractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy for recurrent gynecologic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine a preliminary anti-cancer activity of this combination at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the potential feasibility of using biomarkers in tumor tissue, whole blood or&#xD;
      serum as predictive markers of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the impact of talazoparib when combined with radiotherapy for recurrent&#xD;
      gynecologic cancers on 1) patient reported acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and 2)&#xD;
      overall longitudinal quality of life at week 5 of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of talazoparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on days -10 to -7 and&#xD;
      continuing for up to 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week (Monday-Friday) for up to 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months,&#xD;
      and then every 6 months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
