  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the treatment modalities currently available in this hospital to treat this type of&#xD;
      patients with low back pain who present with chronic pain are the group sessions that are&#xD;
      carried out to provide information to the patient about the anatomy, biomechanics and&#xD;
      ergonomics and are complemented with sessions of physical exercise. Based on the latest&#xD;
      publications on treatment of this type of patients, The investigators have seen that this&#xD;
      intervention is insufficient, and that it could be improved by combining education based on&#xD;
      Therapeutic Neuroscience Education (TNE)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study proposes implementing this program to a randomly assigned group of patients&#xD;
      participating in the group sessions aimed at patients with lumbar pain called &quot;Back-pain&#xD;
      Protocol&quot; that are currently relized in the Physiotherapy Area of a hospital; and compare the&#xD;
      results of this intervention with those obtained in another group that will only carry out&#xD;
      the sessions with the traditional method that is currently used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Process The physiotherapist responsible for programs group to treat chronic back pain (&#xD;
      &quot;Back-pain Protocol&quot;) will be contacted. The study will be explained and material and&#xD;
      training will be provided to carry out the TNE session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be detected and assigned to&#xD;
      the intervention group or to the control group after a randomisation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first session that is currently taking place in the programs to treat&#xD;
      chronic back pain in groups, the physiotherapist will explain the study and will ask them to&#xD;
      collaborate. The information sheet will be provided. Those who decide to participate will&#xD;
      receive an informed consent and some questionnaires to complete: the Numeric Pain Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NPRS) to assess their degree of pain, the Central Sensitization Inventory, the Pain&#xD;
      Catastrophic Scale (Spanish version), the Tampa Kinesiofobia Scale (TSK) &quot;and EuroQol-5D&#xD;
      Cuetionario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions The protocol that is currently carried out consists of five sessions spread&#xD;
      over a month and a half. Patients come in two groups of 10 people each day, with a duration&#xD;
      of one hour, in the Rehabilitation classroom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first session, which consists of an informative talk. The physiotherapist provides&#xD;
      information and explanations about the &quot;back pain protocol&quot;. The physiotherapist explains the&#xD;
      problems of attitude and gestures that can benefit or harm their treatment, their activities&#xD;
      of daily life, their work and the performance of sports activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second, third and fourth sessions, participants learn to do specific exercises for&#xD;
      back pain. Patients receive a booklet with the exercises and postures to adopt in the habits&#xD;
      of daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the fifth and final session, a final review of everything learned is done and the final&#xD;
      evaluation is requested (the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) to assess their degree of pain,&#xD;
      the Central Sensitization Inventory, the Catastrophism Scale of the Pain (Spanish version),&#xD;
      the Tampa Kinesiofobia Scale (TSK) &quot;and EuroQol-5D Cuetionario).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment. This study proposes that only participants assigned to the intervention group will&#xD;
      also receive an additional session of patient education about Therapeutic Neuroscience&#xD;
      Education (TNE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of this session will be one hour and will be carried out the day after the first&#xD;
      informative session of the current protocol, in an additional session. In addition, they will&#xD;
      be provided with information to read and review at home. Only patients who have been randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention group will attend this session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention aims to provide information in a clear and simple way to the participants&#xD;
      so that through it the patients can modify their attitude towards pain, inviting them to&#xD;
      assume a more active and less contemplative role. The physiotherapist will explain in a&#xD;
      simple way to the participants that chronic pain is not always the result of tissue damage.&#xD;
      Neuroscience has shown that it is possible to have persistent pain without damaging the&#xD;
      tissues or with damage that justifies the perception of the disproportion of pain. In&#xD;
      addition, the physiotherapist will explain the difference between acute pain and chronic&#xD;
      pain, central sensitization processes (CS) and endogenous pain control mechanisms. The&#xD;
      physiotherapist will talk about how thoughts, beliefs and emotions modify the painful&#xD;
      experience and how the erroneous information received, and sometimes iatrogenic, modifies the&#xD;
      mechanisms of pain processing. The contents of talks on education in neuroscience are based&#xD;
      on the book Explain Pain.&#xD;

    <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Catastrophic thinking has widely been recognized in the development and maintenance of hypochondriasis and anxiety disorders.The PCS is a 13 item scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). The PCS is broken into three subscales being magnification, rumination, and helplessness. The scale was developed as a self-report measurement tool that provided a valid index of catastrophizing in clinical and non-clinical populations. ranges from '0' representing no pain catastrophizing to '52' representing maximum pain catastrophizing</description>

The TSK is a self-completed questionnaire and the range of scores are from 17 to 68 where the higher scores indicate an increasing degree of kinesiophobia.</description>
