  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: This prospective study investigates the outcomes of daily online stereotactic&#xD;
      MR-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) in patients with localized prostate cancer&#xD;
      (cT1c-T3bN0M0). Visualization of the prostate, rectum and bladder prior to and during&#xD;
      radiation delivery can be used to deliver &quot;gated&quot; treatment (beam-on only when the prostate&#xD;
      is in the predetermined position) using small uncertainty margins. The novel MRIdian&#xD;
      treatment delivery system (ViewRay, USA), which will be used for this study, allows for the&#xD;
      immediate generation of an optimal radiotherapy plan based on the current anatomy of the&#xD;
      prostate and surrounding normal organs prior to each fraction. These major advances will&#xD;
      (i.e. dosimetrically) allow for an optimisation of normal tissue radiation doses, which&#xD;
      should theoretically decrease toxicity to surrounding organs such as the rectum or bladder.&#xD;
      Another advantage of this approach is that online MR-based prostate imaging does not rely on&#xD;
      implanted gold markers, avoiding an invasive procedure to insert such markers. If proven&#xD;
      feasible, this approach could set a new standard of care for patients with localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this phase II study of SMART for prostate cancer is to evaluate the early&#xD;
      and early-delayed toxicity, i.e. within the first year after treatment. An established&#xD;
      5-fraction hypofractionated radiation scheme will be used in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome parameters will include gastro-intestinal, genitourinary and sexual symptoms,&#xD;
      which will be monitored at fixed time points using CTCAE criteria. In addition,&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes will be evaluated using EORTC-QOL questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the early and early-delayed toxicity profile of SMART in patients&#xD;
      with localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:phase II observational study Study population: 100 consecutive patients with&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer (cT1c-T3bN0M0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention: Study patients will be treated with an online MR-guided hypofractionated&#xD;
      course of radiotherapy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy per fraction delivered on the prostate with&#xD;
      a simultaneous integrated sparing of the urethra with a dose of 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions Main&#xD;
      study parameters: Early and early-delayed toxicity (CTCAE v. 4.0); (IPSS) and Qol C30 PR25.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint will be the offline evaluation of the dosimetric benefit of SMART by&#xD;
      comparing cumulative doses to organs at risk.&#xD;

      5-fraction hypofractionated radiation scheme will be used in this trial. At VUmc, experience&#xD;
      with this scheme has been obtained as a result of participation in a recently concluded&#xD;
      multicenter randomized phase II trial [METc NL4181402912; 20012/398]. Main outcome parameters&#xD;
      will include gastro-intestinal- (GI), genitourinary- (GU) and sexual symptoms, which will be&#xD;
      monitored at fixed time points using CTCAE criteria. In addition, patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      will be evaluated using EORTC-QOL questionnaires.&#xD;

      localized prostate cancer (cT1c-T3bN0M0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention: Study patients will be treated with an online MR-guided hypofractionated&#xD;
      course of radiotherapy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy per fraction delivered on the prostate with&#xD;
      a simultaneous integrated sparing (SIS) of the urethra with a dose of 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions&#xD;
      (6.5 Gy per fraction). This stereotactic radiation scheme was also used in [METc&#xD;
      NL4181402912; 20012/398].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: Early and early-delayed toxicity (CTCAE v. 4.0); prostate specific&#xD;
      symptom score (IPSS) and Qol (EORTC-QoL C30 &amp; QLQ Prostate Cancer module (QLQ-PR25)).&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint will be the offline evaluation of the dosimetric benefit of SMART by&#xD;
      comparing cumulative doses to organs at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature, extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: This novel SMART approach could set a new standard of care for patients with&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer by limiting radiation doses to surrounding normal organs and&#xD;
      thereby potentially radiation-induced toxicity. Also, implantation of gold markers would&#xD;
      become unnecessary using MR-guided &quot;gated&quot; radiotherapy. Disadvantages for patients include&#xD;
      the need to be positioned within the MRI bore during radiation delivery, and a prolonged time&#xD;
      per treatment fraction (estimated at 30 minutes per fraction), which has to be weighed&#xD;
      against the use of a total of only five fractions. As the radiation fractionation scheme that&#xD;
      is used in this study has been evaluated in prior trials, no further patient-related risks&#xD;
      are anticipated.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Patients with localized prostate cancer with a clinical stage T1-3b, with a maximal volume&#xD;
        of 90 cc on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and no suspicious lymph nodes observed on either&#xD;
        a diagnostic MRI or CT scan and no signs of distant metastases on radiological staging are&#xD;
        eligible. All patients will be discussed in the multidisciplinary board (MDO) with an&#xD;
        urologist, medical oncologist, radiologist, pathologist and a radiation oncologist, all&#xD;
        specialized in the treatment of prostate cancer. If the MDO treatment advise comprises&#xD;
        external beam radiotherapy, patient eligibility for the study will be assessed, and the&#xD;
        treating radiation oncologist will discuss the study with the patient and family.&#xD;
