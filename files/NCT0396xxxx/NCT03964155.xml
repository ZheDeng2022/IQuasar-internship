  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the protein composition of simultaneously&#xD;
      collected undiluted pulmonary edema fluid and AnaConDa-S ® fluid from patients with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous pilot randomized controlled trial, in patients with moderate-severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the use of inhaled sevoflurane improved oxygenation and&#xD;
      decreased levels of a marker of lung epithelial injury (soluble receptor for advanced&#xD;
      glycation end-products, sRAGE) and of some inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α), compared to intravenous midazolam. These results&#xD;
      reinforce those from previously published preclinical studies as they suggest a protective&#xD;
      effect of sevoflurane from alveolar/systemic inflammation and from reduced epithelial injury&#xD;
      and/or improved alveolar fluid clearance, as assessed by plasma soluble receptor for advanced&#xD;
      glycation end-products (sRAGE). The results from available studies support the safe use of&#xD;
      sevoflurane inhalation through dedicated device is well tolerated, with no major adverse&#xD;
      effect, e.g. on renal function or respiratory mechanics, in critically ill patients admitted&#xD;
      to the intensive care unit (ICU), including those with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the investigators group frequently uses sevoflurane in patients with ARDS and are&#xD;
      interested in developing further research on the effects of inhaled sedation in ARDS, the&#xD;
      current study has been designed to verify whether the same concept could be applied to the&#xD;
      filter the investigators use to vaporize sevoflurane in their ICUs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (within 24 hours of onset) and already receiving&#xD;
      inhaled sevoflurane for sedation as a current practice in participating centers will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an exposure duration of at least 12 hours, a sample of directly-aspirated, undiluted&#xD;
      pulmonary edema fluid will be collected concurrently with AnaConDa-S®filter collection. This&#xD;
      sample will be the only specific intervention of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data prospectively collected from the medical record will include demographics, ARDS&#xD;
      risk factor, chest x-ray, ventilator settings at the time of AnaConDa-S ® filter collection,&#xD;
      hospital and ICU length of stay and hospital mortality. Murray's lung injury score and the&#xD;
      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score will be calculated from data&#xD;
      already available in the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AnaConDa-S ® filters will transported to the laboratory on ice and centrifuged at 2,000 x g&#xD;
      for 10 minutes to collect condensed fluid that will be subsequently aliquoted and stored at&#xD;
      -80°C for further analysis. Undiluted pulmonary edema fluid will be centrifuged at 2,000 x g&#xD;
      for 10 minutes. Supernatants will be aliquoted and stored at - 80°C. Levels of IL-1β, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-8, TNF-α, soluble TNF-receptor 1, angiopoietin-2, and sRAGE will be measured in duplicate&#xD;
      in both types of fluid with Multiplex.&#xD;

    <measure>Comparaison between levels of protein markers, measured IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, soluble TNF-receptor 1, angiopoietin-2, and sRAGE, measured in undiluted pulmonary edema fluid and in AnaConDa-S ® fluid</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 12 hours and 24 hours after the begining of Sevoflurane sedation</time_frame>
    <description>After an exposure duration of at least 12 hours, and when clinically available, a sample of directly-aspirated, undiluted pulmonary edema fluid will be collected (in general, only few ml are collected) concurrently with AnaConDa-S® filter collection. The concordance between levels of markers measured from undiluted alveolar fluid and those measured from AnaConDa-S® fluid will be explored using Lin's concordance coefficient, correlation coefficient (Pearson or Spearman according to the statistical distribution) and Bland-Altman plot. Confidence intervals at 95% will be presented. To complete these analyses, the satisfactory agreement will be confirmed by Passing and Bablok regression in order to highlight non-systematic and non-proportional differences between the two methods (undiluted pulmonary edema fluid and AnaConDa-S® fluid).</description>
