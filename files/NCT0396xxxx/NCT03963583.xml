  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) patients with supportive caregivers have better physical health, emotional&#xD;
      health, and quality of life. But caregivers have an increased risk of caregivers' own&#xD;
      worsening health and often feel a sense of burden related to caregiving. However, caregivers&#xD;
      receive very little support to balance caring for the patient with caring for themselves.&#xD;
      Therefore, this research will provide a program for caregivers of advanced heart failure&#xD;
      patients to build on the caregiver's strengths, sense of purpose, and set goals for healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle changes. The investigators believe that caregivers who receive the program will&#xD;
      have better quality of life, less sense of burden, and a healthier lifestyle.&#xD;

      Aim 1) Develop the intervention through focus groups and human-centered design with key&#xD;
      stakeholders with particular focus on race, gender and financial strain. Key stakeholders&#xD;
      including patients, caregivers and healthcare providers will discuss prototypes and refine&#xD;
      intervention components through human-centered design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2) Refine intervention components through an open label pilot (N=5) of the intervention,&#xD;
      followed by in-depth interviews. We will assess the salient features of the novel&#xD;
      intervention components using mixed methods including examination of all quantitative&#xD;
      measures and qualitative interviews to explore acceptability, participant/interventionist&#xD;
      interactions, home environment factors, goal achievement and perceived value of intervention.&#xD;
      Intervention components will be adapted for the trial based on results of aims 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3) Conduct a single-masked, waitlist control pilot trial of the HEROIC intervention&#xD;
      (N=50). We hypothesize that caregivers who receive the intervention will show greater&#xD;
      improvement in primary outcomes (preventive health behaviors, caregiver burden and QOL) and&#xD;
      potential mechanisms (self-efficacy and biomarkers of resilience [interleukins 6 and 10])&#xD;
      than control caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Caregivers will be randomized using a computer algorithm via REDCap to receive&#xD;
      either: (1) intervention or (2) waitlist. Random assignment will be stratified by spousal vs&#xD;
      non-spousal caregivers due to increased burden among non-spousal caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waitlisted Control Group: The waitlisted group will receive usual care for caregivers for the&#xD;
      first 16 weeks, which is normally limited to inclusion in some clinical assessment and&#xD;
      teaching during patient visits. Waitlisted participants will receive monthly study postcards&#xD;
      to encourage retention. After 16 weeks, they will begin the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Key Stakeholder meetings will be held at the Johns Hopkins University School of&#xD;
      Nursing, which is located within walking distance of the Heart Failure Bridge Clinic and&#xD;
      supported by the Community Research Advisory Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims 2-3: Study visits will be conducted in the home of the caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Components&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be guided by the theory and evidence-based practices that have been&#xD;
      successful in previous work. For the proposed study, every participant will receive each&#xD;
      component of the intervention but interventionists will tailor content to each participant's&#xD;
      goals. The investigators will focus on overall preventive health behaviors broadly&#xD;
      categorized as physical activity, stress management, rest, healthy diet and appropriate&#xD;
      healthcare utilization. As part of the intervention, the nurse and the caregiver will discuss&#xD;
      preventive health categories. In this conversation, the caregiver will prioritize the&#xD;
      preventive health categories that they would most like to address and then set goals towards&#xD;
      them. Allowing the caregiver maximum control over this goal-setting, without placing&#xD;
      additional burden on the caregiver is one aspect of increasing self-efficacy and&#xD;
      person-centeredness. Because the intervention will allow participants to pick their own&#xD;
      health goals, the investigators will measure goal attainment related to preventive health&#xD;
      behaviors, rather than a standardized survey of predetermined preventive health behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Delivery/Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention delivery characteristics will consist of an assessment-driven, tailored&#xD;
      package of interventions delivered by a nurse interventionist. Nurse interventionists will be&#xD;
      trained and equipped with education materials vetted by national organizations leading&#xD;
      preventive health research such as the American Heart Association (Healthy for Good) and&#xD;
      National Institute of Aging (Go4Life). The investigators propose an intervention&#xD;
      incorporating 3 individualized, nurse-led, home-based sessions, with telephone check-ins and&#xD;
      text reminders, according to participant preference. Baseline, 16 and 32-week data will be&#xD;
      collected by interviewers masked to treatment assignment and without interventionist contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse will meet with the caregiver to perform the initial assessment in which the nurse&#xD;
      will focus on preventive health behaviors and factors contributing to a sense of burden. To&#xD;
      build rapport and model the importance of physical activity, the nurse will allow the&#xD;
      caregiver to choose a short physical activity (ie. Walk around the block, 2 minutes of&#xD;
      dancing etc). In this assessment, the nurse and the caregiver identify and prioritize goals,&#xD;
      and make plans to achieve those goals. The nurse will provide the HEROIC Handbook, which will&#xD;
      be developed following aim 1 and include evidence-based educational materials, contact&#xD;
      information, and a calendar of sessions that the participant keeps for reference. In each&#xD;
      session, the nurse assesses goal attainment, reinforces strategy use, reviews&#xD;
      problem-solving, refines strategies (such as Go4Life physical activities and Healthy for Good&#xD;
      materials), and provides education and resources to address future needs. Following the&#xD;
      session, the nurse will find additional resources, tailored to each caregiver. In the final&#xD;
      session, the nurse reviews the participants' strategies and helps to generalize them to other&#xD;
      possible challenges or goals. Sessions will be spaced to encourage practicing new strategies&#xD;
      independently after developing them together with the nurse. Although this intervention&#xD;
      structure has been successful in work by the mentorship team, the investigators will adjust&#xD;
      the timing and frequency of study visits based on feedback in phases 1 and 2. Bi-monthly&#xD;
      meetings of the nurse with the site Research Coordinator and the principal investigator will&#xD;
      ensure smooth communication, address challenges, supervision, and adherence to intervention&#xD;
      fidelity.&#xD;
