    <measure>Change From Baseline on the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5-level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) Health Status Index Score Japan</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 Hours Postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L was assessed based the EQ-5D-5L Health Status Index Score. The Japan specific tariffs (Japanese population-based index value) was used. The EQ-5D-5L is a participant rated, 2-part questionnaire. The first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). The health state index score was calculated based on the responses to the 5 dimensions, providing a single value on a scale from less than 0 (where 0 is a health state equivalent to death; negative values are valued as worse than death) to 1 (perfect health), with higher scores indicating better health utility.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5-level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 Hours Postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a participant rated, 2-part questionnaire. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analog scale on which the participant rates their perceived health state from 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health you can imagine).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Very Much or Much Better as Measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Hours Postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-C is a one-item questionnaire that asks participants to provide their impression of change since taking the medicine. The PGI-C is measured using a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 = very much better, 2 = much better, 3 = a little better, 4 = no change, 5 = a little worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. Percentage of participants who are responders defined as having rated their impression of change as &quot;very much better&quot; or &quot;much better&quot; at 2 hours postdose.</description>

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Total Score as Measured by the 24-Hour Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQoLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Hours Postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The HRQoL is a 15-item, self-administered questionnaire. The items cover 5 domains (work functioning, social functioning, energy and vitality, feelings and concerns, and migraine symptoms). Each domain consists of 3 questions answered on a 7-point scale there 1 indicates maximum impairment and 7 indicating no impairment. A domain score is calculated by summing the responses to the 3 questions and the domain score ranges from 3 to 21, where a lower score indicates greater impairment, and a higher score indicates less impairment. The questionnaire will be administered 24 hours after the study drug.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5-level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) Health Status Index Score Japan</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L was assessed based the EQ-5D-5L Health Status Index Score. The Japan specific tariffs (Japanese population-based index value) was used. The EQ-5D-5L is a participant rated, 2-part questionnaire. The first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). The health state index score was calculated based on the responses to the 5 dimensions, providing a single value on a scale from less than 0 (where 0 is a health state equivalent to death; negative values are valued as worse than death) to 1 (perfect health), with higher scores indicating better health utility.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Very Much or Much Better as Measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C)</title>
        <description>The PGI-C is a one-item questionnaire that asks participants to provide their impression of change since taking the medicine. The PGI-C is measured using a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 = very much better, 2 = much better, 3 = a little better, 4 = no change, 5 = a little worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. Percentage of participants who are responders defined as having rated their impression of change as &quot;very much better&quot; or &quot;much better&quot; at 2 hours postdose.</description>

        <title>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Total Score as Measured by the 24-Hour Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQoLQ)</title>
        <description>The HRQoL is a 15-item, self-administered questionnaire. The items cover 5 domains (work functioning, social functioning, energy and vitality, feelings and concerns, and migraine symptoms). Each domain consists of 3 questions answered on a 7-point scale there 1 indicates maximum impairment and 7 indicating no impairment. A domain score is calculated by summing the responses to the 3 questions and the domain score ranges from 3 to 21, where a lower score indicates greater impairment, and a higher score indicates less impairment. The questionnaire will be administered 24 hours after the study drug.</description>
