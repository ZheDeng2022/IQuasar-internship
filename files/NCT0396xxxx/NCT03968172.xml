  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial with an accompanying process evaluation investigates the&#xD;
      hypothesis that behavioural and web-based information on immunotherapy decisions, disease&#xD;
      management and lifestyle can change patient behaviour resulting in reduced inflammatory&#xD;
      disease activity in multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, uncertainty and psychological stress may have a&#xD;
      negative effect on the disease course, while psychological counselling may reduce&#xD;
      inflammatory activity. Therefore, especially newly diagnosed patients require intensive and&#xD;
      individual support to deal with the disease and to initiate lifestyle changes. This is hardly&#xD;
      available in standard care. Systematic, evidence-based patient information on the value of&#xD;
      lifestyle change is not available either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER@MS1 aims to encourage patients with MS to find the best way of dealing with the disease&#xD;
      on the basis of evidence-based patient information (EBPI) and a complex behaviour change&#xD;
      intervention. The platform will serve as a disease accompanying empowerment programme.&#xD;
      Various modules will be provided to accompany patients with MS (pwMS) at an early stage of&#xD;
      the disease. The multicomponent intervention will offer comprehensive support after&#xD;
      diagnosis, which includes, firstly, an immunotherapy decision-support programme aligned with&#xD;
      principles of shared decision-making (SDM), and, secondly, a behaviour-change intervention&#xD;
      promoting disease management and lifestyle habits over a period of one year. Ideally,&#xD;
      POWER@MS1 leads to a more targeted immunotherapy start, and consequently to better adherence&#xD;
      and optimization of a preventive effective lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if a web-based behavioural intervention on immunotherapy decision making,&#xD;
      disease management, and lifestyle can reduce the inflammatory disease activity in MS (a&#xD;
      relapse or - as a surrogate for inflammatory disease activity - new T2 lesions on magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine if the web-based intervention can&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  strengthen patient autonomy and empowerment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  promote informed decisions on immunotherapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve quality of life,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce anxiety and depression,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase physical activity and a healthy diet,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase effectiveness of neurologists encounters,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and save health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to develop and evaluate the intervention, a multiphase mixed-methods study covering&#xD;
      the first three phases of the Medical Research Council Framework for complex interventions&#xD;
      will be conducted. After development, the intervention programme will be pretested and&#xD;
      piloted with experts and persons with MS (pwMS). The intervention will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 328 patients with early MS (&lt; 12 months), who have at&#xD;
      least two MS-typical lesions. Study participants will be recruited in 16 MS centres across&#xD;
      Germany and randomised to an intervention group with access to an evidence-based information&#xD;
      platform or to a control group with optimised standard care based on material of the German&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis Society (DMSG). The primary endpoint will be reached if new T2 lesions or&#xD;
      relapses occur. Furthermore, a mixed methods process evaluation and a health economic&#xD;
      evaluation will be carried out.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The study will be conducted as an investigator blinded trial and participating physicians as well as MS centres in general will not be provided with any information about the group assignment. Randomisation will take place only after baseline documentation. Blinding of the trial participants is pursued, but only possible to a limited extent. Furthermore, it cannot be prevented that patients discuss the intervention contents with their physician. Thus, participants and neurologist might realize their participation in the intervention group. While blinding in behavioural interventions is virtually not possible, the only strategy to increase similarity of groups is to have an active control group which we aim for with the optimized standard care group.</masking_description>
