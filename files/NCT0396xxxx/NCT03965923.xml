      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maternal and infant safety of the dapivirine&#xD;
      (DPV) vaginal ring (VR) and daily oral Truvada in HIV-uninfected pregnant women and their&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of four cohorts based on gestational age:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 36 0/7 weeks - 37 6/7 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 30 0/7 weeks - 35 6/7 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 20 0/7 weeks - 29 6/7 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: 12 0/7 weeks - 19 6/7 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each cohort, participants will be randomized to receive either DPV VR or oral Truvada.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the DPV VR will use the VR continuously for approximately one&#xD;
      month, replacing the VR each month. Participants taking the Truvada tablet will take one&#xD;
      tablet orally per day. Participants will use their assigned study product until their&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome, but no later than 41 6/7 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend several study visits throughout the study and study staff will also&#xD;
      contact participants by phone at different timepoints throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of study participation will vary depending on gestational age at time of&#xD;
      enrollment and length of pregnancy prior to pregnancy outcome, and will range from&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks or less for Cohort 1 to approximately 36 weeks or less for Cohort 4.&#xD;
      Infants born to study participants will be followed for approximately 52 weeks.&#xD;
