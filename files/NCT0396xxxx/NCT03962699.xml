      Increasing evidence suggests that non-communicable diseases such as in particular obesity and&#xD;
      its associated metabolic diseases are inherited from parents to children throughout several&#xD;
      generations by epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, this environmental stress would induce epigenetic&#xD;
      modification in the germ line that once transmitted and maintained in the progeny would&#xD;
      induce the development of the parental pathologies. Considering the increasing prevalence of&#xD;
      these pathologies worldwide, we urgently need to understand this process in human. Based on&#xD;
      published and unpublished data demonstrating that sperm RNAs are vectors of epigenetic&#xD;
      inheritance of obesity mouse model, the investigative team hypothesizes that epitranscriptome&#xD;
      of obese men play a central role in the paternal epigenetic inheritance of obesity and its&#xD;
      associated metabolic diseases as epigenetic vectors in this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate this hypothesis, the investigative team will use sperm from non-obese and obese&#xD;
      men taken before and after surgery weight loss. Thanks to these cohorts, they propose to: (i)&#xD;
      compare the epitranscriptome profiles of non-obese and obese men to identify the RNAs&#xD;
      molecules which will be either qualitatively or quantitatively epigenetically modulated by&#xD;
      obesity; (ii) compare the epitranscriptome profiles of obese men before and after&#xD;
      surgery-weight loss to assess the reversibility of the newly acquired RNA modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Giving some answers to this central question will provide not only some clues about the&#xD;
      molecular mechanisms involved in this process, elements which might be crucial to stop the&#xD;
      spread of this disorder, but will also allow the identification of obese-susceptibility loci&#xD;
      which expression may be modulate by environmental factors and consequently able to transmit&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;

      1. Background and present state of the art in the research field. Sperm non-coding RNA is&#xD;
           an important vector for epigenetic inheritance of diet-induced obesity Obesity is a&#xD;
           multifactorial pathology associated with a high heritability (50-75%). To date, multiple&#xD;
           Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have attempted and failed to identify the genetic&#xD;
           factors that contribute to the etiopathogenesis of obesity. In fact, the variance&#xD;
           explained by a high Body Mass Index (BMI) at these GWAS mutations is very low, estimated&#xD;
           to be approximately 2%[1]. Recent epidemiological and experimental studies strongly&#xD;
           suggest that this high heritability of obesity might be associated with the transmission&#xD;
           of obesity-induced epigenetic modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Non-genetic inheritance of a newly acquired phenotype is a concept in biology whereby&#xD;
           changes induced by a specific signal and/or environmental stress can be passed to the&#xD;
           next generation in the absence of a genetic change [2, 3]. The biological relevance of&#xD;
           this process is proven by its diversification in various organisms including plants,&#xD;
           insects, nematodes, and mammals [4, 5]. However, evidence is now emerging that a wide&#xD;
           range of dietary factors including fats and proteins lead to changes in gene expression&#xD;
           that are maintained through mitotic and meiotic divisions[6]. These changes can&#xD;
           significantly impact the health of the offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Very recently, the investigator has gained some insight into the molecular mechanisms&#xD;
           involved in this process, in particular those that pertain to the epigenetic inheritance&#xD;
           of newly acquired paternal pathologies [7] However, much remains to be uncovered about&#xD;
           the functional and molecular characterization underlying the mode of action of the&#xD;
           specific factors responsible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Changes in DNA methylation [8-10], chromatin modification [11] and expression levels of&#xD;
           non-coding small RNA, including miRNA, piRNA and transfer RNA fragments [12-14] occur in&#xD;
           germ cells upon changes in environmental cues. However, it is not clear whether these&#xD;
           changes would mediate epigenetic inheritance. While several studies have indicated that&#xD;
           an altered DNA methylation signature of spermatozoa from HFD-obese individuals could be&#xD;
           transmitted to progeny [8], a recent study indicated that the sperm methylome is shaped&#xD;
           by genetic and epigenetic variations, but not diet [15], thus disproving the idea that&#xD;
           DNA methylation is the vector of epigenetic inheritance in this HFD model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on this first evidence showing that small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) act as&#xD;
           trans-generational vectors of epigenetic information in mice [16], the investigative&#xD;
           team and others extended this discovery by deep investigation of the role of sperm small&#xD;
           RNAs as determinants of the inheritance in an acquired metabolic disorder [12-14]. In&#xD;
           this regard, experimental approaches include the micro-injection of one-cell embryos&#xD;
           with well-defined sperm RNAs from individuals fed by high-fat (HFD) or control diet&#xD;
           (CD). They found that mice derived from the microinjection of HFD sperm RNAs into naive&#xD;
           one-cell embryos developed adult onset diet-induced pathologies, such as obesity or&#xD;
           signs of type 2 diabetes even though they had been fed a control diet [14].&#xD;
           Deep-sequencing analysis of small RNAs of testis from HFD-fed animals and control&#xD;
           revealed that several small-RNAs are indeed deregulated upon HFD. Among those small&#xD;
           RNAs, we found miRNAs, piRNAs and tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNA). Importantly,&#xD;
           microinjection into naive one-cell embryos of one of the deregulated microRNAs - namely&#xD;
           microRNA-19b, induced metabolic alterations that were similar to the diet-induced&#xD;
           phenotypes. Likewise, other groups found that tsRNA may also contribute to&#xD;
           intergenerational inheritance of metabolic disorders. Indeed, Chen et al. showed that&#xD;
           micro-injecting sperm tsRNAs from HFD-fed individuals into naive one-cell embryos caused&#xD;
           impaired glucose tolerance in the resulting offspring [12]. However, in this model,&#xD;
           synthetic microRNAs or synthetic tsRNAs did not induce metabolic disorders in the&#xD;
           offspring, suggesting a role of post-transcriptional RNA modifications in the transfer&#xD;
           of epigenetic information. This hypothesis is consistent with the elevated levels of m5C&#xD;
           and m2G modifications of tsRNAs in sperm from the HFD group [12]. Hence, sperm small&#xD;
           RNAs represent a type of paternal epigenetic vector involved in intergenerational&#xD;
           inheritance of diet-induced metabolic phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The majority of data on RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance are from mouse models&#xD;
           [12-14]. Whether this mechanism is conserved in human as yet unknown. Noteworthy, a&#xD;
           study performed in human by Donkin et al. indicated that obesity might modify the sperm&#xD;
           epigenetic landscape as well as sperm epitranscriptome. However, epigenetic and&#xD;
           transcriptomic analysis were performed in only a small number of men[17] Taken together&#xD;
           these observations from human and rodent studies suggest that obesity-induced small RNA&#xD;
           changes are transmitted to the next generation, and then result in heritable metabolic&#xD;
           changes. However, although in rodents the obesity-induced changes have been quite well&#xD;
           described, the impact of obesity on the sperm epitranscriptome/epigenome in human&#xD;
           remains an open question of urgency in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reversal of the obesity-induced epigenetic changes: a hope for the next generation?&#xD;
           Although epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable, they are erased and&#xD;
           re-established twice during development [18]. This reprogramming takes place early in&#xD;
           embryogenesis and during gametogenesis in primordial germ cells that will give rise to&#xD;
           eggs and sperm. [18]. Furthermore, phenotypes conferred by environmental compromise can&#xD;
           also be reversed via active intervention, such as change to healthy diet or physic&#xD;
           exercise during the preconception period [19, 20]. It is not understood whether there is&#xD;
           a relationship between developmental reprogramming and reversibility of environmentally&#xD;
           induced phenotypic states. Although the erasure of these newly established modifications&#xD;
           has been clearly described in rodents [20, 21] only limited studies have been addressed&#xD;
           in human [17, 22, 23]. Those studies only focused on DNA methylation pattern modulated&#xD;
           by obesity in somatic and germ cells. To date, nothing is known about the reversibility&#xD;
           of trans-generational epigenetic RNA in human sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preliminary results Obesity negatively impacts on sperm epigenome and early embryonic&#xD;
           development in human&#xD;
&#xD;
           After having demonstrated the role of sperm RNA (small and long RNA) in paternal&#xD;
           heredity of obesity and its associated diseases, the investigative team is currently&#xD;
           investigating the relevance of sperm RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance of metabolic&#xD;
           disorders in human. To achieve this goal, they have carried out two complementary sets&#xD;
           of experiments. First, they recently found that the development capacity of human&#xD;
           embryos derived from obese men was impaired and noted that pre-implantation embryo&#xD;
           morphokinetic parameters were altered when sperm derived from obese fathers was used to&#xD;
           fertilize oocytes (Raad et al. 2019), suggesting obesity induced epigenetic changes in&#xD;
           sperm. Then, to determine whether obesity induced sperm small-non coding RNA&#xD;
           dysregulation in human, they performed a small RNA-seq differential expression analysis&#xD;
           between obese and non-obese subjects. Briefly, upon multivariant analysis (Principal&#xD;
           Component Analysis, PCA), they identified distinct small RNA profiles between obese and&#xD;
           lean men. However, while sperm small RNA profiles among lean men (N1, N2, N3 and N4&#xD;
           samples) were homogeneous, small RNA profiles among obese men (O1, O2, O3 and O4&#xD;
           samples) were very heterogeneous, suggesting stochastic dysregulation of sperm small RNA&#xD;
           expression in obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Together, our results highlight the negative impacts of excessive weight mass on the&#xD;
           sperm epi-transcriptome and human early embryo development and strongly suggest that&#xD;
           paternal obesity negatively affects the sperm epigenome and subsequently influences the&#xD;
           health of the descendants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Descriptive of the objectives Based on the published and unpublished data described&#xD;
           above, the investigative team hypothesize that epi-transcriptomes are responsive to&#xD;
           transient environmental changes such as obesity, leading to modulation of the progeny's&#xD;
           epigenomes in human and subsequently to the development of the father's phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate this hypothesis, the investigator will use sperm collected from 2 groups of men:&#xD;
      the first group will be composed of non-obese men and the second one will be composed of&#xD;
      obese men taken before and after weight loss induced by surgery. Thanks to these cohorts, we&#xD;
      propose to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the sperm epitranscriptomic signature of obese men Team 1 has recently&#xD;
           demonstrated that sperm RNAs are vectors of epigenetic inheritance of obesity and its&#xD;
           associated pathologies in mice. In parallel, while confirming the role of these RNAs in&#xD;
           epigenetic inheritance, two other independent groups have shown the involvement of RNA&#xD;
           posttranscriptional modifications in this process in mice. However, it is important to&#xD;
           determine whether such process exists for human. By combining the complementary&#xD;
           expertise of three groups in either epigenetic inheritance in mice (Team1) and in the&#xD;
           handling and collection of human sperm samples (Teams 2 and 3), the investigative team&#xD;
           will have the opportunity to answer this unresolved question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the reversibility of the sperm epitranscriptomic signature of obese men The&#xD;
           question of reversibility of sperm epigenetic signature induced by obesity in human is&#xD;
           an important question in term of public health. Barrey's group has recently shown a&#xD;
           possible reversion of obesity-induced epigenetic upon surgically incurred-weight loss.&#xD;
           However, this study relies on sperm DNA methylation studies [17]. The role of DNA&#xD;
           methylation as vector of epigenetic inheritance of obesity remains to be established,&#xD;
           however, we and others have recently demonstrated the involvement of sperm&#xD;
           epitranscriptome in this process in mice, [12, 14]. The possible reversibility of these&#xD;
           obese-induced epitranscriptomic changes remains to be demonstrated both in mice and in&#xD;
           human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of bariatric surgery with weight loss on metabolic health in progeny of obese&#xD;
      fathers could be, in principle, studied directly on human cohorts. However, the few&#xD;
      longitudinal studies currently available from offspring born after parental weight loss are&#xD;
      based on maternal weight loss studies [22, 24, 25]. These results are not only inconsistent&#xD;
      but also biased by the fact that the surgery procedure leads to malnutrition risks in the&#xD;
      mother. Given the importance of nutrition during pregnancy, the potential impact of surgical&#xD;
      weight loss on gametic epigenomic reversibility and on metabolic health of offspring could&#xD;
      not be evaluated in this context. By performing comparison of epitranscriptomic profiles&#xD;
      between obese men before and after surgery, the investigative team will bring new insights&#xD;
      into this very important biological question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigative team expect that this proposal will provide clues about the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in this process, and will allow the identification of&#xD;
      obese-susceptibility loci as well, which their expression may be modulated by environmental&#xD;
      factors and consequently affects the inheritance of the disease.&#xD;
