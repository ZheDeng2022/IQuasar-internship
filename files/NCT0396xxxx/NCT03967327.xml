  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study&#xD;
      with BUP TDS 20 mg (release rate 35 µg/h), 30 mg (release rate 52.5 µg/h) and 40 mg (release&#xD;
      rate 70 µg/h), and MOR SR 60 mg, 100 mg or 120 mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 phases: a Pre-randomisation Phase, a Double-blind Phase and a Safety&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 194 subjects to be randomized, with 97 randomized subjects in each arm to&#xD;
      ensure 154 evaluable (per protocol population) subjects in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AE data are obtained by the Investigators through observation of the Subject (including&#xD;
      examinations and investigations), from any information volunteered by the Subject and through&#xD;
      active questioning. At each visit after informed consent has been signed, Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked about AEs that occurred since the last visit by questioning them with regard to their&#xD;
      well-being by &quot;non-leading&quot; questions. This includes AEs occurring during the administration&#xD;
      of IMP, as well as changes in concomitant diseases (e.g. ongoing medical history). The&#xD;
      general type of questions could be similar to &quot;Do you have any health problems?&quot; or &quot;Have you&#xD;
      had any health problems since your last clinic visit?&quot; During blinded studies, the Subject&#xD;
      and all personnel involved with the conduct and interpretation of the study, including the&#xD;
      Investigators, site personnel, and the Sponsor's staff, those involved in processing and&#xD;
      regulatory reporting of SUSARs, will be blinded to the treatment codes until unblinding. The&#xD;
      randomisation schedule will be filed securely by the Sponsor/IRS provider in a manner such&#xD;
      that blinding is properly maintained throughout the study. Treatment codes will not be&#xD;
      available until unblinding, after completion of the study and data base lock, except in the&#xD;
      case of emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed by a designated CRO. All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using SAS and/or other statistical software as required.&#xD;

             recorded at the screening visit, be non-lactating, and willing to use adequate and&#xD;
             reliable contraception throughout the study. Highly effective (adequate and reliable)&#xD;
             methods of birth control are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e.&#xD;

             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs (intrauterine Device,&#xD;
             hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented history of moderate to severe, chronic cancer pain that in the&#xD;
             investigators' opinion requires around-the-clock opioid therapy in opioid pre-treated&#xD;
             subjects and are likely to benefit from chronic opioid therapy through the&#xD;
             administration of BUP TDS (20 mg, 30 mg or 40 mg) or MOR SR (60 mg/d, 100 mg/d or 120&#xD;
             mg/d) for the duration of the study. Subjects must be willing to discontinue their&#xD;
             routine current opioid analgesic.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. In the investigators' opinion the subject's pre-study, non-opioid analgesics, and all&#xD;
             other concomitant medications, including those medications for the treatment of&#xD;
             depression, will remain stable throughout the double-blind phase of the study, and&#xD;
             will be continued under the supervision of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects, who are able to read, understand and sign written informed consent prior to&#xD;
             study participation and are willing to follow the protocol requirements.&#xD;

             disease, as determined by medical history, clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
             Electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and physical examination, that will place the subject&#xD;
             at risk upon exposure to the study treatment or that could confound the analysis&#xD;
             and/or interpretation of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST; SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT; SGPT),&#xD;

             limit of normal) or an abnormal total bilirubin and/or creatinine level(s) (&gt; 1.5&#xD;
             times the upper limit of normal), due to moderate to severe hepatic impairment and/or&#xD;
             renal impairment, in the investigators' opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Radiotherapy that, in the investigators' opinion, would influence pain during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

             study that has shown in the past to significantly influence pain assessment or safety&#xD;
             profile of subjects (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). If subjects are having their&#xD;
             first cycle of chemotherapy during the 2 weeks before the screening visit or during&#xD;
             the study they should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with known or suspected unstable brain metastases or spinal cord compression&#xD;
             that may require changes in systemic steroid treatment throughout the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with uncontrolled seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with head injury, other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Surgery completed 2 months prior to the screening visit, or planned surgery during the&#xD;
             study that may have influence on pain during the study or preclude completion of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects receiving opioid substitution therapy for opioid addiction (e.g. methadone or&#xD;
             buprenorphine).&#xD;
