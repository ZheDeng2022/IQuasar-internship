    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 3 different corn flours: (1) whole&#xD;
      grain corn flour, (2) 50% refined corn flour + 50% corn bran derived from whole corn meal,&#xD;
      and (3) refined corn flour, on cardio-metabolic outcomes and changes in the gut microbiome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fibers are extremely complex and foster health in a variety of ways that are not&#xD;
      fully understood. The Adequate Intake of fiber (14 g per 1000 kcal consumed) is based on data&#xD;
      that strongly support a relationship with cardiovascular disease prevention (Slavin, 2013).&#xD;
      While cereal fibers have been shown to be most effective at reducing cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk (IOM, 2002), the components of dietary fiber (e.g. germ, bran) that exert this effect&#xD;
      remain inadequately studied in cardiometabolic outcomes. Further, specific types of dietary&#xD;
      fiber (natural and synthetic) have been shown to increase beneficial microbial species in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, which are accompanied by improvements in inflammatory and metabolic&#xD;
      disease markers. Very little is known about how isolated or intact fiber in whole grains&#xD;
      solicit beneficial health effects via microbial mechanisms. Our goal is to study both changes&#xD;
      in cardiometabolic outcomes and the gut microbiome after consuming different types of&#xD;
      corn-based meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate cardio-metabolic outcomes (primary outcome: LDL cholesterol) after&#xD;
      consuming 48 g/d of whole grain corn flour, 50% refined corn flour + 50% corn bran derived&#xD;
      from whole corn meal, and refined corn flour for 4 weeks in adult males and females with&#xD;
      elevated LDL cholesterol in a crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate changes in the gut microbiome after consuming 48 g/d of whole grain corn&#xD;
      flour, 50% refined corn flour + 50% corn bran derived from whole corn meal, and refined corn&#xD;
      flour for 4 weeks in adult males and females with elevated LDL cholesterol in a crossover&#xD;
      design.&#xD;

    <description>Fecal gut microbiome communities will be sequenced using microbial DNA extracted from samples at 0 and 4 weeks for each cornmeal intervention. Amplified copies of the 16S rRNA gene will be evaluated for treatment differences in alpha (within-sample richness and evenness) and beta diversity (between-sample community structure). Relative and differential abundance of individual microbial taxa will also be measured.</description>
