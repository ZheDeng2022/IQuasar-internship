  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Records of Scotland population projections show the pension age population&#xD;
      increasing by 25% over the next 25 years. Falls are a major cause of hospitalisation in older&#xD;
      adults, one in three community dwelling older adults over 65 years of age fall each year.&#xD;
      There is a need to explore novel methods of delivering care to a growing older adult&#xD;
      population. A programme of exercise called OTAGO has been found to reduce the number of falls&#xD;
      for older adults. Several studies have explored the use of students to lead exercise&#xD;
      interventions but these have not included assessing the impact to student educational&#xD;
      experiences and outcomes with varying degrees of success on patient outcomes and no adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim: To examine the feasibility of a student-led exercise intervention in improving&#xD;
      falls risk outcomes for community dwelling older adults at risk of falling referred from NHS&#xD;
      falls services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A feasibility study examining a single patient group undertaking a 12 week,&#xD;
      student-led, OTAGO exercise class for community dwelling older adults at Glasgow Caledonian&#xD;
      University. OTAGO consists of progressive strength and balance exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened, invited to consent to the trial, asked to undertake the 12&#xD;
      week intervention and assessed using physical measures before and after the trial and face to&#xD;
      face interviews after the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be through the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire community falls&#xD;
      teams and the exercise delivery is consistent with usual care, the main difference is the&#xD;
      location and student leaders. Students are qualified OTAGO Leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding has been received from AGILE the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists professional&#xD;
      network working with older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student educational experiences and outcomes will be assessed over the study period and are&#xD;
      included in a separate study protocol&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the TAIC study we will examine the feasibility of a student-led exercise intervention in&#xD;
      improving falls risk outcomes for community dwelling older adults at risk of falling.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will examine the impact on students education and learning from leading an&#xD;
      exercise intervention for community dwelling older adults at risk of a fall. Although we aim&#xD;
      to submit this aspect of the study as a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim will be explored concurrently using a pre-post test design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the feasibility of a student-led exercise intervention in improving falls risk&#xD;
      outcomes for community dwelling older adults at risk of falling referred from NHS Falls&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Intervention:A pre-post test single cohort design of a 12 week OTAGO exercise&#xD;
      intervention of 3 times a week, 60 minute exercise sessions through a combination of home&#xD;
      exercises and 1-2 face to face classes per week, dependant on availability of students and&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Feasibility or pilot study design can be used in physical activity related&#xD;
      interventions to inform practice, to gain an understanding of resource requirements, to&#xD;
      inform management and to advance scientific enquiry. A paper by Bowen (2009) further outlines&#xD;
      feasibility study design in public health. Bowen (2009) outlines eight areas of focus that&#xD;
      will be explored in this study; adaptability, demand, implementation, practicality,&#xD;
      adaptation, integration, expansion and limited-efficacy testing. Feasibility studies can also&#xD;
      suffer from poor methodological quality and El-Kotob (2018) have outlined a number of&#xD;
      challenges to undertaking physical activity research using the PICO framework. The below&#xD;
      methodology has been designed using these eight areas of focus and potential methodological&#xD;
      flaws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of this intervention will be reviewed using mixed methods research.&#xD;
      Quantitative review of feasibility will include using pre-post outcome measure assessments&#xD;
      and analysis, referral rates of participants, student volunteer numbers and adherence rates&#xD;
      for class and home exercises. Qualitatively we will conduct a survey of student confidence in&#xD;
      managing community dwelling older adults at risk of falls; additionally both students and&#xD;
      participants will undertake semi-structured interviews to examine in more depth their&#xD;
      experience in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodologically we will not be using a control group as the OTAGO programme is well&#xD;
      established as an effective intervention for community dwelling older adults at risk of a&#xD;
      fall and would be potentially harmful to their current care to withhold this intervention&#xD;
      (Robertson and Campbell 2001, Public Health England, 2017, Royal College of Physicians,&#xD;
      2012). Fidelity of treatment will be maintained by incorporating a break in the programme to&#xD;
      allow students to complete their exams while still affording patients the full 12 week OTAGO&#xD;
      intervention. The inclusion criteria will be the same as current care with only one major&#xD;
      change that participants must not be cognitively impaired to ensure consent, for inclusion in&#xD;
      the feasibility study, is clearly obtained and to ensure student volunteers can manage a&#xD;
      group of individuals who can follow instructions safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria We will recruit approximately 15 participants to this study through&#xD;
      direct referral from NHS falls services based in NHS GGC and NHS Lanarkshire. Participants&#xD;
      will be identified by HCPC registered physiotherapists and support workers. Information&#xD;
      leaflets will be provided to any potential participant by the NHS falls service team and a&#xD;
      referral form will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Method: Convenience sampling will be used based on the eligible patients referred to&#xD;
      the NHS falls services during the recruitment period. As this is a feasibility study aimed at&#xD;
      gauging service demand and future implementation it is necessary to see the scope of&#xD;
      referrals to gauge the potential for future classes. This method also ensures that no&#xD;
      participants are disadvantaged by missing this evidence based intervention as any&#xD;
      participants after saturation will simply be referred back to the NHS to another falls class&#xD;
      in their area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT INVOLVEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures and time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAIC study is due to start recruiting as soon as feasible but likely September 2019 with&#xD;
      the classes starting at the end of October 2019 and lasting initially for 8 weeks until&#xD;
      students have a christmas break and then re-starting in late January for four more weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure assessment will be undertaken approximately 1 week prior to attending the 1st&#xD;
      OTAGO classes (Week -1) as part of the 12-week intervention (Week 1-12) and approximately 1&#xD;
      week after the final session (Week +1). Comparison of results will be difference between pre&#xD;
      and post scores for this single cohort, Week -1 compared to Week +1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure assessments - student volunteers trained as OTAGO instructors and trained by&#xD;
      the chief investigator in undertaking specific outcome measures. Outcome measure training&#xD;
      will involve a 1-hour introduction to the outcome measures to be used and then an assessment&#xD;
      session using health control volunteers over two separate days to ensure consistency of&#xD;
      scoring and procedure. The chief investigator will facilitate this training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews - Dr Fiona Kennedy, Dr Sam Ellis, Prof Dawn Skelton or if&#xD;
      unavailable the chief investigator can facilitate interviews, to ensure a suitably&#xD;
      experienced member of the team is involved in supporting an in-depth conversation into&#xD;
      participants experience of the study intervention. The chief investigator will ideally not&#xD;
      undertake these interviews to minimise researcher bias or observer effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Descriptive statistics will be used to express baseline and quantitative data&#xD;
      (Mean, mode, percentage spread and range). Changes in pre-post assessments will be examined&#xD;
      by comparing means of the same group at a different time point using a paired t-test or an&#xD;
      equivalent non-parametric test. Intervention effects will be represented by a point estimate&#xD;
      (95% confidence interval). Correlations between baseline information and changes in outcome&#xD;
      measure scores will be undertake using a pearsons correlation co-efficient test or similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interview transcripts will be undertaken using&#xD;
      thematic analysis to explore patients perceptions of the intervention. Thematic analysis has&#xD;
      been used previously in multiple studies and is able to deliver an accessible and&#xD;
      theoretically flexible approach to qualitative data analysis (Braun, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be undertaken by the chief investigator with support from the supervisory&#xD;
      team. The chief investigator will use SPSS to complete data analysis of quantitative data,&#xD;
      normality testing, mean comparison, descriptive statistics and correlation calculations.&#xD;
      Professor Dawn Skelton will act as a quality reviewer for all quantitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be reviewed in an iterative process using NVivo version 12 with the&#xD;
      chief investigator and Dr Fiona Kennedy independently reviewing the raw transcripts to code&#xD;
      and eventually create themes that will be discussed at several points to ensure results are&#xD;
      accurate, agreed and transparent. Once coding is completed Dr Sam Ellis will review this&#xD;
      coding and theming process and where necessary provide a third opinion where disagreements&#xD;
      occur and also confirm the accuracy and agreement of coding and final themes.&#xD;
