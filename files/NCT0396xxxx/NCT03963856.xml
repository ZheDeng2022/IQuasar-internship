  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spaceflight induces detrimental changes in most organ systems with both acute changes and&#xD;
      chronic adaptations. For example, acute fluid shifts associated with weightlessness (also&#xD;
      called - improperly - microgravity) cause initial rapid cardiovascular alterations, whereas&#xD;
      the chronic changes are more reflective of cardiovascular deconditioning and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular/ocular adaptations (Pavy-Le Traon et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-duration stays in weightlessness have resulted in ocular structural and functional&#xD;
      adaptations in some astronauts, which has been termed the Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular&#xD;
      Syndrome (SANS ; see review in Lee et al., 2018). The leading hypothesis is that ocular&#xD;
      changes are the consequence of chronic exposure to the weightlessness-induced headward&#xD;
      (cephalad) fluid shift experienced by all astronauts. Countermeasures targeted to reverse&#xD;
      this fluid shift, including lower body negative pressure and veno-occlusive thigh cuffs, have&#xD;
      been proposed and tested in ground-based studies using a head-down tilt model of the cephalad&#xD;
      fluid shift. However, the amount of fluid shift reversal required to prevent the development&#xD;
      of SANS has not been investigated or determined. Similarly, artificial gravity through&#xD;
      centrifugation has been proposed as a SANS countermeasure, given its ability to reverse&#xD;
      headward fluid shifts and its efficacy as a countermeasure to long-duration bed rest-induced&#xD;
      cardiovascular adaptations (long-duration bed rest is widely employed to simulate the effects&#xD;
      of microgravity on various physiological systems). However, the minimum level of artificial&#xD;
      gravity required also has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and&#xD;
      ocular changes across a range of gravity levels to identify a threshold of gravitational load&#xD;
      that can serve as a countermeasure to SANS during future spaceflight missions.&#xD;
