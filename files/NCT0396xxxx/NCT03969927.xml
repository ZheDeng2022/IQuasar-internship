  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of simulators to retrain driving skills of patients with stroke, Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD), or multiple sclerosis (MS) is very limited because of cost, space required, and&#xD;
      incidence of simulator sickness in high fidelity simulators. The Principal investigator&#xD;
      recently developed a low cost low fidelity portable driving simulator (PDS). In this pilot&#xD;
      study, the study team will (1) determine the ease of use and occurrence of simulator sickness&#xD;
      while operating the low fidelity PDS in a clinic setting and (2) the efficacy of the low&#xD;
      fidelity PDS to reproduce the benefits from retraining impaired driving skills of stroke&#xD;
      survivors in a high-fidelity simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 30 participants, separated according to neurological condition including&#xD;
      stroke, PD, or MS, will be randomly allocated to either the PDS or fixed-base high-fidelity&#xD;
      simulator training. Each participant will undergo a pre-training evaluation, five hours of&#xD;
      designated training and a post-training assessment, similar to the pre-training evaluation.&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed according to study aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the simple set up of the PDS will make it easier to use&#xD;
      and better decrease the incidence of simulator sickness that typically leads to stopping&#xD;
      therapy than the high-fidelity simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that improvements in lane maintenance, adherence to speed&#xD;
      limits, reaction to traffic lights, and overall reaction time after training using the PDS&#xD;
      will not be significantly different from improvements observed after training using the&#xD;
      high-fidelity driving simulator.&#xD;

      Aims: The aims of the proposed study are to determine (1) the ease of use and development of&#xD;
      simulator sickness while operating the low fidelity Portable Driving Simulator (PDS) in a&#xD;
      clinic setting and (2) the efficacy of the low fidelity PDS to reproduce the benefits from&#xD;
      retraining impaired driving skills of stroke survivors, persons with Parkinson's Disease (PD)&#xD;
      or multiple sclerosis (MS) in a high-fidelity fixed-base simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: For the first study aim 1, the investigators hypothesize that the simple set up&#xD;
      of the PDS will make it easier to use and better mitigate incidence of simulator sickness&#xD;
      that typically leads to attrition than in a high-fidelity simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For study aim 2, the investigators hypothesize that improvements in lane maintenance,&#xD;
      adherence to speed limits, reaction to traffic lights, and overall reaction time after&#xD;
      training using the PDS will not be significantly different from improvements observed after&#xD;
      training using the high-fidelity driving simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Currently, simulator-based training is the method with the best evidence of&#xD;
      retraining impaired driving-related skills after stroke and with promise in individuals with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) or multiple sclerosis (MS). Driving simulators enable patients to&#xD;
      retrain impaired driving skills in a context that evokes and ''mimics'' the perceptual,&#xD;
      cognitive, and motor processes used in real-world driving. The fact that real-world traffic&#xD;
      and driving situations can be presented many times over, without any safety risk, under full&#xD;
      experimenter or clinician control, and with ''instant replay'' possibility to augment&#xD;
      feedback enhances the utility of the driving simulator as an ideal tool for driving&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the use of simulators to retrain driving skills of patients with stroke, PD, or MS&#xD;
      has been very limited because of three major reasons. The cost of currently available driving&#xD;
      simulators (between $50,000 to $500,000), the space needed to house the simulators (15 to 50&#xD;
      square feet), and the incidence of simulator sickness (rate = 5 - 25%) in high-fidelity&#xD;
      simulators. The principal investigator recently developed a low cost ($10,000) low fidelity&#xD;
      portable driving simulator (PDS) in the University of Kansas Laboratory for Advanced&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Research in Simulation (LARRS) that measures 25.5&quot; Wide, 32.5&quot; High, and 25&quot;&#xD;
      Deep and requires only approximately 4 square feet of space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the ease of use and occurrence of simulator sickness while operating the low&#xD;
           fidelity PDS in a clinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the efficacy of the low fidelity PDS to reproduce the benefits from retraining&#xD;
           impaired driving skills of stroke survivors in a high-fidelity simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: The study team will recruit 10 participants with a first ever stroke, 10&#xD;
      participants with PD (Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage 2 or 3 during on-medication) and 10 participants&#xD;
      with MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale between 3 and 6.5). Participants in each diagnosis&#xD;
      group will be randomly allocated, based on a computer generated random sequence, into either&#xD;
      the PDS or high-fidelity simulator training. The randomization process will be done by&#xD;
      principal investigator. All participants will undergo a pre-training evaluation that includes&#xD;
      driving-related physical, visual, and cognitive tests. Studies have shown that a minimum of&#xD;
      five hours of training in a simulator is needed for meaningful improvement in driving skills.&#xD;
      As such, each participant will receive five hours of the assigned training. The first session&#xD;
      in the simulator will establish participants' baseline driving performance. The next three&#xD;
      training sessions will be directed at addressing the deficits in specific skills identified&#xD;
      from the baseline performance. The fifth session in the simulator will establish&#xD;
      participants' post-training driving performance. All participants will again undergo a&#xD;
      post-training evaluation similar to the pre-training evaluation. The five training sessions&#xD;
      in the simulator will each last approximately one hour per day, twice or thrice a week, and&#xD;
      will be completed in two weeks. The study coordinator, who will be blind to participants'&#xD;
      group allocation, will administer both the pre- and post-training evaluations. A research&#xD;
      student in the Laboratory for Advanced Rehabilitation Research in Simulation supervised by&#xD;
      Dr. Hannes Devos and Dr. Abiodun Akinwuntan will train all participants.&#xD;
