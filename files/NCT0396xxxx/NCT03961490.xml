  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common rhythm disorder, affecting 2 to 3 percent of the&#xD;
      population. One of the major complications is the occurrence of thromboembolic events, the&#xD;
      thromboembolic risk can be predicted by the ChadsVasc score. Anticoagulant treatment is&#xD;
      therefore almost always indicated, however, in view of the target population, anticoagulant&#xD;
      treatment is sometimes contraindicated, justifying the appearance of alternative treatment&#xD;
      such as occlusion of the left auricle by surgical or percutaneous means, with the placement&#xD;
      of a prosthesis in the left auricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image fusion is a new imaging technique aimed at improving the spatial view of 2D images&#xD;
      (made during a catheterization session) by repositioning in real time a 3D model obtained by&#xD;
      reconstruction from scanner images of the structure of interest. Once the model has been&#xD;
      redesigned, it follows all the consequences that the hemodynamicist wants to take and thus&#xD;
      guides the gesture as well as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the contribution of image fusion to per cutaneous&#xD;
      occlusion procedures of the left atrium. This contribution will be evaluated by comparing the&#xD;
      procedure time, the irradiation time, the amount of contrast material used between the&#xD;
      procedures performed with the image fusion technique and without this new technique.&#xD;
