  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and long-term outcomes&#xD;
      between patients with pancreatic carcinoma and biliary obstruction who are treated by stent&#xD;
      insertion with or without high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distal malignant biliary obstruction is a common problem in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      carcinoma. In unresectable pancreatic carcinomas, percutaneous stent placement has been&#xD;
      pivotal in providing relief from obstructive jaundice, improving the quality of life, and&#xD;
      allowing the maintenance of anticancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous chemotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, or radiotherapy have been used&#xD;
      to prolong stent patency and survival after stent insertion for patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      carcinoma and biliary obstruction. High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation is a&#xD;
      noninvasive and atoxic treatment of malignant tumor using focused ultrasound energy from an&#xD;
      extracorporeal source that is targeted within the body resulting in thermally induced&#xD;
      necrosis and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and long-term outcomes&#xD;
      between patients with pancreatic carcinoma and biliary obstruction who are treated by stent&#xD;
      insertion with or without high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation.&#xD;
