  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator propose to develop an opioid telephone helpline, where trained counselors&#xD;
      and educators provide referral, educational and targeted interventions and support to&#xD;
      individuals interested in addressing their addiction or needing help with managing their&#xD;
      pain. The proposed application builds on &quot;tobacco quit line&quot; efforts, a nationally-adopted&#xD;
      telephone-based service, providing education materials, access to cessation medication and&#xD;
      counseling against tobacco use. Similar to tobacco quit line; the proposed telephone based&#xD;
      services will remove barriers to treatment as they help individuals at the exact time of&#xD;
      need. The helpline will also educate individuals with new onset pain about pain expectations,&#xD;
      relaxation techniques, use of pharmacology and psychotherapy for treatment in addition to&#xD;
      providing support for coping and reducing dependency on prescription opioids. It will be a&#xD;
      low cost, easily accessible and utilizable technology to augment the clinical outcome of&#xD;
      medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder and pain management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test if the helpline is a resourceful tool for patients with opioid use disorder looking&#xD;
           for referrals and support to access treatment. The opioid helpline will provide&#xD;
           individuals with opioid use disorder seeking treatment, direct access to a live person&#xD;
           who can answer questions regarding referrals and various treatment programs. The&#xD;
           helpline will also follow-up on treatment compliance and offer support and motivational&#xD;
           techniques for these individuals to stay engaged in treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test if the helpline is a resourceful tool for patients with new onset of pain or&#xD;
           chronic pain being prescribed opioids. The opioid helpline will provide these&#xD;
           individuals the necessary educational materials on managing pain safely while avoiding&#xD;
           misuse. It will offer free imagery guided meditation and other non-pharmacological tools&#xD;
           to help with pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test if providers find the opioid helpline helpful and resourceful for their practice&#xD;
           and are willing to refer patients to the helpline.&#xD;

    <description>This helpline will aim to provide patients with new diagnosis of pain who are prescribed opioids, access to education, support and free behavioral technique to help manage their pain such as mindfulness exercises. For those with opioid use disorder, the helpline will offer support in the form of education about the disorder, opioid withdrawal symptoms, risks of overdoses, and a variety of services such as help reach appropriate care with MAT licensed providers, information on FDA-approved MAT and naloxone, and, in some cases, behavioral intervention to keep patients engaged in treatment. The opioid helpline will provide a central resource for direct services and a portal for community services. It will also serve as a referral resource for health-care professionals.</description>

        We plan to pilot this model in a small rural area with low accessibility to specialized&#xD;
        treatment. We will specifically target the area of county of Wise as it is an area with one&#xD;
        of the highest rate of opioid addiction and overdose related deaths in the state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        UVA hospital: we plan to pilot this model at UVA hospital because it is a health care&#xD;
        system offering care to a diverse population from urban and rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The providers will be educated regarding the goals and objectives of the helpline: Any&#xD;
        specialty physicians, nurses including dentists that prescribes opioids within Virginia&#xD;
        They will be asked to have flyers about the helpline in their office and refer patients who&#xD;
        are prescribed opioids to get more support from the helpline.&#xD;
