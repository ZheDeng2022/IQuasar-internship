    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well duvelisib on an intermittent (irregular) dosing schedule&#xD;
      works in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;
      Duvelisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Giving duvelisib on an intermittent schedule may result in similar effectiveness with&#xD;
      less amount of severe side effects.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of duvelisib (induction followed by maintenance [intermittent&#xD;
      dosing]) in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as&#xD;
      measured by the progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety of duvelisib induction and maintenance (by intermittent dosing) in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate clinical benefits to duvelisib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate T-cell populations in patients with CLL treated with duvelisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive duvelisib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive duvelisib PO BID on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16, and 22-23. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
