    <textblock>
      In this study the patients with histological evidence of adenocarcinoma of the stomach will&#xD;
      be screened and, if eligible, submitted to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). After conclusions&#xD;
      of NAC and obtaining informed consent, they will be registered and randomized to receive&#xD;
      surgical D2 vs. D2plus lymphadenectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-centre phase III, two-group, randomized and controlled trial&#xD;
      designed to prove superiority of the experimental treatment arm (neo-adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      and super-extended lymphadenectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial population consists of patients who have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
      the stomach with locally advanced primary tumour and no evidence of distant metastases (stage&#xD;
      IIA-IIIC gastric cancer). The lymph node clinical metastases, before neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, must be limited to the first and second compartments (stations 1-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARD GROUP: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + surgical gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are assigned to neoadjuvant chemotherapy+ surgical D2 treatment group will&#xD;
      undergo either subtotal or total gastrectomy, depending on the location of the primary&#xD;
      tumour. Standardized D2-lymph node dissection is required with specific information about&#xD;
      lymph node stations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL GROUP: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + surgical gastrectomy with D2plus&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are assigned to neoadjuvant chemotherapy + surgical D2plus extended&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy treatment group will undergo either subtotal or total gastrectomy, depending&#xD;
      on the location of the primary tumour. Standardized D2 lymph node dissection plus resection&#xD;
      of stations 8p, 12b/p, 13, 14v, 16a2/b1 is required with specific information about lymph&#xD;
      node stations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, surgical treatment should be performed within 4-6 weeks after the end of the&#xD;
      last cycle of NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare overall and cancer-related survival between&#xD;
      D2 and D2+ lymphadenectomy following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, response to chemotherapy, resection rate, quality of life, complications&#xD;
      attributable to surgical intervention / side effects of chemotherapy and the duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation was performed, to detect the minimum number of patients to be&#xD;
      recruited in each arm. A two-sided log rank test with an overall sample size of 539 subjects,&#xD;
      of which 270 are in group 1 and 269 are in group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using SPSS software. Level of significance will be defined as 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be open for recruitment from October 2018 to September 2023.&#xD;
