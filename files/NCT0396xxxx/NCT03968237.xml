  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that aims to develop good clinical practices to improve outcomes after&#xD;
      an opioid overdose and transition of care from the Emergency Department (ED) into an Office&#xD;
      Based Opioid Treatment (OBOT) clinic for patients with opioid overdose/Opioid Use Disorder&#xD;
      (OUD). We intend to involve UVA Emergency Medicine and Medical Toxicology physicians with&#xD;
      buprenorphine waiver or an interest in becoming waived at our institution to implement early&#xD;
      initiation of buprenorphine protocol. We hope that this change in practice will result in&#xD;
      better management of patients with OUD and opioid overdose, reduce relapse and improve&#xD;
      engagement in addiction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet criteria will be consented in the ED and receive a buprenorphine/naloxone&#xD;
      induction protocol, prior to discharge and referral to the OBOT clinic. Subjects who consent&#xD;
      to take part in this study will be entered in a database to track their involvement in&#xD;
      treatment (s) at UVA and or any opioid related UVA health visits including OPIOID OVERDOSE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every patient who is seen in the ED for opioid overdose and has received naloxone either by&#xD;
      emergency medical services (EMS) or in the ED will be eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
      When patient is alert, they will be asked if they would be interested in participating in the&#xD;
      study and consented when appropriate. Patients will receive a buprenorphine/naloxone&#xD;
      induction protocol, prior to discharge and referral to the OBOT clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBOT Follow-up The patient's follow-up care will take place at the OBOT clinic, supervised by&#xD;
      an Addiction Medicine specialist (physician) with a buprenorphine-waiver and an license&#xD;
      clinical social worker (LCSW). Scheduling of all OBOT visits during this study are in&#xD;
      alignment with the OBOT standard of care, including frequency and duration of visits. A total&#xD;
      of 10 visits will be scheduled over the course of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first OBOT visit will last approximately 60 minutes and will entail the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard initial evaluation, urine drug screen, urine pregnancy test, method of&#xD;
      contraception, administration of the Brief Addiction Monitor (BAM), HIV-Risk Taking Behavior&#xD;
      Scale, discussion of treatment plan and goals, and buprenorphine/naloxone prescription from&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 through 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit will last between 16 minutes to 1 hour. During each visit, the following tasks&#xD;
      will be accomplished:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked about their drug use, urine drug screen, urine pregnancy test,&#xD;
      method of contraception, discussion of treatment progress and adherence to plan and goals,&#xD;
      therapy, and buprenorphine/naloxone prescription from physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 5 and 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit will last between16 minutes to 1 hour. During each visit, the following tasks will&#xD;
      be accomplished:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked about their drug use, urine drug screen, urine pregnancy test,&#xD;
      method of contraception, discussion of treatment progress and adherence to plan and goals,&#xD;
      therapy, administration of BAM and HIV-Risk Taking Scale once (either of Visit 5 or 6),&#xD;
      HIV-Risk Taking Behavior Scale and buprenorphine/naloxone prescription from physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Months 3 to 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 7 through 10:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit will last between 16 minutes to 1 hour. During each visit, the following tasks&#xD;
      will be accomplished:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked about their drug use, urine drug screen, urine pregnancy test,&#xD;
      method of contraception, discussion of treatment progress and adherence to plan and goals,&#xD;
      therapy, administration of BAM and HIV-Risk Taking Scale, and buprenorphine/naloxone&#xD;
      prescription from physician.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at screening</time_frame>
    <description>The COWS is an 11 item scale designed to be administered by a clinican. This tool is used to rate common signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal and monitor these symptoms over time. Reduction in adverse events will be evaluated by the documentation of COWS scores right after administration of Naloxone, then buprenorphine/naloxone.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Related Emergency Department (ED) Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Reduce risk of opioid re-overdose following ED buprenorphine/naloxone induction protocol. This will be measured by calculating the percentage of opioid related visits to any ED at 7 days post discharge, at 30 days post discharge, and hospital admissions at 30 days discharge.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Improve addiction treatment engagement for patients receiving ED buprenorphine/naloxone induction following opioid overdose. This will be measured by the number of ED patients scheduled for follow-up at the office based opioid treatment (OBOT) clinic versus number of patients that attend the scheduled first appointment and number of patients that continue to follow-up at the OBOT clinic at 30 days and at 6 months.</description>
