  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different strategies of intraoperative mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP) and stroke volume index management in high-risk patients undergoing&#xD;
      major abdominal and orthopedic surgery (manual versus automated) The investigators hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the automated group will spend less time during surgery in hypotension (defined as a&#xD;
      MAP&lt;90% of patient's MAP baseline) compared to the manual group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The maintenance of MAP is essential for organ perfusion pressure. Intraoperative hypotension&#xD;
      is a frequent complication both after induction and during maintenance of anaesthesia,&#xD;
      ranging from 5% to 75% depending on the chosen definition. Tissue hypoperfusion exposes to&#xD;
      the occurrence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and is a key determinant of&#xD;
      postoperative complications. Persistent intraoperative hypotension has been reported as an&#xD;
      important prognostic factor of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Adequate treatment of&#xD;
      arterial hypotension is therefore of particular importance during surgery. However, the&#xD;
      avoidance of hypotension includes the infusion of vasopressor and/or fluid to optimize&#xD;
      perfusion pressure. The manual adjustment of vasopressor administration has been shown to be&#xD;
      suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a paper published in the JAMA journal demonstrated that among patients undergoing&#xD;
      high-risk surgery, the maintenance of blood pressure within 10% of patient's baseline&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure resulted in less postoperative organ dysfunction compared to standard&#xD;
      MAP management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, the investigators have an automated clinical decision support system that help ease&#xD;
      the administration of both fluid and vasopressors during surgery (individualized fluid and&#xD;
      vasopressor administration). The department of the investigators has recently implemented a&#xD;
      manual hemodynamic protocol to optimize fluid and vasopressor. The goal is to maintain stroke&#xD;
      volume index within 90% of the optimal stroke volume via mini fluid challenge of crystalloid&#xD;
      solution (100 ml) following the French guidelines and to maintain MAP within 90 % of&#xD;
      patient's baseline MAP. This protocol has been called : Individualized Fluid and vasopressor&#xD;
      protocol (because based on patient's values) The purpose of this study is therefore to&#xD;
      compare two different strategies of intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) and stroke&#xD;
      volume index management in high-risk surgical patients (manual versus automated and decision&#xD;
      support guided) The investigators hypothesis is that automated group will spend less time&#xD;
      during surgery in hypotension (defined as a MAP&lt;90% of patient's MAP baseline) compared to&#xD;
      the manual group because patient's stroke volume and MAP will be better maintained during&#xD;
      surgery (within 10% of patient' targets).The decision support system will remind the&#xD;
      clinician when to administer a bolus of fluid to maintain stroke volume index within 10% of&#xD;
      the optimize stroke volume index value and an automated closed-lopp system will titrate&#xD;
      norepinephrine to keep MAP within 10% of patient's MAP target. The study will thus compare an&#xD;
      individualized hemodynamic protocol (already in place in our institution) applied manually to&#xD;
      a decision support-and closed-loop guided- individualized hemodynamic protocol (intervention&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
