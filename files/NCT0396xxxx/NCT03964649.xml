    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who newly initiated tofacitinib or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARDs), between 01 February 2016 and 31 July 2019 (identification period), were identified using Truven Health MarketScan Research database. Data for eligible participants from database were evaluated in this retrospective observational study. Index date = date of first claim for index medication (bDMARDs or tofacitinib) during identification period of 3.5 years.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Baseline characteristics- age, sex, region of enrollment were evaluated at index date. Other study specific characteristics were observed over 12 months before index date (12 months pre-index baseline period) and/or over variable-length pre-index baseline period. Variable-length pre-index baseline period was minimum of 1 year and could have been maximum up to 5.68 years before index date.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Quan-Charlson Comorbidity Score During 12 Months Pre-Index Baseline Period</title>
          <description>The mean Quan-Charlson Comorbidity score during pre-index baseline period is reported. Quan-Charlson Comorbidity score predicts probability of death within one year in participants and was based on presence of any diagnosis codes on medical claims at any time during the 12-months pre-index baseline period, based on the international classification of diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes. Total score ranges from 0 to 9.0. A score of 0 indicated that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely predicted outcome could result in mortality or higher healthcare resource utilization.</description>
