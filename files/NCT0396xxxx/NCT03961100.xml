    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are AEs that were not present before the first dose of study drug or that were present before the first dose of study drug but worsened in intensity during exposure to study drug.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are AEs that were not present before the first dose of study drug or that were present before the first dose of study drug but worsened in intensity during exposure to study drug.</description>
