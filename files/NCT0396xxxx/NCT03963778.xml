  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study explores the impact of organisational culture on multidisciplinary teams in the&#xD;
      provision of nutritional care for older hospitalised acute in-patients by collaborating with&#xD;
      patients and/or their relatives and healthcare practitioners to influence change.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study adopts an action research (AR) approach given that sustained change is more likely&#xD;
      if it incorporates authentic staff engagement. The key choice made in formulating the&#xD;
      research design is to adopt an approach that is collaborative and participatory in a process&#xD;
      of action and learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, eligible health practitioners involved in any aspect of the patients' food and&#xD;
      nutritional care or helping to feed patients during mealtimes would be represented in one&#xD;
      central team, engaging as co-researchers in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and/or relatives will participate in a focus group or interview session. The AR team&#xD;
      participants will be involved in the iterative action research cycle, reflecting on current&#xD;
      nutritional care practices, collectively evaluate patients' stories and consider ways to&#xD;
      improve eating and drinking on the wards. The AR team will meet throughout the course of 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide insight into the impact of organisational culture ('the way the&#xD;
      investigators do things') in the delivery of good nutritional care and elucidate the roles&#xD;
      and responsibilities of nurses and other staff groups involved in the provision of&#xD;
      nutritional care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will provide data on the organisational culture of interdisciplinary teams&#xD;
      working at both micro and macro levels while providing insight into the potential for AR to&#xD;
      be used in a wider arena within the hospital to improve practice.&#xD;

    <description>The action research team will have focus group/meetings involving health professionals willing to participate as co-researchers to collectively draw on their experiences to collaborate and implement interventions to improve nutritional care delivery for patients following the iterative AR cycles; planning, taking action, observing and evaluating interventions. The group meetings will be spread across 12 months.&#xD;
Outcome measures are obtained from interventions implemented as agreed by the team and as informed by preliminary data (such as the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool ('MUST') audit).</description>
