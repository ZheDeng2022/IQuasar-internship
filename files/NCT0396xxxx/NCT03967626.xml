  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In severe brain-injured patients, it is recommended to strictly control the fever in order to&#xD;
      limit brain damage (objective of neuroprotection) via the targeted temperature management&#xD;
      (TTM). In the guidelines, the target temperature is the systemic temperature, just for&#xD;
      practical reasons (brain temperature not being monitored in most polyvalent ICU). However, in&#xD;
      NICU, the brain temperature is monitored routinely via the Intra-Cerebral Pressure (ICP)&#xD;
      sensor. Since in the febrile brain-injured patients the objective of the TTM is&#xD;
      neuroprotection, it would be more appropriate to target temperature control over the cerebral&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TTM directly coupled to the brain&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with brain injury requiring ICP monitoring (Pressio 2, Sophysa France) and&#xD;
      fever requiring TTM (cerebral greater than or equal to 38.5 °C) will be enrolled. The TTM&#xD;
      will be carried out according to the usual methods of the investigator's service: external&#xD;
      cooling devices coupled with cerebral temperature (Artic Sun, Bard France), including two&#xD;
      phases: the cooling phase (H0 to H3) and the maintenance phase (from H3 to the end of the&#xD;
      cooling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups will be formed. In the interventional group, coupling of the TTM will be carried&#xD;
      out to the cerebral temperature. In the control group, coupling of the TTM will be carried&#xD;
      out to the systemic temperature measured at the bladder site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the percentage of time during which the cerebral temperature will&#xD;
      be measured within recommended target temperature range (i.e. 36 to 37 °C) during the&#xD;
      maintenance phase (H3 to H12): comparison of averages. Cerebral hemodynamic parameters (ICP,&#xD;
      transcranial doppler, and brain tissue oxygen partial pressure if available) will also be&#xD;
      collected, in order to be correlated with the delta temperature (cerebral temperature minor&#xD;
      systemic temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No medical device will be put in place specifically for the need of the study.&#xD;
