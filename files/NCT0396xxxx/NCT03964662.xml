  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WeReha is an innovative device for the home rehabilitation of stroke patients developed&#xD;
      within the scope of the EU funded project MAGIC-PCP [5]. WeReha is a system that allows&#xD;
      patients to perform exercises in a home environment with remote supervision integrated within&#xD;
      regular rehabilitation. The principle on which the product is based is that of biofeedback&#xD;
      guided rehabilitation, designed to stimulate muscle recovery and contribute to a more&#xD;
      effective and more motivating rehabilitation of neuro-motor patterns. WeReha is completely&#xD;
      adaptable, allowing only authorized to assign exercises, by planning specific sequences of&#xD;
      movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WeReha product is composed by the following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a tablet with a proprietary application on it (the &quot;WeReha app&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an inertial sensor with accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers (the &quot;sensor&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elastic straps allowing the user to wear it on different parts of the body (the&#xD;
           &quot;straps&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a series of 3D printed objects where the sensor can be placed that become animated (the&#xD;
           &quot;smart objects&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a web portal for clinical staff through which they can manage and monitor users (the&#xD;
           &quot;web-application&quot;) The WeReha app presents the patient with a series of rehabilitation&#xD;
           exercises in the form of a number of interactive games, driven by body movement, which&#xD;
           is captured by the sensor or the hand specific movements using the smart objects. A&#xD;
           session with WeReha always starts with a questionnaire on the system, through which the&#xD;
           software gains an understanding of the patient's health conditions and the presence or&#xD;
           not of a caregiver for the session. Based on this questionnaire, the software adapts the&#xD;
           daily session to minimise risks while maintaining a high level of rehabilitation to help&#xD;
           the patient reach their goals. The device works with and without an internet connection,&#xD;
           but when the device is connected to the internet, supervisors are able to provide&#xD;
           supervision and remote support through a web application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The web application is hosted on a dedicated server located inside the hospital. Only trained&#xD;
      staff will be provided with access to the web application with a unique username and password&#xD;
      required for sign on. The exercises assigned for the client to perform at home, are at the&#xD;
      discretion of the clinician who is caring for the patient and might require the presence of a&#xD;
      caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to investigate the applicability and utility of an innovative&#xD;
      technology product such as WeReha to the home rehabilitation of stroke patients as an&#xD;
      integrative solution to a conventional exercise program and to assess its acceptance by the&#xD;
      patient, caregivers and clinic professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will use WeReha for their home rehabilitation in addition to traditional treatments&#xD;
      for up to 12 weeks. The Inclusion criteria for the study have been kept broad in order to&#xD;
      assess these factors on a large enough scale, so as not to limit the usage of the device to a&#xD;
      specific sub-group of patients. If patients enrolled are in a subacute phase (i.e. within the&#xD;
      first 6 months after the stroke onset), they will be enrolled before leaving the hospital or&#xD;
      the rehabilitation department and reaching their home. If patients are considered to be in&#xD;
      their chronic phase (i.e. over 6 months after stroke onset), they will be enrolled during an&#xD;
      outpatient treatment or on a volunteer basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the trial with WeReha, every patient enrolled will receive proper training&#xD;
      from a person dedicated to the project (who will be referred to as the &quot;dedicated figure&quot;)&#xD;
      appointed by the hospital and financially supported by the sponsor of the study.&#xD;

    <description>The Technology Acceptance Model is a questionnaire that evaluate the acceptance of the rehabilitation platform WeReha by the patients. The TAM questionnaire comprises 22 items (divided into 4 area) each rated in a 7-point Likert-scale, whereby a score of 1 refers to &quot;I do not agree at all&quot; and a score of 7 refers to &quot;I agree entirely&quot;. The 4 area are:&#xD;
Perceived Ease of Use (maximal score 49, minimum score 7)&#xD;
Perceived Usefulness (maximal score 42, minimum score 6)&#xD;
Attitude Toward Using (maximal score 35, minimum score 5)&#xD;
Behavioral Intention to Use (maximal score 28, minimum score 4).&#xD;
The scores achived in the different area are summed to have a total score.The total maximum score, corresponding to 154, indicates a complete acceptance of the use of a technology device, such as WeReha, for the rehabilitation process; the minimum score, corresponding to 22, indicates a tendency to refuse technology for the rehabilitation process.</description>
