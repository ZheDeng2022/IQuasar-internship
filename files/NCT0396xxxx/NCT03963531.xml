  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone tumors make up about 3-5% of childhood cancers and less than 1% of cancers in adults. Of&#xD;
      these, osteosarcoma (OSS) is the most commonly diagnosed primary malignant bone tumor. OSS is&#xD;
      a primary mesenchymal malignant tumor of bone characterized by the production of osteoid or&#xD;
      immature bone by the malignant cells. Despite its rarity, OSS is the most common primary&#xD;
      malignancy of bone in children and adolescents, and the fifth most common malignancy among&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 19 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent bone tumors in children and may arise also in&#xD;
      soft tissues. This disease encompasses tumors formerly known as Askin's tumor, Peripheral&#xD;
      Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET) and the Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chondrosarcoma are rare sarcoma reputed chemorefractory in the non-operable setting and for&#xD;
      which little is known in terms of palliative management with systemic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite adequate loco-regional treatment, up to 40% of patients with sarcoma, soft tissue or&#xD;
      bone, will develop metastatic disease. When metastases are detected, the standard of care is&#xD;
      based on palliative chemotherapy with a median survival in this setting of only 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A slight improvement has been obtained over years thank to registration of a couple of drugs&#xD;
      such as Trabectedin and Pazopanib, the first antiangiogenic registered for soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma patients. Pazopanib is routinely prescribed worldwide after failure of first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy in soft tissue sarcoma. However, bone tumors have not benefited from these small&#xD;
      advances yet and treatment still rely on chemotherapy combining doxorubicine cisplatinum and&#xD;
      ifosfamide. There is no standard in relapse and palliative settings, and after failure of&#xD;
      these agents the survival is very poor. Bone sarcomas are therefore tumors with very little&#xD;
      available data and low level of evidence on palliative systemic treatments in clinical trials&#xD;
      and in the real life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the METABONE study is to conduct a retrospective descriptive&#xD;
      analysis of clinic-biological profiles, patterns of care and modalities of treatment for a&#xD;
      set of patients with malignant bone tumors in a real-life national setting.&#xD;
