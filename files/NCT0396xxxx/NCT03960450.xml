    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BOS-475 following single&#xD;
      and repeat topical administration to healthy participants (Part A), and to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of 42-day repeat topical administration of BOS-475 to participants&#xD;
      with plaque psoriasis (Part B).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part A, healthy participants were randomized to receive a single dose application of&#xD;
      BOS-475 or vehicle cream. Following a washout period, participants received 7 days of&#xD;
      repeated dosing with BOS-475 or vehicle cream on the back, followed by 7 days of repeated&#xD;
      dosing of BOS-475 or vehicle cream over the facial area (excluding eye lids and areas around&#xD;
      the mouth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, participants with mild to moderate stable plaque psoriasis affecting up to 15% of&#xD;
      their body surface area were randomized to receive 6 weeks of topical treatment of BOS-475 or&#xD;
      vehicle cream.&#xD;
