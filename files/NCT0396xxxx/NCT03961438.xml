      ACTHIVE-001 is a randomised, open-label, uncontrolled phase 1 clinical trial to determine the&#xD;
      safety profile of the native-like HIV-1 envelope vaccine, ConM SOSIP.v7, adjuvanted with&#xD;
      monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) liposomes. The study will furthermore determine the extent to&#xD;
      which the vaccine influences the breadth of viruses neutralised by induced antibodies and the&#xD;
      associated diversity of B and T cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will also investigate the effect of a within-schedule successive dose level&#xD;
      reduction (i.e. fractional dose boosting), aimed to induce higher levels of somatic&#xD;
      hypermutation and broadly neutralising antibodies. The primary outcome will be measurement of&#xD;
      adverse events. Secondary and exploratory outcomes will include specific viral neutralisation&#xD;
      activity of serum antibodies and characterisation of antigen specific blood and lymph node B&#xD;
      and T cell responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes a global pandemic that affects nearly 37 million&#xD;
      people and continues to spread at a rate of 1.8 million new infections annually. With&#xD;
      currently only 21.7 million people on antiretroviral therapy (ART), a protective vaccine is&#xD;
      crucial to reduce HIV spread and eliminate the pandemic. Given their protective capacity, a&#xD;
      vaccine that induces neutralising antibodies (NAbs) against the HIV envelope protein (Env)&#xD;
      would be a major step forwards. Nevertheless, the design of an effective NAb inducing vaccine&#xD;
      has proven to be extremely challenging due to the instability and conformational flexibility&#xD;
      of the trimeric Env protein. However, the development of stabilised, native-like trimeric Env&#xD;
      proteins, termed SOSIP trimers, has revolutionised the HIV vaccine field by overcoming this&#xD;
      obstacle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SOSIP prototype, BG505 SOSIP.664, was the first ever Env-based immunogen that&#xD;
      consistently induced NAbs against neutralisation-resistant viruses in animals and BG505&#xD;
      trimer immunisation of non-human primates protected against BG505 virus acquisition. Yet,&#xD;
      HIV-1 diversity is a major hurdle for generating broad protection by broadly neutralising&#xD;
      antibodies (bNAbs). It is thought that consensus-based vaccines might be more amendable for&#xD;
      driving neutralisation breadth, because consensus sequences contain less strain-specific&#xD;
      antigenic determinants and are closer to individual viral strains than strains are to one&#xD;
      another. Therefore, the native-like Env trimer ConM SOSIP.v7 gp140, used in this study, was&#xD;
      modelled after the BG505 SOSIP.664 prototype, but based on a consensus sequence of all HIV-1&#xD;
      isolates in group M, responsible for the global HIV epidemic. Previous nonclinical studies in&#xD;
      rabbits and non-human primates found the ConM SOSIP.v7 gp140 vaccine to be safe. Moreover, it&#xD;
      induced remarkably strong autologous NAb responses and elicited modest levels of&#xD;
      cross-neutralisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bearing these promising results in mind, the investigators firstly aim to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the ConM SOSIP.v7 gp140 vaccine, adjuvanted with monophosphoryl lipid A&#xD;
      (MPLA) liposomes, in healthy HIV-uninfected individuals. The secondary objective will be to&#xD;
      determine whether the ConM SOSIP.v7 gp140 vaccine, adjuvanted in MPLA liposomes, is able to&#xD;
      prime human germline (naive) B cells and drive antibody responses towards induction of NAb&#xD;
      breadth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will furthermore investigate the effect of a within-schedule successive dose&#xD;
      level reduction (i.e. fractional dose boosting), aimed to induce higher levels of somatic&#xD;
      hypermutation and bNAbs. It is thought that fractional dose boosting leads to competitive&#xD;
      antigen binding in germinal centres, which results in selection and expansion of B cells with&#xD;
      surface immunoglobulins showing the highest antigen affinity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunological insights gleaned from this study will be crucial for further design&#xD;
      refinement and clinical development. In-depth characterisation of the elicited immune&#xD;
      response, accomplished for example by state-of-the-art 'omics techniques such as next&#xD;
      generation sequencing (NGS) and transcriptomics, enables us to gain valuable information from&#xD;
      just a few human trial subjects. As a part of the European AIDS Vaccine Initiative 2020&#xD;
      Consortium (EAVI2020), this study will aid with the objective to select and refine the best&#xD;
      immunogens, adjuvants, prime-boost schedules and determine the impact of host factors such as&#xD;
      gender and genetics, increasing the chance of discovery of a definitive vaccine, which most&#xD;
      likely will be multi-component.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Use of any medications, including over-the-counter products, which, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigators, would either interfere with the study or potentially cause harm to&#xD;

             exclude study participation: use of corticosteroid nasal spray for rhinitis, topical&#xD;
             corticosteroids for an acute uncomplicated dermatitis (except for steroids applied to&#xD;
             the non-dominant upper arm); or a short course (duration of ten days or less, or a&#xD;
             single injection) of corticosteroid for a non-chronic condition (based on investigator&#xD;
             clinical judgment) at least two weeks prior to enrolment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Unable to read and speak Dutch or English to a fluency level adequate for the full&#xD;
             comprehension of procedures required in participation and consent.&#xD;

             screening is excluded. (Not excluded: a participant with a history of seizures who has&#xD;
             neither required medications nor had a seizure for three years).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Grade ≥ 1 clinically significant routine safety laboratory parameters.&#xD;
