    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized and parallel-group clinical trial was&#xD;
      conducted at four transplant centers in Korea. This clinical study was designed to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy and tolerability of reduced-dose tacrolimus with standard-dose mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil (MMF) versus standard-dose tacrolimus with reduced-dose MMF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized and parallel-group clinical trial was&#xD;
      conducted at four transplant centers in Korea. The total sample size was 108 and eligible&#xD;
      patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either study or control group. For six&#xD;
      months study period, graft function, the incidence of efficacy failure and adverse events&#xD;
      were compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size was 108 and eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      either study or control group: The study group (reduced-dose tacrolimus + standard-dose MMF)&#xD;
      or the control group (standard-dose tacrolimus + reduced-dose MMF). Restricted block&#xD;
      randomization was applied to this study and both the enrolled subjects and care providers&#xD;
      were blinded until randomization was done. A difference in the mean estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rates (eGFR) of 16 mL/min/1.73m2 was considered a clinically meaningful margin of&#xD;
      non-inferiority. A sample size of 108 for both groups was calculated for the primary endpoint&#xD;
      by assuming a significance level of 0.025 with a power of at least 95% and adjusted for a&#xD;
      potential dropout rate of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint was the renal graft function assessed with eGFR by MDRD formula&#xD;
      at 6 months post-transplant. The secondary endpoints included (1) the incidence of treatment&#xD;
      failure that included biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR), graft loss, death, or loss to&#xD;
      follow-up until 6 months post-transplant; (2) recipients and grafts' survival rates; (3)&#xD;
      24-hour urine proteinuria and creatinine clearance at 6 months post-transplant. Recipients&#xD;
      with clinical findings suggestive of acute rejection underwent biopsies before initiation or&#xD;
      within 48 hours of anti-rejection therapy and biopsy specimens were graded according to Banff&#xD;
      Classification criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints included (1) all adverse event defined as any medical occurrence including&#xD;
      worsening of a preexisting medical condition; (2) opportunistic infections; (3) malignancies;&#xD;
      (4) abnormal laboratory findings; and (5) any abnormal physical findings or vital signs.&#xD;
      Severe adverse events were defined as any adverse events with undesirable signs, symptoms, or&#xD;
      medical conditions that met any one of the following criteria: 1) was fatal or&#xD;
      life-threatening, 2) resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 3) required&#xD;
      hospitalization or the prolongation of existing hospitalization, 4) was a congenital&#xD;
      anomaly/birth defect, or 5) was an important medical event that might deteriorate the patient&#xD;
      and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed&#xD;
      above.18 All adverse events were coding using WHOART 2009 version.&#xD;
