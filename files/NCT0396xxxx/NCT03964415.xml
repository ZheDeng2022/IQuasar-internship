      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the vaccine efficacy (VE) of a heterologous vaccine&#xD;
      regimen utilizing Ad26.Mos4.HIV and aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 and Mosaic&#xD;
      gp140 for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in HIV-1 seronegative cis-gender men and&#xD;
      transgender individuals having sex with cis-gender men and/or transgender individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus that, if left untreated, can&#xD;
      progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in which the immune system&#xD;
      is severely compromised, leading to life-threatening conditions. Ad26.Mos4.HIV is a&#xD;
      tetravalent vaccine composed of Ad26.Mos1.Gag-Pol, Ad26.Mos2.Gag-Pol, Ad26.Mos1.Env, and&#xD;
      Ad26.Mos2S.Env. Clade C and Mosaic gp140 HIV bivalent vaccine contains: Clade C gp140, HIV-1&#xD;
      Env gp140 of Clade C, Mosaic gp140, HIV-1 Env gp140, and aluminum phosphate adjuvant.&#xD;
      Evidences showed that a combination of vaccination with Ad26.Mos.HIV followed by Ad26.Mos.HIV&#xD;
      together with Clade C gp140 protein in aluminum phosphate adjuvant led to highest level of&#xD;
      protection observed so far with this vaccine concept. Study comprises of a screening period&#xD;
      of 45 days, a 12-month vaccination period and a follow-up period of at least 18 months after&#xD;
      fourth vaccination (until Month 30) in participants who remain HIV-1 negative or up to 6&#xD;
      months after diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in participants who become HIV-1 infected.&#xD;
      Participants who completed their Month 30 visit will be followed for HIV infection,&#xD;
      medically-attended adverse event (MAAEs) and serious adverse events until the end of study&#xD;
      (Month 30). Primary analysis of vaccine efficacy will evaluate the number of HIV-1 infections&#xD;
      in the vaccine group compared to number of HIV-1 infections in the placebo group between&#xD;
      Month 7 and Month X (with 24&lt;=X&lt;=30) in per-protocol population.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From Month 7 up to Month 30</time_frame>
    <description>Vaccine efficacy is defined as 1-cumulative incidence ratio (vaccine versus placebo) between Month 7 and Month X after first vaccination and is estimated by the transformation of the Nelson-Aalen estimator for the cumulative hazard function after enrollment in the per-protocol (PP) population. Here, month X will be between month 24 and month 30.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after each vaccination on Months 0, 3, 6, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with local solicited adverse events will be evaluated. An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention, therefore it can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product. Solicited local AEs include assessment of pain/tenderness, erythema and swelling. Solicited systemic AEs: fatigue, headache, nausea, myalgia, chills, arthralgia, and vomiting will be assessed.</description>
