  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of probiotics in combination with pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle electrophysiologic therapy on the uterine endometrial repair and reproductive&#xD;
      prognosis in patients after surgery for intrauterine adhesion&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic repair disorder of endometrium can cause intrauterine adhesions, amenorrhea&#xD;
      and infertility, which seriously endanger women's reproductive health. In our previous study,&#xD;
      high throughput sequencing of intrauterine microorganisms showed that the content of lactic&#xD;
      acid bacteria in the uterine cavity of patients with intrauterine adhesions was significantly&#xD;
      lower than that of normal people. Concurrently, our previous studies found that chronic&#xD;
      endometritis can aggravate endometrial fibrosis, then affect the repair of endometrial&#xD;
      trauma, and increase the recurrence of intrauterine adhesion. Our previous study also suggest&#xD;
      that stem cells are beneficial to the repair of endometrium. Studies have shown that lactic&#xD;
      acid can inhibit inflammatory response and regulate the proliferation of intestinal stem&#xD;
      cells. So can lactic acid also change the microbial environment in uterine cavity to inhibit&#xD;
      endometrial inflammation and regulate the proliferation of endometrial stem cells to help&#xD;
      repair endometrial wounds? In addition, electrical stimulation can relieve depression and&#xD;
      anxiety and play a sedative effect. In recent years, some studies have shown that pelvic&#xD;
      floor electrophysiological therapy can improve the intimal blood flow resistance index of&#xD;
      thin endometrium. Therefore, whether or not the pelvic floor electrophysiological therapy can&#xD;
      repair the endometrium after the intrauterine adhesion. We expect probiotics and&#xD;
      electrophysiologic therapy can promote endometrial repair after electrosurgical resection of&#xD;
      intrauterine adhesions.&#xD;

    <description>The severity and extent of intrauterine adhesions were scored according to a classification system recommended by the American Fertility Society (AFS) (1988 version). A score of 1-4 was considered to represent mild adhesions, a score of 5-8 was considered to represent moderate adhesions and a score of 9-12 represented severe adhesions.</description>
