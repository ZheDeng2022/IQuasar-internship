  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are extremely common. On average, 50% of&#xD;
      individuals suffering an ACL injury will develop radiographic osteoarthritis (OA) 10 to 20&#xD;
      years after injury. Unfortunately, ACL reconstruction does not prevent risk of future OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-1 (IL-1) levels in the human knee joint increase transiently after an ACL injury.&#xD;
      In animal experiments, if interleukin-1 levels are increased in the joint, this alone causes&#xD;
      arthritis to occur. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is a naturally occurring&#xD;
      inhibitor of IL-1. However, in ACL injuries the balance of these two proteins is disturbed&#xD;
      transiently after injury, with the effects of IL-1 dominating this balance. In a large animal&#xD;
      model of ACL injury, injection of IL-1Ra into the knee joint after ACL injury significantly&#xD;
      decreased the amount of arthritis that was later observed.Thus, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that injection of IL-1 inhibitor (IL-1Ra) into the knee joint of patients suffering recent&#xD;
      ACL injury will decrease the incidence of cartilage damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After appropriate IRB approval, a total of 48 active patients will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      three treatment groups. Group 1 will receive removal of the knee joint fluid (aspiration of&#xD;
      hemarthrosis) using a needle and syringe within 1 week of injury. Following aspiration of the&#xD;
      knee joint, an injection of 5 milliliters (mls) of sterile saline (as a placebo control) will&#xD;
      be administered. In addition, a second knee aspiration procedure and an injection of 5mls of&#xD;
      sterile saline into the injured knee joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 2&#xD;
      will receive aspiration of the knee hemarthrosis as described in group 1 as well as&#xD;
      intra-articular administration of 150mg (~5mls) of anakinra (rhIL-1Ra) within 7 days of ACL&#xD;
      injury. In addition, a second knee aspiration and injection of 5mls of sterile saline into&#xD;
      the injured knee joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 3 patients will&#xD;
      receive aspiration of the knee hemarthrosis and injection of anakinra as described in group 2&#xD;
      as well as a second intra-articular knee injection of anakinra (150mg, ~5mls) on post-injury&#xD;
      day 10. Thus, all patients in this randomized placebo-controlled trial will undergo two&#xD;
      injection procedures prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will analyze subjects self-reported function and pain scores as well as urinary&#xD;
      levels of cartilage breakdown products over time. Additionally, MRI studies will be used to&#xD;
      compare MRI findings among patients in these 3 treatment groups. Urine samples will be obtain&#xD;
      prior to surgery, at the time of surgery and at multiple time points after surgery (3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      12 and 24 months after surgery). Subjective outcome measure assessments (surveys) will be&#xD;
      completed by participants prior to surgery and then again at 6, 9, 12 and 24 months&#xD;
      post-operatively. MRI studies will be obtained at 1 year and 2 years following surgery.&#xD;
      Additional, MRI studies at earlier time points are optional.&#xD;

      After appropriate IRB approval at total of 48 active patients who meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      listed above will be randomized into three treatment groups: Group 1 (n = 16) will undergo&#xD;
      ultrasound guided arthrocentesis of the knee hemarthrosis at the time of presentation in&#xD;
      clinic. Following aspiration of the knee joint hemarthrosis, an injection of 5 milliliters&#xD;
      (mls) of 0.9% sodium chloride solution (sterile saline) will be administered as a placebo&#xD;
      control. In addition, a second aspiration of knee joint fluid and injection of sterile saline&#xD;
      into the injured knee joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 2 (n = 16) will&#xD;
      undergo arthrocentesis as described in group 1 as well as intra-articular administration of&#xD;
      150mg (~5mls) of anakinra (rhIL-1Ra) within 7 days of ACL injury. In addition, repeat knee&#xD;
      joint fluid aspiration and a second injection of 5mls of sterile saline into the injured knee&#xD;
      joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 3 patients will receive arthrocentesis&#xD;
      and injection of anakinra as described in group 2 as well as a second knee joint aspiration&#xD;
      and intra-articular knee injection of anakinra (150mg, ~5mls) on post-injury day 10. Thus,&#xD;
      all patients will undergo two ultrasound guided knee aspiration and injection procedures&#xD;
      prior to surgery. The first injection will be after the arthrocentesis procedure to remove&#xD;
      the hemarthrosis associated with acute ACL injury. To minimize pain and discomfort the same&#xD;
      needle stick will be used to aspirate the hemarthrosis and to inject the saline or anakinra&#xD;
      depending on the patient's treatment group. The second knee arthrocentesis and injection in&#xD;
      each patient will also be performed under ultrasound-guidance at 10 days after injury. Some&#xD;
      patient's injuries may fall on a day where performing these aspiration and injection&#xD;
      procedures exactly 10 days after injury is not possible due to constraints of the work week&#xD;
      (i.e. Monday through Friday). In this case the procedures will be performed on the next&#xD;
      consecutive work day closest to the 10 days post-injury time point. An additional&#xD;
      arthrocentesis procedure will be performed at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients in all 3 groups will undergo pre-operative collection of urine and knee joint&#xD;
      fluid as described above. These time points include: i) at the time of enrollment into the&#xD;
      study (within 7 days of injury), ii) at 10 days after injury, iii) on the day of surgery&#xD;
      (within 30 days of injury). In addition, urine and knee joint fluid collection will be&#xD;
      performed at the initial post-operative visit (approximately 10 days after surgery) followed&#xD;
      by collection of urine alone at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months post-operatively in all treatment&#xD;
      groups. Urine and arthrocentesis samples will be analyzed for the presence of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and cartilage breakdown biomarkers according to Osteoarthritis Research Society&#xD;
      International guidelines (see cytokine and biomarker assays section below for further&#xD;
      details). Given, that multiple studies have demonstrated resolution of cytokine abnormalities&#xD;
      by 2 to 4 weeks after ACL injury, urine assessments of cytokine assays (IL-1, etc.) will not&#xD;
      be conducted beyond 3 months post-operatively. However, ELISAs for cartilage biomarkers will&#xD;
      be performed on urine collected at each time point throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
      Validated patient reported outcome assessments (KOOS, VAS and PROMIS) will be completed at&#xD;
      initial presentation as well as at 6, 9, 12 and 24 month post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in all 3 groups will be also be followed longitudinally with repeat MR imaging that&#xD;
      includes cartilage sensitive sequences (T1rho). These will be obtained at 12 and 24 months&#xD;
      post-operatively. Additional MRI studies at earlier time points are optional for study&#xD;
      participants. The MRI studies performed in this investigation will be non-arthrogram studies&#xD;
      without intra-articular or intravenous contrast. The injured and contralateral uninjured knee&#xD;
      will be imaged with MRI at 12 and 24 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a single-blinded design and all aspects of the study design will be&#xD;
      disclosed to subjects during the informed consent process. Given that anakinra needs to be&#xD;
      ordered by the physician from the pharmacy on the day of injection, the physician performing&#xD;
      the injection will not be blinded to which patients receive anakinra treatments. However, the&#xD;
      patients will be blinded regarding which treatment they receive. All patients will receive&#xD;
      injections of the same volume, same color and using the same type of needle and syringe. The&#xD;
      synovial fluid and urine biomarker data will be analyzed in a coded fashion in conjunction&#xD;
      with a statistician to avoid bias in the statistical analysis. In addition, the radiologist&#xD;
      interpreting the MRI studies will be blinded to which treatment the patients receive. The&#xD;
      physician administering the injections into the joint will not be involved in interpreting&#xD;
      the MRI findings and will not be present when subjects complete the patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
