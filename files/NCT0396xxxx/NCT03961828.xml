    <textblock>
      Patients with transfusion dependent Beta Thalassemia suffer from a high incidence of&#xD;
      Hepatitis C infection especially in developed countries as Egypt. In our patients we also&#xD;
      found a high correlation between hepatitic C infection and Liver fibrosis. in this study we&#xD;
      offer our patients treatment with Direct antiviral drugs and assessed the degree of fibrosis&#xD;
      before and after treatment. We tested Hyalornic acid as a predictor of the degree of fibrosis&#xD;
      before and after treatment.&#xD;

      The thalassemias are a heterogeneous group of genetic heritable disorders of hemoglobin (Hb)&#xD;
      synthesis, considered as the most common monogenic disorder in the world, affecting men and&#xD;
      women equally and poses a severe health and economic burden to patients and families at risk&#xD;
      (Mohammad and Al-Doski, 2012). Thalassemia is a major health problem in Egypt since it&#xD;
      estimated out of 1.5 million live births, 1000 children with thalassemia are born annually&#xD;
      (Youssef et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalassemics can develop liver fibrosis because of iron liver overload and hepatitis virus C&#xD;
      (HCV) infection. Multicenter cross-sectional studies have reported that the development and&#xD;
      the severity of liver fibrosis are strongly related to the extent of liver iron overload and&#xD;
      to the presence of chronic HCV infection (Di Marco et al., 2008). HCV infection is the main&#xD;
      risk factor for liver fibrosis in transfusion-dependent thalassemics. Excess liver iron is&#xD;
      now clearly recognized as a cofactor for the development of advanced fibrosis in patients&#xD;
      with HCV infection (Elalfy et al., 2013). Although, hepatic fibrogenesis has long been&#xD;
      thought to be an irreversible process, it is now evident that it is a dynamic process with&#xD;
      significant potential for reversal; unlike cirrhosis, which is irreversible. Identification&#xD;
      of liver fibrosis at an early stage would be of great significance (Manning DS and Afdhal NH,&#xD;
      2008, Xu et al., 2003) Liver biopsy is an essential method for assessing fibrosis and it&#xD;
      continues to have an important role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of patients&#xD;
      with elevated results of iron studies and abnormal liver function test results. Therefore,&#xD;
      liver biopsy is currently considered the gold standard for assessing hepatic fibrosis (Di&#xD;
      Marco et al., 2008). However, it is an invasive and painful procedure, with rare but&#xD;
      potential life threatening complications, limiting its acceptance and repetition in usually&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients. In addition, the accuracy of liver biopsy in assessing fibrosis may be&#xD;
      questioned because of sampling error and interobserver variability, which may lead to under&#xD;
      or overstaging of fibrosis or cirrhosis (Foucher et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus there is a need to develop and validate non-invasive tests that can accurately reflect&#xD;
      the full spectrum of hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and its severity in liver diseases (Foucher&#xD;
      et al., 2006). Serum markers and imaging methods are increasingly in vogue non-invasive&#xD;
      alternatives to liver biopsy and the development of safe, inexpensive, and reliable&#xD;
      non-invasive fibrosis measurement tools remains a research priority in clinical hepatology&#xD;
      (Rockey DC 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan which is an essential&#xD;
      component of extracellular matrix in almost every tissue in the body (Papastamataki, 2010).&#xD;
      In the liver, HA is mostly synthesized by the hepatic stellate cells and removed via&#xD;
      sinusoidal cell adhesion molecules (Halfon, 2005). This mechanism is impeded in fibrosis,&#xD;
      leading to a rise in serum levels of HA. Therefore, serum HA is considered a marker that&#xD;
      appears early before pathological changes occur (Zheng, 2003). Serum HA levels have been&#xD;
      shown to correlate with histological stages of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, HA has a good diagnostic accuracy as a noninvasive assessment of fibrosis and&#xD;
      cirrhosis (Parise et al, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in are at risk for major complications, including&#xD;
      cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. The combined pegylated interferon-α and&#xD;
      ribavirin (PEG-IFN/ribavirin) remains the standard therapy for CHC in children until 2016&#xD;
      (Aziz S, 2014, Suzuki et al. 2016, Yang et al 2017). The approved PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy&#xD;
      for children aged 3 and older is often held from use until adulthood because of its extensive&#xD;
      list of potential side effects and high likelihood of causing adverse symptoms. In children&#xD;
      and adolescents with HCV, treatment and reduction of the spread of HCV before adulthood is&#xD;
      important, as there can be transmission to other individuals via sexual activity and infected&#xD;
      females can later vertically transmit the infection during pregnancy, the latter representing&#xD;
      a common source of transmission for children (Yang et al 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, a number of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are under development for&#xD;
      treatment of CHC. DAAs reduce the amount of HCV in the body by blocking viral replication&#xD;
      inhibiting directly one of the several steps of HCV lifecycle preventing the virus from&#xD;
      multiplying, and in most cases, they cure HCV. DAAs are classified into several categories&#xD;
      based on their molecular target (Perales et al., 2015, Manns et al., 2016). The recent&#xD;
      development of DAAs has shown promising results in clinical trials for use in children and&#xD;
      adults and has dramatically increased the rates of sustained virological response (SVR) while&#xD;
      improving side effect profiles as compared to interferon based treatments (Yang et al 2017).&#xD;
      New DAAs available for adults have still not been approved for treatment in children (Aziz S,&#xD;
      2014, Serranti et al., 2014, Ohmer et al., 2016, Yang et al 2017). However, the approval of&#xD;
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and sofosbuvir with ribavirin for adolescents is potentially&#xD;
      anticipated as early as 2017 (Yang et al 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently (on April 7, 2017), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first&#xD;
      DAAs for children that included sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (Harvoni) to&#xD;
      treat HCV in children and adolescents aged 12 years and older or weighing at least 35&#xD;
      kilograms. These DAAs (Harvoni and Sovaldi) were previously approved to treat HCV in adults.&#xD;
      These approvals will help change the landscape for HCV treatment by addressing an unmet need&#xD;
      in children and adolescents (FDA News Release 2017, HCV Guidance 2017). The adult fixed-dose&#xD;
      of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir resulted in similar plasma exposure of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and&#xD;
      GS-331007 (the inactive metabolite of sofosbuvir) in adolescents as in adults, thus the adult&#xD;
      dose was used for this age group (Schwarz et al. 2016). Similarly, giving half the adult&#xD;
      fixed-dose of ledipasvir/ sofosbuvir, 45 mg/200 mg, to children ages 6-11 resulted in&#xD;
      comparable plasma exposure of ledipasvir, sofobuvir, and GS-331007 as in adults, without any&#xD;
      severe adverse events or laboratory abnormalities (Garrison et al 2016).&#xD;
