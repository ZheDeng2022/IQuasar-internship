  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare a group of patients managed with a manual GDFT protocol (using the&#xD;
      EV1000 monitoring device; Edwards Life sciences, Irvine, USA) to a group of patients managed&#xD;
      using a novel real time clinical decision support system for goal directed fluid therapy&#xD;
      (GDFT) guidance on microvascular parameters in patients undergoing major abdominal or&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many trials have indicated that GDFT strategies may benefit high-risk surgical patients but&#xD;
      these strategies are infrequently implemented on a day to day basis. It has also been shown&#xD;
      that without any goal or protocol for fluid resuscitation, large inter- and intra-provider&#xD;
      variability exist and have been correlated with marked variations in patient outcomes. Even&#xD;
      under ideal study conditions, strict adherence to GDFT protocols is hampered by the workload&#xD;
      and concentration required for consistent implementation.Haemodynamic monitors and protocols&#xD;
      alone do not enable optimal fluid titration to be provided consistently to all patients -&#xD;
      there must also be appropriate and timely interpretation and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this problem of consistency and protocol adherence, a novel real time clinical&#xD;
      decision support system, &quot;Assisted Fluid Management&quot; (AFM), has been designed to help ease&#xD;
      some of the workload associated with GDFT protocol implementation. The AFM system (released&#xD;
      on the European market in March 2017) may help increase GDFT protocol adherence while leaving&#xD;
      direction and guidance in the hands of the care providers. This system can suggest fluid&#xD;
      bolus administration, analyse the effects of the bolus, and continually re-assess the patient&#xD;
      for further fluid requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean arterial pressure will be at least maintained in both groups above 65 mmHg with&#xD;
      norepinephrine administration. Vasopressors administration is standardised in both groups&#xD;
      (objective is a MAP of &gt; 65 mmHg) and the only difference will be the way fluid boluses are&#xD;
      given to the patient (following standard of care (manual protocol) of following the assisted&#xD;
      fluid management recommandations)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent published study demonstrated that the implementation of the AFM for GDFT guidance&#xD;
      resulted in a significantly longer period during surgery in a preload independent state&#xD;
      (defined as a SVV &lt; 13%) with a reduced total amount of fluid administered without any&#xD;
      difference in postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another recent study demonstrated that during abdominal surgery, microvascular perfusion is&#xD;
      impaired during preload dependence (SVV &gt;13%) and recovers after fluid administration&#xD;
      (preload independent state)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the goal of this bicentric randomized controlled trial is to compare a manual GDFT&#xD;
      approach (standard of care actually in the department) versus an Assisted fluid management&#xD;
      approach (using the AFM mode) on the Microvascular flow index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume that this novel clinical decision support system will allow patients to have less&#xD;
      alterations of their microvascular parameters than patients managed under standard of care&#xD;
      (GDFT but without the assisted fluid management mode)&#xD;

The overall score, called microvascular flow index, is the sum of each quadrant score divided by the number of quadrants</description>
