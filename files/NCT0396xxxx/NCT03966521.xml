    <textblock>
      The purpose of the BSET-CLEVAR Registry is to collect device-specific performance outcomes of&#xD;
      the GORE® EXCLUDER® Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis with ACTIVE CONTROL System (EXCC device)&#xD;
      in routine clinical treatment of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel EXCC device is an evolution of an established device allowing active shaping to&#xD;
      conform to the specific patient aortic neck anatomy, with more accurate deployment,&#xD;
      potentially greater neck coverage and better long term fixation/sealing. This may translate&#xD;
      to improved effectiveness of this device over time, reducing the need for any further&#xD;
      procedures. The primary aim of this study is to assess the degree of neck coverage by the&#xD;
      EXCC device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The British Society of Endovascular Therapy (BSET) has received funds from the stent&#xD;
      manufacturer (W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc.) to conduct this study. BSET and the Sponsor&#xD;
      (Imperial College London) have full responsibility for the design, conduct, analysis and&#xD;
      reporting of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a 'bulge' caused by weakness of the wall of the aorta&#xD;
      (main blood vessel) in the section that travels down through the abdomen. An AAA can grow to&#xD;
      a large size over time and it may burst (rupture), causing life-threatening internal&#xD;
      bleeding. The standard method to prevent the AAA from bursting is to re-line the aorta with&#xD;
      an artificial piece of rigid tubing called a stent that has been covered with material. This&#xD;
      is inserted through the blood vessels from the artery in the groin to stop the aneurysm from&#xD;
      expanding and restore normal diameter of the aorta. This is commonly known as a 'keyhole'or&#xD;
      minimally invasive approach called endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been many advances in stent-graft technology to improve the accuracy and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the EVAR procedure. A new design of an existing stent-graft that is&#xD;
      currently being used in patients in many hospitals is the GORE® EXCLUDER® Conformable AAA&#xD;
      Endoprosthesis with ACTIVE CONTROL (also known as EXCC Device). This new device allows the&#xD;
      operator to shape the upper end of the device so that it may be placed into the aorta more&#xD;
      accurately, conforming to the shape of the aorta, potentially improving the fixation and&#xD;
      long-term sealing of the aneurysm, which may translate to a reduction in the need for further&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, multi-centre observational cohort registry of patients&#xD;
      undergoing routine clinical treatment of AAA by the EXCC device. Recruitment will take place&#xD;
      in 13 experienced UK centres with extensive EVAR experience. Up to 150 participants will be&#xD;
      recruited in 30 months and followed-up to 1 year (participants will not undergo any procedure&#xD;
      that is not part of their routine clinical care). Clinical data and device specific outcomes,&#xD;
      including complications and re-interventions will be prospectively collected. In addition,&#xD;
      the BSET-CLEVAR Registry Core Lab will evaluate both the pre-operative CT scan and the&#xD;
      post-operative CT scan (obtained between 4 weeks and 3-months following EVAR), to assess the&#xD;
      primary outcome of the study (endograft positioning accuracy and aortic neck coverage&#xD;
      expressed as percentage of the total aortic neck assessed). Study outcomes will also include&#xD;
      detailed analysis of pathological and anatomical features of the aneurysm and the EXCC&#xD;
      device, which will be used for reporting the effectiveness of the graft. A detailed&#xD;
      statistical analysis plan will be written prior to the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Co-ordinating Centre based at Imperial College London is responsible for the&#xD;
      overall coordination of the Study, including monitoring of the overall study progress and&#xD;
      review of study data accuracy (which, if necessary, may be checked by auditing the source&#xD;
      data).&#xD;
