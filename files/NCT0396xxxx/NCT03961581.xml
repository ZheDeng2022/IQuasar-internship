  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to measure perioperative anxiety in children from 2 to 10&#xD;
      years old in two distinct homogeneous groups before and after the ride in electric cars&#xD;
      versus bed travel in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be to measure the anxiety at the induction, the pain and the&#xD;
      agitation of the children in SSPI as well as the satisfaction and the lived experience of the&#xD;
      parents during the ambulatory stay of their child in the two groups journey in electric cars&#xD;
      versus trip in bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective, randomized, single-centric observational study (small electric cars&#xD;
      versus bed-ridden), focusing on children during their stay in the operating theater at the&#xD;
      CHU Nord of Marseille for ENT and ophthalmic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study on the use of electric cars as a means of locomotion within the block may lead to&#xD;
      other multicenter studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peri operative anxiety is one of major issues of pediatric anesthesia. Our efforts to&#xD;
      decrease children anxiety improve pain, agitation ans behavioral changes during post&#xD;
      operative period. Guidelines in pediatric anesthesia are to take into account anxiety in&#xD;
      order to enhance recovery after anesthesia and to develop ambulatory surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological and non pharmacological tools are used. Midazolam is a benzodiazepin widely&#xD;
      used but its indesirable effects such as paradoxical reactions, prolonged sedation and&#xD;
      adverse behavioral changes are a brake to enhance recovery after anesthesia programs. Non&#xD;
      pharmacological procedures are more promising (parental presence, behavioral preparation&#xD;
      programs and distraction) but their etablishment is time consuming, requiring teaching&#xD;
      programs, and changing habits. To our knowledge, distraction with ride-on car has not been&#xD;
      studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little electric car can carry children aged 2 years and more, it can be driven by children&#xD;
      under adult distant command. Weight is limited to 35 kg (x pounds). Our hospital has 3&#xD;
      differents car models which allow children to choose for their prefered one et to become part&#xD;
      of the adventure. Parental separation could be favored by this device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures are ophtalmologic and oto rhino laryngologic, in an ambulatory ward&#xD;
      receiving children ASA 1 to 3. Anesthesic procedure is the same for every child, inhalatory&#xD;
      induction with sevoflurane following by perfusion for morphinic administration and oral&#xD;
      intubation. To note, premedication is avoided and replaced by important information and&#xD;
      reinsurrance of parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlidren will be randomised by block every week to go to operating room using gurney (goup a)&#xD;
      or ride-on electric car (group b). Primary outcome is peri operative pediatric anxiety&#xD;
      measured by Yale validated scale (m-YPAS). Other outcomes concern post opérative period&#xD;
      (anxiety, pain, agitation), parental lived and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTIBOLID is a monocentric prospective randomised controlled open study wich will include 110&#xD;
      patients in hopital Nord, Marseille, AP-HM.&#xD;
