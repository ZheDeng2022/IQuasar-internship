  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is considered to be acute failure of central nervous system. It is acute confusional&#xD;
      state characterized by decline from baseline mental level, attention deficit and disorganized&#xD;
      thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative delirium is known to prolong length of stay in hospital, cause functional&#xD;
      decline and dementia, increase all-cause mortality and increase the medical cost. It is also&#xD;
      associated with other outcomes like cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, bacterial pneumonia, respiratory&#xD;
      failure requiring intubation, renal failure requiring dialysis and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are well known predisposing and precipitating factors related to its etiology. However,&#xD;
      the effect of type of anesthesia is not very clear. There have been no major clinical trials&#xD;
      in this part of the world to delineate the incidence of immediate postoperative delirium&#xD;
      (IPD). The investigators have undertaken this prospective observational study to determine&#xD;
      the incidence of IPD and its etiological factors in adult patients during their stay in the&#xD;
      Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) following surgery under different types of anesthesia&#xD;
      (general anesthesia, regional anesthesia and monitored anesthesia care). The study was done&#xD;
      over a period of about three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment for delirium was done using Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      (CAM-ICU score, English/Arabic version). Sedation and Agitation were assessed using Richmond&#xD;
      Agitation Sedation Score (RASS). Pain was assessed using Numeric Pain Score (NPS). Assessment&#xD;
      was done within 24 hours prior to surgery and was repeated at three different intervals in&#xD;
      PACU. Details of perioperative management were recorded and analyzed. The incidence of IPD&#xD;
      and its etiologic factors were identified thereby leading to corrective action.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decision to perform this observational study was made due to the lack of information on the&#xD;
      local incidence and risk factors for the development of immediate postoperative delirium&#xD;
      (IPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A literature review was done to study the already implicated perioperative causative factors&#xD;
      as well as other significant perioperative factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consultant neurologist was contacted to confirm the appropriateness of using CAM-ICU, RASS&#xD;
      and NPS as assessment tools for the study. Doctors and nurses were trained on the proper use&#xD;
      of the assessment tools using educational material at www.icudelirium.org. Permission was&#xD;
      obtained from the author who has done validation of arabic version of CAM-ICU score. A&#xD;
      proforma was prepared and local Ethical committee approval was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study of 24 cases showed the incidence of IPD to be about 25%. The investigators&#xD;
      expected to have a total of 600 adult cases undergo anesthesia during the study period of&#xD;
      three months. Based on a population size of 600 patients, a level of confidence of 95% and an&#xD;
      error of 10% on either side, the optimum sample size was calculated as 395 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The details of the study were explained to each patient with help of information sheet by a&#xD;
      dedicated nurse and a doctor well versed in local language. After patient agreement, a&#xD;
      written informed consent was obtained. The preoperative scoring of pain, anxiety and&#xD;
      agitation and delirium was done by a dedicated nurse under supervision of a doctor who was&#xD;
      not involved in providing anesthesia to the patient. Pain was assessed using NPS,&#xD;
      sedation/agitation/anxiety using RASS and delirium using CAM-ICU score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identity was concealed and names were not written in the master chart. The data were&#xD;
      entered and identified by the hospital medical registration number (MRN) as well as code&#xD;
      number. The patient data were kept locked with password protected file by principal&#xD;
      investigators. The premedication choice, anesthetic technique and intraoperative management&#xD;
      were carried out in the usual way and recorded on proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further patient specific data were obtained using the Hospital Information System and&#xD;
      Operating Room record. The following data were recorded for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Data: Age, gender of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbidity Data: All co-morbidities of patient like diabetes, hypertension, bronchial&#xD;
      asthma, ischemic heart disease, jaundice, carcinoma, liver disease, kidney disease, drug&#xD;
      addiction, alcoholism, sickle cell disease, medication details and any other co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Data: hemoglobin level, creatinine, electrolyte levels, serum albumin, ammonia&#xD;
      level and any blood work done preoperative, intraoperative or postoperative in PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Data: diagnosis, urgency and name of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-operative Anesthetic Data: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class,&#xD;
      premedication, pre-operative medications, hydration status, anesthetic method, analgesics,&#xD;
      prophylactic anti-emetic drugs, intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, oxygen saturation,&#xD;
      ventilation status, acid-base status, presence of sepsis, fluid and electrolyte imbalance,&#xD;
      pain, myocardial infarction, hypo/hyperthermia, alcohol withdrawal and other significant&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of an airway, urinary catheter or a surgical drain at admission to PACU was also&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of anesthesia, all patients were transferred to PACU. The management of the&#xD;
      patient was done in the usual manner as prescribed by the involved anesthetist and carried&#xD;
      out by allocated PACU nurse. Patients were assessed for pain, agitation, sedation and&#xD;
      delirium using NPS, RASS and CAM-ICU score by another trained staff nurse who was not&#xD;
      involved in patient management. Scoring was done at fifteen minutes from end of anesthetic,&#xD;
      thirty minutes from end of anesthetics and just prior to discharge from PACU (up to 120&#xD;
      minutes from end of anesthetic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative course (presence of delirium, requirement of treatment for delirium, length of&#xD;
      stay, postoperative complications, admission to high dependency unit or Intensive care unit)&#xD;
      was followed via electronic patient record and recorded by concerned anesthetist on the&#xD;
      proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proforma were handed over to the principal investigator and were kept locked. The&#xD;
      recorded patient data except the name were entered by one of the assigned co-investigator&#xD;
      into the master chart. A copy of master chart without MRN was sent to statistician for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
