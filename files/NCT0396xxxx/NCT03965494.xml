    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well AXL inhibitor BGB324 works in treating participants with&#xD;
      glioblastoma that has come back who are undergoing surgery. AXL inhibitor BGB324 may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the penetration of AXL inhibitor BGB324 (BGB324) across the blood brain barrier&#xD;
      measured by pharmacokinetics/drug concentration of 1.0 uM in tissue resected from a contrast&#xD;
      enhancing region of the tumor in 60% of recurrent glioblastoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine AXL expression, phosphorylation state (AXL phosphospecific antibody if AXL is&#xD;
      inhibited), and circulating soluble AXL levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the BGB324 concentration in tissue resected from a contrast non-enhancing&#xD;
      region of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Characterize the steady state pharmacokinetics of BGB324 in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate safety and tolerability of BGB324 for recurrent glioblastoma. V. Assess the&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Participants receive AXL inhibitor BGB324 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5,&#xD;
      then undergo surgery 3-6 hours after last dose. Within 45 days, participants receive AXL&#xD;
      inhibitor BGB324 PO QD on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Participants undergo surgery, then within 45 days receive AXL inhibitor BGB324 PO QD&#xD;
      on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
