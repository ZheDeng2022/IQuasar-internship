      REMICrush is a French multicentric non inferiority simple blind randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      that will compare the use of Remifentanil to muscle relaxant (reference treatment) for&#xD;
      anesthetic rapid sequence intubation in terms of major complications (difficult intubation,&#xD;
      gastric liquid aspiration, desaturation, hemodynamics reaction, ventricular arrhythmia,&#xD;
      anaphylactic reaction).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Rapid sequence intubation is the reference anaesthetic procedure for patient at&#xD;
      risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents (for example emergency procedure, bowel&#xD;
      obstruction, obese patients, gastroesophageal reflux …) or difficult airway management.&#xD;
      Nowadays the use of Succinylcholine (CELOCURINE), a neuromuscular blockade with a short&#xD;
      duration of action, is recommended in this indication. However, several adverse events are&#xD;
      frequently reported, especially anaphylactic reaction, restraining its use for rapid sequence&#xD;
      intubation. Other adverse effects such as extended neuromuscular block, malignant&#xD;
      hyperthermia or severe hyperkaliemia prohibit its use. In this case the use of another&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade, Rocuronium (ESMERON), is an alternative solution. Unfortunately, this&#xD;
      other molecule causes as many anaphylactic event as Succinylcholine (1 anaphylactic event for&#xD;
      3000 uses) and produce a long duration of neuromuscular block. Incidence of anaphylactic&#xD;
      reaction is increasing in France and mostly severe reactions. Its utilization is therefore&#xD;
      reduced to 31 to 55% of crush induction despite the recommendations. Remifentanil is an&#xD;
      opioid agent with very shorts delay and duration of action. Several study have shown similar&#xD;
      intubation conditions in planned surgery with the use of Remifentanil instead of&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade and less hemodynamic reactions. Remifentanil is already approved for&#xD;
      anesthetic induction and recognized as an alternative to neuromuscular blockade for the&#xD;
      intubation of children. Use of remifentanil has shown satisfying intubation conditions for&#xD;
      adults but its incidence of major complications compared to succinylcholine remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: The investigators thus hypothesized that Remifentanil is non inferior to&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade in terms of major complications after a crush induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A multicenter simple blind randomized controlled trial. 11 centers will participate&#xD;
      in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental treatment arm: During anesthetic induction remifentanil will be injected&#xD;
      immediately after hypnotic drug through bolus intravenous injection by a peripheral or&#xD;
      verified central venous access, at 3 to 4 µg/kg. Orotracheal intubation will be performed 30&#xD;
      to 60 seconds later by a graduated anesthesiologist or a resident with 4 validated semesters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm treatment: A neuromuscular blockade will be injected right after the hypnotic&#xD;
      drug. Whether succinylcholine (CELOCURINE) at 1mg/kg or Rocuronium (ESMERON) at 1mg/kg in a&#xD;
      bolus intravenous injection by a peripheral or verified central venous access. Orotracheal&#xD;
      intubation will be performed after occurring of fasciculations with succinylcholine or 30 to&#xD;
      60 seconds after injection of Rocuronium by a graduated anesthesiologist or a resident with 4&#xD;
      validated semesters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and judgment criteria: The primary objective is to demonstrate non inferiority of&#xD;
      Remifentanil compared to neuromuscular blockade in terms of major complications after a crush&#xD;
      induction. Primary endpoint is the rate of tracheal intubation without major complications as&#xD;
      defined by 1/ tracheal intubation with less than 2 laryngoscopies 2/ no aspiration during the&#xD;
      10 minutes after induction 3/ no desaturation under 95% during the 10 minutes after induction&#xD;
      4/ no hypo or hypertension as defined by a Median blood pressure&lt;50 mmHg or &gt;110 mmHg 5/ NO&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmia involving an emergency treatment or cardiac arrest during the 10&#xD;
      minutes after induction 6/ No grade III or IV anaphylactic reaction after the 10 minutes&#xD;
      after induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 80% incidence of intubation without major complication was hypothesized. Non inferiority&#xD;
      has been set under a superior limit of 7% for the primary endpoint 95% of the proportions&#xD;
      difference between intervention and control group. In order to achieve 80 power with a 5%&#xD;
      alpha risk, 1150 patients (575 for each arms) are to be included.&#xD;
