    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of pulmonary suffusion in controlling minimal&#xD;
      residual disease in patients with soft tissue or bone sarcoma that has spread to the lungs.&#xD;
      Pulmonary suffusion is a minimally invasive delivery of chemotherapeutic agents like&#xD;
      cisplatin to lung tissues. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Pulmonary suffusion may also be useful in&#xD;
      avoiding later use of drugs by vein that demonstrate no effect on tumors when delivered&#xD;
      locally.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of chemotherapy isolated to the pulmonary circulation by determining&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). (Phase I) II. To&#xD;
      determine the rate of local recurrences in patients receiving pulmonary suffusion, compared&#xD;
      to historical controls in patients with completely resected pulmonary metastases (unilateral&#xD;
      and bilateral disease). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the local and systemic toxicities associated with pulmonary suffusion. (Phase&#xD;
      I) II. To determine disease-free survival (DFS) in patients receiving pulmonary suffusion&#xD;
      compared to historical controls, in patients with completely resected pulmonary metastases&#xD;
      (unilateral and bilateral disease). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pulmonary suffusion-associated changes in local tumor microenvironment&#xD;
      (TME) and potential of suffusion as an immune modulation enhancement. (Phase II) II. To&#xD;
      determine overall survival (OS) in patients receiving pulmonary suffusion compared to&#xD;
      historical controls, in patients with completely resected pulmonary metastases (unilateral&#xD;
      and bilateral disease). (Phase II) III. To compare histology of tumor samples with previously&#xD;
      resected specimens with attention to biomarkers of systemic immune recognition in patients&#xD;
      eligible for repeat suffusion. (Phase II) IV. To obtain tumor and systemic immune biomarkers&#xD;
      including cytokine activations for correlation with clinical responses. (Phase II) V. To&#xD;
      correlate local control with biomarker for tissue effect from chemotherapy (including tissue&#xD;
      levels of platinum, alkaline phosphatase [ALP]). (Phase II) VI. To correlate local disease&#xD;
      control with tumor biomarker for metastasis (circulating [circ] ribonucleic acid [RNA], micro&#xD;
      [mi]RNA). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo pulmonary suffusion consisting of cisplatin via infusion. Patients then&#xD;
      undergo metastasectomy. Patients found to have unresectable sarcoma may receive chemotherapy&#xD;
      within 4-8 weeks of metastasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months and then every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years.&#xD;
