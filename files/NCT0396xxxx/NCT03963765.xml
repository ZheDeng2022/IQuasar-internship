  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic sun exposure enhances the incidence of cutaneous neoplasms (NMSC - non melanoma skin&#xD;
      cancer), wrinkles, roughness, telangiectasia and irregular pigmentation of the skin.&#xD;
      Nowadays, actinic keratosis (AK) are considered in situ squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and&#xD;
      should be managed that way. Conventional topical Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has proven its&#xD;
      efficacy on treatment of AK and cancerization field. PDT's action in global improvement of&#xD;
      photodamaged skin, texture, pigmentation and reduction of wrinkles has been well documented&#xD;
      in literature. Immunohistochemical and histopathological essays describe the hypothesis of&#xD;
      conventional PDT's mechanisms of action in photoaging by dermal remodeling, with enhancement&#xD;
      of collagen, statiscally significant. Daylight-Photodynamic Therapy (DL-PDT) is a new&#xD;
      modality that keeps the efficacy of topical PDT in treatment of AK and cancerization field,&#xD;
      but painless and more practically. Until this moment, there is no report of DL-PDT efficacy&#xD;
      on photorejuvenation and actinic keratosis evaluated by clinical, histopathological and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical studies. The investigator's aim is to evaluate the alterations induced by&#xD;
      isolated DLPDT or DLPDT associated with other techniques of transepidermal drug delivery&#xD;
      (microneedles, CO2 laser and microdermabrasion) in the treatment of field cancerization in&#xD;
      photodamaged skin with actinic keratosis, through clinical evaluation, histopathological and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical studies. It is an interventional, prospective, randomized controlled,&#xD;
      parallels-groups, four-arm trial with 1:1 allocation ratio study performed in forty patients&#xD;
      attended at the Dermatology Service of Hospital Universitário Antonio Pedro- Universidade&#xD;
      Federal Fluminense.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled, parallels-groups, four-arm trial with 1:1 allocation ratio&#xD;
      study on the clinical, histological and immunohistochemical changes induced by&#xD;
      Daylight-Photodynamic Therapy (DL-PDT) in 40 patients presenting face-photodamaged skin with&#xD;
      actinic keratosis, attended at the Dermatology outpatient clinic of Hospital Antônio Pedro&#xD;
      (HUAP) of Universidade Federal Fluminense - UFF, who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to&#xD;
      sign the informed consent form (TCLE) for participation in clinical research. There will be&#xD;
      four treatment groups with different protocols. These protocols were chosen by hand draw&#xD;
      using two boxes containing folded papers. One with the 4 numbers of the groups (1, 2, 3, 4),&#xD;
      and another with 4 papers with the names of the protocols. At each draw, one paper from each&#xD;
      box was withdrawn, and the combined results from the two boxes defined the treatments of each&#xD;
      group. Group I was randomly selected to be DL-PDT alone (standard procedure - group control);&#xD;
      Group II was randomly selected to be DL-PDT with TED (microneedles); Group III was randomly&#xD;
      selected to be DL-PDT with TED (CO2 laser) and Group IV was was randomly selected to be&#xD;
      DL-PDT with TED (microdermabrasion with crystal peeling). Two treatment sessions will be&#xD;
      performed with a 4-week interval, regardless of the protocol chosen per group. Patients will&#xD;
      be numbered according to the registration for participation in the study. These numbers will&#xD;
      be distributed in 4 groups randomly through the computer, using an Apple application called&#xD;
      Random (random number generator: seller Mireia Lluch Ortoloa, category utilities, version 1).&#xD;
      Each DL-PDT session will consist of: superficial skin curettage all face with a&#xD;
      dermatological curette; application of pure chemical sunscreen for 15 minutes; application of&#xD;
      methyl-aminolevulinate (Metvix®, GALDERMA), approved by ANVISA under Registration No.&#xD;
      1291600650016, for 30 minutes without occlusion, before exposure to daylight for 2 hours.&#xD;
      Regarding the association of techniques, these will be varied according to the group. For&#xD;
      clinical evaluation, patient data will be recorded on the evaluation form, and photographs&#xD;
      with the same position and lighting patterns will be performed before and after predetermined&#xD;
      periods. For histological and immunohistochemical evaluations, skin biopsies will be&#xD;
      performed before and after 3 months of the last treatment session.&#xD;
