  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modifications of the human gut microbiota have been associated with different pathological&#xD;
      conditions such as obesity, inflammatory bowel diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
      Recently the &quot; Brain-Gut Axis &quot;, a bidirectional communication axis between brain and gut,&#xD;
      has been described. In recent animal studies, an acute brain injury was associated with rapid&#xD;
      modifications of the gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. The&#xD;
      patterns of gut and oropharyngeal microbiota following TBI are unknown. The primary purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to characterize gut and oropharyngeal microbiota of patients with severe&#xD;
      TBI.&#xD;

      Study Protocol :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the ICU for severe trauma will be included. Two groups of patients with&#xD;
      severe trauma will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI): TBI with initial Glasgow&#xD;
           Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 8 and AISextrahead score ≤3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with severe trauma without TBI (AISextrahead score &gt; 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of healthy individuals will serve as a control population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected total enrollment 20 patients in each group, and 10 healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data: age, sex, height, weight, ICU admission date, simplified acute&#xD;
           physiology score II (SAPS II), injury severity score (ISS), abbreviated injury scale&#xD;
           (AIS) at ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trauma-related data: number and type of trauma-related organ injuries, initial GCS,&#xD;
           presence of mydriasis at initial management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors with potential impact on microbiota: antimicrobial therapy, nutrition type,&#xD;
           medications (proton pump inhibitors, opioids, sedations, catecholamines, steroids),&#xD;
           surgical procedure during ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution: multidrug resistant bacteria acquisition during ICU stay, ICU&#xD;
           acquired-infections. Mechanical ventilation duration, extrarenal epuration, ICU length&#xD;
           of stay, neurological outcome evaluated by disability rating scale (DRS-F) at ICU&#xD;
           discharge and at 90 days post trauma, death at ICU discharge and 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs will be performed for each patient within the first 24 hours&#xD;
      after ICU admission (day 0), then 48 hours (day 2) and 7 days (day 7) after ICU admission and&#xD;
      weekly thereafter until ICU discharge. Rectal and oropharyngeal swabs will be performed by&#xD;
      trained paramedical staff using sterile swabs with transport medium ESwab® (Becton, Dickinson&#xD;
      and Company, New Jersey, USA). Swabs will be stored at -80°C until DNA extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA extraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA extraction will be performed using QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA® kit (Qiagen®, Courtaboeuf,&#xD;
      France) for rectal swabs and Extracta DNA Prep® kit (Quanta Biosciences®, Beverly, USA) for&#xD;
      oropharyngeal swabs. DNA will be quantified by Quantit® dsDNA HighSensitivity Assay Kit&#xD;
      (Fisher Scientific).&#xD;
&#xD;
      16S rRNA amplification and sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
      V3 and V4 regions of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences will be amplified by polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) with universal primers (TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and&#xD;
      GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), following the Illumina MiSeq®&#xD;
      System protocol (Illumina®). Amplicons will be purified and then sequenced using MiSeq®&#xD;
      sequencing system ((Illumina®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequences processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequences processing and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering will be performed using&#xD;
      SHAMAN software (SHiny Application for Metagenomic ANalysis) based on R® software (package&#xD;
      DESeq2), provided by Pasteur Institute. Taxonomic classification will be performed using&#xD;
      SILVA database reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SHAMAN software (SHiny Application for&#xD;
      Metagenomic ANalysis). Bacterial phyla, families and genera repartition will be analyzed, and&#xD;
      relative abundance of bacterial genera will be compared between the different populations.&#xD;
      Alpha-diversity will be analyzed using different parameters (Shannon index, Simpson's&#xD;
      diversity index), as well as beta-diversity (principal component analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different populations of patients and healthy volunteers will be compared, and the&#xD;
      evolution of microbiota along time will be studied.&#xD;
