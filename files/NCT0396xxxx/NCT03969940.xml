  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project rolls out combined innovative low-tech thermotherapy of Buruli ulcer (BU) with&#xD;
      heat packs and WHO recommended wound management in a BU endemic district of Cameroon.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project translates available clinical research findings at the secondary health care&#xD;
      level into clinical practice at the primary health care and community level. The string of&#xD;
      previous work from the development of the BU thermotherapy-wound management-package to the&#xD;
      proof of its efficacy provides all necessary procedures, tools and documents to immediately&#xD;
      proceed into practical and integrated community application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine in patients with early BU lesions the effectiveness and acceptability of&#xD;
      thermotherapy treatment at health post and community level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To monitor and evaluate clinical and biological responses to thermotherapy in patients&#xD;
           receiving up to 8 weeks of thermotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess within 6 months after completion of heat treatment wound closure (&quot;primary&#xD;
           cure&quot;) and/or absence of BU specific features in included patients according to WHO&#xD;
           healing criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To measure the BU recurrence rate in included patient within 12 months after completion&#xD;
           of heat treatment' (&quot;definite cure&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the compliance rate of included patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the withdrawal rate of included patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess the ability and comfort of health personnel to use the thermotherapy device&#xD;
