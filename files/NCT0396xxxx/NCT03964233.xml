  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has 2 parts. The first part is open to adults with different types of advanced&#xD;
      cancer (solid tumours). The second part is open to people with specific types of advanced&#xD;
      lung cancer, skin cancer, sarcoma, liposarcoma, and liver cancer. The participants get a&#xD;
      combination of 3 medicines called BI 907828, BI 754091, and BI 754111. BI 907828 is a&#xD;
      so-called MDM2 inhibitor that is being developed to treat cancer. BI 754091 and BI 754111 are&#xD;
      antibodies that may help the immune system fight cancer (immune checkpoint inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the first part of the study is to find out the highest dose of BI 907828 that&#xD;
      the participants can tolerate in combination with BI 754091 and BI 754111. Once the best dose&#xD;
      of BI 907828 for the combination with BI 754091 and BI 754111 is found, it will be used in&#xD;
      the second part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the second part is to see whether the combination of BI 907828 with BI 754091&#xD;
      and BI 754111 is able to make tumours shrink. Some participants in the second part get&#xD;
      combinations of 2 instead of 3 medicines: BI 754091 and BI 754111 or BI 754091 and BI 907828.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are in the study as long as they benefit from and can tolerate treatment.&#xD;
      During this time, they get infusions of BI 754091 and BI 754111, and take tablets with BI&#xD;
      907828 every 3 weeks. The doctors check how many participants have health problems during the&#xD;
      study. The doctors also monitor the size of the tumour.&#xD;

                  infection must be receiving effective antiviral therapy (viral load &lt;100 IU/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the trial drugs or their excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious concomitant disease or medical condition affecting compliance with trial&#xD;
             requirements or which are considered relevant for the evaluation of the efficacy or&#xD;
             safety of the trial drug, such as neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease or&#xD;
             active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,&#xD;
             and in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for&#xD;
             entry into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             makes them an unreliable trial patient or unlikely to complete the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial;&#xD;
             female patients who do not agree to the interruption of breast feeding from the start&#xD;
             of study treatment to within 30 days after the last study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History (including current) of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis within the&#xD;
             last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within&#xD;
             4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except&#xD;
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic treatment (antibacterial, antiviral, or antifungal&#xD;
             therapy) at start of treatment in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following cardiac criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the Investigator) in&#xD;
                  rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting ECGs, e.g., complete left bundle&#xD;
                  branch block, third degree heart block&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any factor that increases the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic&#xD;
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family&#xD;
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years-of-age, or&#xD;
                  any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with an ejection fraction (EF) &lt;50% or the lower limit of normal of the&#xD;
                  institutional standard will be excluded. Only in cases where the Investigator (or&#xD;
                  the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on&#xD;
                  the EF, will the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method&#xD;
                  according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram,&#xD;
                  multi-gated acquisition scan). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6&#xD;
                  months prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided that&#xD;
                  there is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this&#xD;
                  measurement in the opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or&#xD;
                  both.&#xD;
