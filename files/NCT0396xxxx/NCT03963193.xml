      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and survival benefit of&#xD;
      etoposide plus cisplatin and irinotecan plus cisplatin in first-line therapy of non-primary&#xD;
      pancreatic metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor G3 type. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will explore the resistance mechanisms of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor G3, and screen out biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor G3 type patients who cannot be&#xD;
      surgically resected is poor. The median overall survival (OS) is only 6-10 months, and the&#xD;
      3-year survival rate is less than 10%. Among the neuroendocrine tumors of the digestive&#xD;
      system, only pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor has a standard treatment strategy, and there is&#xD;
      a lack of prospective clinical research data on other gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
      According to the chemotherapy regimen of small cell lung cancer, etoposide plus cisplatin or&#xD;
      irinotecan plus cisplatin is the choice of rescue therapy for advanced non-surgical or&#xD;
      metastatic neuroendocrine tumor G3 type. However, prospective studies are needed to confirm&#xD;
      whether there are differences in efficacy and safety between the two chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and survival benefit of&#xD;
      etoposide plus cisplatin and irinotecan plus cisplatin in first-line therapy of non-primary&#xD;
      pancreatic metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor G3 type. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will explore the resistance mechanisms of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor G3, and screen out biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of&#xD;
