  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of case reports describe the association of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL Abs)&#xD;
      with hematological and solid organ malignancies. Especially in elderly patients, thrombotic&#xD;
      events associated with aPL Abs can be the first manifestation of malignancy.&#xD;
      Cancer-associated monoclonal gammopathy of the IgM type can be accompanied by positive lupus&#xD;
      anticoagulant (LA) or an anticardiolipin (aCL) IgM. Cancer and antiphospholipid antibody&#xD;
      syndrome (APS) can coexist in sporadic cases, while some cancer patients with or without&#xD;
      thrombosis may show some transitory aPL Ab positivity, the most striking symptomatic clinical&#xD;
      feature, catastrophic APS, being even described in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some reports suggest a significant incidence of malignancies in APS patients. Cancer was the&#xD;
      2nd cause of death (13.9%), after bacterial infection, during the 10-year follow-up of the&#xD;
      1,000 APS patients studied by the Euro-Phospholipid Project Group, but no control group was&#xD;
      simultaneously evaluated. The risk of cancer in patients with APS is thus still uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nîmes Obstetricians and Haematologists APS (NOH-APS) study was based on the recruitment&#xD;
      of a cohort of women with no history of thrombosis, who had experienced pregnancy loss&#xD;
      fulfilling the clinical criteria of obstetrical APS (oAPS), who were either positive for aPL&#xD;
      Abs (APS group), or positive for the F5 rs6025 or F2 rs1799963 polymorphism (Thrombophilia&#xD;
      group), or negative for thrombophilia screening (Control group). We now want to assess the&#xD;
      comparative incidence of cancer in women for whom an oAPS diagnosis had been made. This&#xD;
      evaluation will be carried out during the 2017 medical follow-up step, corresponding to a&#xD;
      median follow-up of 17 years. An external, local population-derived control group, the&#xD;
      registry of tumors in Montpellier area (Registre des Tumeurs de l'Hérault) will be used to&#xD;
      compute standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).&#xD;
