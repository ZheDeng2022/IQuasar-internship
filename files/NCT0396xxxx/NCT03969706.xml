  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, open label study looking how well a drug called abemaciclib&#xD;
      works in patients with recurrent oligodendroglioma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the efficacy of abemaciclib for recurrent oligodendroglioma, as measured by&#xD;
      the estimated proportion of patients alive without disease progression at 6 months from study&#xD;
      enrollment (PFS-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in recurrent oligodendroglioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the objective radiographic response rate (ORR) associated with abemaciclib&#xD;
           in recurrent oligodendroglioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of&#xD;
           patients with recurrent oligodendroglioma treated with abemaciclib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine ORR, PFS, and OS in the subgroup of recurrent oligodendroglioma patients&#xD;
           with tumor CIC gene mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure pharmacodynamic markers of abemaciclib activity on oligodendroglial tumor&#xD;
           cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify pre-treatment tumor characteristics that are associated with response to&#xD;
           abemaciclib recurrent oligodendroglioma&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically and molecularly confirmed diagnosis of oligodendroglioma according to&#xD;
             2016 WHO Classification (tumor tissue must show co-deletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q,&#xD;
             referred to as &quot;1p/19q codeletion&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Oligodendroglioma must be progressive or recurrent following BOTH a) prior radiation&#xD;
             therapy and b) at least one prior line of alkylating chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients may have had treatment for an unlimited number of prior relapses.. Recent&#xD;
             surgical resection for recurrence is allowed, as long as there remains measurable&#xD;
             contrast-enhancing disease after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have recovered from severe toxicity of prior therapy. Patients who&#xD;
             received chemotherapy must have recovered (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
             Events [CTCAE v. 5.0] Grade ≤1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy except for&#xD;
             residual alopecia or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy prior to enrollment. The following&#xD;

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 8 g/dl. Patients may receive erythrocyte transfusions to achieve&#xD;
                  this hemoglobin level at the discretion of the investigator. Initial treatment&#xD;
                  must not begin earlier than the day after the erythrocyte transfusion.&#xD;

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 3x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Adequate renal function within 7 days prior to enrollment, defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 x institutional ULN OR calculated creatinine clearance&#xD;
                  (glomerular filtration rate can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) &gt;=50&#xD;
                  mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels &gt;1.5x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any of the following would exclude the subject from participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must not be on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs; carbamazepine,&#xD;
             phenytoin, and phenobarbitol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has serious preexisting medical condition(s) that would preclude&#xD;
             participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at&#xD;
             rest or requiring oxygen therapy, history of major surgical resection involving the&#xD;
             stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a&#xD;
             preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females who are pregnant or lactating are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a female of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
                  within 7 days of the first dose of abemaciclib and agree to use a medically&#xD;
                  approved contraceptive method during the treatment period and for 3 months&#xD;
                  following the last dose of abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a male, agree to use a reliable method of birth control and to not donate&#xD;
                  sperm during the treatment period and for at least 3 months following the last&#xD;
                  dose of abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contraceptive methods may include an intrauterine device [IUD] or barrier method.&#xD;
                  If condoms are used as a barrier method, a spermicidal agent should be added as a&#xD;
                  double barrier protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women must agree not to breast feed while on abemaciclib treatment and for at&#xD;
                  least three months following the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has active bacterial infection (requiring intravenous [IV] antibiotics at&#xD;
             time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection&#xD;
             (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known active hepatitis&#xD;
             B or C). Patients with known HIV infection are excluded given the potential for&#xD;
             interactions between antiretroviral agents and abemaciclib. Patients with known&#xD;
             Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection are excluded only if there is evidence of active&#xD;
             infection (detectable Hepatitis B surface antigen, detectable Hepatitis C RNA). For&#xD;
             patients without known viral hepatitis or HIV infection, viral hepatitis and HIV&#xD;
             testing are NOT required to determine eligibility for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of&#xD;
             cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden&#xD;
             cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with major medical, neurologic or psychiatric condition who are judged as&#xD;
             unable to fully comply with study therapy or assessments should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or&#xD;
             physical (eg, infectious disease) illness are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects requiring concurrent administration of any other anticancer agents including&#xD;
             chemotherapy and biologic agents (such as bevacizumab) or the use of other concurrent&#xD;
             investigational treatment drugs and/or devices.&#xD;
