  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and their associated complications like amputations are&#xD;
      increasingly becoming a problem in low and middle income (LMI) countries. Obesity (increased&#xD;
      body fat/adiposity), which has been shown to complicate many diseases, is also increasing in&#xD;
      LMI setting. It is however not certain whether increased adiposity, may make it difficult for&#xD;
      DFUs to heal. Investigators aim to understand whether increased adiposity and accompanied&#xD;
      local microbial factors have any negative impact on healing and progression of DFUs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      A prospective cohort of 300 individuals with type 2 diabetes presenting with diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers (DFUs) at an outpatient clinic will be recruited. At baseline, participants will be&#xD;
      stratified into normal and high adiposity groups as measured by Bioelectrical Impedance&#xD;
      Analysis (BIA). Both groups will receive DFU management according to locally appropriate&#xD;
      standards of care and followed-up for 24 weeks or until complete wound healing, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. Local microbial characteristics, presence or absence of infection and other&#xD;
      clinical parameters will also be assessed, and compared between the two groups. Enrolling 150&#xD;
      participants per group will have a minimum power of 80% to detect a 20% difference in&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of complete ulcer healing (at the 5% level of statistical significance)&#xD;
      between the normal and high adiposity groups.&#xD;

        Participants (males and females) will be newly reporting and known type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
        (T2DM) patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) of any class, stage and grade (based on the&#xD;
        university of Texas ulcer staging system). Any prior treatment and important information&#xD;
        related to the ulcers and patients will be recorded using a pre-tested questionnaire. DFU&#xD;
        will be defined as a full-thickness wound, through the dermis, below the ankle in an&#xD;
        individual with T2DM. Duration of ulcers will be measured and reported in weeks. To recruit&#xD;
        appropriate participants, a careful examination will be done with qualified and trained&#xD;
        personnel. Prior to commencement of the study appropriate manuals and standard operating&#xD;
        procedures will be prepared and used throughout the study period.&#xD;
