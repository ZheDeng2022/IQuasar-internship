    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The&#xD;
      intervention drug will be CD24Fc (intravenous [IV] infusion). A cohort of 64 patients with&#xD;
      HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to be administered 3&#xD;
      doses of CD24Fc (240mg IV infusion) or placebo once every 2 weeks (q2w) during a 4-week&#xD;
      window, followed by a 24-week follow-up window to assess the changes in LDL.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 2, randomized, placebo-control, double-blinded clinical trial to assess&#xD;
      the effect of CD24Fc on reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) among patients with HIV.&#xD;
      The effect of CD24Fc on total cholesterol and triglycerides, markers of immune activation (T&#xD;
      cell activation, sCD14, and inflammatory cytokines), size of HIV reservoirs, hemoglobin&#xD;
      (HbA1c) and leptin, and hepatic steatosis will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that therapy with CD24Fc will result in significant decreases in LDL in&#xD;
      HIV patients. In addition, CD24Fc may reduce leptin and cholesterol, HbA1c, hepatic steatosis&#xD;
      and fibrosis, and markers of inflammation in patients with chronic HIV who are virally&#xD;
      suppressed on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase 2 study, a cohort of 64 HIV patients virally suppressed on ART will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive an intravenous infusion of 240 mg of CD24Fc vs.&#xD;
      placebo administered every 2 weeks during a 4-week treatment window, followed by a 24- week&#xD;
      follow-up period. Patients will be followed for safety and adverse events as well as changes&#xD;
      in lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers during a 24-week follow-up period. This&#xD;
      investigation will take place at the University of Maryland.&#xD;
