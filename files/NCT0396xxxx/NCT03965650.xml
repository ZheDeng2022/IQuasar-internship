      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the beneficial effect of a 3 months&#xD;
      home-based physical exercise program supervised by online videos, in addition to the usual&#xD;
      recommendations, in comparison with usual physical activity as recommended by the WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to compare the following criteria between 2 groups at 3 and 6 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  other measures of disease activity ;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sleep quality ;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  walking ability&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  muscle strength of;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  professional activity;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  cost of cares;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  evolution of weight, BMI and waist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the observance of physical activity program and its tolerance at 3 and 6&#xD;
           months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The spondyloarthritides are a group of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, including ankylosing&#xD;
      spondylitis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease-related rheumatic disease, and&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequence of axial spondyloarthritis is 0.41% in the french population. This disease is&#xD;
      associated with a reduction of physical capacities and quality of life. NSAIDs or even&#xD;
      biologic therapies do not always permit a sufficient control of the disease. Different&#xD;
      physical exercise programs can be effective as an additional therapy for spondyloarthritis,&#xD;
      with positive effects on spinal mobility as well as main disease activity and functional&#xD;
      indices (BASDAI, BASFI and BASMI). The severity of the disease does not seem to influence&#xD;
      significantly the patients' motivation in practicing physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study aims to demonstrate the beneficial effect of physical exercises coached&#xD;
      with a specific internet program diffused on a secured platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will have to connect 3 times weekly in order to follow the entire program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact will be evaluated at 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential impacts of video-coaching program are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of the intrinsic inflammatory activity of the rheumatic disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of the global physical condition: muscular strength and resistance, walking&#xD;
           ability, chest expansion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of fatigue and improvement of sleeping;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of consumption of symptomatic drug (analgesics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids).&#xD;
