    <textblock>
      Newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at high risk for wrong-patient&#xD;
      errors. Effective 2019, The Joint Commission requires that health systems adopt distinct&#xD;
      methods of newborn identification as part of its National Patient Safety Goals. Displaying&#xD;
      patient photographs in the electronic health record (EHR) is a promising strategy to improve&#xD;
      identification of children and adults, but is unlikely to be effective for identifying&#xD;
      newborns. This study assesses the use of Pictographs as a &quot;photo equivalent&quot; for improving&#xD;
      identification of newborns in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-site, two-arm, parallel group, cluster randomized controlled trial will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Pictographs for preventing wrong-patient order errors in the NICU.&#xD;
      Pictographs consist of three elements: 1) pictorial symbols of easy-to-remember objects&#xD;
      (e.g., rainbow, lion); 2) the infant's given name (when available); and 3) a color-coded&#xD;
      border indicating the infant's sex. The study will be conducted at three academic medical&#xD;
      centers that utilize Epic EHR. All parents or guardians will be asked to select a unique&#xD;
      Pictograph for each infant admitted to the NICU to be displayed on the isolette and in the&#xD;
      EHR for the duration of the infant's hospital stay. All clinicians with the authority to&#xD;
      place electronic orders in the study NICUs will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      intervention arm (Pictographs displayed in the EHR) or the control arm (no Pictographs&#xD;
      displayed in the EHR). The main hypothesis is that clinicians assigned to view Pictographs in&#xD;
      the EHR will have a significantly lower rate of wrong-patient order errors in the NICU versus&#xD;
      clinicians assigned to no Pictographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is wrong-patient order sessions, defined as a series of orders placed for&#xD;
      a single patient by a single clinician that contains at least one wrong-patient order. The&#xD;
      Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) measure, a validated, reliable, and automated method&#xD;
      for identifying wrong-patient orders, will be used as the primary outcome measure. The&#xD;
      Wrong-Patient RAR measure identifies one or more orders placed for a patient that are&#xD;
      retracted within 10 minutes, and then reordered by the same clinician for a different patient&#xD;
      within the next 10 minutes. In the validation study conducted at a large academic medical&#xD;
      center, real-time telephone interviews with clinicians confirmed that 76.2% of RAR events&#xD;
      were correctly identified by the measure as wrong-patient orders.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at high risk for wrong-patient&#xD;
      errors. Effective 2019, The Joint Commission requires that health systems adopt distinct&#xD;
      methods of newborn identification to prevent this type of error as part of its National&#xD;
      Patient Safety Goals. Displaying patient photographs in the electronic health record (EHR) is&#xD;
      a promising strategy to improve identification of children and adults, but photographs are&#xD;
      not likely to be effective for identifying newborns. Therefore, this study assesses the use&#xD;
      of Pictographs as a &quot;photo equivalent&quot; for improving identification of newborns in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that clinicians randomly assigned to view Pictographs&#xD;
      in the EHR (intervention arm) will have a significantly lower rate of wrong-patient order&#xD;
      errors in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) compared to clinicians assigned to view no&#xD;
      Pictographs in the EHR (control arm). The secondary hypothesis is that the rate of&#xD;
      wrong-patient orders for siblings of multiple births in the NICU will be significantly lower&#xD;
      for clinicians randomized to the intervention versus control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will pursue the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of displaying Pictographs in EHR systems for reducing&#xD;
      wrong-patient orders among infants in the NICU, using the Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder&#xD;
      measure to identify the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Conduct subgroup analyses of the effectiveness of Pictographs for reducing the rates&#xD;
      of wrong-patient orders among siblings of multiple-birth infants in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. This multi-site, two-arm, parallel-group, cluster randomized controlled trial will&#xD;
      test the effectiveness of Pictographs for preventing wrong-patient order errors in the NICUs&#xD;
      of three health systems. Pictographs consist of three elements: 1) pictorial symbols of&#xD;
      easy-to-remember objects (e.g., rainbow, lion); 2) the infant's given name (when available);&#xD;
      and 3) a color-coded border indicating the infant's sex. For each infant admitted to the&#xD;
      study NICUs, parents or guardians will be asked to select a unique Pictograph to be displayed&#xD;
      on the isolette and in the EHR for the duration of each infant's hospital stay. Clinicians&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm will see a Pictograph displayed in the banner and&#xD;
      verification alert in the EHR. Clinicians randomized to the control arm will not see&#xD;
      Pictographs in the EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sites. The study includes NICUs at the following participating study institutions&#xD;
      representing diverse patient populations: NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY;&#xD;
      Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY; and Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD. All sites&#xD;
      will conduct the study in EpicCare (Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Inclusion Criteria. All infants admitted to the study NICUs will be eligible to be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinician Inclusion Criteria. All clinicians who place electronic orders in the NICU at the&#xD;
      study sites during the study period will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. The clinician is the unit of randomization. Each ordering clinician will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a study arm in a 1:1 random allocation scheme using a computer random&#xD;
      number generator program at all study sites. Then, clinicians will be assigned, as&#xD;
      randomized, to groupers built into Epic to apply configuration rules that dictate whether&#xD;
      Pictographs are displayed according to study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome. The primary outcome is wrong-patient order sessions, defined as a series of&#xD;
      orders placed for a single patient by a single clinician that contains at least one&#xD;
      wrong-patient order. The Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) measure--a validated,&#xD;
      reliable, and automated method endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF #2723)--will be&#xD;
      used to identify wrong-patient orders. The Wrong-Patient RAR measure identifies RAR events,&#xD;
      defined as one or more orders placed for a patient that are retracted within 10 minutes, and&#xD;
      then reordered by the same clinician for a different patient within the next 10 minutes.&#xD;
      These are near-miss errors, caught by the clinician before they reach the patient. In the&#xD;
      validation study, real-time telephone interviews with clinicians demonstrated that 76.2% of&#xD;
      RAR events identified by the measure were confirmed to be wrong-patient orders. In a study&#xD;
      conducted at a large academic medical center, the RAR measure identified more than 5,000&#xD;
      wrong-patient orders in 1 year. Thus, the RAR measure provides robust outcome data to test&#xD;
      safety interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unit of Analysis. If a clinician begins placing orders in the wrong patient's record, several&#xD;
      such orders may be placed consecutively and then retracted together. Therefore, individual&#xD;
      orders do not represent independent opportunities for RAR events to occur, rather the order&#xD;
      session represents an independent opportunity for an RAR event to occur. Thus, the unit of&#xD;
      analysis is the order session, defined as a series of orders placed by a clinician for a&#xD;
      single patient that begins with opening that patient's order file and terminates when an&#xD;
      order is placed for another patient or after 60 minutes, whichever occurs first. The presence&#xD;
      of Pictographs will be tracked as an order-session level characteristic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher Level Units of Analysis. Order sessions are nested within both patient admission and&#xD;
      clinician, and both patients and clinicians are nested within NICU. In the analysis, NICU&#xD;
      will be treated as a fixed covariate, and clinicians are treated as an important source of&#xD;
      variance and &quot;cluster&quot; unit of analysis because clinician is the unit of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Extraction and Management. Data will be extracted retrospectively for all orders (e.g.,&#xD;
      medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and other types) placed by randomized&#xD;
      clinicians for patients receiving care in the study NICUs during the study period. Data for&#xD;
      each order, including order, patient, and clinician characteristics, will be extracted from&#xD;
      the health system data warehouse at each study site at the end of the study period. All&#xD;
      patient and clinician identifiers will be replaced by pseudo-identifiers by research&#xD;
      personnel at study sites to create de-identified analytic data sets, and data will be&#xD;
      transferred electronically to the study biostatistician using a secure file transfer&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing Data. Due to the automatic functioning of the EHR, no missing data concerning orders,&#xD;
      RAR events, study group assignment, or provider-level covariates is expected. There may be&#xD;
      missing information regarding patient-level covariates. If any variables are missing for more&#xD;
      than 1 record per 1,000, analyses will be extended to address this. Data will be presumed to&#xD;
      be missing at random and multiple imputation with chained equations will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan. Because order sessions are nested within clinicians, Aim 1 will be&#xD;
      tested by estimating a multilevel mixed Poisson regression model predicting RAR event status&#xD;
      (yes, no) with Group (Pictograph, coded 1, vs no Pictograph, coded 0) as the primary&#xD;
      predictor and Multiple Status and NICU included as categorical covariates (&quot;class&quot; variables&#xD;
      in SAS); the intercept will be treated as a random effect, assumed to vary among clinicians&#xD;
      within each group. Because RAR events are rare (approximately 5 per 10,000 order sessions),&#xD;
      the mixed Poisson regression model and the mixed logistic regression model yield nearly&#xD;
      identical results with parameter estimates differing in the 3rd significant digit. The&#xD;
      hypothesis will be confirmed if the RR for Group is significantly different from 1.0&#xD;
      (expected to be &lt;1.0), based on the Wald chi-square test of BGroup; i.e., ln(RR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test Aim 2, a variant of the same multilevel Poisson regression model will be estimated in&#xD;
      which the main effect of Group is replaced with the Multiple Status*Group interaction; this&#xD;
      specification will yield two coefficients for Group, one for Singletons (Multiple Status=0)&#xD;
      and one for Multiples (Multiple Status=1). The Wald chi-square test will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the statistical significance of each coefficient, i.e., the effect of Pictographs on RAR risk&#xD;
      for singletons and for multiples. The SAS GLIMMIX procedure will be used to perform these&#xD;
      analyses, and a 2-tailed, alpha=0.05 criterion will be used to evaluate statistical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will examine whether the effect of the Pictograph intervention varies&#xD;
      across hospitals, by EHR vendor, by clinician type and other clinician characteristics, by&#xD;
      patient characteristics, and/or by order session characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Power/Sample Size. The power was calculated using the O'Brien and Muller&#xD;
      approach, an exemplary data set constructed by assumed population parameters to detect the&#xD;
      hypothesized effect. It is estimated approximately 17,000 patients, infants admitted to the&#xD;
      NICU at each site will be recruited, and verbal consent will be obtained from parents or&#xD;
      legal guardians. The number of clinicians is a fixed attribute of the study sites and is not&#xD;
      subject to investigator control. Based on preliminary data, it is assumed that data will be&#xD;
      obtained on 6,250 clinicians, with half randomized to each study arm. With respect to Aim 1,&#xD;
      if the effect sizes are reductions of 30% for singletons and 50% for multiples, as&#xD;
      hypothesized, the study will have 98% power to detect a significant benefit of Pictographs on&#xD;
      RAR event rate. By changing the weights described above to 0.75 and 0.25 for both singletons&#xD;
      and multiples, it is estimated that the study will have 81% power to detect an overall&#xD;
      reduction, across singletons and multiples, of 25% in RAR event rate. Using the mean standard&#xD;
      error, the calculated power for Aim 2 of the proposed study: for singletons, the power to&#xD;
      detect the hypothesized 30% reduction in RAR rate is 89%; for multiples, the power to detect&#xD;
      a 50% reduction is 95%. Minimum effect sizes detectable with 80% power are reductions of 27%&#xD;
      for singletons and 42% for multiples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis. At the midpoint of the study, the Lan-Demets algorithm will be applied for&#xD;
      early termination with an O'Brien-Fleming boundary function to preserve overall Type I error&#xD;
      rate. At the interim review, the corresponding stopping points correspond to a z-statistic&#xD;
      for the primary hypothesis test of ±2.9626. To avoid bias in these judgments, the data sets&#xD;
      will contain interim results for the two arms but will not identify which arm is the&#xD;
      intervention. A test of futility will be conducted, by treating the expected result of 25%&#xD;
      reduction as a null hypothesis. If that hypothesis test is rejected at the 1-tailed 0.001&#xD;
      level, continuation will be considered futile and will conclude the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment/Enrollment. A nurse involved in patient care will inform parents or guardians of&#xD;
      infants admitted to the NICU about the study. The nurse will obtain verbal consent to display&#xD;
      the Pictograph on the infant's isolette and in the infant's medical record in the EHR for the&#xD;
      duration of the infant's hospital stay. Parents who provide verbal consent will select a&#xD;
      unique Pictograph for each infant using the Pictograph Application on an electronic tablet.&#xD;
      The Pictograph Application is a HIPAA-compliant, secure web-based application that enables&#xD;
      Pictograph selection, customization, printing, and uploading to the EHR. Parents with&#xD;
      multiple infants in the NICU will select a different Pictograph for each infant. Selected&#xD;
      Pictographs become unavailable such that no two infants will have the same Pictograph at the&#xD;
      same time in the NICU. The selected Pictograph will be printed and attached to the isolette,&#xD;
      and uploaded into the EHR using the same functionality used to upload and display patient&#xD;
      photographs. When the infant is discharged, the Pictograph will be removed from the isolette&#xD;
      and from the EHR; that image will remain unavailable for use for 2 weeks after the infant is&#xD;
      discharged.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data will be shared with qualified investigators whose research protocols have been IRB-approved by their institutions. The final data set will include retract-and-reorder events (representing near-miss, wrong-patient errors), as well as clinician, patient, and order level characteristics. The final data set will be de-identified, with personal identifiers replaced with pseudo-identifiers. Data will be made available to potential users under a data-sharing agreement that ensures that: (1) data are used only for research purposes and does identify individual participants; (2) data are handled in a secure and confidential way; and (3) data are destroyed or returned after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will be made available upon publication of the primary results.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Data will be transferred using a secure file transfer protocol upon request to the PI.</ipd_access_criteria>
