  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition characterised by recurrent lung infections,&#xD;
      inflammation and progressive lung damage. Patients with CF and advanced lung disease are&#xD;
      limited when exercising and performing activities of daily life, due to increased&#xD;
      breathlessness and lower oxygen levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is an important part of treatment in CF, having been shown to slow down the lung&#xD;
      disease and improve quality of life. Patients with CF are encouraged to exercise both at home&#xD;
      and during hospital admissions, even when the lung disease is advanced. Often, oxygen therapy&#xD;
      is used in patients whose oxygen levels are otherwise too low during. This, however, does not&#xD;
      improve their breathlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a device to deliver air at flows higher than what other device allow has become&#xD;
      available. High flow nasal therapy (HFNT) provides patients with air or a blend of air and&#xD;
      oxygen at flows up to 60 L/min. HFNT can improve oxygen levels and reduce shortness of breath&#xD;
      in many situations both in the acute and chronic setting. HFNT was shown to improve the&#xD;
      tolerance to exercise in patients with other respiratory conditions (chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CF, HFNT is routinely used for patients admitted with acute respiratory failure (inability&#xD;
      to maintain adequate oxygenation) with positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the Investigators aim to understand if HFNT can improve the exercise tolerance&#xD;
      in patients with CF and advanced lung disease, by reducing breathlessness and avoiding the&#xD;
      drop in oxygenation observed during simple training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose a short study to assess if further large clinical trials are&#xD;
      feasible and practical, and will therefore collect preliminary data to have some results to&#xD;
      use for planning other studies. All patients who are admitted in the Leeds Regional Adult CF&#xD;
      Unit will be considered for participation in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular high-level exercise in people with CF has been linked with reduced rate of decline in&#xD;
      lung function, is positively related to quality of life and improvement in bone&#xD;
      mineralisation. Unfortunately, exercise tolerance in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and&#xD;
      severe lung disease is limited by dyspnoea, exercise-induced desaturations (EID) and fatigue.&#xD;
      Therefore, a reduction in patients' activity level can be observed, which would lead to&#xD;
      further deconditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) delivers heated, humidified and oxygenated gas with flow rates&#xD;
      up to 60 L/min at FIO2 adjustable between 0.21 and 1.0 via soft, loose fitting, large bore&#xD;
      nasal prongs (Airvo2/OptiflowTM). HFNT has been shown to (a.) Wash out nasopharyngeal dead&#xD;
      space, minimizing rebreathing of CO2 and acting as a reservoir for fresh air, thus&#xD;
      contributing to improved gas exchange with respect to CO2 and O2. (b) Lower respiratory rate&#xD;
      and provide a small positive end expiratory effect. (c) Provide oxygenated gas at a flow that&#xD;
      matches more closely the patient's spontaneous inspiratory flow rate, thus attenuating&#xD;
      inspiratory resistance within the nasopharynx and eliminating the related increase in work of&#xD;
      breathing. (d) Provide warmed and humidified gas (37°C and 44 mg/L H2O) thus reducing airway&#xD;
      dryness, enhancing patient comfort and reducing the metabolic work associated with gas&#xD;
      conditioning. (e) Moisten secretion and facilitate mucociliary clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFNT is being extensively studied, in comparison to NIV and conventional oxygen therapy, in&#xD;
      de novo acute respiratory failure, in post-surgical and post-extubation setting and in&#xD;
      do-not-intubate patients. One pilot study has demonstrated that HFNT can increase exercise&#xD;
      tolerance in stable patients with severe COPD, with improvement in oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      perceived dyspnea and muscle fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the main limiting factors for exercise tolerance in patients with CF and severe lung&#xD;
      disease are perceived dyspnoea, and hypoxaemia related symptoms, secondary to static and&#xD;
      dynamic hyperinflation, it is conceivable that HFNT could have beneficial effects in&#xD;
      improving exercise tolerance and reducing symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose here a pilot study to assess a feasibility of a subsequent trial of&#xD;
      long-term use of HFNT during exercise training in patients with CF compared to standard&#xD;
      oxygen or room air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-centre, short-term, open, randomized, cross-over study is planned. The Investigators&#xD;
      will compare the results of 6-MWT on HFNT and without HFNT (either on conventional oxygen&#xD;
      therapy or room air). The Investigators plan to enroll 25 subjects, expecting a drop-out rate&#xD;
      of 5%, to have 20 subjects completing the study. Each subject will serve as their own&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will be asked to fill in a questionnaire which is routinely used in&#xD;
      the assessment of exercise and activity among patients with CF, and has been previously&#xD;
      validated in other CF Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures will consist in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two 6-minute walking test (24 to 48 hours apart). The 6-minute walking test is a simple&#xD;
           assessment of exercise and consist in the patient having a brisk walk for 6 minutes.&#xD;
           Patients can increase or decrease the speed at their will while walking. Oxygen and&#xD;
           carbon dioxide (the waste gas) levels will be measured through a sensor applied to the&#xD;
           skin. Patients will be asked to score their breathlessness, comfort and fatigue, before,&#xD;
           during and after the test. One of the tests will be performed under the usual condition,&#xD;
           the other test on HFNT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function before and after each 6-minute walking test. Lung function is a standard&#xD;
           assessment in CF, consisting in blowing air into a machine to measure lung volumes and&#xD;
           flows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures related to the 6-minute walking test and the lung function will be recorded as part&#xD;
      of the study. The Investigators will record patients' feedback on shortness of breath,&#xD;
      comfort and fatigue, but also oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, frequency of breathing and&#xD;
      distance walked during the 6 minutes.&#xD;
