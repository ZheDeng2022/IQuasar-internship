      Determination of the best positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) based on oxygenation or&#xD;
      driving pressure in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a positive end-expiratory pressure in acute respiratory distress syndrome is&#xD;
      obvious in ARDS management. On the one hand it serves to fight against the reduction of&#xD;
      functional residual capacity (FRC) and enable the limitation of hypoxia; and on the other&#xD;
      hand it allows the limitation of &quot;opening/closing&quot; lesions in pulmonary alveoli which lead to&#xD;
      increase &quot;bio trauma&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However elevated PEEP has harmful effect such as hemodynamic effect on the right ventricle&#xD;
      and distension on healthy part of the lung.Other adverse effects are: decreasing cardiac&#xD;
      output, increased risk of barotrauma, and the interference with assessment of hemodynamic&#xD;
      pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally the adjustment of PEEP level must be done by taking into account each patient&#xD;
      characteristic. PEEP titration based on blood gas analysis is one of the most used techniques&#xD;
      by physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines for lung-protective ventilation in patients with acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS) suggest the use of low tidal volumes (Vt), set according to ideal&#xD;
      body weight (IBW) of the patient, and higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure&#xD;
      (PEEP) to limit ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). However, recent studies have shown&#xD;
      that ARDS patients who are ventilated according to these guidelines may still be exposed to&#xD;
      forces that can induce or aggravate lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driving pressure (DP) is the difference between the airway pressure at the end of inspiration&#xD;
      (plateau pressure, Ppl) and PEEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driving pressure may be a valuable tool to set PEEP. Independent of the strategy used to&#xD;
      titrate PEEP, changes in PEEP levels should consider the impact on driving pressure, besides&#xD;
      other variables such as gas exchange and hemodynamics. A decrease in driving pressure after&#xD;
      increasing PEEP will necessarily reflect recruitment and a decrease in cyclic strain. On the&#xD;
      contrary, an increase in driving pressure will suggest a non-recruitable lung, in which&#xD;
      overdistension prevails over recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purposes of this study are to assess the optimal PEEP based on the best driving&#xD;
      pressure or the best oxygenation.&#xD;
