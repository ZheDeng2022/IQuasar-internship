  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol reflects the first part of a larger mixed-methods study aimed at exploring the&#xD;
      process by which global recommendations can be translated into context-specific,&#xD;
      evidence-informed action for diabetes prevention in low-resource settings. The CEAD project&#xD;
      will be carried out in 2 low-resource settings in Ecuador. Here, in recognition that rigorous&#xD;
      epidemiological data on diabetes risk and morbidity is needed to explore applicability of&#xD;
      potential actions, the investigators will undertake 2 representative cross-sectional&#xD;
      population survey using geospatial sampling. We will collect dat by interview in the homes of&#xD;
      the participants using WHO STEPS questionnaires and measure participants' physical and&#xD;
      biological parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To provide rigorous epidemiological data on diabetes risk and morbidity in Health&#xD;
      District 17D06 in Quito, Ecuador; and Eloy Alfaro District, located in the coastal region of&#xD;
      Esmeraldas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The investigators will undertake two cross-sectional population surveys, with&#xD;
      representative samples of the selected health districts, to estimate the prevalence of&#xD;
      diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and NCD risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample design: Participants will be selected using multi-stage cluster sampling. We will use&#xD;
      parishes or 'micro-areas' as primary Enumeration Areas (EA) for which official GIS shape&#xD;
      files and population estimates are available. The EAs will be randomly selected with a&#xD;
      probability proportional to its population density. In urban areas, after having sampled EAs,&#xD;
      buildings or homes will be identified by randomly generated GPS points. The investigators&#xD;
      will then sample one person at random in each household.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rural areas, the investigators will randomly select villages from within the samples EAS,&#xD;
      and then undertake the simple random sampling of individuals by using an existing census&#xD;
      already developed by voluntary health promotors, and digitised by a local NGO. This census&#xD;
      will be updated in the 3 months preceding sample selection to ensure accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size is proposed assuming the prevalence of diabetes is no higher&#xD;
      than 10%, to provide an estimate with an absolute precision of +/- 3%, with a 95% confidence&#xD;
      level. The investigators assume a design effect of 1.5 (recommended in STEPS guideline for&#xD;
      complex designs in absence of locally available alternatives) and will further increased the&#xD;
      sample size to allow for up to 20% refusal or loss due to individuals not attending their&#xD;
      appointment for physical and biological measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey procedures: The questionnaire will be designed according to the WHO STEPS NCD risk&#xD;
      factor survey forms , and some survey-specific questions. Detailed demographic information&#xD;
      will also be included following the WHO STEPS core questions and extended questions (highest&#xD;
      level of education, ethnicity, marital status, employment status and household income).&#xD;
      Cultural adaptations to the questions will be made as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questions will be used to compile a purpose designed electronic survey form loaded onto&#xD;
      tablets purchased for the research. The survey tool will be pre-piloted before the survey,&#xD;
      after training the data collection team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty trained interviewers will establish survey eligibility, solicit informed consent, and&#xD;
      carry out the survey in the participant's home. Composition of the survey team will be gender&#xD;
      balanced, and include staff who represent local cultural, ethnic and religious groups. The&#xD;
      survey will be carried out in Spanish but some interviewers will also be fluent in Quechua,&#xD;
      Chachi and any other relevant indigenous language to translate questions verbally if&#xD;
      required. Data collection in rural areas will engage the volunteer health promotors. The&#xD;
      surveyors will arrange an appointment for physical and biological measurements together with&#xD;
      the participant considering geographical convenience and availability. Individuals with a&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl and/or a 2 hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl, or blood&#xD;
      pressure over 140/90 mmHg will be referred to their local health facility for care. All&#xD;
      participants will receive the results of their physical measurements and blood analyses and&#xD;
      will receive a health promotion booklet about diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and the&#xD;
      importance of healthy diet and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical measurements and laboratory: Weight, height, waist circumference will be measured&#xD;
      and we will include limited biochemical measurements (fasting blood glucose, cholesterol and&#xD;
      creatinine) analysed at regional reference laboratories. Participants will also undergo an&#xD;
      Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Survey participants will be invited to a well-lit&#xD;
      hygienic location after at least 8 hours fasting. Appointments will be first thing in the&#xD;
      morning and participants will be instructed to eat or drink nothing but water from 10pm the&#xD;
      night before. Instructions for fasting will be given on the appointment card given to the&#xD;
      participants the survey day and telephone reminders will be sent when possible. All&#xD;
      participants will receive breakfast after the OGTT test. Diabetic patients on medication will&#xD;
      be asked to bring their medication and take it immediately after their breakfast after blood&#xD;
      draw. They will not be asked to complete an OGTT. Similarly, pregnant women are eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the study but will not undergo an OGTT, only fasting blood glucose. In order&#xD;
      to ensure absence of pregnancy, the investigators will provide pregnancy tests to women in&#xD;
      fertile age who are unable to confirm the absence of pregnancy at the household interview.&#xD;
      Steps will be taken to minimise variability (at study zone level) in the pre-analytical&#xD;
      treatment of samples. Blood extraction, storage and transportation will follow standard&#xD;
      infection control measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis: Stickers with Quick Response (QR) codes that can be scanned by&#xD;
      the android devices at each step will be used to ensure linkage of data collected in&#xD;
      participant's home, their physical and biological measurements and laboratory results. The&#xD;
      investigators will use and modify the WHO STEPS forms where possible and import them to Kobo&#xD;
      toolbox free open source software (or ODK collect if necessary). Stata/SE (StataCorp, Texas,&#xD;
      U.S.A.) Version 12.1. will be used for statistical analysis. The prevalence of impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance, diabetes, and the other NCD risk factors will be calculated with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals. Outcomes will be disaggregated by sex, age group, ethnicity and&#xD;
      socioeconomic position. Geographical variation in survey outcomes will also be described.&#xD;
      Steps will be taken to prevent missing data, but some level is unavoidable and we will&#xD;
      incorporate methods analysing missing data or data from uncertain sources when necessary.&#xD;

    <description>New cases of diabetes will be identified by performing the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. Participants will drink a solution containing 75 g of glucose and their plasma glucose will be measured 2 hours later. Glucose concentration will be given in mg/dl. Individuals will be classified as having impaired glucose tolerance if glycemia after 2 hours is higher than 200 mg/dl and at risk of developing diabetes if he or she has a glicaemia between 140 and 199 mg/dl. Already diagnosed diabetic patients and pregnant women will not undergo this test.</description>
