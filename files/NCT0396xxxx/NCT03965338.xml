  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain cortex controls movement but the influence of peripheral component of movement on the&#xD;
      cortex is not known. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(fMRI) studies in stroke and fantom&#xD;
      limb patients investigate cortex areas activated during execution and imagination of complex&#xD;
      hand movements. These studies aim to understand the mechanisms of the motor component of&#xD;
      movement but the results are limited as there is no effector organ in fantom limb patients&#xD;
      and the affecting organ is damaged in stroke patients. The investigators hypothesized that&#xD;
      the areas of the cortex that is activated to remember, set-up and order to move can be&#xD;
      isolated from the areas that are activated during the motor component of movement. To prove&#xD;
      this hypothesis the investigators developed a model that investigate the brain activation&#xD;
      areas during the patient try to execute and imagine doing a complex motor task (sequential&#xD;
      opposition with the thumb to the other four fingers) with a peripherally blocked arm. Brain&#xD;
      fMRI in 15 right-handed patients scheduled to undergo right-hand surgery with peripheral&#xD;
      block anesthesia will be obtained before the surgery day and just before surgery after the&#xD;
      block. Participants will be screened when executing the task (after the block they just&#xD;
      attempt), during rest and during they imagine doing the task. Bilateral cortex activation&#xD;
      areas will be compared when the right hand was intact and was peripherally blocked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many unknowns in the relationship between the brain-peripheric organ during&#xD;
      movement. The investigators hope that some of these mechanisms will be identified by the new&#xD;
      model we used in our study. The final benefit will be to develop stroke therapies and new&#xD;
      therapies for neuropathic pain which is closely related to motor function.&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators aim to separate the cortex areas that are activated during&#xD;
      one remember, set-up and plan and start doing a motor task from the areas that are activated&#xD;
      during performing the motor component. The investigators hypothesized that these areas can be&#xD;
      identified by screening areas with fMRI when participants are asked to perform a complex&#xD;
      motor task with a hand that is completely blocked. The hypothesis is based on the fact that&#xD;
      in a participant with a peripherally blocked arm the central component of the movement will&#xD;
      not be affected and the activation areas that remember and plan to do a motor task can be&#xD;
      separated from the areas that are activated when the effector organ is doing the motor task,&#xD;
      in other words, the motor component of the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators also aim to show;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If there is an ipsilateral cortex activity during a participant with a peripherally&#xD;
           blocked arm try to execute a complex motor task. The investigators know that in&#xD;
           centrally paralyzed hands there is ipsilateral activity and there is no argument if this&#xD;
           is an adaptive response or it is present from the beginning of the motor paralysis due&#xD;
           to the strength of the central event of the contralateral brain area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If there is a difference between activation areas of the cortex during the imaginary of&#xD;
           complex hand movements with the intact and peripherally blocked arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (&gt;18) that have been scheduled to have right-hand surgery with peripheral&#xD;
      blockage of the arm will be evaluated for the study. The patients will be informed about all&#xD;
      the details and the consequences of the study and patients who give written informed consent&#xD;
      will be included in the study. Local ethics committee approval is obtained in 05.12.2018. the&#xD;
      study will be continued until the planned 15 patients are recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right-hand dominance of the patient will be confirmed by Edinburgh handedness inventory&#xD;
      (Oldfield,1971) and scores will be recorded. In the end, the mean of the score will be&#xD;
      obtained for the whole study population. medium-high degree right handedness will be required&#xD;
      for inclusion to the study. The patients who do not give written informed consents, patients&#xD;
      who use their left hand dominantly, patients who have a neurologic or psychiatric disease,&#xD;
      the patients with hearing and visual loss, who have history of substance abuse or who had&#xD;
      surgery in the previous 12 months, with a history of major systemic disease (ASA III and IV)&#xD;
      , with history of drugs that alter neurologic activity, who are unable to stay at MR machine&#xD;
      without sedation, who are accepted to have a surgery duration of more than 3 hours, and&#xD;
      patients who have a motor deficit at their right hand that makes the performance of the motor&#xD;
      task impossible will not be included to the study. before the MR scanning patients will have&#xD;
      a neurologic examination to show any neurologic insult related to the pathology they will&#xD;
      have the operation for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these examinations and evaluations will be made at most 10 days before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will perform a given motor task of block sequence. Patients will touch the&#xD;
      other digits by the thumb in a given order and sequence. At the same session patients, will&#xD;
      be screened while imagining doing the same task. The orders to rest, imagine and perform the&#xD;
      task will be given by an MRI compatible monitor- mirror set. Patients will practice the task&#xD;
      of the experiment before the real screening sessions. The patients will be observed while in&#xD;
      the magnet to see if they perform the task appropriately.&#xD;
