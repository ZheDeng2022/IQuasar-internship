      This is a prospective, randomized, open label, parallel, 16-week study to explore and&#xD;
      evaluate the therapeutic effects of liraglutid, dapagliflozin and acarbose on the cognitive&#xD;
      function, olfactory function, and odor-induced brain activation in overweight/obese patients&#xD;
      with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.We have 1 principle&#xD;
      investigator, 6 sub-investigators and 1 nurse in research centre. The sub-investigators will&#xD;
      screen in the outpatient and inpatient departments to enroll 87 patients (29 for each arm)&#xD;
      totally with the inclusion and exclusion criteria in 12 months. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio into liraglutid, dapagliflozin and acarbose treatment group with&#xD;
      a computer-generated random order. All patients will also continue on their existing dose and&#xD;
      regimen of metformin throughout the study. At the baseline, clinical information collection,&#xD;
      100g-steamed bread meal test, biochemical measurement, body composition analysis, cognitive&#xD;
      assessment, olfactory test and functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) scan will be&#xD;
      conducted for all patients. During the treatment period, visits at 4-week intervals will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the safety of drugs and adjust the dose of metformin if hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      occurs; meanwhile, fasting and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose assayed by fingerstick,&#xD;
      physical examination, and olfactory test will be conducted. At the end of the study, all of&#xD;
      the assessments will be performed again for all recruited subjects, including early&#xD;
      withdrawal patients.&#xD;

    <description>The olfactory threshold test (score range 1-13.5) is determined based on a series of binary dilutions of the N-butanol solution in light mineral oil. The higher the score is, the more sensitive the participant is in detecting an odor. Scores of 8-10 were considered normal olfactory sensitivity, whereas scores of 1-3 signified olfactory dysfunction or anosmia, and scores of ≥10 indicate better olfactory sensitivity.</description>

    <description>Liraglutid will be titrated from 0.6mg/day to a final dose 1.8mg/day during the first 2 weeks, if well tolerated. Meanwhile, All patients will also continue on their existing dose and regimen of metformin throughout the study. Visits at 4-week intervals will be performed to evaluate the safety of drugs. Metformin dose can be reduced in response to hypoglycaemia, but liraglutid could not be adjusted.
