      To evaluate the effect of the Minneapolis minimum wage ordinance on change in body mass index&#xD;
      among low-wage workers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On June 30 2017, Minneapolis became the 40th local jurisdiction to set the minimum wage above&#xD;
      the state level, following a succession of other cities and counties across the U.S that have&#xD;
      passed similar ordinances since 2012. The city of Minneapolis will incrementally increase the&#xD;
      minimum wage from $9.50 to $15 by July 1, 2022 for all businesses with greater than 100&#xD;
      employees; minimum wage in smaller businesses will increase from $7.75 to $13.50 during this&#xD;
      same time period. The ordinance specifically states that its purpose is to &quot;maintain worker's&#xD;
      health, efficacy, and general well-being.&quot; A report by members of the study team at the&#xD;
      Humphrey School of Public Affairs at University of Minnesota estimates that the ordinance&#xD;
      would increase wages by an average of 22% for the 71,000 city workers making minimum wage or&#xD;
      just above minimum wage; moreover, it would affect 41% of non-Hispanic black workers and 54%&#xD;
      of Hispanic workers, compared with 17% of white workers. The report also projects a&#xD;
      post-policy decrease in food insecurity of 3.8 percentage points and an increase in food&#xD;
      expenditures of $26 per week among affected workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The available evidence suggests that minimum wage laws may be associated with a range of&#xD;
      health outcomes, including obesity. Obesity affects 36.5% of Americans, and is&#xD;
      disproportionately high among non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics. A study by Meltzer and Chen&#xD;
      (2009) estimated that 10% of the increase in body mass in the U.S. since 1970 can be&#xD;
      explained through the diminished value of minimum wages by inflation, while Kim &amp; Leigh&#xD;
      (2010) used instrumental variables to demonstrate that low wages increase the risk of&#xD;
      obesity. Mechanisms through which increasing the minimum wage could reduce obesity include&#xD;
      improving food security and reducing cost constraints for purchasing healthier foods.&#xD;
      However, existing studies linking wages and weight have design weaknesses that limit causal&#xD;
      inference and the ability to identify causal mechanisms. A prospective study with a strong&#xD;
      counterfactual condition is needed to test whether and how an increase in minimum wage&#xD;
      results in improved obesity-related outcomes among low-wage workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the 4.5-year implementation period of the Minneapolis minimum wage ordinance&#xD;
      (January 1, 2018-July 1, 2022), the team will follow a cohort of low-wage workers in a&#xD;
      natural experiment, using a difference-in-difference design to compare a panel of&#xD;
      obesity-related measures among low-wage workers (those earning â‰¤$10 an hour at baseline) in&#xD;
      Minneapolis (n = 400) with low-wage workers in a comparison city with no minimum wage&#xD;
      increase (Raleigh, North Carolina, n = 400).&#xD;

    <description>Body mass index (BMI) will be measured over 5 years among low-wage workers in Minneapolis compared to workers in a comparison (control) city, as assessed by objective annual height and weight measurements.</description>

    <measure>Change Purchase of Healthier Foods</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in purchasing of healthier foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables) and less healthy foods (e.g. sugar sweetened beverages) will be measured by 2 weeks of food purchase receipts, among a cohort of low-wage workers in Minneapolis compared to a control city.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Food Insecurity</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in food insecurity will be measured by the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module: Six-Item Short Form (from the Economic Research Service, USDA September 2012), among a cohort of low-wage workers in Minneapolis compared to a control city. Scores are calculated by simple addition for the 6 items. Scores range from 0 (high food security) to 6 (very low food security).</description>

    <measure>Change in Food Assistance Program Participation</measure>
