  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of methylase system in the accelerated atherosclerotic progression of diabetic&#xD;
      patients is unclear. Authors will evaluate methylase activity in carotid plaques of&#xD;
      asymptomatic diabetic and non diabetic patients, as well as the effect of metformin added to&#xD;
      sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SLGT2i) therapy vs. metformin alone in diabetic&#xD;
      plaques. Plaques will be obtained from 43 type 2 diabetic and 30 non diabetic patients&#xD;
      undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Diabetic patients will receive 1000 mg of metformin (n 23)&#xD;
      or 1000 mg of metformin plus SGLT2i (100 mg of canagliflozin; n 20) or placebo (n 23) for 4&#xD;
      months before scheduled endarterectomy. Plaques will be analyzed for macrophages (CD68),&#xD;
      T-cells (CD3), inflammatory cells (HLADR), methylase activity, nuclear factor (NF)-KB, tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, nitrotyrosine, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and collagen&#xD;
      content (immunohistochemistry and enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay. Authors' study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that methylase over-activity will be associated with enhanced inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction and NF-KB expression in diabetic plaques. Secondly, the inhibition of methylase&#xD;
      activity in atherosclerotic lesions of diabetic patients by metformin plus SLGT2i might be&#xD;
      associated with morphological and compositional characteristics of a potential stable plaque&#xD;
      phenotype, possibly by down regulating NF-KB-mediated inflammatory pathways.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) leads to increased vulnerability for plaque disruption and mediates&#xD;
      increased incidence and severity of clinical events. Inflammation, particularly in diabetes,&#xD;
      plays a central role in the cascade of events that result in plaque erosion and fissuring.&#xD;
      There is emerging evidence that the methylase system might be involved in both initial stage&#xD;
      and progression of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the methylase system might be involved in&#xD;
      inflammatory/oxidative stress pathway, involved for activation of nuclear factor kappa B&#xD;
      (NF-KB), and other proteins linked to over inflammation/oxidative stress. Although it has&#xD;
      been demonstrated that diabetes may up regulate these inflammatory/oxidative pathway, still&#xD;
      no evidence exists about the potential role of methylase system in the evolution of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic patients. Conversely, less data have been reported about&#xD;
      the possible modulation of these pathways by hypoglycemic drugs as SLGT2i. However, in the&#xD;
      present study authors hypothesized that by increasing methylase activity, diabetes may&#xD;
      enhance the inflammatory potential of atherosclerotic plaques favoring instability.&#xD;
      Therefore, authors designed this study to identify differences in inflammatory infiltration&#xD;
      as well as methylase activity between carotid plaques of asymptomatic diabetic and non&#xD;
      diabetic (normoglycemics) patients. Because experimental and pathological studies suggest&#xD;
      that activation of methylase system might control inflammation/oxidative stress, the present&#xD;
      study also evaluated the effect of the metformin added to SLGT2i (vs. metformin alone) on&#xD;
      methylase activity in carotid plaques of diabetic patients.&#xD;
