      Study design: The Spanish registry of RYR1 and CACNA1S polymorphisms (RYCA) is an anonymous&#xD;
      descriptive observational multicentre study that aims to identify and catalogue the variants&#xD;
      or polymorphisms in the RYR1 and CACNA1S genes in the Spanish population. Secondarily, its&#xD;
      correlation with the binding mutations described in both genes at European level by the EMHG&#xD;
      will be evaluated to assess the incidence of malignant hyperthermia in Spain. The RYCA&#xD;
      registry complies with the highest standards of European and international homologation, both&#xD;
      with regard to computer security and the protection of personal data (Data Protection Law&#xD;
      15/1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Performing a Spanish registry of RYR1 and CACNA1S polymorphisms will contribute&#xD;
      to describe the variants present in our environment and determine their relationship with MH&#xD;
      susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the national polymorphisms of the RYR1 and CACNA1S genes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the incidence of genetic MH susceptibility according to the recommendations&#xD;
           of the EMHG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of polymorphisms in a population that has not been studied before may have a&#xD;
      difficult correlation with the mutations described in the EMHG webpage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria: The sample contained in the registry will originate from the genetic&#xD;
      data of patients unrelated to HM who have been sequenced the RYR1 and CACNA1S gene by another&#xD;
      pathology. The data related to the genetic analysis will be provided without identifying data&#xD;
      of the patient or the clinical history. There will be no possibility of identification of the&#xD;
      patient by the team responsible for the RYCA registry, so the request for informed consent is&#xD;
      not viable. There will be no selection of participants or patient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A preliminary pilot study will be conducted in an unselected anonymous cohort of&#xD;
      the sequenced exome database of the RYR1 and CACNA1S gene at the La Fe Health Research&#xD;
      Institute (IISlaFe). The population contained in this database is random and unrelated to HM&#xD;
      and the patients are anonymous, so we do not have access to personal data or medical history.&#xD;
      If the analysis is feasible, a request for collaboration will be transferred to the Genetics&#xD;
      Services / Research Units with experience in the exome sequencing of the RYR1 and CACNA1S&#xD;
      genes. Anonymous readings will be requested to carry out the registration and description of&#xD;
      the variants existing in the Spanish population and their relationship with the variants&#xD;
      described by the EMHG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables: The registry will include the chromosomal coordinates, number of total patients&#xD;
      included, number of patients whose variant is in heterozygosis, number of patients whose&#xD;
      variant is in homozygosis and allelic frequency. Thus, for each of the genes of interest, and&#xD;
      making use of their respective chromosomal coordinates, information regarding the variants&#xD;
      that these might include will be extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. Sample size calculation is not considered since it is a descriptive record.&#xD;
