      1. Title of the Research Project： Study of regional Cerebral Oxygenation and Brain Blood&#xD;
           Volume changes during Cardiac Surgery using the NeurOS system (COBBV-CS Trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background/Problem Statement: The use of regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) monitoring&#xD;
           has grown clinically, even becoming the standard of care in some institutions.&#xD;
           Monitoring of intracranial tissue oxygenation is fundamentally possible because light in&#xD;
           the near infrared spectrum (700-900nm) penetrates bone, muscle, and other tissue.&#xD;
           Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin have distinct peak absorption spectra, but there is an&#xD;
           isobestic wavelength (i.e., wavelength for which the peak absorption of light is similar&#xD;
           for oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, approximately 810nm) for absorption by total&#xD;
           hemoglobin. Determination of rScO2 thus is possible with transmission of just 2&#xD;
           wavelengths of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the relative&#xD;
           concentrations of oxyhemoglobin versus total hemoglobin. A decrease in rSO2 from&#xD;
           baseline &gt;20% or an absolute rSO2 value &lt;50% often is reported in clinical investigation&#xD;
           as representing a clinically meaningful reduction or &quot;desaturation.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data is controversial on the benefits of NIRS to prevent or reduce stroke or delirium&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery. However, it must be realized the inherent limitations of monitors&#xD;
      alone to impact clinical outcomes without a standardized intervention algorithm. Although&#xD;
      multiple NIRS monitors are approved in the United States and other countries primarily for&#xD;
      assessing the adequacy of cerebral oxygenation during surgery, their approval is not based on&#xD;
      the indication of detecting and/or lowering the frequency of neurological complications. In&#xD;
      regard to the latter, strokes are believed widely to result primarily from cerebral embolism&#xD;
      and/or cerebral hypoperfusion. Importantly, both etiologies can contribute to cerebral injury&#xD;
      in the same patient insofar as hypoperfusion may delay washout of microembolism and/or&#xD;
      compromise collateral perfusion to the ischemic penumbra. Many strokes, though, occur in&#xD;
      subcortical brain areas or at sites remote from the area of NIRS monitoring, and many occur&#xD;
      in the postoperative period after NIRS monitoring has concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, technological advances with NIRS monitoring have continued and now include the&#xD;
      ability to perform bedside cerebral autoregulation monitoring. Regional cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      provides a clinically acceptable surrogate of cerebral blood flow (CBF) for clinical&#xD;
      autoregulation monitoring. Monitoring CBF autoregulation with rSO2 has many clinically&#xD;
      attractive features, including the following: It is noninvasive, monitoring requires little&#xD;
      caregiver intervention, and it has sufficient resolution to discriminate the lower&#xD;
      autoregulatory threshold to prevent brain ischemia. On the other hand, simply raising mean&#xD;
      blood pressure targets during CPB, however, may not necessarily be beneficial because for&#xD;
      some individuals this may result in blood pressure above the upper limit of autoregulation,&#xD;
      which potentially could lead to cerebral hyperperfusion, increasing cerebral embolic load&#xD;
      and/or enhancing cerebral edema in the setting of systemic inflammatory response to cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. Individualizing blood pressure during CPB based on physiological endpoints such as&#xD;
      rSO2 monitoring, rather than empiric targets, may provide a means for modifying the risk for&#xD;
      renal injury and major organ morbidity and possibly mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Statement: Disposable rSO2 sensors are costly and is becoming a rate limiting factor&#xD;
      hindering its widespread clinical use. Reusable sensors like NeurOS cerebral oximetry are&#xD;
      only a fraction of cost with similar performances in healthy volunteers. The investigators&#xD;
      will use NeurOS in accordance with its approved labeling and indications by FDA. Cardiac&#xD;
      surgery has significant variations and great clinical importance of cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      during different stages of surgery. Blood volume changes before, during and after&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass have not been studied previously and could provide critical&#xD;
      information to prevent postoperative cognitive changes. The NeurOS system calculates the sum&#xD;
      of attenuation of two wavelengths to provide brain blood volume index (BVI) continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the performance of NeurOS with INVOS system during cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the brain blood volume changes during cardiac surgery, which has never been&#xD;
           studied before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study Design/Methodology: All cardiac surgical patients are already receiving INVOS&#xD;
      cerebral oximetry monitoring during surgery at Jewish Hospital. Both INVOS and NeurOS pads&#xD;
      will be placed on the same patient. Continuous monitoring of both cerebral oximetry data for&#xD;
      the whole length of cardiac surgery will be recorded and saved in a USB drive for retrieval&#xD;
      and analysis. Key point left and right-side cerebral oximetry data include: Baseline,&#xD;
      Anesthesia Induction, Incision, Initiation cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), Aortic Clamping,&#xD;
      Coming off CPB and Skin Closure. These key points data will be extracted for comparison&#xD;
      between NeurOS and INVOS in terms of percentage change from the baseline. In addition, a&#xD;
      time-rSO2 graph will be plotted for each patient side by side with NeurOS and INVOS cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation for trend comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Sample selection and size: 100 consecutive cardiac surgical patients at Jewish&#xD;
           Hospital, Louisville, KY (2 months to recruit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Describe the proposed intervention: Apply the single use NeurOS cerebral oximetry&#xD;
           sensor adhesive onto patients' forehead who are going to have cardiac surgery in the&#xD;
           operating room before anesthesia induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Data collection procedures, instruments used, and methods for data quality control:&#xD;
           Anesthesia providers (attending anesthesiologists, residents and CRNAs) provide routine&#xD;
           anesthesia care for cardiac surgery. NeurOS and INVOS rSO2 reading are automatically&#xD;
           recorded in the VO200-NeurOS Cerebral Oximetry Monitor and the INOVS Monitor&#xD;
           respectively. Significant events (Baseline, Anesthesia Induction, Incision, Initiation&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), Aortic Clamping, Coming off CPB and Skin Closure) will be&#xD;
           marked manually by the anesthesia providers in individual systems. Brain blood volume&#xD;
           index will be automatically recorded and retracted from the NeurOS system once surgery&#xD;
           is over. All data will be downloaded from the system into an encrypted USB drive for&#xD;
           storage and analysis. Data quality control will be ensured by the individual system&#xD;
           alarms for poor signals and be corrected by anesthesia providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Unit of analysis and observation: Cerebral Oxygenation in percentage of oxyhemoglobin.&#xD;
           Brain blood volume index in the sum of attenuation of two wavelengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Subject Recruitment Methods: All patients presenting to Jewish Hospital for cardiac&#xD;
      surgery will be contacted for potential recruitment on the day of surgery in the preoperative&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Informed Consent Process/Complete Waiver Process: Informed consent will be provided to all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all consented patients, baseline cerebral oxygenation and brain blood volume index will be&#xD;
      obtained at room air or baseline oxygen requirement level in NeurOS and INVOS systems. Both&#xD;
      NeurOS and INVOS rSO2 and brain blood volume indexes will be continuously recorded and saved&#xD;
      in the respective system throughout the whole cardiac surgery. General anesthesia will be&#xD;
      induced by using O2 administered via face mask and IV fentanyl 1μg/ kg, propofol 2-3mg/kg and&#xD;
      rocuronium 1mg/kg. Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with inhaled isoflurane in&#xD;
      air/oxygen mixture and muscle relaxation using intermittent boluses of rocuronium. Fentanyl&#xD;
      will be used as supplemental analgesia. Normocapnic ventilation was maintained. Upon&#xD;
      completion of surgery and weaning from cardio pulmonary bypass, titrated doses of protamine&#xD;
      will be administered to reverse the anticoagulant action of heparin, targeting to achieve&#xD;
      baseline preoperative Activated clotting Time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery, all rSO2 and brain blood volume index data are downloaded into an&#xD;
      encrypted USB drive for analysis and storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Minimizing Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All HIPPA related information will be stored in a private computer in a password&#xD;
           protected computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cleaning of cables, monitors and reusable equipment are performed after each use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standard electrical precautions will be followed to prevent electrical shock to&#xD;
           providers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Plan for Analysis of Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trend graphs of INVOS and NeurOS cerebral oximetry will be plotted together to compare&#xD;
           whether they follow a similar trend. Cerebral oxygenation deviation from the baseline&#xD;
           will be compared through statistical analysis to identify whether NeurOS performs as&#xD;
           well as INVOS at these critical moments during cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trend graphs of NeurOS brain blood volume, arterial blood pressure, central venous&#xD;
           pressure and cerebral oxygenation will be plotted together to identify correlations&#xD;
           among these parameters. Each key point brain blood volume index deviation from the&#xD;
           baseline will be analyzed to identify whether above mentioned critical moments during&#xD;
           cardiac surgery will affect the brain blood volume. Clinical outcomes data will be&#xD;
           collected on 30-day mortality and strokes to identify whether the brain blood volume&#xD;
           index directly affects clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Programs to be used for data analysis: Software R&#xD;
&#xD;
           10. Research Materials, Records, and Privacy: Identify the sources of research material&#xD;
           obtained from individually identifiable living human subjects: Prospective noninvasive&#xD;
           data on cerebral oxygenation and brain blood volume during cardiac surgery. Please see&#xD;
           data collection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicate what information (records, data, etc.) will be recorded and whether use will be made&#xD;
      of existing records or data: Cerebral oxygenation and brain blood volume. They will be&#xD;
      recorded in the medical charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explain why this information is needed to conduct the study: These data are necessary to&#xD;
      identify outcomes for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specify how the data will be de-identified (if applicable), who has access to the data, where&#xD;
      the data will be stored and how the researcher will protect both the data with respect to&#xD;
      privacy and confidentiality. Address physical security measures (e.g., locked facility,&#xD;
      limited access); data security (e.g., password-protection, data encryption); safeguards to&#xD;
      protect identifiable research information (e.g., coding or links): Once required information&#xD;
      is collected, HIPPA information will be deleted. All HIPPA related information will be stored&#xD;
      in a private computer in a password protected computer. No links will be provided to the&#xD;
      public.&#xD;
