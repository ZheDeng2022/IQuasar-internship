      Background Eating disorders rank among the ten leading causes of disability among young&#xD;
      women, and anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate of all mental disorders. Follow-up&#xD;
      studies have shown that 20-30 % of patients with eating disorders develop longstanding&#xD;
      symptoms, seriously impairing their daily and represents a public health concern. There are&#xD;
      very few studies on the course of these patients. Several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      comorbidity between eating disorders and personality disorders. Among patients with eating&#xD;
      disorders, the reported frequencies of personality disorders vary from 27% to 77%. Most of&#xD;
      the studies are cross-sectional designs, thus unable to catch trends or changes over time.&#xD;
      There is a need for prospective longitudinal studies of adult patients using structured&#xD;
      diagnostic interviews both for eating disorders and personality disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Modum Bad, a Norwegian psychiatric hospital, the investigators have conducted a follow-up&#xD;
      study of patients with longstanding eating disorder 1-, 2- and 5-years after treatment. The&#xD;
      aim of the present project is to follow-up the patients additional 17-years after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Investigate the 17-years course and outcome of adult patients with severe and&#xD;
      longstanding eating disorders with regard to eating disorder-related symptoms, general&#xD;
      symptoms and personality disorders in addition to examining whether personality disorders and&#xD;
      sexual abuse in childhood can predict the course and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Examining patients 17-years after treatment with standardized interviews and&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

      Participants From August 1998 to June 2001, 92 consecutive patients were admitted to a&#xD;
      specialized eating disorder unit at a psychiatric hospital, Modum Bad. The admission criteria&#xD;
      were symptoms of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise&#xD;
      specified that impaired daily life functioning, inadequate responses to previous treatment&#xD;
      and age above 18 years. Those with severe medical complications and body mass index (BMI) &lt;&#xD;
      14 were excluded. Patients were allocated to specific inpatient treatment programs for&#xD;
      anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa respectively. Six patients discharged themselves during&#xD;
      the first two weeks. A total of 86 remaining patients, one male and 85 female, initially&#xD;
      entered the study. Participants have been assessed at five points in time, i.e. 1 (Admission,&#xD;
      1998-2001), 2 (Discharge, 1998-2001), 3 (one year after admission, 2001-2002), 4 (two years&#xD;
      after admission, 2002-2003) and time 5 (five years after admission, 2004-2005). A total of 77&#xD;
      patients (90 %) were available for the five-year follow-up. These patients have given written&#xD;
      consent to participate in a 17-year follow-up. Attrition is a common problem in long-term&#xD;
      follow-up investigations, but appears to be less severe in Norway generally and at Modum Bad&#xD;
      in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Study 1: Investigate the course and outcome of eating disorder patients Subordinate aims&#xD;
      included: to a) report on the 17-year course and outcome of adults with longstanding eating&#xD;
      disorder and b) identify eating disorder subgroups with various courses and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Investigate the course of personlaity disorders among eating disorder patients&#xD;
      Subordinate aims included: to a) report the presence of categorical and dimensional&#xD;
      personality disorder in adults with longstanding eating disorder at admission to hospital&#xD;
      treatment and at 1-, 2- 5-year and 17-year follow-up; b) compare the changes of personality&#xD;
      disorder in anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified;&#xD;
      c) investigate if personality disorder is less frequent among recovered patients; d) compare&#xD;
      the magnitude of changes in specific eating disorder symptoms, general psychopathology and&#xD;
      personality disorder; e) investigate whether changes in personality disorder influence&#xD;
      changes in symptom scores, or vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: Identify predictors of poor outcome in longstanding eating disorder Subordinated&#xD;
      aims included: to a) investigate if personality disorder and child sexual abuse predict the&#xD;
      course of severity of eating disorder symptoms, b) examine how child sexual abuse and&#xD;
      personality disorder interact to affect the eating disorder course. Does persoanlity disorder&#xD;
      mediate, does child sexual abuse moderate, or do they independently influence the eating&#xD;
      disorder course?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility: design, method, analysis The present sample is unique in having participating in&#xD;
      a previous prospective longitudinal study of adult patients using structured diagnostic&#xD;
      interviews both for the eating disorder and the personality disorder. The very longterm&#xD;
      course and outcome can be evaluated. There are no other studies where several repeated&#xD;
      structured clinical interviews have been used to assess personality disorders in a sample of&#xD;
      patients with eating disorders. This study may bridge the gap between science and practice in&#xD;
      the assessment and treatment of severe eating disorder patients. As there are no generally&#xD;
      accepted guidelines for treatment of severe eating disorder, the present finding may elicit&#xD;
      efforts to develop such guidelines. The main finding in the previous studies is that a&#xD;
      majority of patients with severe and longstanding eating disorder experience significant&#xD;
      improvement that is fairly stable through years. This knowledge stands in contrast to a&#xD;
      widespread professional opinion that there is little chance of improvement for individuals&#xD;
      with longstanding eating disorder. Bridging the gap between science and clinical practice the&#xD;
      refuting of this opinion by dissemination of research findings stands out as an important&#xD;
      implication as one aspect of being a clinician is to provide a realistic hope to patients and&#xD;
      relatives. However the previous studies do not provide the full knowledge of the full course&#xD;
      of eating disorder. Thus, a further extension of the study is important.&#xD;
