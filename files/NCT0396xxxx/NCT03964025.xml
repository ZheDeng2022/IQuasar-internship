  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, comparative, single-arm, open label, multi- centre,&#xD;
      post-market clinical investigation involving an expected 74 subjects (minimum 40, maximum&#xD;
      118) suffering from paroxysmal AF with the aim to determine the accuracy of &quot;definitive&quot; AF&#xD;
      detection (≥30 seconds) of the Cardioskin™ as compared to a 3-lead Holter recorder in&#xD;
      patients with known paroxysmal AF.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, comparative, single-arm, open label, multi-centre,&#xD;
      post-marketing clinical investigation involving an expected 74 subjects (minimum 40, maximum&#xD;
      118) suffering from paroxysmal AF. The clinical investigation will include a screening visit&#xD;
      to determine subject eligibility, an inclusion visit where (additional) baseline&#xD;
      characteristics will be collected and the subject will receive the investigational device&#xD;
      (Cardioskin™) and comparator device (3-lead Holter recorder) (Visit 1), and 2 additional&#xD;
      study visits. The subject will be wearing both the Cardioskin™ and 3-lead Holter recorder for&#xD;
      a period of 24 hours, after which the subject will continue wearing the Cardioskin™ alone for&#xD;
      an additional period of 13 days. The clinical investigation primarily aims to determine the&#xD;
      accuracy of AF detection (≥30 seconds) of the Cardioskin™ wearable 15 lead ECG monitor as&#xD;
      compared to a 3 lead Holter recorder in patients with known paroxysmal AF. Further objectives&#xD;
      of the clinical investigation include detection of AF for the 13 additional days, detection&#xD;
      of other arrhythmias and patient safety. A 3 lead Holter recorder was selected as the&#xD;
      comparator device, because it is currently the gold standard for 24-hour home-based ECG&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;

    <description>The current standard of care for diagnosing AF is through the use of a 24 hour Holter device. In this study, in addition to wearing the 3-lead Holter recorder for 24 hours, the subject will be wearing the Cardioskin™ for a period of 24 hours as well, after which the subject will continue wearing the Cardioskin™ alone for an additional period of 13 days.</description>
