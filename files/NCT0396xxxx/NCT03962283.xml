      Background: Investigators have previously shown that misoprostol can heal small bowel ulcers&#xD;
      in aspirin users with small bowel bleeding. However, the rate of small-bowel mucosal healing&#xD;
      was low with use of misoprostol alone. There is evidence to suggest that bacteria contribute&#xD;
      to the development aspirin-induced ulcers and antibiotics may be useful in its treatment.&#xD;
      Rifaximin, a non-absorbed oral antibiotic that target the gastrointestinal tract have been&#xD;
      shown to be safe and effective in a few other gastrointestinal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small bowel capsule is the most sensitive and non-invasive way to investigate the small&#xD;
      bowel. It plays an important role in obscure GIB investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The aim of this randomized study is to test the hypothesis that misoprostol combined&#xD;
      with rifaximin is superior to misoprostol alone for healing of small bowel ulcers in aspirin&#xD;
      users complicated by small bowel bleeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide It is widely used as the first&#xD;
      line agent for prevention and treatment of heart diseases and stroke. It is well recognized&#xD;
      that aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with&#xD;
      risk of upper gastrointestinal (the stomach) bleeding. It is increasingly recognized to have&#xD;
      adverse effects in the small bowel, including ulcers resulting in bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding from the small bowel has been very difficult to diagnose as it is beyond the reach&#xD;
      of the conventional endoscopy. But with advances in endoscopic technique, video capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy is now available to visualize the whole of the digestive tract. Capsule endoscopy&#xD;
      is the size and shape of a pill which contains a tiny camera. After ingesting the capsule,&#xD;
      pictures are taken inside of the gastrointestinal tract. Capsule endoscopy is now recommended&#xD;
      to be a noninvasive test to identify source of small bowel bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have recently shown that misoprostol can heal small bowel ulcers in aspirin&#xD;
      users with small bowel bleeding. However, the complete healing rate with misoprostol alone&#xD;
      was only 40%. This suggests that we should continue to investigate for additional therapies&#xD;
      in order to achieve higher success rate of healing of aspirin-induced small bowel ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin is a non-absorbed oral antibiotic that targets the gastrointestinal tract. It was&#xD;
      first described in 1982 and introduced into the Italian market 5 years later. Since then,&#xD;
      rifaximin has had U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treatment of&#xD;
      travellers' diarrhea (year approved = 2004), hepatic encephalopathy (year approved=2010),&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea (year approved= 2015). Unlike the systematically&#xD;
      available antibiotics, it allows localized enteric targeting of pathogens and is associated&#xD;
      with minimal risk of systemic toxicity or side effects. In addition, the restricted use of&#xD;
      non-absorbed oral antibiotics should also reduce the development of wide spread resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the combination therapy of rifaximin and&#xD;
      misoprostol is superior to misoprostol alone for healing of small bowel ulcers in aspirin&#xD;
      users complicated by small bowel bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are invited to this study because some predefined lesions are detected by the&#xD;
      small bowel capsule endoscopy. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a&#xD;
      combination therapy of misoprostol and rifaximin or misoprostol and rifaximin placebo for 8&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will be contacted by telephone after 1 week for any adverse events.&#xD;
      Participants will then return at Week 8 to undergo a follow-up capsule endoscopy. Lab tests,&#xD;
      drug compliance, and adverse events will be assessed.&#xD;
