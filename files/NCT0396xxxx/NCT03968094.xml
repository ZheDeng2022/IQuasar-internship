      Imagine a hospital or ambulatory surgical work environment where clinicians could look at an&#xD;
      electronic respiratory monitoring device and observe the patient's data over time, and be&#xD;
      cued by the monitor before the patient exhibits dangerous opioid induced respiratory&#xD;
      depression/respiratory compromise. Currently, clinicians use electronic monitoring data for&#xD;
      real-time assessment of respiratory status. Alarms set at thresholds alert a clinician when&#xD;
      the patient is currently experiencing respiratory compromise. Adverse events secondary to&#xD;
      opioid induced respiratory compromise (OIRC) continue to occur in 0.5-4.2% of hospitalized&#xD;
      patients receiving opioids for acute pain. Opioids continue to be a staple for acute pain&#xD;
      management. In this environment of litigation around adequate pain management and the use of&#xD;
      opioids, clinicians need a more sensitive and specific way to determine which patients are at&#xD;
      risk of severe respiratory depression when using opioids for acute pain management in the&#xD;
      hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to evaluate algorithms preliminarily developed in the computer&#xD;
      laboratory. This translational research will compare and test replication of our algorithms&#xD;
      in a new sample of patients. Patients' electronic monitor data will be used to further&#xD;
      develop our algorithms for identifying patients who exhibit OIRC and predicting OIRC events.&#xD;
      Explicitly, we will monitor post-operative patients using pulse oximetry, capnography, minute&#xD;
      ventilation, and transcutaneous PCO2 during recovery from anesthesia (in PACU), and on the&#xD;
      general care floor for up to 72 hours. This data, along with covariates collected from the&#xD;
      electronic medical record and environment will be used in machine learning models to develop&#xD;
      our algorithms in an iterative process. Future studies will involve instituting these&#xD;
      algorithms into a monitoring interface and testing in simulation and in real-time on&#xD;
      patients. Please see AHRQ summary sheets from a submission that occurred earlier this year.&#xD;

      Setting: This research project will be performed at an inner-city hospital in Western New&#xD;
      York, Buffalo General Medical Center (BGMC) is typical of an under-resourced facility&#xD;
      providing care to a substantial proportion of the indigent, minority, immigrant and medically&#xD;
      underserved population of a region. In 2017, 36% of BGMC patients identified themselves as&#xD;
      Black or African American. Typical patients face economic, cultural or linguistic barriers to&#xD;
      healthcare. By focusing on OIRC at BGMC, this study will help in informing how health&#xD;
      disparities may impact the incidence of OIRC. At BGMC in 2017, 11,744 surgical procedures&#xD;
      were performed and 2% of general surgical cases experienced an adverse event (code blue).&#xD;
      Information on adverse events related to OIRC is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. After recruiting and performing informed consent pre-operatively, we will monitor&#xD;
      post-operative patients using pulse oximetry, capnography, TCpCO2, and minute ventilation&#xD;
      during recovery from anesthesia (in PACU), and on the general care floor for up to 72 hours.&#xD;
      An observational study of 50 surgical patients will be performed to record electronic&#xD;
      respiratory monitoring data as well as patient characteristics. This information will be used&#xD;
      for validation and iterative development of prediction models using machine learning&#xD;
      techniques. In our preliminary work, we used data that was collected by the research&#xD;
      assistants reading the data off the device display. During the proposal proposed study, we&#xD;
      will record the data from each electronic device directly on USB memory sticks attached to&#xD;
      the device. In our preliminary work, we had data from the PACU stay only. During this study,&#xD;
      we will collect data prospectively throughout the hospital stay to further inform changes in&#xD;
      respiratory compromise as the patient transitions away from the anesthetic and paralytic&#xD;
      agents . On the machine learning side, we will explore long-short term memory networks&#xD;
      (LSTM), which have become the state of art machine learning models to deal with sequence and&#xD;
      time series data (24), including applications in the healthcare domain (25), including recent&#xD;
      work by Co-I Chandola. The justification behind using these models over the support vector&#xD;
      machine model used in our preliminary study is that they are able to explicitly model the&#xD;
      temporal dependencies in the data, which is expected to provide significant improvements in&#xD;
      the predictive performance of the model (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To further understand factors related to OIRC and to assist in responding to the AHRQ&#xD;
      reviewers' comments, we will perform a root cause analysis of all adverse events found in the&#xD;
      patients we recruited for Aim 1, as well as all rapid response calls, naloxone deliveries,&#xD;
      and code blue calls for 2018 at Buffalo General Medical Center (BGMC ). We will examine each&#xD;
      case specifically for nursing assessment and monitoring procedures as well as all patient and&#xD;
      environmental factors that may have contributed to the adverse event. The patient safety&#xD;
      physician and quality assurance nurses from BGMC will be interviewed to perform root cause&#xD;
      analysis of all opioid-related adverse events that have occurred over the past year at the&#xD;
      facility. Each event will be broken down by who was involved, what they were doing, what&#xD;
      technologies were used, where did the event take place, and what outside factors may have&#xD;
      contributed to the event. This information will be used to group the potential causes and the&#xD;
      progression toward the adverse event, which will allow for identification of the roles of&#xD;
      staff workload and patient monitoring on OIRC occurrence. We have received a letter of&#xD;
      support from the medical director of patient safety at BGMC and Kaleida Health chief nursing&#xD;
      office for our intended projects.&#xD;
