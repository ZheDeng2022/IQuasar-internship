  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of blocking IL-6 signaling with&#xD;
      tocilizumab on lipid, glucose and protein metabolism during rest and exercise in healthy and&#xD;
      obese humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 is a molecule produced by a variety of cells and impacts on energy metabolism&#xD;
      during fasting and fed conditions. Systemic IL-6 levels are low but increase acutely in&#xD;
      response to fasting, exercise and infection, and also chronically in response to obesity and&#xD;
      other conditions of lowgrade inflammation.Our recent human intervention study showed that&#xD;
      IL-6 receptor blockade prevents exercise training from reducing visceral fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether IL-6 receptor blockade directly regulates lipolysis and/or lipid oxidation in humans&#xD;
      is however unclear. Therefore, this study will be performed to investigate the physiological&#xD;
      role of IL-6 on lipid, glucose and protein metabolism in humans.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to assess changes in substrate kinetics, that is, lipolytic rate,&#xD;
      rate of appearance and disappearance of free fatty acids, fatty acid oxidation, glucose rate&#xD;
      of appearance and disappearance and protein synthesis and degradation during rest and&#xD;
      exercise with and without IL-6 receptor blockade. We will assess the acute effects of&#xD;
      blocking IL-6 as well as the long-term consequences of IL-6 receptor blockade on all the&#xD;
      above parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, we hypothesize that blocking IL-6 changes substrate kinetics. More specifically we&#xD;
      hypothesize that blocking IL-6 reduces the appearance of free fatty acids, reduces the&#xD;
      lipolytic rate and lipid oxidation. We hypothesize that the consequences of blocking IL-6&#xD;
      will be observed during resting and exercising conditions and both immediately and longterm&#xD;
      after IL-6 receptor blockade. We hypothesize that IL-6 receptor blockade results in an&#xD;
      increased respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and thus increased reliance on glucose as&#xD;
      substrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study 10 healthy males and 10 obese males will be included. Subjects will be infused&#xD;
      with saline on 2 of the study days and tocilizumab on 1 of the study days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotope dilution techniques with [6,6-2H2]Glucose, [1,1,2,3,3-D5]glycerol,&#xD;
      K-[U-13C16]palmitate, L-[ring-D5]phenylalanine, L-[D2]tyrosine will be applied to assess&#xD;
      lipid, glucose and protein kinetics. Respiratory exchange ratio will be measured by indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry. The BORG scale will be used to assess the perceived exertion during exercise.&#xD;
