  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will determine whether using high flow oxygen in&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea patients following a major non cardiac surgery is&#xD;
      more efficacious than usual care in preventing decrease in oxygen level in blood.&#xD;

      The POSA-II trial is a culmination of the investigator's program of research to prevent&#xD;
      postoperative adverse outcomes in surgical patients with untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea&#xD;
      (OSA). It is a multi center open label, randomized clinical trial of nasal high-flow vs.&#xD;
      usual care in patients with untreated moderate-to-severe OSA undergoing major non cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. It is a proof of concept trial to show that nasal high-flow reduces severe&#xD;
      desaturation, the causal mechanism for OSA-related adverse events, and to collect key&#xD;
      feasibility data for a large international multi center trial with enough power to detect&#xD;
      effects on the clinical outcomes. Eligible patients undergoing major non cardiac surgery with&#xD;
      high-risk OSA will have a home sleep study. One hundred and ninety patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe Sleep Apnea will be randomized into either nasal high-flow or usual care&#xD;
      group. Sleep studies, oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), and Troponin will be done&#xD;
      preoperatively. Postoperatively, ECG and Troponin will be determined daily for the 1st three&#xD;
      days, and nocturnal oximetry for the 1st 3 nights. Patients will be followed during their&#xD;
      hospitalization and for 30 days postoperatively to ascertain any adverse outcomes. A blinded&#xD;
      clinical events committee will adjudicate all components of the composite outcome.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will measure Oxygen Desaturation Index(the number of desaturation events per hour) by using Pulsox 300i for maximum of three nights post-operatively at the hospital preventing the severe desaturation in surgical patients with untreated moderate-to-severe OSA undergoing major non cardiac surgery. Higher values of ODI are considered worst. If successful, it will provide feasibility data for the performance of a large randomized clinical trial focusing on clinical outcomes and the cost effectiveness of the therapy to the health care system.</description>

    <measure>Time (minutes) spent below 90% and 80% SpO2 (T90, T80)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the time spent in minutes with SpO2 between 0% to %79 (T80) and the time spent in minutes with SpO2 between 0% to 89% (T90). ODI, T90 and T80 will serve as surrogate outcomes of adverse events in the pilot study. In POSA study, an increase in time spent with SpO2 &lt;80% after surgery was associated with a higher risk of postoperative vascular events under usual care.</description>

    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the tolerability and adherence of patients with OSA to Nasal High-Flow in the wards using a 10-point numeric rating scale to grade general discomfort, in which points 0 to 3 means not comfortable, 4 to 6 means comfortable and 7 to 10 means the most comfortable.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of postoperative cardiovascular events will be collected during hospitalization and following discharge from hospital, emergency department (if visited) and physician records, and patient by phone at day 30. Adjudicators who are blinded to the results of the ECG, Troponin, sleep study and oximetry will evaluate outcome events.</description>

    <description>Nasal High-Flow oxygen delivery will be applied starting at airflow of minimum 20 Litre/minute. It will be titrated in 15Litre/minute increments to 35 Litre/minute and a maximum 50 Litre/minute as determined by patient comfort. O2 supplementation will be managed by the anesthesia and surgical health care team to maintain the oxygen saturation level in the blood between 92-95%. In the Nasal High-Flow group, when SPO2 is in the range of 92-95%, air will be given instead of oxygen for the 1st 3 nights and during the day, if required, till discharge, whichever is earlier.</description>
