    <textblock>
      IRMA is a Prospective, monocenter, non-interventional investigator initiated (IIT) registry&#xD;
      that aims to investigate the use of the CE-marked OncotypeDX and its impact on adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy recommendations in the clinical routine. Additionally, the proportion of patients&#xD;
      with low, intermediate and high RS in predefined clinical subgroups will be determined. To&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of the RS on tumor cell dissemination, these subgroups also include&#xD;
      DTC-negative versus DTC-positive patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Evaluation of the influence of the 21-gene Recurrence-Score (RS) on adjuvant therapy recommendation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Recurrence Score is a continuous score that provides an individual estimate of the 10 year risk of distant recurrence and predicts the likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy. The quantitative nature of PCR allows for a continuous score as opposed to a binary result (low vs. high only). Oncotype DX test results assign a Recurrence Score - a number between 0 and 100 - to the early-stage breast cancer or DCIS.&#xD;
Recurrence Score lower than 18: The cancer has a low risk of recurrence. The benefit of chemotherapy is likely to be small and will not outweigh the risks of side effects.&#xD;
Recurrence Score of 18 up to and including 30: The cancer has an intermediate risk of recurrence. It's unclear whether the benefits of chemotherapy outweigh the risks of side effects.&#xD;
Recurrence Score greater than or equal to 31: The cancer has a high risk of recurrence, and the benefits of chemotherapy are likely to be greater than the risks of side effects.</description>
