    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral&#xD;
      administration of MB-102, and to evaluate the use of MB-102 as a means of measuring gut&#xD;
      permeability in normal participants (n=10) and in those with radiologic evidence of small&#xD;
      bowel Crohn's disease (n=10).&#xD;

      This study is a single center, randomized, open label, cross-over study evaluating MB-102&#xD;
      versus dual sugar testing using lactulose and rhamnose for the assessment of gut&#xD;
      permeability. Participants will be screened within 30 days of Day 1, and eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to receive either an oral dose of MB-102 or the dual sugar&#xD;
      test on Day 1. At a second study visit occurring between 3 to 7 days after completion of the&#xD;
      first test, participants will return to the study center for the second test. Following&#xD;
      completion of the second test, participants will return to the study center 7 ±3 days for a&#xD;
      follow-up visit to evaluate safety.&#xD;

    <description>For MB-102 excretion evaluation, urine samples will be collected pre-dose (time 0), each time the participant voids, and at the protocol-defined time points after oral administration of MB-102. The total volume of urine excreted will be recorded. Urine samples will be analyzed using validated analytical methods. For the dual sugar test, participants will consume a 10 mL solution (1000 mg of lactulose and 200 mg of rhamnose). Urine will be collected pre-dose (time 0), each time the participant voids, and at the protocol-defined time points after consuming the sugar solution. The total volume of urine excreted will be recorded. Urine samples will be analyzed using validated analytical methods.</description>
