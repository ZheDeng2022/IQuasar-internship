  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently very few proven pharmacologic options available for these patients. The&#xD;
      recent discovery of transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels, particularly&#xD;
      TRPV2 channels, in the cardiovascular system is promising as a potential pathway for&#xD;
      pharmacologic intervention for Fontan patients. Probenecid, a drug best known as a treatment&#xD;
      for gout or as a penicillin adjunct, acts as a TRPV2 agonist and has recently become the&#xD;
      subject of study as a model therapy for the treatment of cardiomyopathy due to its positive&#xD;
      inotropic and lusitropic effects. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if&#xD;
      probenecid will improve magnetic resonance (MRI) parameters of systolic and/or diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction as well as associated symptoms in patients with a Fontan circulation. The&#xD;
      investigators will quantitatively assess functional improvement with pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing.&#xD;

    <description>Determine if Fontan patients treated with probenecid for four weeks will experience increased systolic and diastolic function (as measured via standard and advanced MRI parameters) compared with four weeks of placebo. Participants will be assigned to either the placebo arm or study medication arm for the first four weeks. They will then undergo a four week wash out period. Finally, participants will be placed into the study arm that they were not assigned to in the first four weeks when they return for the last four weeks of study participation. There will be four MRI scans over the course of the 12 week study period.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over pilot study of up to 22 patients who have had a prior Fontan operation for single ventricle physiology who are ≥ 10 years old. Each patient completed a total of four study visits over the course of a 4 month period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Each patient came in for a baseline assessment visit. At the end of the baseline visit they received either probenecid or placebo. They took the medication for a month and then returned for the second visit. A washout period occurred for a month and then study patients returned for visit three where they received either probenecid or placebo; whichever was not received during visit one. This medication was taken for a month and then patients returned for the final visit.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Probenecid, and Then Placebo</title>
          <description>All patients will have a baseline assessment immediately preceding initiation of probenecid or placebo. This will include a physical exam to assess any clinical symptoms, review of cardiac symptoms, blood work, pregnancy test for those girls/women of child bearing potential, PEDS QL questionnaire completion, exercise testing and MRI, as described in detail below. Patients will then receive either probenecid or placebo for 28(±7 days) of treatment according to their randomization group, after which the same testing will be repeated. Following 28(±7 days) of washout, patients will undergo the same testing procedures as during the first period of study but with the alternate treatment. To assist in achieving congruence between clinical testing performed and desired pre-intervention testing, we will coordinate with each patient and his/her cardiologist prior to the clinical visit.&#xD;
Patients will receive a one month supply of oral probenecid therapy with the following dosing regimen:&#xD;
For patients (adults and pediatric) ≥ 40 kg: 500 mg by mouth twice daily.&#xD;
For children 10-17 years old and &lt; 40 kg: 250 mg by mouth twice daily&#xD;
During the placebo treatment arm, patients will receive 28(±7 days) of placebo therapy. Oral placebo therapy will be twice daily, with an identical dosing regimen as the placebo.</description>

        <title>Changes in End Diastolic and End Systolic Volume as Measured by Standard and Advanced MRI Parameters</title>
        <description>Determine if Fontan patients treated with probenecid for four weeks will experience increased systolic and diastolic function (as measured via standard and advanced MRI parameters) compared with four weeks of placebo. Participants will be assigned to either the placebo arm or study medication arm for the first four weeks. They will then undergo a four week wash out period. Finally, participants will be placed into the study arm that they were not assigned to in the first four weeks when they return for the last four weeks of study participation. There will be four MRI scans over the course of the 12 week study period.</description>
        <time_frame>Total time participation in the study will be twelve weeks. Four weeks on the placebo or study medication, four weeks of a washout period and another four weeks with the study medication or placebo.</time_frame>
