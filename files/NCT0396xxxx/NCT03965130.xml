  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that alterations in the portal vein insulin:glucagon ratio play a&#xD;
      major role in the dysregulated hepatic glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes but the&#xD;
      molecular mechanism by which glucagon promotes alterations in hepatic glucose production and&#xD;
      mitochondrial oxidation remain poorly understood. This is borne out of the fact that both&#xD;
      glucagon agonists and antagonists are being developed to treat type 2 diabetes with unclear&#xD;
      mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will directly assess the effects of glucagon on rates of mitochondrial oxidation&#xD;
      and pyruvate carboxylase flux for the first time in humans using PINTA analysis. The results&#xD;
      will have important implications for the possibility of intervening in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      non alcoholic fatty liver and type 2 diabetes via chronic dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor&#xD;
      antagonism and provide an important rationale for why a dual agonist may be more efficacious&#xD;
      for treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver and T2D than GLP-1 alone.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effects of glucagon on hepatic glucose and fat metabolism in vivo, this study&#xD;
      will apply a novel Positional Isotopomer NMR Tracer Analysis (PINTA) method to quantify rates&#xD;
      of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and pyruvate carboxylase flux, which has been&#xD;
      cross-validated in awake rodents and humans (Perry et al. Nature Communications 2017).&#xD;
      Preliminary rodent studies have found that glucagon stimulates intrahepatic lipolysis through&#xD;
      an InsP3R-I-dependent process, leading to increases in hepatic acetyl-CoA content, which&#xD;
      allosterically activates pyruvate carboxylase activity and flux, and that this phenomenon&#xD;
      explains its acute, transcription-independent effect to acutely stimulate hepatic&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis in vivo (unpublished results). In addition, using PINTA analysis it has been&#xD;
      shown that glucagon stimulates hepatic mitochondrial oxidation through calcium signaling in&#xD;
      awake mice, and that this process can be exploited by short-term continuous glucagon&#xD;
      treatment leading to two-fold increases in hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation, which in turn&#xD;
      results in large reductions in hepatic steatosis and marked improvements in glucose tolerance&#xD;
      through reversal of hepatic insulin resistance in a high fat fed rat model of non alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A physiological increase in plasma glucagon concentrations will promote a significant&#xD;
           increase in rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A physiological increase in plasma glucagon concentrations will promote a significant&#xD;
           increase in rates of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A physiological increase in plasma glucagon concentrations will promote a significant&#xD;
           increase in rates of 13C4 β-hydroxybutyrate turnover (hepatic ketogenesis) in healthy&#xD;
           humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design - Clinical Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of a physiological increase in plasma glucagon on rates of hepatic mitochondrial&#xD;
      oxidation and pyruvate carboxylase flux will be examined in 12 healthy participants (ages&#xD;
      21-65) using Positional Isotopomer NMR Tracer Analysis (PINTA) (Perry et al. Nature&#xD;
      Communication 2017). Briefly rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and hepatic pyruvate&#xD;
      carboxylase flux will be assessed in 12 healthy overnight fasted participants by PINTA after&#xD;
      a three-hour infusion of glucagon or saline. The glucagon infusion will be designed to&#xD;
      increase peripheral and portal vein plasma glucagon concentrations 3-4 fold. The effects of a&#xD;
      physiological increase in plasma glucagon on rates of hepatic ketogenesis will also be&#xD;
      assessed using an infusion of 13C4 β-betahydroxybutyrate (Perry et al. Cell Metabolism 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux /citrate synthase flux by PINTA: Participants&#xD;
      (n=12) will be studied by PINTA under 2 conditions: 1) following an overnight fast and a 3&#xD;
      hour saline infusion (Control), 2) following an overnight fast and a 3 hour glucagon&#xD;
      infusion. Briefly, after collection of baseline blood samples a 3 hour infusion of tracers as&#xD;
      described below will be started. Relative rates of pyruvate carboxylase to citrate synthesis&#xD;
      flux will be assessed using a constant infusion of [3-13C] lactate and rates of glucose&#xD;
      production will be measured using an infusion of [2H7]glucose (Perry et al. Nature&#xD;
      Communication 2017). Rates of hepatic ketogenesis will be measured using a constant infusion&#xD;
      of [3C β-hydroxybutyrate as previously described (Perry et al. Cell Metabolism 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body energy expenditure and the respiratory quotient will be assessed by indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry.&#xD;
