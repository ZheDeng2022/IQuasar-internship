    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional pilot trial for patients with advanced breast cancer. The trial&#xD;
      is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of induction talazoparib followed by&#xD;
      combination of talazoparib and avelumab. As an exploratory endpoint, the study team will&#xD;
      evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of induction talazoparib followed by the combination of&#xD;
      talazoparib and avelumab in patients with advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

             study or interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study&#xD;
