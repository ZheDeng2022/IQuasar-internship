    <textblock>
      To verify the role of nab-paclitaxel in neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, the investigators designed a prospective, randomized, controlled , multicente&#xD;
      phase II trial, to investigate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel combined with&#xD;
      cisplatin as neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone for esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
