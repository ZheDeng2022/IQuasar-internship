  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site, randomized, double-masked, 2×2 crossover design, 1-week&#xD;
      dispensing study. Subjects will wear both Test and Control lenses in each eye in a random&#xD;
      order for 1-week each as a daily disposable modality with a wash-out period of 1 week between&#xD;
      the wearing periods.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Comfort Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort score was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (standard deviation [SD] 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for the population of soft disposable contact lens wearers.</description>

    <description>Overall quality of vision was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire.

Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response.

    <measure>LogMAR Visual Performance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity measured via Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts (logMAR) can take on any possible value. A value of 0.0 logMAR equates to 20/20 vision on a Snellen Scale. Lower values indicate better visual performance. The average visual performance is reported for each lens type on high contrast dim light and low contrast bright light.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Daily Wear Time</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Average daily wear time was calculated as the number of hours between participants reported time of insertion and time of removal of the study lenses, on an average day, at 1-Week follow-up evaluation.</description>

        <title>Overall Comfort Score</title>
        <description>Overall comfort score was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (standard deviation [SD] 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for the population of soft disposable contact lens wearers.</description>
