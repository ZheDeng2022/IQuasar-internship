    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well glucarpidase works in reducing toxicity in patients&#xD;
      with osteosarcoma receiving high dose methotrexate treatment. Glucarpidase may reduce the&#xD;
      levels of methotrexate in patients' blood and lead to shorter hospitalizations and a&#xD;
      reduction in toxicities.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of completion of 4 planned high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) doses when&#xD;
      glucarpidase is administered after each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the length of hospital stay (LOS) associated with methotrexate (MTX) clearance&#xD;
      following administration of glucarpidase 24 hours after HDMTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the LOS associated with all causes following administration of glucarpidase 24&#xD;
      hours after HDMTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the impact of glucarpidase administration on HDMTX efficacy. IV. To assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of 4 doses of HDMTX administered with glucarpidase in an adult&#xD;
      osteosarcoma population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the efficacy of glucarpidase flat dose of 1,000 units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive standard of care HDMTX intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on day 1 of weeks 4,&#xD;
      5, 9, and 10. After 24 and 48 hours after the start of each HDMTX infusion, patients also&#xD;
      receive glucarpidase IV over 5 minutes in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 32 weeks.&#xD;
