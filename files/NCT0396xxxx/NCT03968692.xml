      Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of the determination of PSA&#xD;
      for the early detection of prostate cancer or in the presence of symptoms, in general&#xD;
      practice in two health departments of the Valencian Community (Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the PSA determinations that are performed in clinical practice, with the&#xD;
           exception of patients with prostate cancer or who are being followed for previous high&#xD;
           PSA values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the adequacy of PSA requests according to the available recommendations,&#xD;
           considering sociodemographic and clinical aspects of the patient, such as the time&#xD;
           interval since the last PSA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will randomly select patients from the Health Departments 17 and 19, in the&#xD;
      Valencian Community (Spain) with a PSA request from Primary health centres.&#xD;

      Sample size and recruitment procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last semester of 2016, 9,963 PSA determinations were carried out at Sant Joan&#xD;
      d'Alacant Hospital and a similar number at Alicante General Hospital. Primary health centres&#xD;
      requested most determinations. The prevalence of prostate cancer in 2012 was 527.3/100,000&#xD;
      men in Spain. Considering that there are about 120,000 men in each of the included&#xD;
      Departments of Health, approximately 630 men will have the diagnosis of prostate cancer in&#xD;
      each of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the established recommendations, a patient with prostate cancer had a PSA&#xD;
      determination every 3-6 months. Consequently, 1,260 determinations per centre would&#xD;
      correspond to prostate cancer patients each 6 months. Therefore, the investigators would have&#xD;
      in each department approximately 8,740 determinations of patients without prostate cancer,&#xD;
      and therefore, possible candidates to enter in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a pilot study with 360 patients in which 35.6% of the requested PSA&#xD;
      determinations do not follow the available recommendations with a 95% margin of error and 2%&#xD;
      accuracy, the investigators will include a total of 1,410 determinations from the two&#xD;
      centres. Hence, for the determination of specific objective 1, the investigators will select&#xD;
      a random sample of 705 patients with a PSA determination in each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each clinical analysis laboratory, the investigators will randomly select 300 primary&#xD;
      care analyses with PSA determination for each month from January to April 2018. The&#xD;
      investigators will select the patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria consecutively from&#xD;
      this list until 180 are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect the following variables from the medical records for each&#xD;
      patient: Demographic characteristics, setting (primary care or clinical service), PSA tests&#xD;
      carried out in the last 12 months and PSA value, anthropometric measures and other&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze the appropriateness of PSA determinations according to the&#xD;
      criteria established by the clinical practice guidelines of the EAU, and the May 2018 update&#xD;
      of the USPSTF. All the reviewers are trained in the use of these guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study of a sample of 30 determinations will be independently evaluated by the nine&#xD;
      researchers the application of the determined criteria. If the agreement is high, the rest of&#xD;
      the determinations will be evaluated separately by at least two researchers using a&#xD;
      predesigned google form. In case of disagreement between two of the evaluators, the case will&#xD;
      review by a third, or discussed in a joint meeting with the rest of the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be performed using the Stata IC 15 program. The investigators will estimate&#xD;
      the frequency and 95% confidence interval of the adequacy of PSA determinations to&#xD;
      established recommendations. The investigators will evaluate the inter-observer agreement in&#xD;
      the determination of adequacy using the Kappa index. In order to assess the relationship with&#xD;
      potential explanatory variables, and the magnitude of the association, the investigators will&#xD;
      calculate prevalence ratios. If necessary, a log-binomial regression will be performed to get&#xD;
      an adjusted analysis.&#xD;

    <description>We define appropriateness of the PSA determination as follows:&#xD;
Presence of symptoms suggestive of prostate pathology (difficulty starting to urinate; weak or interrupted urine flow; frequent urination, especially at night; difficulty emptying the bladder completely; pain or burning when urinating; blood in the urine or semen; persistent pain in the back, hips, or pelvis; pain when ejaculating, and erectile dysfunction);&#xD;
Patients in opportunistic screening defined by satisfaction of the criteria of at least one of the two guidelines:&#xD;
Age 55-69 years (USPSTF) or older than 50 years and a life expectancy of at least 10 years, provided that have not had a PSA determination in the last 24 months (EAU).&#xD;
Patients under 55 years of age (USPSTF) or patients from 45 to 50 years old with a family history of first degree and/or African American race, provided that have not had a PSA determination in the last 24 months (EAU).</description>
