  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide that is a chronic public health&#xD;
      problem. Unfortunately, glaucoma can be diagnosed when the disease reaches a certain level in&#xD;
      today's conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic methods that can&#xD;
      diagnose glaucoma before it reaches the advanced level and to identify pathophysiological&#xD;
      processes. In this study, choroidal thickness was investigated in primary open-angle glaucoma&#xD;
      cases and its correlations with OCT and multifocal ERG parameters were evaluated.&#xD;

      In this study, patients with primary open-angle glaucoma who have recently received a new&#xD;
      diagnosis with healthy volunteers with age-matched groups were enrolled. All data from 49&#xD;
      glaucoma patients and 47 healthy volunteers were recorded and the study was completed. The&#xD;
      study was carried out at the Afyon Kocatepe University Ophthalmology Department between&#xD;
      January 2014 and April 2015. Routine ophthalmologic examinations of all participants were&#xD;
      performed. Medical treatment was initiated on patients diagnosed with primary open-angle&#xD;
      glaucoma. Intraocular pressures and visual acuities of all participants were recorded at&#xD;
      baseline, at 1-month, at 3-month, and at 6-month. All participants underwent tests of&#xD;
      multifocal electroretinography and the measurements of optic nerve head optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography parameters and the choroidal thickness, at the same follow-ups. Visual acuities&#xD;
      were measured by using the Snellen chart as the best corrected visual acuity. Intraocular&#xD;
      pressures were measured by using applanation tonometry. Choroid thicknesses were also&#xD;
      measured and recorded using EDI-OCT mode of optical coherence tomography device (Cirrus HD&#xD;
      4000, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Germany). Choroidal thicknesses were measured in three regions:&#xD;
      fovea, 3mm nasal and temporal distances of the fovea. The mean of these three measurements&#xD;
      was recorded as macular choroidal thickness. The same technician performed all multifocal&#xD;
      electroretinography tests of the participants (Metrovision Monpack 3, Metrovision, France).&#xD;
      Multifocal electroretinography tests were carried out from a distance of 33 cm using ERG-jet&#xD;
      electrode, ground electrode, and a reference electrode. Electrical potential responses from&#xD;
      103 retina regions were recorded. Results were compared statistically and correlations were&#xD;
      analyzed (SPSS 20.0, SPSS Inc. IL, USA).&#xD;
