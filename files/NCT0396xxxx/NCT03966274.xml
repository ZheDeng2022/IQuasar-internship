  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Delirium is associated with prolonged hospitalization, an increased risk of&#xD;
      dementia, institutionalization and mortality, as well as increased costs. Early detection of&#xD;
      delirium would allow for early treatment and improved patient outcomes, but delirium is often&#xD;
      not recognized and treatment is therefore delayed or not applied at all. Additionally,&#xD;
      current screening tools are subjective, so an alternative, more objective diagnostic tool for&#xD;
      early delirium detection is desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the diagnostic performance of the DeltaScan, a CE-certified device&#xD;
      to detect delirium using a brief electroencephalography (EEG) recording. A single EEG&#xD;
      recording will be obtained from patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and&#xD;
      elderly patient admitted to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Cross-sectional, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients admitted to an ICU, and elderly at the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: (1) Delirium as assessed by an adjudication committee of&#xD;
      three delirium experts, based on cognitive information that is collected by one experienced&#xD;
      investigator in line with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th&#xD;
      edition, (DSM-5) criteria (2) Delirium Probability as determined by DeltaScan, (3) the&#xD;
      proportion of successful DeltaScan measurements, and (4) the repeatability of the DeltaScan&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The burden to participants of this study is minimal. EEG recording using the&#xD;
      CE-certified DeltaScan will be made using a strip with EEG electrodes that will be mounted to&#xD;
      the head using self-adhesive gel. The patient will be visited by an experienced investigator,&#xD;
      who collects information in accordance with DSM-5 criteria for delirium. This assessment will&#xD;
      be performed once and takes about 10 minutes. Afterwards, the EEG recording will be performed&#xD;
      once and takes a maximum of 4 minutes, and all procedures combined will take a maximum of 6-7&#xD;
      minutes. Both the EEG recording and the assessment are an add-on to routine care and will be&#xD;
      performed within 30 minutes of each other.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The positive and negative predictive value of DeltaScan</measure>
    <time_frame>The predictive value of DeltaScan is assessed through study completion. Each patient is assessed only once, at a random time between admission and discharge to the ICU/nursing ward, for a maximum of 1 day.</time_frame>
    <description>Using positive and negative predictive values, the diagnostic performance of the DeltaScan will be assessed separately in patients admitted to an ICU, and elderly patients admitted to the ward.&#xD;
A specific focus will be on a high negative predictive value (NPV) because it is important not to miss delirium. A lower positive predictive value (PPV) is acceptable, as the subsequent step in the management of patients with a positive Delta scan will be further diagnostic testing, which is clinically considered to have a lower risk compared to missed delirium.</description>

    <description>The variability of DeltaScan's Delirium Probability Score (on a scale from 1 (low probability of delirium) to 5 (high probability of delirium)) in patients scored as delirious, non-delirious and indeterminate across three measurements performed within a short time frame of 30 minutes. This will be done in a subsample of 30 delirious patients and 30 non-delirious patients.</description>
