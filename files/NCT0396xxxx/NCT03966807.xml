  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine, in an innovative setting, the potential for a&#xD;
      lung cancer diagnosis in a loved one to represent a teachable moment for smoking cessation in&#xD;
      family members or caregivers who are current smokers. The researchers will identify the&#xD;
      willingness and preferred modality for smoking cessation among family members/caregivers in&#xD;
      this setting. The researchers will estimate abstinence rates at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks..&#xD;

        Patients with newly diagnosed lung cancers will be identified from the daily patient lists&#xD;
        at the thoracic oncology clinics at IUSCC, Roudebush VAMC, and Eskenazi. The study&#xD;
        coordinator will screen for newly diagnosed lung cancer patients to identify potential&#xD;
        family member/caregiver study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be approached and asked whether they have any family members/caregivers who&#xD;
        smoke, and if they would be willing to allow the study team to contact those people (or&#xD;
        person) with information about the study. For patients who agree and have family&#xD;
        members/caregivers present at the clinic visit that day, the study coordinator (or other&#xD;
        designated member of the study team) will discuss the purpose of the study and utilize the&#xD;
        5A strategy (Ask, Advice, Assess willingness to quit, Assist, Arrange follow-up) to&#xD;
        ascertain interest in participation.&#xD;
