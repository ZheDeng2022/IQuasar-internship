  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, phase II trial of cabozantinib in subjects&#xD;
      with untreated, high risk prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. This multicenter&#xD;
      study will enroll 30 subjects. Duke is the lead site for this trial. There will be a second&#xD;
      site selected TBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned (first 9 subjects only) or randomized 2:1 to either: (1)&#xD;
      cabozantinib 40 mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks, followed by a 2 week drug washout period&#xD;
      before prostatectomy (n = 20), or (2) immediate prostatectomy within 12 weeks of registration&#xD;
      (n = 10). The first 9 subjects (6 subjects assigned to cabozantinib treatment, 3 subjects&#xD;
      assigned to immediate prostatectomy) will constitute the Safety Lead-In Cohort, which will be&#xD;
      only accrued at Duke. After six subjects have received cabozantinib and completed the 57-85&#xD;
      day safety visit without triggering a stopping rule, subjects may be accrued at the ex-Duke&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal is to compare pathologic apoptotic indices (cleaved caspase-3) in&#xD;
      prostatectomy specimens from patients who undergo immediate prostatectomy (controls) versus&#xD;
      those who receive with cabozantinib followed by prostatectomy. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      conduct immune phenotypic profiling on the peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment in&#xD;
      prostatectomy specimens from both groups. A statistical analysis will be used to compare the&#xD;
      apoptotic indices between the two groups.&#xD;

             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
