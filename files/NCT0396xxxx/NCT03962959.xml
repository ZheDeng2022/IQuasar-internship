  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this study is to develop non-invasive, painless repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols to prevent cognitive decline in patients with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal individuals at high risk of developing&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, 1 in 9 adults over the age of 65 have AD, which&#xD;
      currently totals more than 5 million Americans and this number is expected to rise as high as&#xD;
      16 million by 2050.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCI is a clinical syndrome that represents the gray area between healthy aging and dementia.&#xD;
      Those with amnestic MCI (aMCI) have memory problems more severe than normal for their age and&#xD;
      education, but their symptoms are not as severe as those of people with AD. Patients with&#xD;
      aMCI are at high risk for AD. Notably, roughly half of those with MCI will continue to&#xD;
      progress and convert to clinical dementia within 3 years. Alternatively, it is also&#xD;
      worthwhile to study cognitively healthy older adults who carry genes that may increase the&#xD;
      risk of AD. The frequency of the human APOE gene ε4 allele increases in patients with AD and&#xD;
      the ε4 allele is also associated with an earlier age of disease onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no known therapies that can effectively modify the progression and&#xD;
      hallmark symptoms of AD. Therefore, it is crucial to provide an early intervention in&#xD;
      patients with aMCI to delay or prevent the progression to AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, this project has two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To plan personalized non-invasive brain stimulation location by brain Imaging with&#xD;
           Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy older&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify potential personalized cognitive enhancement strategy (such as dosage or&#xD;
           patterns) of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in MCI and healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Techniques to artificially and precisely stimulate brain tissue are increasingly recognized&#xD;
      as valuable tools both in clinical practice and in cognitive neuroscience studies among&#xD;
      healthy individuals and people with clinical conditions. With these practices, researchers&#xD;
      can safely stimulate specific regions of the brain to explore causal relationships that&#xD;
      comprise the brain's circuitry and modulate behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total, 60 participants (50-80 years old) will be recruited to participate in this trial.&#xD;
      These 60 participants will be grouped into two distinct cohorts, with 30 participants in 2&#xD;
      groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cognitively normal adults (CN group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      You would be asked to receive 30 intervention sessions for three different protocols (10&#xD;
      sessions for each). Before and after the interventions, MRI and Cognitive tasks will be&#xD;
      utilized again as the outcome measurements. There is an one-month interval between each&#xD;
      protocol. Each intervention will be around half hour to an hour and each outcome measurement&#xD;
      will take another two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each block includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI+ Memory pre-assessment (2 hours/session)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS * 10 (10 sessions; 0.5 hours/session)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI+ Memory post-assessment (2 hours/session) You will experience each of the three TMS&#xD;
           protocols. The total time commitment across these sessions will be 27 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be another 2 testing sessions to evaluate intervention effects. They will be&#xD;
      scheduled at the beginning, and 1 month after the end of the intervention sessions. You don't&#xD;
      need to come to the laboratory during the weekends. All sessions are located in the&#xD;
      Biosciences Research Laboratories (BSLR) Building (1230 N. Cherry Ave., Tucson, AZ 85721).&#xD;
      The schematic below outlines the components of the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will acquire the following data during components for primary outcome&#xD;
      measures and secondary measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Brain imaging data 2) Neuropsychological data and demographic data 3) Cognitive tasks 4)&#xD;
      Biological sample&#xD;
