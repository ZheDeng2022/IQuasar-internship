  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A team of researchers at Rice University and Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) are&#xD;
      working to develop a low-cost infant incubator called &quot;IncuBaby&quot; that consists of two&#xD;
      components: a temperature sensor that can continuously monitor an infant's temperature, and a&#xD;
      heated, enclosed area that can adjust internal temperature based on the feedback from the&#xD;
      temperature sensor. This robust, low-cost device will allow for the individualized treatment&#xD;
      of hypothermia with minimal intervention from the clinical staff. In this study, researchers&#xD;
      intend to evaluate the efficacy of this incubator at QECH by comparing infants' temperatures&#xD;
      before and after treatment, and calculating the proportion of time that the infants remain in&#xD;
      a normothermic range after rewarming. During phase I of this study, the infants will be&#xD;
      continuously monitored using the IncuBaby temperature sensor and a gold standard temperature&#xD;
      monitor for up to 3 days. The accuracy of the IncuBaby temperature sensor will be determined&#xD;
      by calculating the difference between the temperatures recorded by the temperature sensor and&#xD;
      the commercial patient monitor at each point in time. During phase II of the study, infants&#xD;
      in need of thermal care with an incubator will be treated with an IncuBaby device and their&#xD;
      temperatures will be continuously monitored by both the temperature sensor of the IncuBaby&#xD;
      device and a commercially available patient monitor. Care will continue at the clinician's&#xD;
      discretion until the infant can be weaned from the incubator or until patients are withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study and placed on the standard of care. To determine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      IncuBaby device at warming infants, the temperatures of the infants will be compared before&#xD;
      and after treatment for each subject. The proportion of time the device maintains the&#xD;
      subject's temperature in a normal range will also be calculated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-phase, pilot prospective study to determine the effectiveness of a low-cost&#xD;
      incubator in warming infants and regulating their temperatures. The temperature sensor that&#xD;
      controls the heat of the incubator based on the infant's temperature has been previously&#xD;
      evaluated in Rice IRB approved studies in Houston, TX with plans to evaluate at QECH. The&#xD;
      first phase will validate the use of the temperature sensor in infants by comparing it to a&#xD;
      commercial temperature monitor. The second phase will test the effectiveness of the IncuBaby&#xD;
      device using that temperature sensor to regulate the heat of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and Monitoring of Neonates&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase I, the following steps will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained study nurse will assess the subject for clinical complications before attaching the&#xD;
      temperature monitoring device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained study nurse or clinician will attach the temperature monitoring device to the&#xD;
      infant. A trained research assistant from Rice University or from the Biomedical Engineering&#xD;
      Department at Malawi Polytechnic will observe all procedures and will notify the nurse of any&#xD;
      observed errors so they may be corrected. They will also be able to answer any technical&#xD;
      questions from the nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trained study nurse will attach the temperature probe from the commercial patient monitor&#xD;
      as well as provide any other care needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research assistant will use a laptop to collect the electrical signals from both&#xD;
      temperature monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature monitoring will continue for up to 3 days. The research assistant may ask the&#xD;
      nurse to remove and reapply the temperature monitor during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon removal of the abdominal strap at the end of the study, the subject may be monitored for&#xD;
      up to one hour in order to assess the effect of the abdominal strap on the skin of the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once Phase I is complete, Phase II will begin. During Phase II, the following steps will be&#xD;
      taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained study nurse will assess the subject for clinical complications before beginning&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained study nurse or research technician will turn the incubator on to begin pre-warming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained study nurse or clinician will attach the temperature probe from the IncuBaby device&#xD;
      to the infant and then place the infant in the incubator. A trained research assistant from&#xD;
      Rice University or from the Biomedical Engineering Department at Malawi Polytechnic will&#xD;
      observe all procedures and will notify the nurse of any observed errors so they may be&#xD;
      corrected. They will also be able to answer any technical questions from the nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trained study nurse will attach the temperature probe from the commercial patient monitor&#xD;
      as well as provide any other care needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research assistant will use a laptop to collect the data from both devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care will be continued at the discretion of the clinician until the infant can be weaned from&#xD;
      the IncuBaby device. The infant may be weaned to the standard of care or end thermal&#xD;
      treatment. The infant will be transitioned to KMC as soon as possible after these eligibility&#xD;
      criteria are fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completed other treatment (CPAP, phototherpay, IV) Mom/caregiver becomes available Weight&#xD;
      increases &gt; 1000 g Becomes clinically stable Body temperture is stable and not dipping below&#xD;
      normal despite thermal support&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the discretion of the clinician, the subject may be weaned to KMC or an open cot.&#xD;
      The IncuBaby device has a &quot;weaning&quot; setting that turns off the heaters in the incubator but&#xD;
      continues to monitor the infant's temperature. If the infant is found to be hypothermic after&#xD;
      ending treatment and the clinician recommends continued incubator care, the subject may&#xD;
      recommence use of the IncuBaby for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The commercial patient monitor will alert nursing staff if the baby's temperature becomes too&#xD;
      high or too low. Temperature settings for alarms will be set by a clinician so that the high&#xD;
      temperature alarm is &gt; 37.5 C, and the low temperature alarm is &lt; 36.5 C. During Phase II,&#xD;
      the following steps will be recommended if the commercial patient monitor sounds a high or&#xD;
      low temperature alarm. These guidelines were written in accordance with current clinical&#xD;
      practice at QECH. The study nurse can also choose to discontinue the use of the IncuBaby&#xD;
      device at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High temperature alarm - indicates possible hyperthermia Check that the incubator temperature&#xD;
      is at 36C or less. Open the incubator and recheck the baby's temperature If baby's&#xD;
      temperature is still above normal remove blankets/clothing If baby is febrile despite these&#xD;
      measures look for a clinical reason for the temperature Remove the infant from the IncuBaby&#xD;
      device Low temperature alarm - indicates possible hypothermia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Check that the incubator is in on and functioning Check that the temperature probe has not&#xD;
      fallen off. Recheck the baby's temperature If temperature still low add blankets/clothing and&#xD;
      hat If the temperature is still low look for a clinical reason for the hypothermia&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both phases, a research assistant will be available during the trial to mitigate any&#xD;
      complications with the device. A nurse will be available to respond to alarms from the&#xD;
      continuous patient monitor. If the subject's guardian, the nurse, or the research assistant&#xD;
      indicates concern during the tests, the study treatment can be discontinued and the subject&#xD;
      will return to the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected on paper forms as is consistent with current clinical&#xD;
      practice. Data will be saved on a secure study server for analysis. Clinical and/or research&#xD;
      personnel will record information, excluding personal identifiers, on a standardized patient&#xD;
      monitoring form. After the subject's participation is complete, a research assistant will&#xD;
