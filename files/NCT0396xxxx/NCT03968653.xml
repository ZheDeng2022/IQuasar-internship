    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      Debio 0123 in combination with carboplatin in participants with advanced solid tumors that&#xD;
      recurred or progressed after prior platinum based therapy and for which no standard therapy&#xD;
      of proven benefit is available.&#xD;
