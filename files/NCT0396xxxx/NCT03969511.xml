  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Acute large-vessel strokes, requiring endovascular treatment, are currently being&#xD;
      managed through radiology department before being transferred to the angiography room.&#xD;
      However, patients with severe neurological deficit have demonstrated even greater benefits&#xD;
      from recanalization as the symptom onset-to-reperfusion time is shortened to less than 1&#xD;
      hour. Recent pilot study have shown a benefit in reducing management delays with direct&#xD;
      admission to the angiography room and subsequently in increasing functional independence at 3&#xD;
      months. Therefore, the aim is to demonstrate the superiority of the direct angio-suite&#xD;
      transfer versus the standard management, in terms of 3-month functional independence, in&#xD;
      patients strongly suspected of having a severe ischemic stroke related to acute large-vessel&#xD;
      occlusion of the anterior circulation, and treated by mechanical thrombectomy ± intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Design: The DIRECT ANGIO trial is a (PROBE) randomized, multicenter, controlled,&#xD;
      open-label, blinded endpoint clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes: The primary outcome is the rate of patients with 3-month functional&#xD;
      independence defined as modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at 3 months.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The DIRECT ANGIO trial is a French academic, investigator-initiated, multicenter,&#xD;
      controlled, open-label, blinded endpoint, two-arm randomized, clinical trial to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of direct angio-suite admission versus the standard radiological or&#xD;
      emergency departement-based management in ≤75 year-old patients with suspected proximal&#xD;
      arterial occlusion lesion. As of March 2020, 9 comprehensive stroke centres (Besançon,&#xD;
      Bordeaux, Colmar, Limoges, Montpellier, Nancy, Reims, Foch Hospital, Rothschild foundation)&#xD;
      have agreed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population: As of the phone call from the emergency rescue service, the&#xD;
      neurologist/the emergency medical doctor will check inclusion and exclusion criteria and then&#xD;
      randomize the patient during the travel to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: All consecutive patients with the following features are enrolled, under&#xD;
      the condition of immediate availability of the angio-suite and the medical team:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aged 18 to ≤75 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  strongly suspected of having an acute and severe neurological deficit related to acute&#xD;
           large-vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation (hemiparesis or hemiplegia with at&#xD;
           least one sign of cortical damage : aphasia, hemianopsia, hemi-neglect, deviation of the&#xD;
           head and eyes),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  who can be admitted to hospital within an anticipated 5 hours after symptom onset,&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the French laws, oral informed consent will be sought via telephone&#xD;
      conversations from patient if their level of consciousness is sufficient or from their&#xD;
      relatives. Written informed consent will be then given at hospital. In case of inability to&#xD;
      consent and absence of the relatives, informed consent to follow will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After inclusion and before hospital arrival, i.e. during the transfer to the&#xD;
      hospital, patients are randomized in the two treatment arms using a web-based centralized&#xD;
      system with a 1:1 ratio to either direct angio-suite management or standard management. To&#xD;
      deal with open-label, 3-month functional outcome is gathered with blinding to randomization&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Arm: Upon arrival in angio-suite and after neurological examination with scoring&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and&#xD;
      performing blood sampling, electrocardiogram and weight estimation, patient undergoes&#xD;
      rotational Cone Beam CT (CBCT) in order to confirm ischemic stroke and CBCT-angiography in&#xD;
      order to confirm proximal arterial occlusion lesion. Mechanical thrombectomy is then&#xD;
      performed as well as intravenous thrombolysis when contraindications are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that in the absence of proximal or distal intracranial arterial occlusion,&#xD;
      the patient will be redirected to standard management as in the control arm. They will thus&#xD;
      benefit from cerebral MRI/CT-scan and the treatment strategy will then be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm: Arrival is in the MRI/CT-scan room or in the emergency department. Directly&#xD;
      after neurological examination and blood sample, patient undergoes imaging. If required,&#xD;
      patient undergoes intravenous thrombolysis directly in the MRI/CT-scan room or after transfer&#xD;
      in the stroke unit or in the emergency service, according to the practices of the centres&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second step, the patient is admitted in the angio-suite if mechanical thrombectomy&#xD;
      indicated. The transfer to angio-suite will be carried out as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients data will be recorded in an electronic case report form (e-CRF) and imagings&#xD;
      will be recorded in a centralized database, located in the Clinical Investigation&#xD;
      Centre-Technological Innovation of Nancy, in order to a centralized radiological reading by&#xD;
      the Imaging Core Lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation is conducted early, as soon as the first telephone contact with the&#xD;
      emergency rescue service or the fire brigade, by the neurologist at the participating centre&#xD;
      who confirms that the patients meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment includes then demographics and collection of routine clinical information&#xD;
      (comorbidities, symptoms, vital constants), allergy contraindications. Neurological deficit&#xD;
      will be assessed using the NIHSS score and pre-stroke disability with mRS by a neurologist at&#xD;
      hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months (±15 days) and 12 months (±1 month), the mRS score will be centralized gathered&#xD;
      by a trained clinical research nurse blinded to randomization group via a telephone&#xD;
      conversation. The 12-month outcome assessment comprises medical ongoing treatment, vital&#xD;
      status, serious adverse effect and EQ-5D questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care workflow time will record all the delays between each strategy time (onset-to-admission&#xD;
      in angio-suite/radiology department time; onset-to-intravenous thrombolysis, onset-to-groin&#xD;
      puncture, onset-to-reperfusion times).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging protocol Baseline imaging characteristics in the standard management group is either&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging with 3D-Time of Flight (TOF) sequence or CT-scan with intracranial&#xD;
      angiography and CT-perfusion sequence. In the angio-suite group, rotational CBCT and&#xD;
      CBCT-angiography will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging protocol in angio-suite will be harmonized between the centres and the quality of&#xD;
      the images evaluated before the study is implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, if mechanical thrombectomy is indicated, angiographic perfusion will be assessed&#xD;
      with the modified Treatment In Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) score on initial and final&#xD;
      angiograms and collateral status with the Grading Collateral System (GCS) score on initial&#xD;
      angiogram, in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes The primary outcome is the rate of patients with 3-month functional&#xD;
      independence defined as modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at 3 months (±15 days), irrespective&#xD;
      of the pathology that actually led to the hospitalisation and of the treatment actually&#xD;
      received. It will be centralized gathered via telephone conversations with patients and their&#xD;
      relatives by a certified clinical research nurse with blinding to the randomized group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary feasibility outcomes will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of confirmed large-vessel stroke in the intervention and the control groups,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of proximal intracranial occlusion of the anterior circulation in the&#xD;
           intervention group,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the hospital admission-to-imaging time / the admission-to-thrombolysis time / the&#xD;
           admission-to-puncture time / the admission-to-reperfusion time,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the imaging-to-puncture time / the imaging-to-reperfusion time,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the puncture-to-reperfusion time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Effectiveness outcomes will include :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the quality of final perfusion according to the mTICI score: percentage of patients with&#xD;
           reperfusion defined by mTICI 0, 1, 2a, 2b, 2c, and 3 (modified Treatment In Cerebral&#xD;
           Infarction) at the end of thrombectomy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of complications per procedure: embolus in new territory, arterial perforation,&#xD;
           arterial dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the 24-hour (±6 hours) clinical improvement staged with the NIHSS score, the NIHSS at&#xD;
           5-7 days (or at hospital discharge if within 5 days),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the blinded 12-month (±1 month) functional outcome valued by the mRS score,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of cerebral hemorrhage at admission,&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  the rate of 24-hour asymptomatic and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhagic&#xD;
           transformation as defined by the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in&#xD;
           Stroke-Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of overall mortality (mRS score 6) at 3-month (±15 days) and at 12 months (±1&#xD;
           month),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the inhospital rate of neurosurgical procedure (malignant stroke or large intracerebral&#xD;
           hemorrhage with mass effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), of stroke unrelated to large-vessel&#xD;
           occlusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of patients treated by intravenous thrombolysis alone and who required&#xD;
           additional imaging (MRI or CT-scan),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of stroke mimics (tumour, epilepsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medico-economic analyses will assess the avoided health care costs in an health insurance&#xD;
      perspective and provide a cost-utility evaluation using the Health-Related Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) at 12-month (±1 month) from inclusion. Health costs will be&#xD;
      collected from a national database (the National Institute of Health Data) using a matching&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Body: To ensure that appropriate ethical consideration is given to the&#xD;
      welfare of the patients enrolled in the study, a DSMB was formed. The members of the DSMB are&#xD;
      not participants of the DIRECT ANGIO consortium and not involved in the clinical trial. The&#xD;
      DSMB is composed by one neuroradiologist, one pharmacovigilance specialist and one&#xD;
      methodologist, who are not participating in the study and are not affiliated with the&#xD;
      sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, one interim analysis is planned once 50% of patients have been included, for the&#xD;
      study to be stopped early owing either to compelling evidence of efficacy (using a&#xD;
      pre-specified Haybittle-Peto efficacy boundary with an alpha level of 0.001) or of futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type I error is specified at 0.05 with a power of 80%. Assuming 30% of patients&#xD;
      randomized in the control arm achieve 3-month mRS score ≤2 and an absolute difference of 20%&#xD;
      between the two arms, we will need a sample size of 93 patients per group for a two-sided&#xD;
      test. To deal with 10% drop-out, we will include a total of 208 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and baseline clinical-radiological characteristics will be provided in the entire&#xD;
      inclusion cohort. Descriptive statistics will include drop-out rate for each covariates and&#xD;
      use chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Student or Mann-Whitney test when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between two randomized arms for the primary outcome will be made in the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat and in the per-protocol sets with a logistic regression adjusted on the&#xD;
      center. Odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous primary outcome&#xD;
      will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy and safety outcomes will be assessed with chi-square tests for&#xD;
      categorical variables (eg, overall mortality and serious adverse events) and Student's t test&#xD;
      for continuous variables (eg, mean 24-hour NIHSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, one interim analysis is planned once 50% of patients have been included, for the&#xD;
      study to be stopped early owing either to compelling evidence of efficacy (using a&#xD;
      pre-specified Haybittle-Peto efficacy boundary with an alpha level of 0.001) or of futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the medico-economic analysis will take into account disability costs and health&#xD;
      costs avoided with the interventional strategy. A cost-utility analysis will be also&#xD;
      performed with health-related quality of life estimated with EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties&#xD;
      (CNIL), the Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP).&#xD;
