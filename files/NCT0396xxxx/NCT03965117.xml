  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining adequate blood pressure is important for survival of organs. Recent studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that higher blood pressures were necessary for prevention of acute kidney injury&#xD;
      and myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery. Hypotension after induction and maintenance&#xD;
      of anesthesia is common. For maintaining adequate blood pressure in a euvolemic patient,&#xD;
      vasopressor therapy is required. Norepinephrine (NOR) is commonly used to treat&#xD;
      anesthesia-related hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hepatic circulation has a large number of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and is very&#xD;
      sensitive for adrenergic stimulation such as norepinephrine infusion. Animal studies&#xD;
      (Hiltebrand et al.) suggest that NOR has only minimal effect on hepatic blood flow however&#xD;
      the effect of NOR on hepatic blood flow in clinical surgical patients remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of NOR on hepatic blood flow during.&#xD;
&#xD;
      goal directed haemodynamic therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients receive standardized anesthesia care for pancreas surgery according to the&#xD;
      existing departmental protocol for these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive individualized goal-directed haemodynamic therapy based on the&#xD;
      transpulmonary thermodilution technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At designated times, hemodynamic variables will be recorded. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate (bpm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central venous pressure (mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean arterial pressure (mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac index (L/min/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse pressure variation (PPV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood flow and pressure measurements performed by the surgeon :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic flow : hepatic artery (HAF) and portal vein (PVF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pressure measurements in portal vein (PPorta) and caval vein (PCava)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both flow and pressure will be simultaneously recorded. To minimize the effect of ventilation&#xD;
      on pressure, these measurements will be obtained during apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between each flow measurement there will be a minimum of 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOR will be started at 0,1 mcg/kg/min and titrated according to its haemodynamic effect.&#xD;
      After baseline MAP (which is &gt; 60 mmHg), NOR is targeted according baseline MAP. At T2, MAP&#xD;
      is between 10 - 20 % above baseline (T1), at T3 MAP is between 20 - 30 % above baseline (T1).&#xD;
