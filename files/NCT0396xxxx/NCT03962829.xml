  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have reported that the 5-HT2C receptor agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine&#xD;
      (mCPP) decreases appetite and food intake in humans1-3. 5-HT2C receptor activation inhibits&#xD;
      dopamine and norepinephrine release in the brain4, and has also been linked to diabetes5. The&#xD;
      specificity of the effect of mCPP on human appetite is unclear, as previous studies also&#xD;
      reported an increase in nausea1,3. The drug has also been reported to increase anxiety and&#xD;
      cause panic attacks when given in a bolus dose intravenously6. Previous findings in our&#xD;
      laboratory showed that mCPP reduced appetite, increased satiety in women and enhanced memory&#xD;
      in the P1vitalÂ® Oxford Emotional Test Battery3. Following up on these results a food intake&#xD;
      and fMRI study was performed, in which it was observed that mCPP decreased intake of a&#xD;
      palatable snack (hedonic eating) and dlPFC and insula BOLD responses to food pictures.&#xD;
      Additionally it increased memory and food value responses in brain after mCPP administration&#xD;
      (Thomas et al submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that eating behaviour is affected by metabolic signals (e.g. insulin,&#xD;
      ghrelin, serotonin) and is also modulated via food reward processes7. More recently it has&#xD;
      been proposed that eating is also modulated via higher cognitive processes such as inhibitory&#xD;
      control, attention, and memory. However, in humans, eating behaviour seems to be a more&#xD;
      complex process, which involves habits, long-term goals and social interaction. Thus,&#xD;
      cognitive processes appear to play an important role in food consumption. In the proposed&#xD;
      study the researchers investigate the effect of administering mCPP, on eating, and on&#xD;
      metabolic, reward and cognitive processes and the potential interplay between these&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased rapidly in less than half a century.&#xD;
      It is assumed that this development is due to interplay between behavioural, environmental&#xD;
      and genetic factors. This increase in weight is associated with multiple-medical conditions,&#xD;
      e.g. increased depression, and chronicle health conditions, like heart disease, cancer, and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, and is associated with high health care costs. The UK has one of the highest&#xD;
      rates of obesity in Europe, with 20% of the population defined as obese and over 50% defined&#xD;
      as overweight. However treatment options for weight loss, and especially long-term weight&#xD;
      maintenance are still limited. The development of safe and effective therapeutics is&#xD;
      therefore imperative. An effective way to help weight loss, as part of a comprehensive&#xD;
      program, is to prescribe drug treatments designed to reduce food consumption. However, at&#xD;
      present, drug treatments for obesity are very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mCPP appears to reduce food intake, and appetite in lean people. However it also seems to&#xD;
      effect cognitive processes. Basic research to understand the interplay between these&#xD;
      processes in relation to drug effects on appetite are of great interest because it can&#xD;
      provide important insight into new development novel treatments for obesity. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to test a model outlining that metabolic signals may reduce food intake&#xD;
      by interfering with cognitive processes that underpin appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been agreed upon that eating behaviour is affected by metabolic signals, e.g.&#xD;
      serotonin, insulin and ghrelin, and influenced by food reward processes (Berthoud 2011). But&#xD;
      the idea that these mechanisms are modulated via higher cognitive processes such as&#xD;
      inhibitory control, attention, and memory is a relatively new domain to be explored. In&#xD;
      humans, eating behaviour seems to be a more complex system; which also involves habits,&#xD;
      long-term goals, and social interaction. Cognitive processes appear to play an important role&#xD;
      in food consumption. Previous studies reported the anorectic effect of the drugs&#xD;
      meta-chloriphenylpiperazine (mCPP), a 5-HT2C receptor agonist. Additionally mCPP has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce appetite, increase satiety, and enhance memory for emotional material (word&#xD;
      recall) and recognition memory (Thomas et al 2015). Preliminary results suggest that mCPP&#xD;
      decreased intake of palatable snacks (hedonic eating) and when viewing food pictures appetite&#xD;
      and reward related neural responses appear to be modulated by mCPP administration (Thomas et&#xD;
      al in preparation). However the interaction between the drugs, neural responses and behaviour&#xD;
      are still not known, and the effects of overweight on these responses is a very interesting&#xD;
      question in relation to anti-obesity drug development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study the researchers want to investigate the effect of oral administrating&#xD;
      mCPP, on neural responses and networks in relation to food reward, cognitive control and&#xD;
      working memory and its impact on subsequent snack consumption, food and emotion related&#xD;
      memory, and mood and appetite ratings, and additionally the interplay between all these&#xD;
      processes in both lean and obese individuals. Participants will get an mCPP dose (30mg) and a&#xD;
      placebo on different occasion, where after the neural activation (with fMRI) in response to&#xD;
      food stimuli is assesed, inhibition tasks, and memory tests. This will be related to eating&#xD;
      behaviour, memory performance, and mood and appetite ratings.&#xD;
