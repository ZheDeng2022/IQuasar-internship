  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Listening to &quot;patient voices&quot; in terms of symptoms, emotional status, satisfaction with care&#xD;
      and information received, represents a major shift in medicine. It is in fact crucial in&#xD;
      medical decision making and patient empowerment, especially in cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) and in particular electronically assessed PROMS&#xD;
      (ePROMS), have been identified as potentially effective tools to systematically gather&#xD;
      patient voices. Despite international extensive and growing interest, systematic PROM&#xD;
      collection is not widely implemented in routine cancer care, due to barriers at various&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PATIENT VOICES is a project aimed at achieving a stepwise inclusion and integration of&#xD;
      PROMs within routine clinical practice at the FONDAZIONE IRCCS ISTITUTO NAZIONALE&#xD;
      TUMORI-MILANO. Phase I of the Patient Voices project (pilot and feasibility testing), will be&#xD;
      the focus of the present study and its results will be the base for subsequent phases&#xD;
      (implementation and impact assessment).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study aims of this phase are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the use and attitudes toward PROMs by clinicians in a comprehensive cancer&#xD;
           centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reviewing and compare pre-existing ePROMS assessment systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developing and pilot testing a flexible system for electronic collection of PROMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing feasibility of ePROM assessment of physical symptoms, psychological distress&#xD;
           and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying barriers to and developing strategies for the final implementation and&#xD;
           integration of routine ePROMs into the clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will last 2 years. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies will be carried out&#xD;
      with the aim to evaluate compliance, acceptability, and usability of a routine ePROM&#xD;
      assessment system by both patients and clinicians. Participants will be enrolled among&#xD;
      patients attending 3 out-patient clinics (physical symptom), 3 inpatient wards (psychological&#xD;
      distress) and 5 multidisciplinary teams (patient satisfaction). The Edmonton symptom&#xD;
      assessment scale, the Distress Thermometer, and a questionnaire adapted from the Bench-Can&#xD;
      and EURACAN projects plus the institutional customer satisfaction survey, will be used in the&#xD;
      three studies. Qualitative methods will be used identify patient and clinician related&#xD;
      barriers to ePROM assessment and to pinpoint engagement strategies to promote its use in&#xD;
      routine cancer care. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative and qualitative studies will respectively enroll 600 and 40 participants.&#xD;
