  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the efficacy and the feasibility of the Asian Women's&#xD;
      Action for Resilience and Empowerment (AWARE) intervention, in the real world setting --&#xD;
      student health service centers at Boston University, Wellesley College, and Harvard&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AWARE is an 8-week group intervention specifically designed to address mental health and&#xD;
      sexual health issues among Asian-Pacific Islander (API) women. One AWARE group (final number&#xD;
      of 8-10 API women who will be treated) will be held at BU Student Health Services, two groups&#xD;
      at Wellesley College, and two groups at Harvard University Health Services for undergraduate&#xD;
      and graduate students who meet the demographic and clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention period, participants will attend the AWARE group counseling sessions,&#xD;
      which are 90 minutes, once a week, for 8 weeks. Each week's session is focused on a specific&#xD;
      theme related to the cultural and gender-specific issues typical among young Asian American&#xD;
      women. The sessions are led by staff therapists at either institution. Participants will fill&#xD;
      out forms that detail their therapeutic goals (&quot;commitments&quot;) and any adverse&#xD;
      emotional/behavioral events from the past week. Participants will also receive daily text&#xD;
      messages that reinforce the group session themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed pre- and post-intervention on clinical outcomes, including&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, PTSD, and suicidality, using standardized quantitative instruments. This&#xD;
      serves to evaluate the efficacy of AWARE at improving mental health outcomes. Participants&#xD;
      will also participate in a post-intervention focus group session to evaluate the program's&#xD;
      implementation and suggest ways for future improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After institutional review application is approved, study recruitment will begin immediately.&#xD;
      Electronic and hard-copy fliers will be disseminated around campus. Fliers will be emailed to&#xD;
      Offices of Student Affairs, as well as Asian American student groups, at Boston University&#xD;
      and Harvard University. Publicity at Wellesley College will be conducted through the Office&#xD;
      of the Dean of Students, Intercultural Education Program. The research group social media&#xD;
      (AWSHIP Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, monthly newsletter) will also be used to recruit&#xD;
      potential participants. Those who are interested in participating in AWARE will be directed&#xD;
      to the AWSHIP website, where the link for the &lt;3 minute demographic survey will be available.&#xD;
      The survey will have 6 initial screening question and participants must answer in the&#xD;
      affirmative to be eligible for the next recruitment step:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;1. How or where did you hear about our study? Why did our advertisement grab your&#xD;
      attention/our outreach effort interest you? 2. Do you self-identify as an Asian American&#xD;
      female? 3. What is your marital status? 4. What is your age as of this screening? 5. What&#xD;
      languages are you fluent in reading, writing, and speaking? 6. Do you currently have a mobile&#xD;
      phone (either a regular phone or a smart phone) with a text-messaging plan?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who provide answers that meet the preliminary criteria will receive more detailed&#xD;
      information about the study (either by phone or email) within a week. They will be invited to&#xD;
      meet with the site coordinator/research assistant to complete the consent form. After&#xD;
      participants sign the consent form, they will be asked to complete the clinical assessment in&#xD;
      the same room (BUSSW: Rooms 345 or 340, Wellesley: Stone Center Counseling Service offices,&#xD;
      Harvard U: Counseling and Mental Health Services offices) using the study laptops. Since the&#xD;
      clinical assessments contain questionnaires that ask for details on history of mental health&#xD;
      and suicidality, the research team will debrief with the participants asking them about their&#xD;
      feelings, ensuring their safety and referring them to care immediately (if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions will be asked in the debrief:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;1. How do you feel after completing the measures? 2. Do you feel safe going about your day?&#xD;
      3. Do you need to talk to someone?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant completes the assessment and leaves the room, research coordinators will&#xD;
      calculate the scores and inform the PI to help determine if participants meet the threshold&#xD;
      criteria based on the results of the clinical screening. The PI will only use the screening&#xD;
      questionnaire scored to determine study eligibility. This will be done within 24 hours after&#xD;
      the clinical assessment. The research coordinators will contact the participant within 48&#xD;
      hours after the clinical assessment to inform whether they are eligible for the intervention.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be invited to join the intervention group until all the spots have&#xD;
      been filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening questionnaire will contain the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale - Revised (CESD-R) is a survey&#xD;
           that screens for depression by measuring the severity of symptoms linked with depressive&#xD;
           episodes. Eligibility criteria is a score equal to or greater than 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) determines the levels of depression and&#xD;
           anxiety that a participant may be experiencing. Eligibility criteria is a score equal to&#xD;
           or greater than 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version (PCL-C) screens for the key symptoms of PTSD that&#xD;
           applies to any traumatic event that has happened. Eligibility criteria is a score equal&#xD;
           to or greater than 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. As well, exposure to physical or sexual violence during childhood is assessed using the&#xD;
           Adverse Childhood Experience International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ). The (ACE-IQ) surveys&#xD;
           the first 18 years of the participant's life, such as physical or sexual abuse from&#xD;
           household or non-household members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The SF-12 Health Survey (SF-12) asks for personal views on health and keeps track of how&#xD;
           the participant feels/how well the participant is able to do perform usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) assesses the suicidality of the&#xD;
           participant, such as suicidal ideation, intent of ideations, and suicidal behavior. Any&#xD;
           participant who indicates that they attempted suicide for the last two years, will be&#xD;
           immediately referred to the Student Health Service Center therapist for individual&#xD;
           psychotherapy instead of being part of the group intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, for the Harvard University site, the pre-/post-intervention questionnaires will&#xD;
      also contain measures that aim to clarify the psychosocial mechanisms through which the AWARE&#xD;
      intervention acts to improve mental health outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS) measures the individual's propensity&#xD;
           towards perfectionistic thinking and behavior;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) measures the individual's capacity and coping behaviors&#xD;
           to tolerate emotionally distressful events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Asian American Family Conflict Scale (AAFCS) assesses the conflicts in values and&#xD;
           practices between U.S.-raised children and their immigrant parents, in terms of&#xD;
           likelihood of occurrence and seriousness of conflict;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measures (MEIM) assess the individual's commitment (i.e.&#xD;
           affirmation and belonging) towards her ethnic identity group, as well as the extent of&#xD;
           her exploration and resolution of identity issues;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale - Short Form (ATSPPHS)&#xD;
           measures the participant's stigma toward mental health and seeking psychological help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the screening and consent process, depending on demand, eligible participants may&#xD;
      be assigned to a waiting list. Since this is a small study, it is anticipated that some&#xD;
      participants may not be able to join the intervention during the clinical trial period. The&#xD;
      research team will encourage those who will be unable to join the intervention to participant&#xD;
      in any other form of mental health treatment offered at the student health service center. If&#xD;
      the participants still want to be part of the intervention, they will be informed that they&#xD;
      may be able to participate the following semester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Wellesley College, approximately 30 participants are expected to complete the initial&#xD;
      demographic screening, and approximately 75% (n = 23) of those women are expected to meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria on the subsequent clinical screening. Approximately 85% (n = 20) will be&#xD;
      both eligible for the inclusion criteria and will commit to 8 weeks of approximately 90&#xD;
      minutes of AWARE intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Boston University, approximately 30 participants are expected to complete the initial&#xD;
      demographic screening, and approximately 75% (n = 23) of those women are expected to meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria on the subsequent clinical screening. Approximately 40% (n = 10) will be&#xD;
      both eligible for the inclusion criteria and will commit to 8 weeks of approximately 90&#xD;
      minutes of AWARE intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Harvard University, approximately 60 participants are expected to complete the initial&#xD;
      demographic screening, and approximately 75% (n= 45) of those women are expected to meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria on the subsequent clinical screening. Approximately 33% (n= 18-20) will be&#xD;
      both eligible for the inclusion criteria and will commit to 8 weeks of approximately 90&#xD;
      minutes AWARE intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AWARE intervention was developed as a culturally informed treatment that addresses issues&#xD;
      of family dynamics, trauma, mental health, and sexual health in Asian American women. The 8&#xD;
      sessions in the AWARE intervention was developed to be sensitive to the gender power dynamics&#xD;
      that is consistent throughout many Asian cultures. The sessions provide a safe space for&#xD;
      Asian American women to explore the impact of family issues including conflict with parents&#xD;
      and family violence as well as understanding coping styles and identity development. The&#xD;
      AWARE intervention also addresses mental and physical symptoms that are relevant for trauma&#xD;
      survivors. The AWARE intervention was also developed for Asian American women who have&#xD;
      experienced Intimate Partner Violence. The sessions focus on how to achieve safety and&#xD;
      stability by teaching participants various skills such as how to identify unhealthy&#xD;
      relationship patterns and increase safety in their relationships and sexual practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will complete the Adverse Events Log for each week. They will bring the log&#xD;
      to each intervention session. The log will take 5-7 minutes to complete. The Adverse Events&#xD;
      Log is a form that the subjects will complete to let the therapist know if there were any&#xD;
      safety concerns in the previous week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The topics for the intervention follow the AWARE manual. The topics include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: Introduction to AWARE Session 2: &quot;ABCDG&quot; Parenting &amp; Coping with Disempowerment&#xD;
      Session 3: Catch-22: The Double Bind Session 4: Who Do I See in the Mirror? Body Image,&#xD;
      Stereotypes, &amp; the Media Session 5: Romance, Violence, &amp; Everything in Between Session 6: Sex&#xD;
      and Substance Use Session 7: Giving Yourself Grace Session 8: New Beginnings&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention, participants will receive text messages once a day that will provide&#xD;
      helpful tips and strategies that promote wellness, encourage self-care, and provide new&#xD;
      information and resources. The text messages will not indicate that the subjects are part of&#xD;
      a research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of text message stories include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Being empowered is easier said than done. When you are faced with an emotionally challenging&#xD;
      obstacle, you can often act in ways that you feel you are not in control of recognizing your&#xD;
      emotions and how you react to them is a key step in discovering how you can empower&#xD;
      yourself.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;STOP is a coping skill that we can use to cope. When we recognize that we are in an&#xD;
           emotionally heightened state, take a moment to stop whatever you're doing or thinking,&#xD;
           take a deep mindful breath, observe (with your senses and internally), and proceed with&#xD;
           caution (respond not react).&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;More often than not, you are who you are and your perceptions of yourself is connected&#xD;
           to your experiences and/or relationship with your parents. Asian-American women often&#xD;
           have complicated relationships with their parents; and their actions may confuse you. It&#xD;
           is helpful to understand these experiences and this relationship as part of your healing&#xD;
           process.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the intervention has been completed, the participants will complete the post-test&#xD;
      clinical evaluations. These evaluations will be the same as the measures completed during the&#xD;
      clinical screening prior to the start of the intervention. The clinical evaluations will be&#xD;
      send to the participants after the completion of the final session. The participants will&#xD;
      receive an email link with their unique study identification number that they will input when&#xD;
      they complete the clinical eligibility screening. The research team will encourage them to&#xD;
      complete the clinical screening within 48 hours. This will take about 35-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to participate in a focus group after the completion of the&#xD;
      post-test. The participants are not mandated to take part in the focus group. The focus group&#xD;
      will allow the participants to give the principal investigator feedback on the AWARE&#xD;
      intervention contents. The focus group discussion will use a semi-structured interview and&#xD;
      last approximately 90 minutes.&#xD;
