  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common tumor (the 8th leading cause of cancer in France)&#xD;
      and has a poor prognosis. It is the 3rd leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. In the&#xD;
      early stages (low tumor mass), HCC can be treated for curative purposes by surgical&#xD;
      resection, percutaneous ablation or liver transplantation. When the tumor mass is larger (&gt; 3&#xD;
      nodules) but remains confined to the liver, the standard treatment is hepatic intra-arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE). In the event of failure of the latter or if the tumor dissemination&#xD;
      progresses in the portal venous system or in the form of metastases, the systemic treatments&#xD;
      are then indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1st line, the reference treatment is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ITK) Sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabozantinib obtained the European and French authorization (AMM) in November 2018 for its&#xD;
      use in case of failure of Sorafenib in patients with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is the evaluation of the safety of Cabozantinib administered to patients&#xD;
      with intermediate HCC ineligible for chemoembolization or advanced HCC after failure of&#xD;
      Sorafenib and possibly another systemic anticancer line.&#xD;
