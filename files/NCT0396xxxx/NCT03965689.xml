    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well MLN4924 (pevonedistat), carboplatin, and paclitaxel work&#xD;
      in treating patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. Pevonedistat may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving pevonedistat together with carboplatin and paclitaxel&#xD;
      may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer when compared with other&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) treated with pevonedistat (MLN4924 [pevonedistat]) in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced NSCLC treated&#xD;
      with MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with&#xD;
      MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety profile of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with carboplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2) target&#xD;
      genes NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) and the cysteine/glutamate antiporter solute&#xD;
      carrier family 7 member 11 (SCL7A11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine expression of pharmacodynamic markers induced by neural precursor cell&#xD;
      expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD-8) activating enzyme (NAE)&#xD;
      inhibition: cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF3), beta 2 microglobulin (B2M),&#xD;
      glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit (GCLM), glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR),&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-3-methyladenine (MAG1), ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit&#xD;
      P0 (RPLPO), sulfiredoxin-1 (SRXN1), thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), and&#xD;
      ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To perform qualitative assessment of tumor NAE1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 M&#xD;
      (UBC12) protein expression at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for DNA damage repair pathway alterations (i.e.,&#xD;
      gamma H2AX induction, RAD51).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) when given in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1, carboplatin IV over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes on day 1, and pevonedistat IV over 1 hour on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for at least 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, all patients without disease progression are followed up&#xD;
      at 30 days, every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months until 5 years from end of study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the proportion of evaluable subjects with a response. Response will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. Patients will be re-evaluated for response every 6 weeks. The number and frequencies of responses will be summarized in tabular format. The ORR will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval which will be constructed using the Wilson score method.</description>

             physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and 4 months after completion of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been&#xD;
                  treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on&#xD;

               -  Patients with NSCLC harboring genomic aberrations (e.g. sensitizing EGFR, ALK,&#xD;
                  ROS1, NTRK, BRAF V600E mutation positive) must have received prior treatment with&#xD;
                  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved targeted therapy for patients for&#xD;
                  which FDA approved targeted therapies is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from AEs due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have&#xD;

             carboplatin, and paclitaxel have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat),&#xD;
             breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924&#xD;

                    -  Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or grade &lt; 3 atrial&#xD;
                       fibrillation for period of at least 6 months are permitted to enroll&#xD;
                       provided that their rate is controlled on a stable regimen.&#xD;
