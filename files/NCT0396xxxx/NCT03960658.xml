    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the effectiveness of the drug, Ketamine, in combination with&#xD;
      Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy for people suffering from PTSD. Participation in the study&#xD;
      includes Ketamine infusions, which occur once a week for three weeks. PE therapy sessions&#xD;
      will be scheduled one day after each infusion, and may continue up to 12 weeks. After&#xD;
      completely therapy, there will be two monthly follow-up assessment visits.&#xD;

      Study location: Minneapolis VA Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an open-label interventional study designed to inform and strengthen the&#xD;
      feasibility of protocol implementation on sub-anesthetic doses of intravenous Ketamine as&#xD;
      augmenting strategy of standardized, manually-driven Prolonged Exposure therapy in PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline: Eligible individuals can expect their participation to last up to 5 months.&#xD;
      Compensation will be given for participation per session that is attended. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be provided with information about the study and asked a series of&#xD;
      questions to determine if they meet basic inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., indicators of&#xD;
      current PTSD). They will be informed that the treatment involves multiple infusions of&#xD;
      sedatives at subanesthetic doses followed by PE therapy. Those interested will be scheduled&#xD;
      for an in-person, baseline session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voluntary informed consent will be obtained in accordance with local IRB approvals. During&#xD;
      the baseline, all assessments, computer tasks, and information on treatment will be&#xD;
      explained. Participants will also undergo a urine toxicology analysis during this session.&#xD;
      Ketamine infusions and PE therapy appointments will be scheduled within two weeks of the&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the infusion, patients will arrive in the morning after an overnight fast of at&#xD;
      least 8 hours. An IV will be placed in the non-dominant arm for medication administration.&#xD;
      Vitals will be recorded throughout the entire medication treatment. Subjects will then&#xD;
      receive IV infusion of 0.5mg/Kg of ketamine hydrochloride solution over 40 minutes. The dose&#xD;
      of ketamine will be calculated by ideal body weight. Any altered sensory or dissociative&#xD;
      effects will be measured before and after each infusion. Vitals will be monitored for another&#xD;
      hour, until all side-effects have subsided. Participants are required not to drive or use&#xD;
      heavy machinery until the following morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One day after the infusion, patients will come back for study assessments and Prolonged&#xD;
      Exposure therapy with a VA psychologist. PE is an evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD that&#xD;
      is based on the Emotional Processing Theory of PTSD; the four components of PE are: 1)&#xD;
      exposure to safe situations, objects, or people that cause distress and are avoided because&#xD;
      they are trauma reminders (in vivo exposure), 2) revisiting and processing of the trauma&#xD;
      memory (imaginal exposure), 3) psycho-education about trauma-related symptoms, and 4)&#xD;
      breathing retraining. Session 1 includes the presentation of treatment rationale and program&#xD;
      overview, information gathering, and breathing retraining. Session 2 includes education about&#xD;
      common reactions to trauma, rationale for in vivo exposure, and construction of an in vivo&#xD;
      exposure hierarchy. The hierarchy includes safe or low-risk activities and situations that&#xD;
      were avoided because of their association with the trauma. Throughout the treatment,&#xD;
      participants will be assigned homework to confront items on the hierarchy in a gradual&#xD;
      fashion, working up to the most anxiety-arousing situations. During Session 3, the rationale&#xD;
      for confronting the trauma memory in imagination is presented and initiation of imaginal&#xD;
      exposure and processing is conducted. In this procedure, participants will be asked to close&#xD;
      their eyes, visualize the trauma, and recount it aloud in the present tense for 45-60 min.&#xD;
      The memory recounting will be repeated if necessary to allow total reliving of 45-60 min. The&#xD;
      exposure will be audiotaped; participants will be instructed to listen daily to the tape.&#xD;
      Sessions 4-10 will be conducted in a similar fashion: therapists review homework, conduct&#xD;
      imaginal exposure to trauma memory for 30-45 min, discuss the imaginal exposure, and assigned&#xD;
      in vivo and imaginal exposure homework. In the final session, participants summarize learning&#xD;
      in treatment, discuss their progress, plans, and relapse prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon PE completion, participants are asked to come back for 2 follow-up sessions over two&#xD;
      months. Familiar study and PTSD assessments will be administered during this time.&#xD;

    <description>The overall severity of PTSD symptoms would be measured by the mean change in the Past Month (current) total scores on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (CAPS-5) from baseline to post-treatment (10 weeks). The CAPS-5 is a structured interview with higher values representing worse outcomes. The CAPS-5 total symptom severity score ranges from 0 to 80 and it is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms.</description>
