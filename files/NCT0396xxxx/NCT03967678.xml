  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red meat is an integral component of the habitual diet among the UK and Irish population,&#xD;
      with adults consuming an average of 71grams/day. Although typically high in saturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (SFA), red meat is also an important dietary source of protein and essential nutrients&#xD;
      including iron, zinc, B vitamins and long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which&#xD;
      provide numerous benefits to human health, particularly related to cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) risk. N-3 and n-6 PUFA are a family of fatty acids with important roles in&#xD;
      cardiovascular health, and it is often recommended in dietary guidelines to replace SFA with&#xD;
      unsaturated fats, such as PUFA. Owing to the social and economic burden of CVD, increasing&#xD;
      the proportions of these unsaturated fatty acids, in combination with a reduction in SFA&#xD;
      within meat, could have a large impact on CVD risk at the population level, whilst retaining&#xD;
      the beneficial nutrients and n-3 PUFA which meat provides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research, a total of 90 eligible and consenting participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to consume three portions per week of n-3 enriched beef (from either dietary&#xD;
      supplemented or grass-fed cattle) or control beef (from standard supply). This beef will be&#xD;
      offered within a lunchtime meal and served from the Human Intervention Studies Unit at Ulster&#xD;
      University, Coleraine for a period of 5 weeks. A fasting blood sample will be taken before&#xD;
      and after intervention to determine the effect the n-3 enriched beef on cholesterol&#xD;
      concentrations, lipid profile, PUFA status and inflammation. Blood pressure, stiffness of the&#xD;
      arteries and body shape, size and composition will also be assessed, and some health and&#xD;
      lifestyle habits will be captured using questionnaires.&#xD;
