        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric&#xD;
             criteria at Visit 1 (Screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relatively stable, moderate to very severe airway obstruction with a&#xD;
                  post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;80% of predicted normal and FEV1/FVC &lt;70%. Spirometry&#xD;
                  should be done at baseline and approximately 1/2 hour following 4 inhalations of&#xD;
                  albuterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male = exp [-10.61669 + 2.27078 × ln (- in cm) + 0.06622 × ln (age in year) +&#xD;
                  Mspline] Female = exp [-9.69716 + 2.09385 × ln (- in cm) + 0.02006 × ln (age in&#xD;
                  year) + Mspline]&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Historical data from spirometry measurements within the past 6 either at the site&#xD;
                  or at the other hospital may be used. If the measurements are not performed at&#xD;
                  the trial site a referral letter and signed copies of the measurement printouts&#xD;
                  must be provided to the trial site for source data verification. In case several&#xD;
                  qualifying spirometry measurements are available, the most recent one should be&#xD;
                  referred to as long as it was not performed during an exacerbation. Patients may&#xD;
                  not be randomised to the study without the availability of spirometry data at the&#xD;
                  actual study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, age: ≥40 years of age&#xD;

             Tiotropium HandiHaler®&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to perform all study related procedures, and must be able to&#xD;
             maintain records (patient diary) during the study period as required by the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had visual, cognitive, or motor impairment that, as judged by the investigator, did&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients have had used both Respimat® and HandiHaler® (including generic HandiHaler®)&#xD;
             within one year prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease is defined as a disease or condition which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, may put the patients at risk because of participation in the study or&#xD;
             may influence either the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with an Aspartate Transaminase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic&#xD;

             Transaminase, SGPT) &gt;80 IU/L, Bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL or Creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL will be&#xD;
             excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will not&#xD;
             be conducted in these subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than 1 hour per day and in&#xD;

             Respimat® inhalation solution delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently in any pulmonary rehabilitation program or scheduled to participate&#xD;
