  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common atrial arrhythmia. Ablation of AF is a recent&#xD;
      technique, nevertheless, the success rates of ablation vary between 50% and 70% depending on&#xD;
      the paroxysmal or persistent nature of AF. These rates are difficult to assess in routine&#xD;
      practice because they are based on the recurrence of fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vitaphone is a non-invasive device, with which the patient can record a single-track ECG&#xD;
      as his or her symptoms take place. The plot is then transmitted via the internet to the&#xD;
      centre, which can thus diagnose a relapse of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to correlate the rhythm and symptoms of 20 patients with Vitaphone 6&#xD;
      months after AF ablation and to compare them with 20 other patients receiving conventional&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common atrial arrhythmia in the population and its&#xD;
      incidence will increase in the coming years. Ablation of AF is a recent technique, the&#xD;
      efficiency of which has considerably increased in recent years. Nevertheless, the success&#xD;
      rates of ablation vary between 50% and 70% depending on the paroxysmal or persistent nature&#xD;
      of AF. These rates are difficult to assess in routine practice because they are based on the&#xD;
      recurrence of fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This definition of recurrence based on symptoms (palpitations, asthenia, fatigue, shortness&#xD;
      of breath, malaise, precordialgia) is widely debated because some patients have asymptomatic&#xD;
      AF recidivism, while others experience palpitations that are not due to AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, studies have been carried out with electrocardiographic recording devices&#xD;
      implanted subcutaneously. Given the invasiveness of this monitoring, it is not feasible in&#xD;
      current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vitaphone is a non-invasive device, with which the patient can record a single-track ECG&#xD;
      as his or her symptoms take place. The plot is then transmitted via the internet to the&#xD;
      centre, which can thus diagnose a relapse of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to correlate the rhythm and symptoms of 20 patients with Vitaphone 6&#xD;
      months after AF ablation and to compare them with 20 other patients receiving conventional&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is, to our knowledge, the first non-invasive French study using the Vitaphone.&#xD;
