  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 Multi-Center Clinical Trial (safety and effectiveness trial) in 60 patients&#xD;
      (40 denosumab; 20 placebo) who have had a kidney transplant for 12-months or longer with more&#xD;
      than 30% of kidney function. The investigators will test whether denosumab safely improves&#xD;
      bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and improves bone&#xD;
      strength by high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) in the&#xD;
      subset of patients recruited at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. These data will&#xD;
      inform the development and execution of a larger trial to test if denosumab prevents&#xD;
      fractures in kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone fractures are 3-times more common in kidney transplant recipients than in the general&#xD;
      population and risk of dying after a hip fracture is 60% higher compared to kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients without a fracture. Unfortunately, there are no anti-fracture strategies that have&#xD;
      been proven to be effective in double blinded randomized clinical trials for kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients. This is because some anti-fracture medications that are commonly used&#xD;
      to treat osteoporosis and prevent fractures in the general population (i.e.,&#xD;
      bisphosphonates), may be harmful to the skeleton when kidney function is less than 30% of&#xD;
      normal. In addition, intravenous bisphosphonates may be toxic to the kidneys, which further&#xD;
      limits their utility in patients with a kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANKL, inhibits osteoclast function and is not&#xD;
      harmful to the kidney. Denosumab prevents fractures in men and women with age-related and&#xD;
      glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Recently, a non-blinded randomized trial of denosumab&#xD;
      versus usual care during the first year of kidney transplantation in 90 patients reported the&#xD;
      bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) increased at&#xD;
      the spine and hip and that bone strength measured by high resolution peripheral quantitative&#xD;
      computed tomography (HR-pQCT) increased in patients treated with denosumab. Adverse events in&#xD;
      denosumab-treated patients included greater risk of urinary tract infections, diarrhea, and&#xD;
      transient levels of low serum calcium that were asymptomatic. This study demonstrated that&#xD;
      denosumab safely increased BMD at the spine and hip in new kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
      However, long-term kidney recipients, who comprise the vast majority of patients living with&#xD;
      a transplanted kidney and who are also at increased risk of fracture, were not included.&#xD;
