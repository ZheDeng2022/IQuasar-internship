      The overall aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness and sustainability of parent-targeted interventions for pain management during&#xD;
      vaccination of infants. To achieve the goal, a two-phase pilot randomized control trial is&#xD;
      planned. Study one, currently in the data collection phase, aims i) to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of data collection tools, participants' recruitment procedures&#xD;
      and implementation process of parent-targeted interventions prior to infant vaccination at&#xD;
      two, four, or six months. ii) to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of parent-targeted&#xD;
      interventions prior to infant vaccination in promoting the use of pain management strategies&#xD;
      during vaccinations of infants at two, four, or six months. iii) to identify the parent's&#xD;
      knowledge, use, intention and recommendation to use the recommended pain management&#xD;
      strategies, and facilitators and barriers influencing the implementation of the&#xD;
      parent-targeted interventions during vaccinations of infants at two, four, or six months.&#xD;
      Methods. This study is a prospective multi-faceted two-armed pilot randomized control trial&#xD;
      (RCT). a pilot randomized control trial. The participants are parents of infants, recruited&#xD;
      before the infants receive their 2, 4, or 6- month vaccinations, who responded to the online&#xD;
      invitation and consent to participate in this study. Parents living in Canada and prior to&#xD;
      the infant receiving one of the three vaccinations were invited to participate through an&#xD;
      online recruitment process. A sample of 50 parent/infant dyads in each group of control and&#xD;
      intervention is estimated to be sufficient to achieve the study's goals. The outcome&#xD;
      measurements are being done by five brief study questionnaires; Brief information of the&#xD;
      study goals and the researchers' affiliation followed by a hyperlink to the survey were&#xD;
      posted on different online platforms. Eligible parents of infants who respond to the study&#xD;
      invitation are being randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups (Intervention and control). There&#xD;
      are two interventions in the study one being compared: 1) Be Sweet to Babies Videos and&#xD;
      Pamphlet; and 2) Be Sweet to Babies Videos, pamphlet, and MIAS&amp;Q. After the intervention, the&#xD;
      impact of the vaccination pain management video and brochure followed by MIAS&amp;Q questions are&#xD;
      being evaluated by a brief online survey exploring the use of pain management (breastfeeding&#xD;
      or sucrose and upright secure holding) during infants' vaccination in both groups. Following&#xD;
      that, the opinion of parents about the understandability, applicability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      acceptability of this study are evaluated. All data are being collected electronically using&#xD;
      REDCap survey tool. SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) will be used to perform&#xD;
      all descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. NVivo version 11.0 (Qualitative data&#xD;
      analysis Software; QSR International Pty Ltd) will be used for content analysis and&#xD;
      descriptive statistical analysis and thematic analysis will be used for the analysis of the&#xD;
      qualitative data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Early childhood vaccination is the most important public health intervention to protect&#xD;
      against life-threatening infectious diseases worldwide. However, vaccinations are painful and&#xD;
      result in distress and anxiety for infants and, in many cases, their parents. If vaccination&#xD;
      pain is not addressed, this pain can lead to subsequent non-adherence with vaccination&#xD;
      schedules, fears of needles and avoidance of health care. Clinical practice guidelines and&#xD;
      high-quality synthesized evidence shows that breastfeeding, sucrose, and upright secure&#xD;
      holding effectively reduce pain during vaccination in infants. Despite the evidence, these&#xD;
      strategies are not consistently used in practice highlighting an important gap in translating&#xD;
      this knowledge into practice. Aims. The overall aim of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, preliminary effectiveness and sustainability of parent-targeted&#xD;
      interventions for pain management during vaccination of infants. To achieve the goal, a&#xD;
      two-phase pilot randomized control trial is planned. Study one, currently in the data&#xD;
      collection phase, aims i) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of data collection&#xD;
      tools, participants' recruitment procedures and implementation process of parent-targeted&#xD;
      interventions prior to infant vaccination at two, four, or six months. ii) to evaluate the&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness of parent-targeted interventions prior to infant vaccination in&#xD;
      promoting the use of pain management strategies during vaccinations of infants at two, four,&#xD;
      or six months. iii) to identify the parent's knowledge, use, intention and recommendation to&#xD;
      use the recommended pain management strategies, and facilitators and barriers influencing the&#xD;
      implementation of the parent-targeted interventions during vaccinations of infants at two,&#xD;
      four, or six months. Methods. This study is a prospective multi-faceted two-armed pilot&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT). a pilot randomized control trial. The participants are&#xD;
      parents of infants, recruited before the infants receive their 2, 4, or 6- month&#xD;
      vaccinations, who responded to the online invitation and consent to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Parents living in Canada and prior to the infant receiving one of the three&#xD;
      vaccinations were invited to participate through an online recruitment process. Parents were&#xD;
      eligible if they have an infant scheduled to receive their 2, 4, or 6-month routine&#xD;
      vaccination as per the childhood immunization schedule of the province the parents are living&#xD;
      in, and they read, speak and understand English sufficiently to understand the videos and&#xD;
      complete the surveys. A sample of 50 parent/infant dyads in each group of control and&#xD;
      intervention is estimated to be sufficient to achieve the study's goals. The outcome&#xD;
      measurements are being done by five brief study questionnaires; Baseline demographic&#xD;
      questionnaire, Baseline knowledge questionnaire, Knowledge utilization questionnaire,&#xD;
      Acceptability, and feasibility questionnaire. All recruited parents of infants before their&#xD;
      2, 4, or 6-month vaccination were invited to take part in a baseline survey, aimed to assess&#xD;
      current awareness, previous use and future intent to use one of the recommended pain care&#xD;
      strategies (breastfeeding, sucrose/other sweet solutions and holding). Different methods were&#xD;
      taken for online recruiting of the participants. Brief information of the study goals and the&#xD;
      researchers' affiliation followed by a hyperlink to the survey were posted on different&#xD;
      online platforms. When participants clicked on the survey link, they were directed to a&#xD;
      REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the respondents are not eligible, a brief message containing a thank-you note and&#xD;
      explanation about their in-eligibility to continue the study was sent to them. However, if&#xD;
      they meet the listed screening criteria, they are directed to the next page which is the&#xD;
      study's consent form. They are invited to read the forms and provide online informed consent&#xD;
      to participate in this study. They are then being directed to the next page which is the&#xD;
      demographic questionnaires. A hyperlink directs participants to a brief survey asking&#xD;
      questions about previous awareness and intention to use specified recommended pain management&#xD;
      strategies in their infants' future immunization episodes. In addition, they were asked to&#xD;
      provide an email address to be contacted for the following steps of the study. Eligible&#xD;
      parents of infants who respond to the study invitation are being randomly allocated to 1 of 2&#xD;
      groups (Intervention and control) in a 1:1 ratio before the infants' 2, 4, or 6-months&#xD;
      vaccination. Participants were stratified according to the infant's age of receiving the&#xD;
      vaccine (two, four, or six months). There are two interventions in the study one being&#xD;
      compared: 1) Be Sweet to Babies Videos and Pamphlet; and 2) Be Sweet to Babies Videos,&#xD;
      pamphlet, and MIAS&amp;Q. The Be Sweet to Babies vaccination pain management videos and pamphlet&#xD;
      are provided to all participants. Those in the intervention arm is also be given MIAS&amp;Q. Be&#xD;
      Sweet to Babies vaccination pain management videos showing parents how to use breastfeeding,&#xD;
      upright secure holding, and a small volume of the sweet solution during vaccination, are&#xD;
      used. In addition, the pamphlet is a knowledge translation tool developed in partnership with&#xD;
      the Children Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) and Ottawa Public Health. MIAS&amp;Q includes&#xD;
      five questions and statements based on MI approach consists of four scaled questions and two&#xD;
      open-ended questions, aimed to present brief informative and affirmative questions and&#xD;
      statements. After the intervention, the impact of the vaccination pain management video and&#xD;
      brochure followed by MIAS&amp;Q questions are being evaluated by a brief online survey exploring&#xD;
      the use of pain management (breastfeeding or sucrose and upright secure holding) during&#xD;
      infants' vaccination in both groups. Following that, the opinion of parents about the&#xD;
      understandability, applicability, feasibility, and acceptability of this study are evaluated.&#xD;
      All data are being collected electronically using REDCap survey tool. SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS&#xD;
      Inc, Chicago, Illinois) will be used to perform all descriptive and inferential statistical&#xD;
      analyses. NVivo version 11.0 (Qualitative data analysis Software; QSR International Pty Ltd)&#xD;
