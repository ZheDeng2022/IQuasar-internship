    <textblock>
      The study TAULÍ-PREVINQ-WARM will assess the rate of perioperative hypothermia in patients&#xD;
      submitted to major surgical procedures at the operating room main area (and at the ambulatory&#xD;
      surgery building for ophthalmologic major procedures) of the Parc Taulí, Hospital&#xD;
      Universitari, Sabadell, Barcelona.&#xD;

      Treatment plan The month before the start of the study, investigators will double check with&#xD;
      the administrative personnel the potential candidates to be included in to the study.&#xD;
      Furthermore, investigators will meet with the responsible of each surgical specialty to&#xD;
      delineate the adequate staff workload and collaborators needs. To assure the best study&#xD;
      performance and to avoid selection patient bias, patients will be consecutively included in&#xD;
      blocs of each designated surgical specialty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the patient admission area and surgical preparation, associated investigators will inform&#xD;
      to candidates and relatives about the project giving the informed form to be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient inclusion will include a pilot phase (four to five patients) to teach collaborators&#xD;
      regarding the correct placement of cutaneous sensor, data lecture and registration to the&#xD;
      database. Along with the maintenance department of the hospital, we also assess the correct&#xD;
      installation and function of temperature and humidity sensors at the OR (Mini-datalogger&#xD;
      174H, Instrumentos Testo, S.A. Cabrils, Barcelona). OR temperature and the degree of humidity&#xD;
      will be measured at the specific time points stated at the paragraph of the measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body temperature (BT) measurements will be performed at the UPQ, anesthesia preparation room,&#xD;
      OR and URPA in those specifically stated time points (Annex 2 and Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the investigators want to perform a pragmatic study, patients will receive&#xD;
      conventional normothermia preventive measures following the approved local guidelines from&#xD;
      the Anesthesiology Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement and data entry Body temperature (BT) Patient's BT will be assessed with the&#xD;
      SpotOn system that encompasses the registration unit (3M SpotOn Control Unit), disposable&#xD;
      sensor (3M SpotOn Control Sensor) along with the cords and electric power unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive digital BT system monitorization SpotOn, includes a sensor that by adhering to&#xD;
      the lateral side of supra-ocular region, allows for continued registration of BT for the&#xD;
      overall surgical process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of times and sites of BT registration Staff devoted to assess BT measurements. Staff&#xD;
      from 3M, will advise nurses, anesthesiologists and investigators regarding SpotOn&#xD;
      specifications and management at the beginning of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because OR temperature and degree of humidity may have some influence on patient's BT and&#xD;
      thermic comfort both patients and OR staff, OR temperature and humidity will be registered at&#xD;
      the beginning and at the end of surgical procedure. Also, the protocol will take in to the&#xD;
      account weather conditions registered at the MeteoCat and will be included at the data base&#xD;
      regularly. Also, staff from Maintenance of Hospital Facilities and Equipment, will set up and&#xD;
      store data from the OR temperature and humidity sensors (Mini-datalogger 174H, Instrumentos&#xD;
      Testo, S.A. Cabrils, Barcelona).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about measures addressed to sustain perioperative normothermia will also be recorded&#xD;
      (see Annex 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgical procedure the investigators will ask patients and OR staff for running&#xD;
      a visual analogic scale punctuation (1 to 10) regarding the perceived thermal comfort (see&#xD;
      Annex 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of the study and period of patients recruitment. Because the specific nature of this&#xD;
      prospective observational and pragmatic study, the rate of patients recruitment will be&#xD;
      assessed frequently to accommodate both optimal patient accrual and fair and adequate entry&#xD;
      data. The approximate time for total patients inclusion will be of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The main objective of the study TAULI-PREVINQ-WARM is to assess the rate of&#xD;
      perioperative hypothermia (&lt;36ªC) at some point during the surgical process in patients&#xD;
      operated on for a major surgical procedure at the Parc Tauli, Hospital Universitari,&#xD;
      Sabadell. Then, sample size has been calculated taking in to the account that roughly 50% of&#xD;
      patients will have some kind of hypothermia with 10% of variability of 95% CI. Assuming a10%&#xD;
      of repository additional patients, 110 patients will be included overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of data results and statistical analysis. The TAULI-PREVINQ-WARM is a pragmatic&#xD;
      study that wants to assess body temperature in surgical patients under regular clinical&#xD;
      conditions. We will perform a descriptive analysis of data by depicting mainly frequency&#xD;
      distribution analysis of the qualitative main variable, HypoTer. The proposed sample size&#xD;
      will allow also for assessing the rate HypoTer at each different surgical areas where&#xD;
      patients are admitted. Also, repeated measures will be compared among different surgical&#xD;
      procedures at the OR taking in to consideration the body surface area under regular&#xD;
      preventive normothermia measures, following the general lineal model. Univariate two-sided&#xD;
      analysis will be perform for all comparisons and parametric or non-parametric analysis will&#xD;
      be performed accordingly. Multivariate analysis might eventually be performed depending of&#xD;
      the rate of events.&#xD;
