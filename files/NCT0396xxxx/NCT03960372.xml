  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing use of information and communication technology (ICT), family information&#xD;
      can be easily accessed. Family information seeking was found to be associated with higher&#xD;
      levels of family well-being. Alongside the growth in popularity of ICTs and its role in&#xD;
      promoting family well-being, there is also a growing appreciation that ICTs such as&#xD;
      internet-enabled devices and web-based applications can offer many advantages compared to&#xD;
      traditional face-to-face approaches when delivering behaviour change programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increasing use of ICT and its potential advantages in public education, ICTs emerge&#xD;
      as new strategies of high impact service delivery in different community public education&#xD;
      activities, including community events and workshops. Although ICT use is common in daily&#xD;
      practice, the application of ICT in implementing public education activities is not common,&#xD;
      especially in activities that promote family well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SMART Family-Link Project is to use ICT in public education activities to promote family&#xD;
      communication, sharing happiness with family members, and well-being in the community. The&#xD;
      public education activities include community public education events and community public&#xD;
      education workshops. The present study aims to assess participants' satisfaction toward the&#xD;
      public education activities, the efficiency in activities implementation, and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of public education activities. Feedback from participants will be collected by&#xD;
      questionnaire survey and interviews. Participants' engagement and response will be observed&#xD;
      by observers and video and/or photo-taking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The last few decades have seen a dramatic rise in the use of information and communications&#xD;
      technology (ICT) and Internet access. According to the World Bank, 1.33 per cent of&#xD;
      individuals in the world were using the Internet in 1996; in 2006, this figure rose to 17.58&#xD;
      %; by 2016, 45.91 % of individuals were using the Internet. Concurrently, there has been a&#xD;
      dramatic rise in the number of mobile cellular subscriptions across the globe in the last two&#xD;
      decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the global trend, Hong Kong had 18.25 million mobile service subscribers in&#xD;
      2016. The Hong Kong Family and Health Information Trends Survey (FHinTs) under the FAMILY&#xD;
      Project was conducted to monitor opinions and behaviours regarding family health, information&#xD;
      use, and health communications. The investigator's results showed that ICT platforms such as&#xD;
      online websites, social media, and instant messages are widely used in Hong Kong. In FHinTs&#xD;
      2016 survey, 82.6% of the respondents had smartphones, and 48.8% had tablets. Similar&#xD;
      findings from the Nielsen Media Index 2017 year-end report showed that 97% of all internet&#xD;
      users in Hong Kong were using smartphones to access the internet. The amount of time spent&#xD;
      online each day was 3.2 hours and 94% of people aged 12 to 64 were using the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the increasing use of ICT, family information can be easily accessed. According to the&#xD;
      findings from FHinTs 2016, ICT was increasingly used as a method of family information&#xD;
      seeking: 66.7% of respondents sought family information from online websites, compared with&#xD;
      53.6% in 2009. About 30.9% sought family information from social media such as Facebook, and&#xD;
      22.8% sought family information from instant messaging platforms such as WhatApp. Family&#xD;
      information such as recreation (46.6%), family heath (22.9%) and elderly-related topics&#xD;
      (17.9%) were most commonly sought. Also, family information seeking was associated with&#xD;
      higher levels of family health, happiness, harmony, and overall family well-being. The&#xD;
      associations were observed regardless of the type of sharing methods, such as face-to-face&#xD;
      sharing or sharing via ICT means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside the growth in popularity of ICTs and its role in promoting family well-being, there&#xD;
      is also a growing appreciation that ICTs such as internet-enabled devices and web-based&#xD;
      applications can offer many advantages compared to traditional face-to-face approaches when&#xD;
      delivering behaviour change programmes. One of the biggest challenges that face-to-face&#xD;
      intervention programmes face is diminishing reach and impact due to barriers to&#xD;
      accessibility, cost-efficiency, flexibility to adapt to individuals, and structured&#xD;
      intervention integrity. Using ICTs can address these barriers and may thus contribute to&#xD;
      improving reach. ICT also helps facilitate access to interventions from a large variety of&#xD;
      settings at all times, bringing the intervention to participants at times convenient to them&#xD;
      and diminishing the influence of the situational constraints on intervention participation&#xD;
      rates. The rise of ICT has created promising and potential new avenues and demand for&#xD;
      implementing interventions related to mental health and parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increasing use of ICT and its potential advantages in public education, ICTs emerge&#xD;
      as new strategies of high impact service delivery in different community public education&#xD;
      activities, including community events and workshops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to evaluate participants' satisfaction to the activities and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of ICT-related activities to enhance family communication, relationship and&#xD;
      happiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A process evaluation will be performed to evaluate the process of each component of the&#xD;
      program. Qualitative and quantitative assessments will be used to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the activities.&#xD;
