    <textblock>
      This study explores the effect of probiotic administration to decrease colonization by&#xD;
      Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in at-risk populations. Colonized patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive probiotics or placebo for 14 days and reevaluated for colonization&#xD;
      in follow up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of antibiotics is known to have significant effects on the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
      Studies have linked this alteration with the risk of colonization and / or infection by&#xD;
      Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and / or Clostridium difficile (Cd). The impact&#xD;
      of these microorganisms has been demonstrated, with mortality rates in inpatients of around&#xD;
      30-50% for patients infected with CRE and 10% in Cd. It is necessary to implement mechanisms&#xD;
      to contain dissemination and decrease colonization, in order to prevent infections caused by&#xD;
      such agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are foods consisting of live microorganisms and could restore the balance of the&#xD;
      microbiota and avoid colonization by multi-resistant germs. Systematic reviews have shown a&#xD;
      protective effect of probiotics for Cd. Studies on the effect on CRE are scarce and have been&#xD;
      related mostly to prevention of colonization. Among the probiotics obtained by bacterial&#xD;
      fermentation technology and already available in pharmacopoeia we have Bioflora ®. The&#xD;
      objective of this trial is to explore the effect of probiotic consumption to decrease the&#xD;
      duration of the colonization by CRE by comparing the percentage of patients colonized with&#xD;
      CRE after the administration of probiotics and in the untreated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Randomized clinical trial, single center. Known CRE colonized patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to consume probiotics for 14 days or placebo. Then the colonization will be&#xD;
      evaluated by means of anal swabs as indicated by the hospital standards with a follow up of&#xD;
      12 weeks from the initial intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is discharged, home follow-up will be scheduled to supervise the intake of the&#xD;
      dietary supplement and the control swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected impact is to accelerate the process of decolonization of multi-resistant germs&#xD;
      through the administration of probiotics leading to a shorter contact isolation time in and&#xD;
      reducing the risk of complications in CRE colonized patients.&#xD;

It will be considered negative when the patient as three consecutive negative swabs separated by a week. It will be persistently positive when during this period of follow-up at least one of the swabs is positive, total follow-up 12 weeks</description>

If the patient has diarrhea with a positive Cd toxin and is receiving probiotic he/she should leave the study and the data for CRE will be evaluated with the last available swab at the time of the exit event (positive for clostridium difficile diarrhea).</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to active arm, will consume 5ml every 12 hours per day of a suspension of probiotics (Bioflora ® Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus faecalis y Bifidobacterium brevis) for 14 days.The content of each bottle is reconstituted up to 50 ml (10 doses) with drinking water The prescription of the intervention will be carried out and monitored through the electronic medical record. In the hospital setting, the probiotic is reconstituted by the nursing staff. If the patient is discharged before this period the patient and family will be instructed to perform the reconstitution at home.</description>
