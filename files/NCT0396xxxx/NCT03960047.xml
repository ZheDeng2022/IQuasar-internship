  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle pedestrian injury is a critical issue for school children.1-4 Each year in the&#xD;
      US, over 4900 pedestrians are killed and another 207,000 are injured, and about 25% of these&#xD;
      pedestrian events involve school-age children. This research focuses on 7-8 year olds, who&#xD;
      constitute a high-risk group for pedestrian injury. At these ages children regularly cross&#xD;
      streets without supervision and they struggle both with selecting where to cross and&#xD;
      determining how to cross. Research has shown, however, that children are capable of&#xD;
      benefiting from effective behavioral training in pedestrian behavior. The proposed research&#xD;
      addresses the issue of crossing skills deficits and will: (1) implement a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) to test two alternative training programs to teach 7-8 year-olds where&#xD;
      and how to cross streets safely; and (2) conduct an economic analysis to reveal cost:benefit&#xD;
      indices for both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analyses of pedestrian training programs reveal that behavioral training in a traffic&#xD;
      environment most reliably produces some degree of improvement in crossing skills. Thus,&#xD;
      'street-side training' is often described as the gold standard. Implementation, however,&#xD;
      poses many practical problems related to implementation. The investigators have addressed&#xD;
      this issue by developing a training system that uses a virtual pedestrian environment and&#xD;
      extends past VR systems by having children fully cross the street and offering the unique&#xD;
      capability of teaching both where and how to cross, with skills in each domain measured&#xD;
      separately so exactly what is learned and what component crossing behaviors improved can be&#xD;
      precisely determined for each individual child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children (7-8 years) will be randomized to one of three groups (balanced for sex):&#xD;
      street-side training, virtual-reality training, and a no-intervention control, with the same&#xD;
      pre- and post- measures taken across groups. Primary analyses will test for changes in&#xD;
      indices of where and how to cross, as well as attention to traffic when crossing. An economic&#xD;
      analysis of the two programs will reveal their relative cost effectiveness. These results&#xD;
      will provide essential knowledge to inform future decisions about 'best practices' in child&#xD;
      pedestrian injury prevention through behavioral training.&#xD;

      APPROACH&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RESEARCH GOALS. The specific goals are: (1) conduct a RCT with 7-8 year olds to evaluate&#xD;
           the relative effectiveness of 2 training programs (Virtual Reality, Street Side),&#xD;
           compared to a no-intervention control, with a focus in training on where and how to&#xD;
           cross. (2) Conduct an economic analysis of the programs to ascertain their relative cost&#xD;
           effectiveness. These results will provide essential knowledge on relative program&#xD;
           effectiveness and economic costs to inform future decisions about 'best practices' in&#xD;
           child pedestrian injury prevention through behavioral training&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN: 3 Groups Recruited children will receive the pre-tests and then be&#xD;
           randomly assigned to one of three groups (2 Intervention, 1 Control), using a block&#xD;
           (sex) randomization procedure so Intervention groups (VR training or VR-T, Street Side&#xD;
           training or SS-T) and the no intervention Control group (No Intervention: NI-C) are&#xD;
           balanced for sex of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS Does performance in VR-T exceed that in NI-C? Does performance in&#xD;
           SS-T exceed that in NI-C? Is performance equivalent in VR-T vs SS-T or does one produce&#xD;
           better outcomes and qualify as best practice? Do any immediate gains persist over time&#xD;
           (2 months post-intervention)? What is the cost-effectiveness of VR-T compared to SS-T?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. POWER ANALYSIS All calculations were performed by a consulting statistician (Dr. Gerarda&#xD;
           Darlington) using a function written in R version 3.3.2 based on a formula provided by&#xD;
           Julious and using the pwr.anova.test function from the pwr package in R. Results from&#xD;
           the pilot feasibility study were used to estimate mean changes for where and how to&#xD;
           cross: after VR-T, children crossed in unsafe locations 65% fewer times and there was a&#xD;
           68% increase in how to cross safely, with both variables being normally distributed.&#xD;
           With a within-group standard deviation of 0.16 (pilot data) and a sample size of 58&#xD;
           children per group, we would have over 80% power to confirm equivalence between the VR-T&#xD;
           and SS-T groups, assuming no observed difference in change scores between the groups and&#xD;
           an equivalence threshold level of 17%, with alpha=0.025. Note that the total sample size&#xD;
           would support the analyses planned, allowing for significance at p &lt; 0.0001 with power&#xD;
           greater than 95%. Allowing for 10% attrition, we will recruit 64/group (N = 192).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. SUBJECT POPULATION AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA [*see Introduction to Application please] A&#xD;
           total of 192 children 7-8 years will be recruited, with 64 assigned to each group; this&#xD;
           includes allowance for 10% attrition (usual rate=5%). Youth will be randomly sampled&#xD;
           from an existing database of 9250 community recruited volunteers, with supplemental&#xD;
           recruiting (as needed) through community organizations and advertising. Use of the&#xD;
           database increases the speed and efficiency with which we can execute the research but&#xD;
           does not change the base population-it is all a community recruited sample. Inclusion&#xD;
           Criteria: developing normally (parent report; no learning, social, physical, mental&#xD;
           health concerns), English speaking. Exclusion Criteria: self or anyone in family&#xD;
           hospitalized for injury as a pedestrian, which can lead to atypical cautiousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. RANDOMIZATION Blinding. Blinding to condition is not possible but greater bias may be&#xD;
           introduced in RCTs through inadequate allocation concealment than with blinding. All&#xD;
           participants will be blind to the study hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Allocation of participants will occur by via a computer-generated random number&#xD;
           sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. TIMING OF EVENTS AND MEASURES All children do an initial visit to complete the pre-test&#xD;
           measures and are then randomized. Then SS-T and VR-T children complete 6 weekly training&#xD;
           sessions (~30 minutes/session). All children then complete another visit for post-test&#xD;
           immediate measures, with a longer-term visit (2 months later) to evaluate sustainability&#xD;
           of any improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. SETTING Midblock crossing on two-lane bidirectional roads, without nearby traffic&#xD;
           signals or crosswalks, are the focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For SS-T sessions, a road has been identified (50 km limit) that provides opportunity&#xD;
           for training in where and how to cross in the same types of road situations to be&#xD;
           presented in VR-T. Traffic volume was recently measured for 7 days and varied from light&#xD;
           (8 cars/min) to heavy (16 cars/min). This range for traffic volume will occur in VR-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For VR-T sessions, these occur in the VR lab at UG campus. For pre and post measures,&#xD;
           for all groups these occur in two settings: (a) street side (designated as &quot;Field&quot;&#xD;
           below) with naturally varying traffic (children indicate where and how they will cross&#xD;
           but do not do so), (b) in the VR lab in which children cross the virtual street in&#xD;
           traffic using a gaming controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Note that the pre/post Field measures will be taken at two locations along the same road&#xD;
           (randomized order, with one used for pre and the other for post), which controls for&#xD;
           familiarity and minimizes risk of large variation in traffic volume between pre/post&#xD;
           measures. The road is nearby the VR lab, which allows children to complete pre-test VR&#xD;
           and Field measures during the same visit to UG; the same will occur for post-test&#xD;
           measures. Posted speed is 50 km, which means traffic conditions to be tested on are ones&#xD;
           that pose risk of severe injury at these ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. TESTING PROTOCOL Pre/Post measures for Where and How to Cross [Note that pre- and post-&#xD;
           measures are the same, and all children, regardless of group, complete all measures.&#xD;
           ***Reliability for coding street side crossing will be completed.] Field Measures. For&#xD;
           where to cross measures, the child selects the safest location to cross in 3 different&#xD;
           street side situations (parked cars, hill, blind curve). For how to cross measures: the&#xD;
           child stands 1 foot from the curb, with a pressure sensitive step plate in front of him&#xD;
           (it connects to a laptop; a clear plastic wall prevents entry into the street), and&#xD;
           completes a '2 step procedure' (based on observed traffic, take 2 steps forward,&#xD;
           corresponding to initiating a street crossing; from this we estimate crossing&#xD;
           measures.[NOTE: Street side testing is video recorded so traffic and crossing measures&#xD;
           and reliability can be computed later.] VR Measures. The same measures as for Field,&#xD;
           except completed within a virtual street environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre-Training Activities &amp; Measures VR-T. An initial Orientation and Movement-Control&#xD;
           Training Module ensures all children are practiced with using the controller to navigate&#xD;
           in the 3-D world to the same motor skill level, before starting pedestrian training. The&#xD;
           controller allows them to vary their path, direction, and speed of walking and crossing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SS-T. Children's average walking speed for crossing is determined and then, in&#xD;
           combination with video taken street side, is used to estimate crossing measures - so&#xD;
           they do not cross in traffic, but only give initiation judgements. This is a common&#xD;
           approach that has been used before.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training Programs [All program decisions were informed by pilot testing.] Each includes&#xD;
           6 training sessions of 30 minutes (2% of our pilot sample needed a break) and addresses&#xD;
           where and how to look and cross. Performance is tracked on a trial-by-trial basis, and&#xD;
           errors result in repetition of teaching trials, resulting in more training on skills&#xD;
           they lack than those they have. Difficulty level generally increases over sessions as&#xD;
           children acquire skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VR-T. Children experience trials from each of three training modules that are organized&#xD;
           logically for how one crosses: (1) deciding where to cross (component skills: identify a&#xD;
           safe place with parked cars, traffic on hills, traffic on blind curves); (2) effective&#xD;
           looking (component skills: left-right-left, always left as one enters the road); (3) how&#xD;
           to cross safely (component skills: check traffic in both directions, select larger gaps,&#xD;
           start right in when car back bumper passes). On each trial, the computer talks and&#xD;
           provides immediate feedback on performance so children know if they safely completed the&#xD;
           trial (e.g., &quot;Great job&quot;) or what they did that was unsafe and why (replays of what the&#xD;
           child did are shown and explained), and what to do instead. A component skill is tested&#xD;
           (with explanatory feedback given for failures) until the child achieves at least 80%&#xD;
           success over a minimum of 5 trials or completes 10 trials. The child then moves on to&#xD;
           test another skill, with failed component skills retested in a future session. Over&#xD;
           sessions, the child gets repeated training on all modules and skills, but repetition&#xD;
           focuses mostly on skills the child still needs to achieve.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SS-T. The Kerbcraft program is grounded in behavior theory (modeling, reinforcement).&#xD;
           The program includes where and how content and is organized similarly to VR-T (modules,&#xD;
           teach component skills, immediate feedback). Over sessions, children get training on all&#xD;
           modules and skills, with repetition focusing on weaker skills. Testers (RA, students)&#xD;
           will follow a detailed manual that outlines program delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Behavior Measures. [All have been used in prior research.] Pre&#xD;
           and Post measures are taken in two settings (VR lab and Field street side). In each&#xD;
           setting, children complete 15 where trials (they indicate where to cross, but do not do&#xD;
           so) and 15 how trials (they decide about crossing in traffic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where. One score: average proportion of 15 trials the child chose the safe option for when&#xD;
      crossing on a hill (5 trials), with blind curves (5 trials), with parked cars (5 trials).&#xD;
      These 3 component scores will also be analysed separately (see Secondary Analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      How. Three scores: (1) Attention composite (proportion of 15 trials they looked correctly:&#xD;
      L/R/L, always L just before they step into road for VR-T or would have for SS-T); (2) Start&#xD;
      Delay (time in seconds between rear bumper of car passing and beginning of starting across);&#xD;
      (3) Inter-vehicle Temporal Gap Size selected (in sec).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequence. Two scores (from how trials): (1) average Time Left to Spare (i.e., how close&#xD;
      the car came in seconds); (2) composite of proportion of Near Miss (car passed within 1 sec&#xD;
      of child) and Hit trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic Measures The key outcome is hits, as this would result in economic burden of injury.&#xD;
      First, the actual cost of implementing the two training programs (personnel, equipment, etc.)&#xD;
      will be determined. Then a decision analytic model will be developed to compare each program&#xD;
      to the no-intervention group. The model will take a societal perspective, including both&#xD;
      government payer (direct hospital and non-hospital costs: ER visits, community physician&#xD;
      visits, etc.) and individual/ family out of pocket costs (e.g., out of hospital drugs, home&#xD;
      care services, lost productivity). A lifetime time horizon will be used, noting that some&#xD;
      injuries are severe and will have a long-term impact on morbidity and quality of life.&#xD;
      Probabilistic sensitivity analysis will assess the robustness of the model. Cost data will be&#xD;
      captured from relevant administrative databases; where data are missing, relevant literature&#xD;
      and/or expert opinion will be used to estimate costs.&#xD;
