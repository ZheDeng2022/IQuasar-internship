  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effects of a diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids&#xD;
      (UFA)-also known as 'healthy fats'-in patients with obesity and heart failure with preserved&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFpEF) on dietary consumption of UFA as well as fatty acids plasma levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate participant's food consumption during 2 different 12-week periods.&#xD;
      During one of the 12-week periods, participants will receive specific counseling and&#xD;
      instructions on how to increase the consumption of food rich in healthy fats; during the&#xD;
      other 12-week period they will receive general dietary recommendations following the Dietary&#xD;
      Guidelines for Americans. There will be a 6-week break (washout) between the 12-week periods&#xD;
      for a total of study period of 30 weeks. During each 12-week periods, the study will measure&#xD;
      the effects of these dietary recommendations on dietary consumption and the fatty acids in&#xD;
      their blood (primary endpoints).&#xD;

    <description>The face-to-face intervention will be performed by a research nutritionist that reviews the dietary recall and provides a list of commonly available foods rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), together with individual instructions on how to integrate the recommended foods in the daily dietary pattern based on the dietary recall, and also to emphasize that the recommended food should be consumed as listed, and not as part of processed food (i.e., guacamole for avocado, hazelnut chocolate for nuts, pesto for olive oil, fish sticks for fatty fish). Extra-virgin olive oil or canola oil or nuts will be considered first choice for daily consumption of UFA-rich food, but a list of daily food substitutes will be also provided .</description>
