      Background : The NOVEOS® method is a chemiluminescent immunoassay used to provide&#xD;
      quantitative detection of total IgE and allergen-specific IgE antibodies in human serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IgE antibody assay has an essential place in the diagnosis of mediated IgE allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This system could become an alternative to the techniques used today. NOVEOS® uses a quick&#xD;
      and convenient method to give results concerning the patient's sensitization profile towards&#xD;
      allergens. The volume required for the assays is 4 μl (against more than 100 μl for current&#xD;
      techniques), which is particularly important in pediatric and geriatric populations where it&#xD;
      may be more difficult to take larger samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOVEOS® also brings true autonomy. In fact, the incorporated reagents provide sufficient&#xD;
      capacity for 8 hours of continuous testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Validate the NOVEOS® system as an allergy diagnostic tool, by estimating the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the NOVEOS® assays compared to the gold standard diagnostic&#xD;
      represented by the clinical history and PT positive, for a panel of 20 allergens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a validation study of a new immunoassay method (Système NOVEOS®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A preliminary phase to familiarize the team with the use of the NOVEOS® system. It is&#xD;
           planned to analyze its technical characteristics: the precision, the sensitivity. Eight&#xD;
           allergens will be tested, on a cohort of 136 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A validation study of the technique as a diagnostic tool for allergy (sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity compared to the gold standard represented by clinical history and positive&#xD;
           PT) and comparison between the new technique and the ImmunoCap® system. Twenty allergens&#xD;
           will be tested prospectively, each on 50 cases and 10 controls. A single patient may be&#xD;
           both a case for an allergen and a witness for another. For rare allergies, the blood&#xD;
           database of the Allergy Service will be used, and affected patients will be contacted to&#xD;
           request their non-opposition.&#xD;

    <description>In order to validate the NOVEOS® system as an allergy diagnostic tool, We have to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the NOVEOS® assays compared to the gold standard diagnostic represented by the clinical history and Prick Test positive, for a panel of 20 allergens.</description>

    <description>The serum-specific IgE assay is an in vitro assay of IgE antibodies that are able to bind specifically to their allergen.&#xD;
Today, there are techniques that allow the assay of both the IgE reactivity against sources of allergens, but also against the different allergenic components.&#xD;
The results of the NOVEOS® method will be considered acceptable according to the following criteria:&#xD;
Total agreement ratio of sample recovery ≥ 0.8&#xD;
Linear Regression / Correlation between the 2 techniques, R ≥ 0.8</description>
