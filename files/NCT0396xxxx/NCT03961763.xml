  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that high-dose intake of long-chain n-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids have a favorable role in altering blood TG and non-HDL cholesterol when combined with&#xD;
      statins in hyperlipidemic patients. Their efficacy in altering low density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol particle size and concentration is yet to be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the effects of adding 4/day eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) +&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to stable statin therapy on blood TG, non-HDL, LDL-C as well as&#xD;
      small dense (sdLDL) particle concentration in a group of hyperlipidemic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel group study, 44 subjects who&#xD;
      were already on statin therapy for &gt; 8 weeks and had non-HDL-C levels above the National&#xD;
      Lipid Association Recommendations were randomized into two groups. For 8 weeks, together with&#xD;
      their prescribed atorvastatin, the intervention group received 4g/day EPA+DHA (in ethyl ester&#xD;
      form) while the control group received 4g/day olive oil (placebo). Baseline measurements of&#xD;
      non-HDL-C, TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C and sdLDL were repeated at week 8. Differences in&#xD;
      dietary intake were assessed with a weighed 3-day food diary at week 4. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are the percent change in non-HDL-C and sdLDL particle concentration from baseline&#xD;
      to the end.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a parallel randomised, double-blind placebo - controlled trial which was&#xD;
      conducted in Istanbul, Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been, and still is the number 1 cause of deaths all over the&#xD;
      world. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 1 of every 3 death was caused by CVD&#xD;
      in 2012. Heart disease and stroke were the No. 1 and No. 2 killers worldwide, according to&#xD;
      American Heart Association. In Turkey, it is even worse, 40% of all deaths were caused by&#xD;
      CVD. Such high prevalence naturally brings a huge disease burden and in many countries there&#xD;
      are ongoing research to mitigate CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential to highlight that CVD is not a single disease, it is actually a family of&#xD;
      diseases that mostly cause by a common pathology named &quot;atherosclerosis&quot;. Atherosclerosis is&#xD;
      plaque formation in artery walls which leads a reduced lumen diameter, causing organ damage&#xD;
      or clinical events like myocardial infarction (MI), angina or stroke. One of the two reasons&#xD;
      of atherosclerosis is hyperlipidemia, which is the theme of this study. Atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      lipids are evident to be related; the elevations in circulating LDL cholesterol level plays a&#xD;
      central role in atherogenesis, given the fact that they cause the formation of fatty plaque.&#xD;
      Therefore, in all clinical guidelines, LDL level is the primary target to prevent&#xD;
      atherosclerosis.However, more recent studies have revealed that LDL is structurally&#xD;
      heterogeneous based on its size and density. There are large, buoyant LDL particles and&#xD;
      small, dense LDL particles, which are believed to be more atherogenic. Individuals that have&#xD;
      a large amount of small and dense LDL particles are at an increased risk of CV events,&#xD;
      regardless of their total LDL level. In studies, small and dense LDL profile was associated&#xD;
      with a three-fold to seven-fold increase in risk of CVD as they:1- Have the increased ability&#xD;
      to penetrate arterial wall. 2- Are readily oxidized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main therapeutic approach to treat small&amp;dense LDL is using drugs that lower serum&#xD;
      triglyceride (TG) levels, as they also cause a change in the LDL size profile to larger, less&#xD;
      dense and, therefore, less atherogenic species. Most commonly used such drugs are statins.&#xD;
      Apart from statins, there is strong evidence that omega-3 fatty acids also have a beneficial&#xD;
      effect in lowering TGs. However, their effect on small, dense LDL has not been studied enough&#xD;
      yet. If omega-3 fatty acids have a beneficial effect in changing LDL profile to less dense&#xD;
      and larger particles, omega-3 supplementation will be quite effective for patients with&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia. Given the fact that statin use is the gold standard in all clinical&#xD;
      guidelines, this study will not compare statins with omega-3 fatty acids and instead, compare&#xD;
      statin monotherapy to the combined use of statin and omega-3 supplements to investigate&#xD;
      whether omega-3 fatty acids have a supportive role to statin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants were men or women from Istanbul, Turkey, aged between 50 and 79 years&#xD;
      who had been receiving a stable dose of atorvastatin for the control of LDL-C levels at least&#xD;
      for 8 weeks before initial screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients were selected for initial screening and 44 matched the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized to the intervention using&#xD;
      www.randomization.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were informed informally via telephone first, and then invited to the Clinic by&#xD;
      a Patient Invitation Letter. A structured one-to-one information session was carried out with&#xD;
      each participant at the Clinic, during which they were given a Participant Information Sheet.&#xD;
      Participants provided written informed consent by signing the a Participant Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE-SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total sample size was 44, consisting of two 22-subject groups (control and intervention&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A targeted sample size of 36 subjects (18 per arm) was expected to provide at least 80% power&#xD;
      to detect a difference of 5% or above in primary outcome non-HDL-C and LDL-C III particle&#xD;
      concentration when compared with placebo (α=0.05) . Sample size was assigned as 44 to allow&#xD;
      for subject attrition and other potential causes of study withdrawal up to 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculation was based on the mean changes in non-HDL-C measurement of the previous&#xD;
      COMBOS trial which is a largest randomized placebo controlled trial that has the same design&#xD;
      with this study. Data from COMBOS trial is summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      baseline non-HDL mean + standard deviation (SD): 135.8 mg/dL + 24.5 mg/dL final non-HDL mean&#xD;
      + SD: 124.1 mg/dL + 24.7 mg/dL Percent change: -7.9%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      baseline non-HDL mean +SD: 141.3 mg/dL + 29.3 mg/dL final non-HDL mean + SD: 138.8 mg/dL +&#xD;
      32.0 mg/dL Percent change: -1.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel groups study was carried out. Before&#xD;
      entry into the intervention phase of the study, 8-weeks of dietary lead-in was carried out.&#xD;
      Study participants received dietary counselling for the 8 weeks before the intervention,&#xD;
      based on the heart-healthy diet structured in the United Kingdom (UK) National Institute of&#xD;
      Health Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (2014) and were instructed to maintain this diet&#xD;
      throughout the study. Adherence to dietary advice was also measured by a 3-day weighed intake&#xD;
      food diary at Week 4. Household measures were used to assess the food intake. Nutrient&#xD;
      content of the diet was estimated using Nutritics software (Nutritics Ltd, Ireland) using UK:&#xD;
      Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) 2015 food composition tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the dietary lead-in, baseline measurements of fasting blood Triglycerides (TG), Total&#xD;
      Cholesterol (TC), High-density Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Low-density Lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDL-C), and LDL-C sub groups (LDL-C I, LDL-C II, LDL-C III, LDL-C IV, LDL-C V)&#xD;
      were carried out for all subjects at 2 clinics separated by 1 week, and the means were used&#xD;
      as baseline values. Non-High-density Lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) was calculated by&#xD;
      subtracting HDL-C from TC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline measurements, all participants were randomized in equal numbers to receive&#xD;
      either 4g/day EPA (75%) &amp; DHA (25%) ethyl esters or 4g/day olive oil (placebo) for 8 weeks in&#xD;
      combination with the same dose of atorvastatin they had been prescribed. For all subjects,&#xD;
      atorvastatin dosage was kept constant throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups consumed four 1000mg capsules orally 4 times daily and compliance was measured by&#xD;
      the number of capsules consumed relative to the number estimated to be consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measurements were repeated at the end of week 8. Study participants and&#xD;
      investigators remained blinded to all laboratory results until completion of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analyses were performed by e-Lab Laboratories (Istanbul, Turkey) on the serum or&#xD;
      plasma of 12 hours fasting blood samples. LDL-C, VLDL-C and HDL-C was measured with&#xD;
      homogeneous enzymatic colorimetric assay of Roche Diagnostics (USA). TG and TC was measured&#xD;
      with enzymatic colorimetric assay of Roche Diagnostics (USA). LDL-C subgroups were analyzed&#xD;
      with electrophoresis by Lipoprint (Quantimetrix, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses was be performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)&#xD;
      version 24 (IBM, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and baseline analysis was performed for all study participants, while efficacy&#xD;
      analysis was performed only on subjects that successfully completed the 8-week study&#xD;
      protocol. The primary efficacy end points are non-HDL and LDL-C III particle concentration&#xD;
      percentage change from baseline; secondary efficacy end points are changes in TG, TC, LDL-C,&#xD;
      VLDL-C and HDL-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal distribution of the sample was checked with Shapiro-Wilk's test. Mixed model ANOVA&#xD;
      test was carried out to compare changes in outcome parameters from baseline to&#xD;
      end-of-treatment between the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired t-tests were performed to analyze the changes from baseline to Week 8 for each outcome&#xD;
      parameter, and multiple Independent t-tests were performed to analyze significant differences&#xD;
      between groups across time points. A P-value &lt; 0.05 determined statistical significance.&#xD;
