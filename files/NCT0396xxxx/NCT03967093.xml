    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of BXQ-350 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      in children and young adults with relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain&#xD;
      tumors. All patients will receive BXQ-350 by intravenous (IV) infusion. The study is divided&#xD;
      into two parts: Part 1 will enroll patients at increasing dose levels of BXQ-350 in order to&#xD;
      determine the MTD. Part 2 will use the MTD to further assess the safety of BXQ-350 as well as&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumor activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BXQ-350 is a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent configured from two components: Saposin&#xD;
      C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid&#xD;
      dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a phospholipid located on cell membranes (clinical&#xD;
      formulation BXQ-350). Given via intravenous (IV) infusion, data indicate that the agent&#xD;
      exhibits the propensity to enter the body and brain, target cells in the tumor mass, and&#xD;
      induce cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Dose Escalation and Safety - Sequential cohorts of patients 1-30 years of age with&#xD;
      relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain tumors will be treated with&#xD;
      escalating doses of BXQ-350 until the MTD is established, or in the absence of a Maximum&#xD;
      Administered Dose, the highest planned dose level is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Safety and Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity - Patients will be enrolled into one of&#xD;
      four cohorts and administered BXQ-350 at the established MTD or at the highest planned dose&#xD;
      level. The four cohorts will consist of: recurrent ependymoma, recurrent malignant brain&#xD;
      tumor, recurrent Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), and relapsed non-central nervous&#xD;
      system (non-CNS) solid tumor.&#xD;

    Bexion will not move forward with the Part 2 expansion portion of the trial in order to focus&#xD;
