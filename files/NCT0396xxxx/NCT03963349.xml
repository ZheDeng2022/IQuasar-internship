    <textblock>
      A single-center, real word study of consecutive subjects who undergo radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      for paroxysmal AF using THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH®SF (STSF) Catheter guiding by Ablation Index&#xD;
      (AI). Prospectively or retrospectively record 150 eligible subjects since 1st Jan 2019 to&#xD;
      evaluate effectiveness and safety of STSF with AI.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to measure the long term effectiveness，clinical benefit, and&#xD;
      safety outcomes of catheter ablation with STSF and AI for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      (PAF) subjects up to 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject:Up to 150 PAF subjects will be included in the study data, representing all&#xD;
      consecutive subjects having catheter ablation with AI guiding STSF and for the treatment of&#xD;
      PAF at the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint is freedom from documented atrial fibrillation (AF),&#xD;
      atrial tachycardia (AT), or atrial flutter (AFL) (≥30 seconds) within 91-365 days post index&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint : Acute success at 0.5hour CPVI (i.e. entrance block achieved in all&#xD;
      veins, verified via an isoproterenol intravenous challenge)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numbers of reconnected pulmonary veins (PV), with number and location of any gaps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedural efficiency measures（e.g. mapping time, ablation time, total procedure time,&#xD;
           and fluid volume delivered via catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AI values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inter-Tag distances&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (Complications related to device or procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-hospitalization due to arrhythmia recurrence or procedure-related reasons up to 1&#xD;
           year Clinical Study Sites: Shanghai General Hospital Study Duration: 18-month enrollment&#xD;
           period, with follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months after ablation, with a blanking period&#xD;
           defined as the period within 90 days after the ablation.&#xD;

    <description>Atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence events will be recorded and included as a study endpoint after a 90-day blanking period; recurrence during the blanking will not be considered treatment failure.
