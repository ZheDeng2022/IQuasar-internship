    <textblock>
      Mount Vernon Cancer Centre at East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust offers patients with&#xD;
      certain cancers a treatment called adaptive radiotherapy. The aim of adaptive radiotherapy is&#xD;
      to respond to physical changes that occur during treatment to ensure the radiation continues&#xD;
      to be directed at the cancer and to minimise the amount of healthy tissue treated. For&#xD;
      example, if tumour shrinkage or weight loss occurs during head and neck radiotherapy the&#xD;
      patient may have a repeat CT scan and a new radiotherapy treatment plan after a few weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. For patients with cancer of the bladder or cervix changes in bladder and uterus&#xD;
      size and position can be predicted allowing the prospective creation of three radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment plans, each day the best fitting plan, i.e. the one that closely covers the tumour&#xD;
      whilst giving minimal dose to normal tissues, is selected and used for treatment, this is&#xD;
      known as plan-of-the-day adaptive radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small changes in shape and position of the prostate occur but are generally the result of&#xD;
      rectal changes which cannot be predicted, consequently adaptive radiotherapy based on&#xD;
      physical change is not possible for prostate cancer treatments. However, recent literature&#xD;
      suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect changes within the prostate in&#xD;
      response to radiotherapy, some studies have seen changes as early as the second week of&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment. A feasibility study to investigate if these changes can support&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment plan adaption for prostate cancer treatments is proposed, whether the&#xD;
      plan can be adapted to give a higher treatment dose to any areas of the prostate that show&#xD;
      poor response to radiotherapy without increasing bowel and bladder dose is of particular&#xD;
      interest. The treatment for patients who participate in the study would not be changed but&#xD;
      the results may help to personalise and improve the treatment of future patients.&#xD;
