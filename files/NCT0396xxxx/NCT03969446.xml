      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab and how well it&#xD;
      works in combination with decitabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome that is newly-diagnosed, has come back, or does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. This trial may help doctors find the best dose of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab that can be safely given in combination with decitabine, and to determine what&#xD;
      side effects are seen with this treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with decitabine, by&#xD;
      evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose(s)/schedule (MTD) and phase 2 recommended dose(s)/&#xD;
      schedule (RP2D) of the combination for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Obtain preliminary estimate of complete remission (CR/CR with incomplete hematologic&#xD;
      recovery [CRi]) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain estimates of remission duration and survival probabilities (overall and&#xD;
      progression-free) at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore the possible association between pre-treatment PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 and&#xD;
      clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate change in PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 levels as a result of the combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore the possible association between specific T cell subsets (e.g. CD4 T regulatory&#xD;
      cells, T naive, effector and memory cells), other immunological correlatives (e.g. T-cell&#xD;
      receptor [TCR] repertoire analysis) including post-treatment changes, and clinical response&#xD;
      to combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients with AML receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days&#xD;
      1 and 22 and decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-10. Patients who achieve a CR receive&#xD;
      decitabine on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 8 cycles or 1 year from&#xD;
      start of therapy, whichever comes first, in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients with MDS receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22 and&#xD;
      decitabine over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 8 cycles or 1&#xD;
      year from start of therapy, whichever comes first, in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, then every 3 and 6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
