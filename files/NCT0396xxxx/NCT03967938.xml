  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present targeted therapy with the PARP inhibitor olaparib has become standard of care in&#xD;
      advanced platinum sensitive BRCA1/2 mutant ovarian cancer. The key in this sensitivity is the&#xD;
      loss of homologous recombination (HR) function. The current project aims to treat patients&#xD;
      with any type of cancer carrying in their germline a mutation in genes that generate such an&#xD;
      homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) or have an acquired somatic mutation in their tumor&#xD;
      with the targeted PARP inhibitor olaparib. The project would thus bring access to a targeted&#xD;
      drug matched to the genomic profile of the tumor of these patients and provide oncologists&#xD;
      with information regarding efficacy and safety of olaparib in these patients. This evidence&#xD;
      could then later lead to a more routine regulatory access.&#xD;
