      • Address the accuracy of functional MRI techniques to predict response to neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy given to local advanced breast cancer patients with correlation with pathology&#xD;
      thus allowing early chemotherapy regimen modification to increase number of patients&#xD;
      achieving pathological complete response or save patients from toxic effects of ineffective&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

      patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of patients diagnosed with of biopsy proven breast cancer (BIRAD VI ) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Inclusion criteria: patient in different age groups with local advanced breast cancer who&#xD;
      are eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast conservative surgery and in need for&#xD;
      clip placement for tumor localization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer in the world and by far the most frequent&#xD;
      cancer among women. In Egypt the incidence rate of breast cancer is 29.9/100,000 population&#xD;
      in the age group of 30-34 years with the highest population among young women. (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of breast cancer depends upon its stage. Early stages (stage I) with small sized&#xD;
      breast masses undergo breast conservative surgery (BCS) while locally advanced breast masses&#xD;
      (stage II and III) may require Preoperative administration of Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)&#xD;
      to decrease the tumor burden allowing for BCS instead of mastectomy with no significant&#xD;
      difference in disease-free survival for patients receiving breast conservation in comparison&#xD;
      to mastectomy.(2, 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR; defined as no residual tumor or a&#xD;
      minimal residual tumor on histologic analysis) post NAC demonstrate significantly longer&#xD;
      disease-free and overall survival rates(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting whether a patient will respond or not to the given chemotherapy would allow an&#xD;
      early change in chemotherapy regime or early resort to surgery saving patients from potential&#xD;
      toxic effects of chemotherapy and provide a greater chance of achieving a pCR.(5, 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging is more accurate than clinical examination in monitoring response to therapy.&#xD;
      Different imaging modalities including Digital mammography, ultrasound and MRI have been&#xD;
      incorporated in predicting tumoral response to NAC however the MRI has the upper hand due to&#xD;
      its higher sensitivity.(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing tumoral response to chemotherapy based on observing the regression in the tumor&#xD;
      size is widely accepted(7). However, changes in tumor microvasculature, cell density can&#xD;
      predate tumoral size change therefore the use of Functional MRI techniques as&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), MR spectroscopy (MRS) or Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE)&#xD;
      can be used to quantify these early histopathological changes in the tumor.(8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCE MRI was reported by multiple studies as the optimal imaging tool to determine disease&#xD;
      response, with an accuracy of approximately 91% however there is no established cutoff of&#xD;
      enhancement determining partial versus complete response.In three recent studies, the routine&#xD;
      use of DWI allowed early differentiation between responders and non-responders by at least a&#xD;
      20% increase in apparent diffusion coefficient, thereby allowing for tailoring of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Also it was reported that the addition of DWI to DCE MRI resulted in improved&#xD;
      diagnostic performance in predicting residual disease after chemotherapy.(3) 80% to 90% of&#xD;
      patients receiving NAC have a significant response rate of the primary tumor to neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. However, this significant response complicates the surgical excision because it&#xD;
      is difficult to verify accurate localization of the site of the previous tumor. Therefore the&#xD;
      use of a radiopaque marker placed in the tumor bed before administrating chemotherapy has&#xD;
      been reported as a safe and inexpensive technique that allows later on for wire guided&#xD;
      localization of the tumor bed before surgical resection (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a report on patients who underwent clip placement and preoperative chemotherapy indicated&#xD;
      that preoperative wire localization of the tumor bed would have been impossible in 35.7% of&#xD;
      patients and difficult in 21.4% of patients without the aid of the clip. Dash et al.&#xD;
      concluded that the clip placement was valuable in 57% of patients at the time of preoperative&#xD;
      needle localization(10). Edeiken and colleagues reported a similar experience with&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided implantation of metallic markers. The markers reportedly were the only&#xD;
      remaining evidence of the original tumor site in (47%) of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study conducted in M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas in 2007 aiming to&#xD;
      determine whether patients with breast cancer who received breast-conservation therapy after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy had improved outcomes if radiopaque clips were placed to mark the&#xD;
      primary tumor. The study concluded that the omission of tumor bed clips was associated with a&#xD;
      hazard ratio of 3.69 for increased local recurrence compared with patients who did have&#xD;
      radiopaque clip placement (P =.083;95% confidence interval , 0.84-16.16).(9)&#xD;
