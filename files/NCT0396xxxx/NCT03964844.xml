  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The microbiology department prospectively generates a data base of all episodes of&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in the institution, the investigators will analyse the&#xD;
      evolution of the episodes and the incidence per 10,000 days of stay of cases of diagnosed CDI&#xD;
      in the Hematological wards and the rest of the hospital during the 2006-2018 period. The&#xD;
      investigators will also compare the impact on haematological paediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to analyse the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of CDI in this&#xD;
      population, a case and control study will be conducted, reviewing the medical records of&#xD;
      patients who have had an episode of diarrhoea caused by C. difficile in an hematological&#xD;
      unit, which will be compared with non-hematological patients who have had an CDI episode&#xD;
      These patients will be selected randomly from the Microbiology Department database. The&#xD;
      sample size will be 400 patients, 200 per arm. The histories will be reviewed according to a&#xD;
      pre-established clinical protocol including epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic and&#xD;
      evolution variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study in 2019-2020 will also be conducted. The investigators will include all&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with an hematological/oncological disease or with any immunosuppressive&#xD;
      condition, who have a positive detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for at least 2 months. For each patient a protocol data will be filled&#xD;
      prospectively.&#xD;

      A retrospective case control study (2006-2018) and a prospective study 2019-2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with a hematological disease who had a detection of toxigenic&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile in the laboratory within the 2006-2018 period will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Hematological patients with a negative Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) test in&#xD;
      the same period will be included as controls, For controls, out of the number of cases within&#xD;
      that study period, 200 will be randomly selected with the aid of the Excel software, with the&#xD;
      tools randomization (RAND) and INDEX to ensure there is no bias. For each patient a protocol&#xD;
      data will be filled retrospectively including the variables listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a prospective study in 2019-2020 will also be conducted. We will include all&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with an hematological/oncological disease or with any immunosuppressive&#xD;
      condition, who have a positive detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for at least 2 months. For each patient a protocol data will be filled prospectively&#xD;
      including the variables listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the study period 2006-2018 a total of approximately 200 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prospective study 2019-2020 approximately 50 patients will be included.Data&#xD;
      collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the last 15 years, the institution has kept a prospective record of all episodes of CDI&#xD;
      diagnosed in the hospital. This record enables the investigators to assess incidence,&#xD;
      incidence density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will include age, sex, hospital department or outpatient clinic diagnosis&#xD;
      of CDI. Data regarding the underlying conditions and comorbidity factors, clinical data&#xD;
      regarding the CDI episode days of diarrhea, presence of abdominal pain, abdominal distention,&#xD;
      fever, hypotension, toxic megacolon, pseudomembranous colitis, and severity of the CDI&#xD;
      episode according to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      (ESCMID) criteria. Analytical data on the day of diagnosis will be recorded. Treatment data&#xD;
      will be recorded. Outcome will also recorded be recorded: need for intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      admission, need for surgery for CDI episode, recurrence, mortality, and CDI-associated&#xD;
      mortality (For more details please find attached the clinical protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also assess all the changes regarding different procedures, management&#xD;
      and treatments that have occurred during the study period, including all changes in the&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From January 2003 to February 2011, diagnosis of CDI was performed on all stool specimens for&#xD;
      which a clinical request for C. difficile testing was made. From March 2011 to current days,&#xD;
      diagnosis of CDI was also performed in all unformed stool specimens regardless of clinical&#xD;
      request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedure All C. difficile strains will be characterized at molecular level&#xD;
      including ribotype, as it is the most widespread method for the molecular typing of&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile. It is based on the detection of polymorphisms located in the&#xD;
      intergenic region between genes 16S and 23S RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and&#xD;
      electrophoresis on high resolution agarose gels and will be performed according to the&#xD;
      technique described by Stubss et al.[13]The resulting ribotyping profiles will be compared to&#xD;
      those of international libraries. Additionally antimicrobial susceptibility testing will be&#xD;
      performed on these strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be performed using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA).&#xD;
      Qualitative variables will appear with their frequency distribution. Quantitative variables&#xD;
      will be expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR). Groups will be compared using&#xD;
      the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the t test or Mann-Whitney test for&#xD;
      continuous variables. A multivariate logistic regression model will be used to assess&#xD;
      predictors of poor outcome of CDI. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were&#xD;
      calculated. A p value &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data from our center, for the retrospective part of the study, the total number of&#xD;
      hematological patients with CDI corresponding to the study period is approximately 200&#xD;
      patients, all of them will be studied, the sample size for controls will be of 200 patients&#xD;
      (ratio 1:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prospective study, also based in data from our center, approximately 50 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled.&#xD;
