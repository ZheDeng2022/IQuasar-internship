    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of stereotactic radiosurgery with MBG453 and&#xD;
      spartalizumab in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of&#xD;
      radiation directly to the tumor to more precisely target the cancer. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as MBG453 and spartalizumab may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery together with immunotherapy may be a better&#xD;
      treatment for GBM.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives To determine safety of MBG453 given in combination with spartalizumab and&#xD;
      SRS in patients with recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity using the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate progression-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate Radiographic Response (RANO and iRANO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate pain for patients undergoing the treatment of anti-TIM3 and anti-PD1 in&#xD;
           combination with SRS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effects of MGB453, spartalizumab and their combination with SRS on immune&#xD;
           cells in peripheral blood, including but not limited to the T cell compartments, myeloid&#xD;
           cells, and serum proteins (cytokines and other immune modulators).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the pharmacodynamic activity in tumor tissue and peripheral blood in treated&#xD;
           subjects who undergo tumor biopsies as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore potential associations between biomarker measures and anti-tumor activity by&#xD;
           analyzing markers of inflammation, immune activation, host tumor growth factors, and&#xD;
           tumor-derived proteins in the pre-treatment and on-treatment setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore characteristics of tumor immune microenvironment change after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive MBG453 and spartalizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes each on Day 1.&#xD;
      Patients then undergo stereotactic radiosurgery on Day 8 per standard of care. Courses with&#xD;
      MBG453 and spartalizumab repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
