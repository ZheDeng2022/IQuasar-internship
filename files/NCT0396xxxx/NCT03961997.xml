  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to characterize the safety profile of lorlatinib in the&#xD;
      presence of a moderate CYP3A4/5 inducer, modafinil. In another drug-drug interaction study&#xD;
      for lorlatinib coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer, rifampin, all participants&#xD;
      experienced increases in liver enzymes after receiving the combination of a single dose&#xD;
      lorlatinib (100 mg) with rifampin (600 mg daily (QD)) after multiple doses of rifampin. The&#xD;
      AST and ALT continued to increase over the next 24-48 hours, but recovered below the upper&#xD;
      limit of normal for all participants upon discontinuation of rifampin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize the combination of lorlatinib with the moderate CYP3A inducer modafinil will&#xD;
      not have a safety findings related to liver enzyme elevation similar to what occurred in the&#xD;
      study with rifampin and lorlatinib.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1 study in approximately 16 healthy participants employing&#xD;
      administration of a single dose of lorlatinib in the fasted state alone, and with multiple&#xD;
      doses of modafinil 400 mg once daily. This study will consist of up to 3 lorlatinib treatment&#xD;
      groups: 50, 75, or 100 mg single doses of lorlatinib given alone and in combination with&#xD;
      multiple doses of modafinil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each enrolled participant will receive lorlatinib 50, 75, or 100 mg alone in Period 1 and&#xD;
      then lorlatinib 50, 75, or 100 mg in combination with multiple dose modafinil in Period 2&#xD;
      after a washout period of at least 19 days between lorlatinib doses in Periods 1 and 2. A&#xD;
      single PK sample is taken prior to lorlatinib dosing in each period. Following administration&#xD;
      of lorlatinib in each period, participants will undergo serial PK sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 4 cohorts. Cohorts 1 to 3 will include 2 participants each, while Cohort 4 will&#xD;
      include 10 participants. Participants in Cohorts 1 to 4 will be sequentially enrolled such&#xD;
      that participants in a new cohort can receive their lorlatinib Period 2 dose only after&#xD;
      participants from the prior cohort are 72 hours past their lorlatinib Period 2 combination&#xD;
      dose (with modafinil) with no safety concerns. In addition, Cohorts 1 to 3 will employ&#xD;
      sentinel dosing such that the second participant in each cohort can receive their lorlatinib&#xD;
      Period 2 dose only after the first participant from the same cohort is 72 hours past their&#xD;
      lorlatinib and modafinil Period 2 combination dose with no safety concerns. Participants in&#xD;
      Cohort 4 may be dosed in parallel, as sentinel dosing of lorlatinib 100 mg will have been&#xD;
      completed in Cohort 3. The overall study design will be identical in all 4 cohorts, with the&#xD;
      only difference being the dose of lorlatinib administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to dose subsequent cohorts during Period 2 with lorlatinib will be made after&#xD;
      reviewing the totality of the participants' clinical picture for safety by the investigator.&#xD;
      Furthermore, participants in subsequent cohorts will not be dosed if the following liver&#xD;
      function abnormalities are observed during the 72 hour time frame for safety evaluation after&#xD;
      lorlatinib dosing in Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For enrollment of each successive cohort, the period of safety evaluation will be at least 72&#xD;
      hours after the Period 2 lorlatinib dosing in the previous cohort. During Period 2, safety&#xD;
      laboratory assessments including urinalysis, hematology and chemistry will be performed once&#xD;
      daily from Day 14 through Day 20. Only after the review of safety labs for at least 72 hours&#xD;
      after lorlatinib+ modafinil dosing during Period 2 of the previous cohort, will participants&#xD;
      in a new cohort receive lorlatinib in combination with modafinil in their Period 2.&#xD;
      Additional safety laboratory assessments may be performed at any additional times at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator. If safety events of concern are observed in Cohorts 1, 2, or&#xD;
      3 during Period 2, this study will be terminated.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Y days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to Drug X was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study. Psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated&#xD;
             with modafinil with many, but not all, with prior psychiatric history. Participants&#xD;
             with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania are excluded from this study.&#xD;

             7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             investigational product. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at&#xD;
             doses of ≤1 g/day. Limited use of nonprescription medications that are not believed to&#xD;
             affect participant safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a&#xD;
             case by case basis following approval by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous administration with lorlatinib within 30 days (or as determined by the local&#xD;

             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is ≥130 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥80 mm&#xD;
             Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP&#xD;
             values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;

             screening: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level &gt;&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (ULN); Total bilirubin level &gt; ULN; participants with a history&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5&#xD;
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,&#xD;
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week for males or 7 units per week for&#xD;

             (90 mL) of wine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As modafinil is a controlled substance, participants with a history drug abuse will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;

             after the last dose of investigational product or longer based upon the compound's&#xD;
             half life characteristics, and refrain from sperm donation for the duration of the&#xD;
             study and for at least 97 days after the last dose of investigational product.&#xD;
