    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) is a cardiovascular disease secondary to a structural and / or functional&#xD;
      alteration of the heart that prevents its correct function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) aims to restore atrioventricular, inter and&#xD;
      intraventricular synchrony in patients with systolic HF and wide depolarization of the&#xD;
      ventricles (QRS). Although CRT has been shown to be effective, the rate of non-responders is&#xD;
      high (30-50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the proposed reasons for the lack of response to the CRT is the lack of intrinsic&#xD;
      conduction, since most of the time CRT is administered using biventricular stimulation (BiV).&#xD;
      One of the limitations to achieve ventricular fusion are the dynamic physiological variations&#xD;
      of the auriculo-ventricular (AV) interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SyncAVTM algorithm is a new dynamic algorithm that manages to adjust the AV intervals&#xD;
      outside the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the present clinical study is post-marketing, prospective, multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized and blind for the patient and the central echocardiography laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess whether CRT with ventricular stimulation with fusion&#xD;
      using the SyncAVTM algorithm is superior to CRT with conventional BiV stimulation in the&#xD;
      population for which its use is foreseen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected in at least the Selection / Baseline Visit and in the Visit of&#xD;
      Follow-up at 6 Months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population are subjects to whom an Abbott Medical CRT has been implanted with&#xD;
      SyncAVTM® Stimulation function that go to the participating sites in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess whether CRT with ventricular stimulation with&#xD;
      fusion using the SyncAVTM algorithm is superior to CRT with BiV stimulation conventional in&#xD;
      terms of the rate of responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint is the determination of significant differences between conventional BiV&#xD;
      stimulation and ventricular stimulation with fusion using the SyncAVTM algorithm in terms of&#xD;
      the percentage of patients responding to CRT therapy with echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the clinical study is estimated at 24 months with a recruitment period of 18&#xD;
      months and a patient follow-up of 6 months. The number of subjects that is planned to be&#xD;
      recruited is 176. The inclusion will be competitive and there is no inclusion number&#xD;
      determined per site.&#xD;

      Study design The study is designed post-marketing, prospective, multicenter, randomized and&#xD;
      blind for the patient and for the Core-laboratory of the echocardiogram (ECO) department. Has&#xD;
      this design is post- marketing since it is a sanitary product with European Committee (CE)&#xD;
      marking that is already commercialized and will be used in the study according to its&#xD;
      instructions for use. Is a blind study since neither the participant subject nor the&#xD;
      Core-laboratory of the ECO (person in charge to assess the main variable of the study) know&#xD;
      the treatment that has been randomized the subject, it is a randomized study because the&#xD;
      group assignment of each subject is done randomly 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study evaluation Evaluation of the risk and benefits of the study: The following will be&#xD;
      taking into account&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Expected clinical benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stimulation function with the SyncAV algorithm is expected increase the rate of&#xD;
                responders to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  These two methods improve function VI (ventricle left) and it is believed that this&#xD;
                additional improvement of the VI function could benefit patients who do not respond&#xD;
                to BiV conventional stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expected adverse effects of the product: bleeding/acute hemorrhage, gas aeration,&#xD;
           acceleration of arrythmias, cysts formation, erosion,exacerbation of cardiac&#xD;
           insufficiency, venous or cardiac perforation, excessive fibrous tissue development,&#xD;
           bruising, histotoxic reactions, infection, keloid formation, myocardial irritability,&#xD;
           infection, hematoma, excessive bleeding, local tissue reaction, loss of stimulation&#xD;
           and/or detection due to migration or mechanical malfunction, myocardial irritability,&#xD;
           stimulation of the nerve, etc. All those events are inherent to the implant of the&#xD;
           device for cardiac resynchronization therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Risk associated with participation in this clinical trial: It is expected that the risks&#xD;
           associated with the use of the SyncAVTM stimulation algorithm be comparable to the risks&#xD;
           associated with other types of ventricular pacing, and therefore, the risks associated&#xD;
           with the use of the stimulation algorithm are expected SyncAVTM will not differ from the&#xD;
           risks associated with the different modes of Conventional stimulation available.&#xD;
           Patients will be included in the study after the successful implantation of a CRT&#xD;
           device, whose indication will be made clinically based on the guidelines current&#xD;
           clinical practice of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Possible interactions with concomitant medical treatments and / or Simultaneous medical&#xD;
           interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interaction with concomitant pharmacological treatments and / or medical interventions&#xD;
      simultaneous, apart from those that occur in the usual treatment with any CRT device. All&#xD;
      participants will be candidates for the implantation of a CRT device and will be included in&#xD;
      the clinical study once the device has been implanted successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Valuation criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint of the study is to determine if there are differences significant&#xD;
      differences between conventional BiV stimulation and ventricular pacing with fusion using the&#xD;
      SyncAVTM algorithm in terms of the percentage of patients responders to CRT therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive response to CRT is defined as an improvement&gt; 15% in the Systolic Volume End in&#xD;
      the Left Ventricle (VSFVI) 6 months after implantation, evaluated by echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ▪ Secondary rating criterion The secondary endpoints of this study are differences between:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inverse remodeling of the VI, measured as the changes in the interval (VTSVI), Volume&#xD;
           Telediastolic Left Ventricle (VTDVI), Telesystolic Diameter Left Ventricle (DTSVI),&#xD;
           Telediastolic Diaphragm of the Left Ventricle (DTDVI) and Left Ventricular Ejection&#xD;
           Fraction (LVEF) at 6 months, in comparison with the Basal situation without stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the aforementioned echocardiographic parameters with the cohort of&#xD;
           patients stratified according to the etiology (ischemic patients versus to non-ischemic&#xD;
           patients): or The percentage of super-responder patients * at 6 months. or dyssynchrony&#xD;
           measured by the rate of deformation (echocardiography with the speckle tracking&#xD;
           technique ) between the anteroseptal segment and the posterior wall (if available). or&#xD;
           Electrode position VI: o Short axis (posterolateral, lateral, anterolateral). o Long&#xD;
           axis (apical, midventricular, Basal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class Change at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality from any cause after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization rate for any cause, due to cardiovascular causes and / or heart failure,&#xD;
           at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combined mortality and hospitalization variable for heart failure a 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life variable according to Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)-12&#xD;
           survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  % auricular fibrilation (FA) (no patients / FA load)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY ASSESSMENT The safety of the stimulation algorithms will be evaluated by collecting&#xD;
      and registering of any dysfunction, alteration of the features or performance of the product&#xD;
      that could or could have led to the death or serious deterioration of the state of health of&#xD;
      a patient or a user. Therefore, safety has as an evaluation criterion the Record and analyze&#xD;
      the frequency and intensity of adverse incidents that occur throughout the study. For the&#xD;
      evaluation of safety, the Population of Security (PS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of effectiveness The superior efficacy of CRT with ventricular stimulation with&#xD;
      fusion through SyncAVTM algorithm versus CRT with conventional BiV stimulation will be&#xD;
      studied comparing the results of the stimulation logarithms between the two branches of the&#xD;
      study (stimulation by SyncAVTM algorithm and conventional BiV stimulation).The ultimate goal&#xD;
      of the study is to determine the percentage of responding patients and not respondents The&#xD;
      response of patients to CRT will be evaluated taking into account the reduction of VSFVI.&#xD;
      Patients will be classified as responders. have documented a reduction in VSFVI of at least&#xD;
      15% compared to the data collected in the Basal situation without stimulation. The evaluation&#xD;
      of the effectiveness will be analyzed with the Population of Intent to Treat (ITT) and&#xD;
      Population by Protocol (PP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The calculation of the sample size is based on the main variable: the proportion&#xD;
      of responders to CRT at 6 months with the SyncAV function activated at the start of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variable of the study is the response to re-synchronization, understood as a&#xD;
      dichotomous variable that takes the values: Yes / No. In the study there will be two&#xD;
      randomization groups, and the response rate of the control group is set at 65% of the&#xD;
      patients, while that of the study group will be 77%, that is, 12% higher. As statistical&#xD;
      criteria for the estimation of the sample size, it was used a confidence level of 95%, a&#xD;
      margin of non-inferiority δ = 0 and a power a priori of 80%. The statistical technique used&#xD;
      for the analysis of the main variable is a test χ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formula used to calculate the sample size is as follows (Chow, Shao and Wang, 2008): In&#xD;
      addition, it is assumed that 5% of patients may be lost due to loss of follow-up and 8% due&#xD;
      to exitus. For the calculation of the sample size, the R-studio software (version 1.0.153).&#xD;
      Applying the formula, the sample size is 77 patients per group, that is, a total of 154&#xD;
      patients. However, 22 more must be added (11 more patients in each group) due to possible&#xD;
      loss of follow-up and due to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering all the above information, the expected sample size is of 176 patients, 88&#xD;
      patients would be randomized to the control group and 88 to the group of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an exact binomial test of a unilateral sample, with a level of significance of 95%, a&#xD;
      total of 176 patients would be necessary to reach a 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect a difference of 12% between the two responder rates, it is It is necessary that a&#xD;
      total of 176 patients have analysable data at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on clinical experience, it is assumed that some patients will abandon the study (5%&#xD;
      during the first 6 months of implantation, 8% due to exitus)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical design, hypothesis, method and analytical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the main variable will be based on the intention to treat principle (ITT),&#xD;
      including all deviations from the Protocol. There will also be a secondary analysis per&#xD;
      Protocol (PP), excluding all deviations of the Protocol. If the results obtained in these&#xD;
      analyzes were different, an exploration of the data will be done in search of the reasons. In&#xD;
      the analysis of the main variable will be evaluated the following hypothesis of inequality:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0: Proportion of responders at 6 months with ventricular stimulation with fusion using&#xD;
           SyncAVTM algorithm &lt;Proportion ofResponders at 6 months with conventional BiV&#xD;
           stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1: Proportion of responders at 6 months with ventricular stimulation with fusion using&#xD;
           the SyncAVTM algorithm &gt; Proportion ofResponders at 6 months with conventional BiV&#xD;
           stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results will be expressed according to the corresponding intervals confidence of 97.5%&#xD;
      and the values p. P values less than 2.5% are will consider significant.&#xD;
