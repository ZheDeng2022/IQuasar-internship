  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the mechanism of action (MoA) of cladribine&#xD;
      tablets by exploring the effect on central nervous system (CNS) and blood biomarkers relevant&#xD;
      in the relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS; to include relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS]&#xD;
      or active secondary progressive MS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label, randomized, multicenter collaborative research Phase 4 biomarker&#xD;
      study, designed to generate hypotheses to better understand the MoA of cladribine tablets in&#xD;
      RMS (to include RRMS or active secondary progressive MS). The study is designed to generate&#xD;
      hypotheses regarding the impact and relevance of cladribine tablet activity in the CNS by&#xD;
      assessing the cerebrospinal (CSF) levels of lymphocyte subsets, other immune cells, neuronal&#xD;
      injury markers and soluble immunological markers in study participants with RMS before and&#xD;
      during treatment with cladribine tablets, and the association of these CSF markers with&#xD;
      corresponding blood markers and with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
