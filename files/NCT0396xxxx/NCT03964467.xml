  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke often leads to long-term disability including upper extremity (UE) dysfunction even&#xD;
      with the provision of timely rehabilitation services. Brain injury stemming from stroke,&#xD;
      affecting the corticospinal system results in weakness, alterations in muscle tone and&#xD;
      incoordination during the performance of functional tasks. Recovery of functional task&#xD;
      performance after injury to the corticospinal system involves a residual neural network that&#xD;
      engages the premotor cortex, frontal cortex and supplementary motor cortex. In particular,&#xD;
      the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is anatomically and physiologically poised to reorganize and&#xD;
      support motor recovery after corticospinal damage. The goal of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of stimulating the ipsilesional PMd in adults with chronic stroke&#xD;
      using noninvasive anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during the training&#xD;
      sessions of a 4-week circuit-based, UE, task-related training (TRT) program. Pilot data from&#xD;
      six adults, using anodal tDCS over the injured PMd just before each session of TRT, led to&#xD;
      significant improvements in UE function in 5 of the 6 adults after only 4 weeks of training.&#xD;
      We will assess the motor function of both arms using clinical assessments immediately before&#xD;
      and after the 4-week TRT program. In addition to effects of tDCS-primed UE-TRT on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the changes&#xD;
      in neural network reorganization. We hypothesize that the training program will reveal&#xD;
      significant improvement in motor function based on clinical assessment as well as significant&#xD;
      global network changes based on resting state functional MRI and hybrid diffusion MR imaging.&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this research is to develop an effective intervention strategy to&#xD;
      improve UE function in individuals with moderate impairment from chronic stroke.&#xD;

      AIM 1: To determine if UE motor performance significantly improves in individuals with&#xD;
      moderate impairment from chronic stroke, following anodal tDCS applied to the ipsilesional&#xD;
      PMd during circuit-based, UE, TRT conducted three times/week for 4-weeks. Hypothesis:&#xD;
      Following a 4-week, tDCS-paired UE TRT program, there will be significant changes in&#xD;
      unimanual and bimanual performance in individuals with moderate impairment from chronic&#xD;
      stroke, as detected by clinical assessments. Our primary measure will be UE accelerometry&#xD;
      gathered with wrist-based ActiGraphs; a secondary measure will be the Wolf Motor Function&#xD;
      Test (WMFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To determine if there are significant structural and functional brain changes in&#xD;
      individuals with moderate impairment from chronic stroke, following anodal tDCS applied to&#xD;
      the ipsilesional PMd paired with circuit-based, UE, TRT conducted 3 times/week for 4-weeks.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Following a 4-week, tDCS-paired UE TRT program, there will be significant&#xD;
      structural/functional brain changes as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI). Based on prior work,4,10 we expect that there will be an increase in&#xD;
      resting state functional connectivity as shown using BOLD fMRI between the cerebellum and&#xD;
      cortical areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task related training (TRT) is a treatment approach that aims to increase use of the paretic&#xD;
      arm, avoid learned disuse and minimize compensation (Thielman et al, 2004). It involves&#xD;
      variable practice of goal-directed, functional movements in a natural environment (Ada et al,&#xD;
      1994) focusing on solving movement problems (Gentile, 2000). Task related training has been&#xD;
      found to significantly improve paretic arm function post-stroke, in individuals with baseline&#xD;
      UE FM &lt; 35 (Kim et al., 2013; Thielman et al., 2004; Thielman, 2015; Wu et al, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of TRT could be augmented with noninvasive brain stimulation pairing. Motor&#xD;
      priming before or during task practice has been found to foster motor learning and UE&#xD;
      function in healthy individuals and persons post-stroke by increasing neuroplasticity (Fusco&#xD;
      et al., 2014; Stoykov and Madhavan, 2015; Stoykov and Stinear, 2010). Anodal transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one form of stimulation (Fusco et al., 2014). Anodal&#xD;
      tDCS increases neuronal excitability by depolarizing the membrane potential while cathodal&#xD;
      tDCS decreases excitability and hyperpolarizes the membrane potential (Nitsche and Paulus,&#xD;
      2001). After effects from anodal tDCS stimulation, involving activation of NDMA receptors&#xD;
      associated with long-term potentiation, have been shown to last up to 120 minutes (min)&#xD;
      (Madhavan and Shah, 2012). Anodal tDCS administered during intervention has a greater impact&#xD;
      on UE function than therapy or tDCS alone (Bolognini et al., 2011; Butler et al., 2013; Cho&#xD;
      et al., 2015; Lee and Lee, 2015; Yao et al., 2015). While the receipt of tDCS during&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions is promising, it can limit the therapy to seated or more sedentary&#xD;
      programs. Given the support in the literature, we believe it may be more effective to foster&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and UE functional recovery in chronic stroke survivors if tDCS is done&#xD;
      repetitively, during participation in a dynamic UE standing program. Our circuit-based, UE&#xD;
      TRT standing program requires more aerobic effort from participants than seated programming&#xD;
      and greater aerobic effort has been shown to foster neuroplasticity in persons post-stroke&#xD;
      (Mang et al., 2013; Quaney et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expanding Plasticity Beyond the Motor Cortex. The dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) may be a more&#xD;
      suitable neural substrate for promoting recovery in moderately impaired individuals. While&#xD;
      the results of anodal priming over the ipsilesional motor cortex are promising, the effects&#xD;
      have primarily been limited to persons with mild impairments. For persons with moderate&#xD;
      impairment, a substantial portion of the motor cortex and/or corticospinal system is damaged&#xD;
      leaving less neural substrate within M1 than can be targeted using anodal tDCS. In such&#xD;
      individuals, alternative cortical sites may have greater potential to reorganize and&#xD;
      implement motor recovery. Previously, we (Kantak et. al., 2012) and others (Plow et al.,&#xD;
      2016) proposed that the PMd may be uniquely poised to reorganize and implement recovery after&#xD;
      motor cortex injury. The PMd contributes to over 30% of descending corticospinal fibers&#xD;
      (Barbas and Pandya, 1987; Dum and Strick, 2002). Further, the PMd has been shown to&#xD;
      reorganize after stroke, contributing to motor performance (Fridman et al., 2004; Kantak et&#xD;
      al., 2012; Mohapatra et al., 2016). We believe that the benefit of priming the PMd before&#xD;
      engaging in circuit-based, UE TRT warrants further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain Imaging. Using hybrid diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI&#xD;
      (fMRI) to quantify structural and functional changes in the brain is critical to understand&#xD;
      behavioral change post-injury and with training. Functional organization of intact cortical&#xD;
      tissue post-stroke is dependent on the post-injury behavioral experience (O'Shea et al,&#xD;
      2007). Neuroimaging has been used to show an increase in neural activity in persons who&#xD;
      engage in TRT post-stroke (Nelles et al,2001). By using fMRI to assess brain function, the&#xD;
      volume of activation in regional brain areas can be determined, which could be used to&#xD;
      predict treatment outcome (Cramer, 2008).&#xD;
