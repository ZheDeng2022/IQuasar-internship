  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theory of mind is one of the features of mentalization. It can be defined as the ability to&#xD;
      predict or explain other's behavior with the assignment of beliefs, wishes, and intentions&#xD;
      and knowing how to discriminate them with our own, or in other words to know how other people&#xD;
      think.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this ability is crucial to behave adequately in a complex environment, theory of&#xD;
      mind judgments are not always optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, individuals with borderline personality disorder are may have difficulties to infer&#xD;
      other people's thought and state of mind as well as their own mental states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aspects could be at the origin of symptoms like impaired and unstable relationships,&#xD;
      identity disruption and excessive fear of abandonment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and scientific point suggest that this struggle can be reinforced by social&#xD;
      exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims at identifying if a situation of social exclusion (compared with social&#xD;
      inclusion) may decrease theory of mind performance in borderline personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will play a virtual ball-tossing game on a computer, which can lead to a&#xD;
      situation of social inclusion or exclusion. Before and after that, they will perform theory&#xD;
      of mind tests with visual material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will address three research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q1: Is theory of mind performance lowered after social exclusion, compared with social&#xD;
      inclusion?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q2: is the self-reported mentalization skills correlated with theory of mind performances?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q3: Is the social rejection sensitivity correlated with the the theory of mind performances ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators make several hypotheses related to the previous research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q1: the investigators expect social exclusion will decrease the subject's theory of mind&#xD;
      performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q2: the investigators expect low mentalization skills are correlated to low theory of mind&#xD;
      performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q3: the investigators expect that a high social rejection sensitivity will be correlated with&#xD;
      low theory of mind performances.&#xD;

      SAMPLING PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing data registration before the creation of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of the date of submission of this research plan for preregistration, the data have not yet&#xD;
      been collected, created, or realized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedures. Individuals with a borderline personality disorder will be&#xD;
      recruited from community mental health centers. All participants will be naive to the purpose&#xD;
      of the study, give informed consent in accordance with institutional guidelines and the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Maximum of 50 individuals with a borderline personality disorder. Given that&#xD;
      psychometric properties of intention attribution measures by the VLIS in borderline&#xD;
      personality disorder aren't known and the impact of social exclusion lead by a virtual&#xD;
      ball-tossing game in intention's attribution aren't know either, it is impossible to operate&#xD;
      a calculation of the number of necessary subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a previous study has shown that is was possible to prove a significant diminution of&#xD;
      theory of mind measure in a group of 17 subjects with a borderline personality disorder,&#xD;
      after being socially excluded by the cyberball.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the measures used in this study are different from ours, the investigators offer to&#xD;
      proceed with an intermediate analysis of power after including 10 subjects in each condition&#xD;
      (social exclusion and inclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This power analysis aims to calculate the number of subjects the investigators should recruit&#xD;
      for the difference underlined by our two intermediate samples to become significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this number exceeds 25 subjects in each group, the research will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigators will collect socio-demographic data then the participants will have&#xD;
      various evaluations and tests like the MADRS depression scale, the WAIS-IV with matrix&#xD;
      reasoning, vocabulary and letter-number sequencing, an executive functions test (Test des&#xD;
      commissions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before playing the cyberball game the participants will perform the first sequence of&#xD;
      intentional cartoon task, a computer task in which the subject had to choose a logical end at&#xD;
      a 3 boxes comic strip, involving or not a human intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then they will play the cyberball game, a virtual ball-tossing game in which they are lead to&#xD;
      think they are playing online with two other people while it is actually a randomized pre&#xD;
      register condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the VLIS, a theory of mind test in which the subject as to infer intentionality&#xD;
      likehood for characters in various movies extracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the second sequence of intentional cartoon task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will finish with the the height items reflexive questionnaire and the VSISR (Versailles&#xD;
      Sensitivity for Social Rejection, measuring social rejection sensitivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups' socio-demographic (age, sex, education), cognitive ( current IQ, and executive&#xD;
      performance with planning and working memory) and mood (depression) characteristics will be&#xD;
      compared using the Student t test or Χ² tests when appropriate. Only variables that&#xD;
      significantly differ between the two groups will be included as covariates in the following&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first analysis of covariance with repeated measures will be run with VLIS score as the&#xD;
      dependent variable, the condition (social exclusion or inclusion) as the independent factor,&#xD;
      and depression scale, and cognitive performances (matrix reasoning, vocabulary, letter-number&#xD;
      sequencing, and executive functions test) as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second analysis of covariance with repeated measures will be run with intentional cartoon&#xD;
      task score as the dependent variable, the condition (social exclusion or inclusion) as the&#xD;
      independent between-subject factor, the time of measurement (before or after the cyberball)&#xD;
      and the cartoon condition (intentional or non intentional) as the independent within-subject&#xD;
      factors, and depression scale and cognitive performances (matrix reasoning, vocabulary,&#xD;
      letter-number sequencing and executive functions test) as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third analysis of covariance with repeated measures will be run with questionnaire of&#xD;
      reflexive functions score as the dependent variable, the condition (social exclusion or&#xD;
      inclusion) as the independent factor and depression scale, and cognitive performances (matrix&#xD;
      reasoning, vocabulary, letter-number sequencing, and executive functions test) as covariables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spearman's correlation will be computed between:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  change in intentional cartoon task score after social exclusion and VSISR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intentional cartoon task score and questionnaire of reflexive functions score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VLIS score and questionnaire of reflexive functions score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data management :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict an anecdotal quantity of missing data (&lt;5%) in our study. If need&#xD;
      be the investigators will exclude them.&#xD;
