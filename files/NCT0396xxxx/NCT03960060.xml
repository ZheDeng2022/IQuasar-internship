      This is a single arm, open label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary therapeutic efficacy of CCT301-59 T cells in adult subjects with relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory stage IV metastatic solid tumors (soft tissue sarcoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, bladder cancer etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects with ROR2 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2) positive biopsy will&#xD;
      receive CCT301-59.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the 3+3 rules during the dose escalation stage to receive CCT301-59 treatment.&#xD;
