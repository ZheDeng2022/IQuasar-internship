  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RIMDAMAL II is a double-blind, cluster randomized trial in Burkina Faso designed to test&#xD;
      whether repeated ivermectin mass drug administrations, integrated into a monthly delivery&#xD;
      platform with standard malaria control measures of seasonal malaria chemoprevention and&#xD;
      insecticide-treated bed net distribution in the Sahel, will reduce childhood malaria&#xD;
      incidence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RIMDAMAL II trial is designed to determine the efficacy of adding seasonal ivermectin&#xD;
      mass drug administrations to the standard-policy malaria control measures in the Sahel&#xD;
      (seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children, maximum long-lasting insecticidal net&#xD;
      coverage, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy), for reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria episodes in enrolled village children (≤ 10 years of age) assessed by&#xD;
      active case surveillance. The investigators will also examine the safety of the intervention,&#xD;
      as well as entomological and parasitological endpoints. This is a double-blind, cluster&#xD;
      randomized trial in that will occur in villages in southwestern Burkina Faso over two&#xD;
      consecutive rainy seasons. For the intervention, mass administration of ivermectin or placebo&#xD;
      will be given monthly over 4 months of each rainy season to the eligible village population,&#xD;
      each as 3-day course of 300 µg/kg/day. These mass drug administrations will occur&#xD;
      simultaneously with the distribution of seasonal malaria chemoprevention drugs on the same&#xD;
      monthly schedule to eligible children aged 3-59 months.&#xD;
