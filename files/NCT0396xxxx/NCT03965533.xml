  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group, two-part study where&#xD;
      single IV doses of GSK2831781 will be administered to healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects&#xD;
      in part A and SC doses will be administered to healthy Caucasian subjects in part B.&#xD;
      GSK2831781 is a humanized, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) enhanced depleting&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that is specific to the lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG3) protein. LAG3&#xD;
      is a transmembrane receptor, which is upregulated on T cells following activation. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity post&#xD;
      administration of GSK2831781 in healthy subjects. The duration of the study is approximately&#xD;
      147 days for each subject enrolled. Approximately 36 subjects will be enrolled in the study,&#xD;
      16 subjects in Part A and 20 subjects in Part B.&#xD;

             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Japanese ancestry, defined as having been born in Japan, being descendants of four&#xD;
             ethnic Japanese grandparents and two ethnic Japanese parents, holding a Japanese&#xD;
             passport or identity papers, and being able to speak Japanese. Subjects should have&#xD;
             lived outside Japan for less than 10 years at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caucasian ancestry, defined as Caucasian descent as evidenced by appearance and verbal&#xD;
             confirmation of familial heritage (a subject has 2 Caucasian parents and 4 Caucasian&#xD;
             grandparents).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of a disease that in the opinion of the investigator constitutes a&#xD;
             risk when taking the study intervention or interfering with study assessment or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A medical history of severe allergic reaction, angioedema, anaphylaxis, clinically&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  An active infection or a history of serious infections as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Use of antimicrobials (antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals or antiparasitic&#xD;
                  agents) for an infection within 30 days before first dose. Topical treatments may&#xD;
                  be allowed at the Medical Monitor's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A history of opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Recurrent or chronic infection, or other active infection, that in the opinion of&#xD;
                  the Investigator might cause this study to be detrimental to the subject.&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. History of tuberculosis (TB) (active or latent) irrespective of treatment status.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  test). In cases where the QuantiFERON test is indeterminate, the subject may have&#xD;
                  the test repeated once and if their second test is negative they will be&#xD;
                  eligible. In the event a second test is also indeterminate, the investigator has&#xD;
                  the option to undertake purified protein derivative (PPD) testing. If the PPD&#xD;
                  reaction is &lt;5 millimeter (mm) at 48 to 72 hours, then the subject is eligible.&#xD;
                  If the reaction is &gt;=5 mm, or PPD testing is not undertaken, the subject is not&#xD;
                  eligible.&#xD;

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs (including recreational drugs and herbal&#xD;
             medications) within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to dosing,&#xD;

             study or compromise subject safety. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) at doses of &lt;=4 grams&#xD;
             per day, and occasional use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at&#xD;
             licensed doses, are permitted.&#xD;

             IMP (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than 4 new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;

             of 500 milliliter (mL) within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neutrophil or lymphocyte counts below the normal range.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb),&#xD;
             or positive hepatitis C antibody result at screening (Subjects with positive Hepatitis&#xD;
             C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be enrolled only if a confirmatory&#xD;
             negative Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid [RNA] test is obtained).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.&#xD;
&#xD;

             interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF; preferred&#xD;
             method), or another method, machine or overread.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an&#xD;
             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units. One unit is equivalent to 8 grams (g) of alcohol:&#xD;

             spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable lifestyle factors, to the extent that in the opinion of the investigator they&#xD;
             would interfere with the ability of a subject to complete the study.&#xD;

Urine red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC) were assessed by microscopy. Urine potential of hydrogen (pH) and specific gravity (Sp.Gr.) were also analyzed. The dipstick results are read as Trace,1+,2+ indicating proportional concentrations. pH is measured on a numeric scale of 0 to 14 (pH 7: neutral, pH &lt;7: acidic and pH &gt;7: basic). Urine Sp. Gr. is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and indicated as ratio of urine density to water density. The clinical concern range for these parameters were: Bil., Gl., Leuko, OB and Pro. (high: &gt;1+),Keto (high: &gt;2+),Nit. (high: positive),pH (low: &lt;4.6 and high: &gt;8),Sp.Gr.

Number of participants with worst-case clinically significant and not clinically significant abnormal ECG findings have been presented. Clinically significant abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.</description>

        <title>Concentration of Free GSK2831781 at Which Half Maximum Effect on Kout is Achieved (EC50) Derived From Statistical Analysis of the Relationship Between LAG3 Positive T Cell Levels in Blood and GSK2831781 Concentrations in Plasma (Part A and B)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to measure LAG3 positive T cell levels. Plasma samples were collected to measure concentrations of GSK2831781 in plasma. The relationship between the pharmacodynamic measure (LAG3 positive T cell levels in blood) and plasma concentrations of GSK2831781 was described by an indirect response (Emax type) PK/PD model. EC50 was calculated by fitting the PK/PD model to all available data (Part A and Part B) of GSK2831781 concentrations in plasma and LAG3 positive T cells in blood. As there was a limited dose range, to allow for a successful model conversion, EC50 was fixed to the EC50 value estimated from a previous study. The model parameter; EC50 is presented.</description>
