    <textblock>
      Follow-up of patients&gt; 70 years old with cancer pathologies to evaluate the influence of&#xD;
      geriatric factors associated with a review of therapies on their care pathways and health&#xD;
      conditions. We will be particularly interested in the main objective, the unplanned&#xD;
      hospitalization rate at 3 months in patients&gt; 70 years old with cancer treated in&#xD;
      oncogeriatric HDJ before the initiation of oncological treatment such as chemotherapy (oral&#xD;
      or intravenous) and / or targeted therapy and / or immunotherapy and / or new generation&#xD;
      hormone therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aging of the French population is associated with a constant increase in the number of&#xD;
      cancers in people over 75 years of age (1/3 of cancers diagnosed in patients â‰¥ 75 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncogeriatrics is a combination of two specialties, oncology and geriatrics. This practice&#xD;
      aims to ensure that all elderly cancer patients are treated according to their condition&#xD;
      through a multidisciplinary and multiprofessional approach. The improvement of the care of&#xD;
      elderly people with cancer has been measured in Measure 23.4 of the 2009-2013 Cancer Plan.&#xD;
      This objective is pursued through action 2.16 of the 2014-2019 Cancer Plan aimed at meeting&#xD;
      the specific needs of elderly people with cancer, notably by relying on the organizational&#xD;
      set-up of UCOGs (Coordination Units in Onco-Geriatrics). for an improvement of the management&#xD;
      practices of this population and a structuring of clinical research in oncogeriatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, 85% of people over 75 have at least one pathology and more than 7 different&#xD;
      molecules are delivered on average at least three times a year. Polypharmacy is a factor of&#xD;
      frailty and the risk of functional decline is established from two prescribed drugs.&#xD;
      Polypharmacy can be problematic in elderly patients with cancer who are treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our institution, we wanted to combine a review of therapies with this geriatric evaluation&#xD;
      in elderly patients with cancer or haematological diseases managed by a systemic oncological&#xD;
      treatment. In this context, during the evaluation sessions in day hospital (HDJ) of&#xD;
      oncogeriatrics on the Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille (AP-HM), a medical assessment&#xD;
      and a cross analysis between the usual treatments of patients (herbal medicine) and&#xD;
      self-medication) and chemotherapy and / or immunotherapy and / or targeted therapy and / or&#xD;
      new generation hormone therapy are routinely performed. The main objective of this work is to&#xD;
      evaluate the influence of the therapeutic revisions associated with the EGS data on the&#xD;
      unplanned hospitalization rate at 3 months and then the secondary objective of the impact on&#xD;
      the course of treatment oncology, to become patients and their survival. For this purpose, we&#xD;
      want to conduct a pilot observational cohort study, monocentric, prospective, descriptive for&#xD;
      patients convened in oncogeriatric HDJ and each patient is followed for 6 months.&#xD;
