  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The following obstetric procedures are commonly performed with spinal anesthesia on labor and&#xD;
      delivery: bilateral tubal ligation, external cephalic version, cerclage insertion, cerclage&#xD;
      removal, minimally invasive fetal surgery, and evacuation of retained products of conception.&#xD;
      Bupivacaine is currently the standard spinal medication for these procedures because of its&#xD;
      long history of safe use, its low incidence of transient neurologic symptoms, and its ability&#xD;
      to provide a dependable, dense block with a high degree of maternal satisfaction. While&#xD;
      bupivacaine has the aforementioned advantages, it unfortunately has a long duration of&#xD;
      action, up to 240-380 minutes, which far exceeds the time necessary to complete most&#xD;
      obstetric procedures. ClorotekalÂ®, the first Food and Drug Administration approved&#xD;
      chloroprocaine solution created for spinal injection, is a potential alternative. When&#xD;
      compared with bupivacaine spinals, chloroprocaine spinals have been shown to facilitate&#xD;
      clinically significant shorter times to resolution of motor and sensory block, first&#xD;
      ambulation, micturition, and discharge readiness. The objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if a strategy of spinal anesthesia with chloroprocaine will reduce the duration of motor&#xD;
      block, compared with equivalent block with hyperbaric bupivacaine..&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-blind, randomized, controlled, single center clinical trial assessing&#xD;
      the efficacy of spinal chloroprocaine on resolution of motor block and associated patient&#xD;
      flow through the post-anesthesia care unit . Fifty patients will be equally randomized to&#xD;
      receive either spinal chloroprocaine or hyperbaric bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obstetric provider&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Outcomes assessor&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia provider will be unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be allocated to either intrathecal injection of 50 mg of 1% chloroprocaine or&#xD;
      10.5 mg (1.4 mL) of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine. The intrathecal space will be accessed with&#xD;
      a 25 gauge Whitacre needle. Upon obtaining cerebrospinal fluid, the syringe of study solution&#xD;
      will be attached the end of the Whitacre needle. The syringe will be pulled back to reveal&#xD;
      aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid. The study solution will then be administered over&#xD;
      approximately 5 seconds. The Whitacre needle and spinal introducer needle will be removed&#xD;
      from the patient's back. The patient will be placed supine on the operating room table. The&#xD;
      outcomes assessor will then be allowed to enter the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decisions on when to administer additional sedative and analgesic medications will be left to&#xD;
      the discretion of the anesthesia team. The level of block will be initially assessed by the&#xD;
      anesthesia team. When the block is felt to be at peak height the outcomes assessor will test&#xD;
      with pinprick to determine the peak block height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with standard of practice at our institution all patients will have convective&#xD;
      warmers used during the case and patient temperature will be monitored. Non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressures will be obtained every 2.5 minutes after spinal placement. The frequency of blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement will be changed to every 5 minutes, 15 minutes after spinal placement.&#xD;
      Anesthesia providers will administer phenylephrine via intravenous bolus to maintain maternal&#xD;
      blood pressure within 20% of baseline or for a systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mm Hg.&#xD;
      Anesthesia providers will be allowed to add ephedrine or glycopyrrolate to phenylephrine for&#xD;
      maternal hypotension with co-existent bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research coordinator will remain with the patient throughout their time in the operating&#xD;
      room and the post-anesthesia care unit. Active, non-standard of care, monitoring for the&#xD;
      following signs and symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity will occur in the operating room&#xD;
      and post-anesthesia care unit at the following time intervals after spinal placement: 5&#xD;
      minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, upon post-anesthesia care unit arrival, upon completing&#xD;
      Phase 1 of post-anesthesia care unit recovery, and upon discharge from the post-anesthesia&#xD;
      care unit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tinnitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metallic taste&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Agitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory depression (respiratory rate &lt; 10 breaths per minute)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dizziness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vision changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paresthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perioral numbness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypotension (drop in mean arterial pressure &gt; 20% or systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mm&#xD;
           Hg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator will obtain from anesthesia, upon arrival to the post-anesthesia&#xD;
      care unit, the total dose of intraoperative opioids administered, whether the patient had&#xD;
      intraoperative hypotension, and the total dose of intraoperative phenylephrine administered.&#xD;
      In the post-anesthesia care unit, the research coordinator will determine the patient's&#xD;
      Bromage scale score at 5-minute increments. The research coordinator will also ask the&#xD;
      patient to notify them when they have a Bromage scale score of 2 (able to flex knees). While&#xD;
      in the post-anesthesia care unit, the research coordinator will also document the time of&#xD;
      post-anesthesia care unit arrival, the end of Phase 1 of post-anesthesia care unit recovery,&#xD;
      and the time that the patient leaves the post-anesthesia care unit (end of Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator will meet with the patient on the evening of their surgery as well&#xD;
      as daily for the duration of their hospitalization to assess for time of first ambulation,&#xD;
      bladder catheterization, and for adverse events including, new postoperative neurologic&#xD;
      deficits and any other potential adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gather information on the incidence of new postoperative neurologic deficits all patients&#xD;
      will be called 1 week after spinal insertion. A telephone script will be used to obtain this&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
