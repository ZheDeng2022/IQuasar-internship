      It is accepted that emotional events engage more attention and are detected and identified&#xD;
      faster than neutral events. The same is true of negative events with regard to positive&#xD;
      events. At the cerebral level, this facilitation results in greater activation of brain&#xD;
      regions involved in visual and emotional processing. In normal aging, the preference for the&#xD;
      negative stimuli (named negativity bias) tends to disappear and, sometimes, to shifts towards&#xD;
      a preference for positive stimuli compared to both the negative and neutral stimuli&#xD;
      (positivity bias). Most studies have assessed the age effect on emotional processing using&#xD;
      tasks which require the identification of a personal emotional experience or the emotions of&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many studies suggest a strong link between emotion and action, relatively little is&#xD;
      known about the age effect on emotional processing when the task requires the identification&#xD;
      of a tendency to action (i.e. preparation of the individual to react and direction of action&#xD;
      - example: fear prepares to avoid danger).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTEMOVI project aims to identify the brain bases and neural networks involved in the&#xD;

      It is accepted that emotional events engage more attention and are detected and identified&#xD;
      faster than neutral. The same is true for negative events compared to positive events. On the&#xD;
      cerebral level, this facilitation results in greater activation of brain regions involved in&#xD;
      visual and emotional processing. In normal aging, the preference for the negative stimuli&#xD;
      (named negativity bias) tends to disappear and, sometimes, to shifts towards a preference for&#xD;
      positive stimuli compared to both the negative and neutral stimuli (positivity bias), which&#xD;
      could be mainly related to a decrease with age in processing of negative stimuli and in&#xD;
      attention to this type of information. Only a few studies rather suggest an improvement in&#xD;
      processing of positive stimuli with age. On the cerebral level, various fMRI studies mainly&#xD;
      highlight an age effect on processing of negative stimuli in several brain regions involved&#xD;
      in emotional processing such as amygdalae and prefrontal cortex (respectively a lower and&#xD;
      higher activity in older adults compared to young adults). This age effect also induces a&#xD;
      higher level of well-being and less frequent negative emotional feelings in the elderly than&#xD;
      in younger people. Most studies have assessed the age effect on emotional processing using&#xD;
      tasks which require the identification of a personal emotional experience or the emotions of&#xD;
      others. Although many studies suggest a strong link between emotion and action, relatively&#xD;
      little is known about the age effect on emotional processing when the task requires the&#xD;
      identification of a tendency-to-action (i.e. preparation of the individual to react and&#xD;
      direction of action - example: fear prepares to avoid danger). Team's works on this research&#xD;
      question show the negativity bias with age is preserved in a tendency-to-action appraisal&#xD;
      task while it disappears with age in an emotional appraisal task, suggesting a dissociation&#xD;
      between emotion and tendency to action. In addition, a pilot fMRI study by our team in young&#xD;
      people show the tendency-to-action appraisal task compared to emotional appraisal task&#xD;
      induces higher activation in brain regions involved in visual and emotional processing. To&#xD;
      our knowledge, no study has yet investigated the evolution with aging of neural circuitry&#xD;
      involved in emotional processing during a tendency-to-action appraisal task compared to an&#xD;
      emotional apparaisal task. Studying this evolution could allow to better understand the&#xD;
      observed dissociation with increasing age between emotional and tendency-to-action tasks and&#xD;
      more generally to better understand the evolution of the interactions between emotional and&#xD;
      action processes with aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTEMOVI project aims to identify the brain bases and neural networks involved in the&#xD;
      processing of emotional visual information in normal aging when performing emotional&#xD;
      appraisal and action-oriented tasks, through a functional MRI study and using an original&#xD;
      mathematical modeling of functional connectivity based on the Graph theroy developed in the&#xD;
      team. Findings will be used to develop a first neural network mapping model involved in&#xD;
      visual perception of emotional scenes during emotional and tendency-to-action appraisals&#xD;
      during normal aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will be conducted in two age groups (20-35 and 60-85 years old) of 50 healthy&#xD;
      participants each (number based on currently requirements in terms of size of effects for the&#xD;
      envisaged connectivity analyzes), and carried out using a whole-body 3-T Philips scanner&#xD;
      (Philips Medical Systems, Best, NL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform two appraisal tasks during viewing a succession of emotional&#xD;
      scenes, one emotional based on the appraisal of personal emotional experience (pleasant,&#xD;
      unpleasant or neutral), and the other based on the appraisal of the tendency-to-action&#xD;
      (approach, avoidance or no action). Two characteristics of stimuli will be manipulated in the&#xD;
      study : valence and arousal.The age effect is modulated by these two characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each task, stimuli will be organized into two blocks: &quot;High&quot; block containing pleasant&#xD;
      and unpleasant stimuli of high activation and neutral stimuli, and &quot;Low&quot; block including&#xD;
      unpleasant and pleasant stimuli of low activation and neutral stimuli. The tendency-to-action&#xD;
      induced by stimuli will be congruent with the valence of stimuli (i.e. pleasant/approach,&#xD;
      unpleasant/avoidance and neutral/no action). The emotional stimuli in each block will be&#xD;
      displayed according to a block fMRI paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, each participant will successively perform four experimental blocks. Two blocks&#xD;
      will involve an emotional task (for the high and low blocks) and the other two will involve a&#xD;
      tendency-to-action task (for the high and low blocks).The order of tasks and images within a&#xD;
      task will be counterbalanced between the participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      For fMRI analyses, the protocol will aso include an anatomical MRI, a Diffusion Tension&#xD;
      Imaging (DTI) and a resting-state measure in order to take into account the anatomical and&#xD;
      functional differences between age groups. fMRI data (MRI signal of the BOLD type - Blood&#xD;
      Oxygen Level Dependent) will be analyzed using standard neuroimaging analysis software (e.g.&#xD;
      SPM, FSL). Analysis will perform on whole-body and in regions of interest (ROIs, e.g.&#xD;
      amygdala). Regions of interest (ROIs) associated with emotional processing will be&#xD;
      functionally identified and delimited for each participant using a separate functional&#xD;
      localizer experiment adapted from Vuilleumier et al. (2003). These regions will also be used&#xD;
      for Resting-State network analysis.&#xD;
