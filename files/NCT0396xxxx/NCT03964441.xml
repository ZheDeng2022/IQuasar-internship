  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal diagnosis of genetic diseases is a real medical challenge. The discovery of&#xD;
      antenatal abnormalities on ultrasound is frequent (5 to 10% of pregnancies), and when an&#xD;
      abnormalities is seen on ultrasound, it raises the possibility of an underlying developmental&#xD;
      anomaly. Currently, in France, when abnormalities are discovered with an ultrasound scan, the&#xD;
      etiological diagnosis is based on additional imaging tests (cerebral MRI, 3D bone tomography,&#xD;
      fetal CT, fetal CT) or diagnostic tests such as invasive chorionic villus sampling,&#xD;
      amniocentesis or fetal blood for infectious, metabolic, immunological and genetic&#xD;
      investigations (standard karyotype, FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) for the rapid&#xD;
      detection of aneuploidy, Chromosome Analysis on DNA Chip (ACPA or CGH-array) and possible&#xD;
      sequencing of targeted genes when they are available within a time frame compatible with&#xD;
      pregnancy). NIPT (Non-invasive prenatal testing) on cell free fetal DNA circulating in&#xD;
      maternal blood has more limited indications, allowing, from an early stage of pregnancy, the&#xD;
      determination of fetal sex and fetal rhesus factor and the search for aneuploidy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, establishing an etiological diagnosis during pregnancy has many benefits for the&#xD;
      parents: clarifying the cause, obtaining a more precise prognosis to determine future&#xD;
      management and outcome of the pregnancy, and establishing the risks of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, medical genetics has undergone a real technological revolution, leading&#xD;
      to the development of high throughput genome-wide, exome (ES) and genome (GS) sequencing.&#xD;
      However, few countries have currently embarked on ES/GS in prenatal care, due to the&#xD;
      constraints of time and the difficulty of interpreting genomic data when the clinical data is&#xD;
      limited to antenatal imaging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, France launched the France Medicine Genomics 2025 Plan (PFMG2025) to deploy GS,&#xD;
      particularly in the diagnosis of rare diseases. It is thus becoming essential to define the&#xD;
      modalities of prescription of this testing, in particular during prenatal diagnosis. In&#xD;
      parallel, from the first publications, the applications of genomic analysis on circulating&#xD;
      fetal DNA seem to be able to extend to genome sequencing for research of SNVs responsible for&#xD;
      developmental diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AnDDI-rares health network therefore proposes this ANDDI-PRENATOME pilot project to study&#xD;
      the feasibility of a &quot;rapid&quot; analysis of ES in prenatal diagnosis from 61 fetuses with&#xD;
      ultrasound abnormalities, as a first step before considering future cost-effectiveness (PRME)&#xD;
      or care system performance (PREPS) studies in conjunction with the PFMG2025.&#xD;
