  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) almost always develop acoustic neuromas in both&#xD;
      ears. As a result of the tumours themselves or the treatment of the tumours, many patients&#xD;
      become profoundly deaf in both ears. It is possible to restore a degree of hearing by placing&#xD;
      a hearing implant in the brainstem adjacent to the hearing pathways within the brain. This is&#xD;
      termed an auditory brainstem implant (ABI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find the optimum head position in relation to the MRI magnet&#xD;
      field, which would produce least area of image distortion in patients with ABIs. This will be&#xD;
      of benefit in optimising the MR imaging in future patients with implants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Auditory brainstem implants (ABI) are placed against the auditory centres in the brainstem if&#xD;
      it is not possible to implant the cochlea or if the cochlear nerve, which conveys neural&#xD;
      signals from the cochlea to the brainstem, is damaged or absent. The latter device is usually&#xD;
      used in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) who develop bilateral benign inner ear&#xD;
      tumours called vestibular schwannomas as well as other neurological tumours1. These patients&#xD;
      often become bilaterally profoundly deaf either as a result of the disease or because of&#xD;
      surgery to remove the tumours and require an ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NF2 require monitoring of their tumours. In the absence of an auditory implant&#xD;
      it is possible to use magnetic resonance imaging. This is the gold standard imaging technique&#xD;
      as it gives excellent views of the soft tissues of head. However, there has been concern&#xD;
      regarding the use of MRI in patients with auditory implants until recently because of&#xD;
      potential problems such as demagnetisation of the magnet within the implant, implant magnet&#xD;
      displacement and risk to the integrity of the implant electronics. In addition, the magnet&#xD;
      field of the implant magnet results in imaging artefact (manifesting as a signal void) around&#xD;
      the implant site that limits the information that can be obtained.&#xD;
