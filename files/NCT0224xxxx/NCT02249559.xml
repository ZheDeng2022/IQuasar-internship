  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of unilateral gamma knife&#xD;
      subthalamotomy for Parkinson's disease in patients deemed poor candidates for deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to enroll 20 subjects who could benefit from unilateral&#xD;
      subthalamotomy due to the presence of unilateral rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia and/or&#xD;
      dyskinesias (as opposed to axial symptoms such as walking) but who are suboptimal candidates&#xD;
      for deep brain stimulation (DBS) because of advanced age (&gt;74), medical comorbidities&#xD;
      precluding surgery, or patient aversion to DBS, and who show more than 30% improvement in&#xD;
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score in the ON versus OFF medication state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will focus on the efficacy of Gamma Knife (GK) subthalamotomy for&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD), as determined by changes in the patient's clinical status and any&#xD;
      improvement following the treatment. A full neurologic exam as well as a screen for&#xD;
      depression will be administered at every postoperative visit. The patient's neurologic&#xD;
      function will be assessed with a full neurological examination and objectively quantified&#xD;
      using the UPDRS focusing on the contralateral side, as well as overall UPDRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician will complete a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination (MMSE) at each visit to record overall impression of the patient's disease&#xD;
      progression and severity, and to evaluate cognitive function. Pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      assessment of the Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) (quantification of medication regimen&#xD;
      in levodopa equivalents) will be obtained and recorded to evaluated the efficacy of gamma&#xD;
      knife subthalamotomy (GKS) as a treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). A Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
      Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) to determine the patient's independence and quality of life will be&#xD;
      filled out at each visit. Finally, the patient will complete a Beck Depression Inventory at&#xD;
      each clinic visit to monitor for development or progression of depressive symptoms.&#xD;
