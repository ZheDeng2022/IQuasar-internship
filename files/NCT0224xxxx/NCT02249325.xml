  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot quasi experiment was designed to determine the feasibility of a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of the oral probiotic combination of Florajen3 (&gt;7.5 x109 L. acidophilus,&#xD;
      &gt;6.0 x109. B. lactis, and &gt;1.5 x109 B. longum) taken orally once daily beginning at 28 weeks&#xD;
      gestation, against placebo, to reduce the colonization of group B Streptococcus at 36 weeks.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-blinded, open-label, quasi-experimental design was approved by the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Boards of three institutions (two universities and the clinical research site). The study&#xD;
      setting was a large Certified Nurse-Midwife (subsequently referred to as midwife) clinical&#xD;
      practice serving a culturally and economically diverse urban population in the Midwest region&#xD;
      of the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Women self-selected to participate in screening and informed consent procedures&#xD;
      done by the first two authors. The following inclusion criteria were used at study&#xD;
      enrollment: low risk (no obstetric, fetal, medical or genetic risk factors), adult (≥18 years&#xD;
      of age), pregnant at 28 ± 2 weeks gestation, able to speak and write English, and expressing&#xD;
      willingness to participate in the study intervention (oral probiotic) and data collection&#xD;
      (vaginal and rectal swabs, questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of 20 healthy pregnant participants was sought. Following informed&#xD;
      consent, the first 10 subjects were assigned to the experimental group. Nonrandom assignment&#xD;
      was used to assure that the 10 experimental group participants were enrolled while remaining&#xD;
      within funding, and time constraints. After enrolling the experimental group, the next ten&#xD;
      women were assigned to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention consisted of one capsule of Florajen3 (previously described) orally&#xD;
      each day. Florajen3 meets the internationally established probiotic criteria (FAO/WHO, 2001).&#xD;
      The probiotics contained in Florajen3 are non-spore-forming, lactose- and&#xD;
      hydrogen-peroxide-producing bacteria. The manufacturer recommends refrigeration to maintain&#xD;
      maximum potency. As part of the preparation for this study, a sample of Florajen3 was left&#xD;
      unrefrigerated for a period of 6 weeks and appropriate colony counts were sustained.&#xD;
      Therefore for the purpose of the study, the participants in the experimental group were&#xD;
      allowed to leave the probiotic unrefrigerated in an effort to improve daily compliance.&#xD;
      Experimental group study participants were made aware of the probiotic brand used (open&#xD;
      label) as the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the current state of knowledge about prenatal probiotics, including potentially rare&#xD;
      side effects, were discussed at length using a 10-page informed consent document. The&#xD;
      Florajen3 was placed in a study bottle equipped with an electronic cap monitoring system&#xD;
      (MEMS ®AARDEX), designed to record each time the bottle was opened by the participant. Each&#xD;
      opening of the cap bottle equipped with this system is recorded on a microchip. The number of&#xD;
      openings are retrievable via computer software when the bottle caps are returned.&#xD;
      Researchers, midwives, and participants were aware of group assignment. The control group&#xD;
      participants did not receive a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midwife prenatal care providers and staff were oriented to the study data collection&#xD;
      procedures. Study data were collected at three points during routine prenatal visits with&#xD;
      each participant's midwife (28±2 weeks, 32±2 weeks, and 36±2 weeks gestation). The study was&#xD;
      considered completed at the 36±2 weeks gestation visit. All participants received&#xD;
      compensation at the completion of 2 study visits; 25 USD at 32±2 weeks and 75 USD at 36±2&#xD;
      weeks gestation. Probiotic group participants were offered a supply of probiotics for the&#xD;
      remainder of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The midwife prenatal provider collected demographic information (birth date, race, and&#xD;
      gestational age), and the vaginal and rectal swabs for GBS and wet mount, using accepted&#xD;
      criteria to identify the vaginal pH and the presence of normal flora and/or pathogens. The&#xD;
      wet mounts were examined microscopically by each midwife using standardized wet mount&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures with normal saline and potassium hydroxide and documented in a standard&#xD;
      format. Participants completed a brief questionnaire at each study visit that asked them to&#xD;
      describe yogurt ingestion, sexual activity (frequency and type), and vaginal cleansing&#xD;
      practices (if used) in the past week; these were considered potential confounding variables.&#xD;
      The participants were also asked if these practices were typical for them, and if not, how&#xD;
      they were atypical. Women in the experimental group were asked to report any side effects&#xD;
      that they attributed to the probiotics by notifying their midwife immediately, if necessary,&#xD;
      and then also noting the information on the study questionnaire. As part of routine prenatal&#xD;
      care, the CDC-required GBS vaginal to rectal swab was collected by each participant's midwife&#xD;
      and sent to the hospital laboratory between the 35 and 37 week visit. This was the only&#xD;
      result that determined the need for IAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers oversaw data collection and sample packaging. Participants were asked to return&#xD;
      their probiotic bottles at each study visit and the Florajen3 capsules were replaced with a&#xD;
      fresh supply. This gave the researchers the opportunity to notify the laboratory to record&#xD;
      the date for later evaluation of the electronic cap monitoring results and conduct pill&#xD;
      counts as an additional means to monitor women's responses to study participation, as well as&#xD;
      probiotic adherence at each study visit. The vaginal and rectal swabs were placed on ice,&#xD;
      packaged according to accepted procedures for human specimen handling, and shipped overnight&#xD;
      to the laboratory of the final author, located 80 miles from the study site, for processing&#xD;
      and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Analysis Upon receipt at the laboratory, the vaginal and rectal swabs were&#xD;
      processed for quantitative colony counts of GBS. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was&#xD;
      performed to determine whether bacteria isolated were the same as those in Florajen3. If&#xD;
      positive for PCR, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) would be performed to confirm the&#xD;
      strain identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results were for research purposes only and were not available to the practicing&#xD;
      midwives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine CDC-recommended prenatal GBS vaginal to rectal swabs were analyzed at the&#xD;
      hospital laboratory, using a culture based method in which a threshold for GBS positive&#xD;
      results is considered greater than 102 colony forming units (CFU) per swab. These results&#xD;
      determined the need for IAP and were available to the midwives for management during labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics, the study variables, and laboratory data were entered into and analyzed with a&#xD;
      statistical software package. Descriptive statistics, Confidence Intervals, Chi-squares,&#xD;
      T-tests, and correlations were used for analysis. Data were compared between subjects at each&#xD;
      study visit and between groups at each data collection point. The qualitative prenatal GBS&#xD;
      culture results (positive or negative) from the hospital laboratory were compared to the&#xD;
      quantitative vaginal and rectal GBS study results, adherence data, and confounding variables&#xD;
      (yogurt ingestion, sexual activity, and vaginal cleansing practices).&#xD;
