      The study is a prospective, single arm, non-randomized, open label pilot trial, designed to&#xD;
      study the safety, toxicity, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a medical device, the&#xD;
      NovoTTF-100L(O) concomitant with weekly paclitaxel in recurrent ovarian carcinoma patients.&#xD;
      The device is an experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic administration&#xD;
      of alternating electric fields (termed TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor,&#xD;
      by means of surface, insulated electrode arrays.&#xD;

      PAST PRE CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the electric fields generated by the NovoTTF-100L(O) device (Tumor Treating&#xD;
      Fields, TTFields, TTF) has demonstrated significant activity in in vitro and in vivo ovarian&#xD;
      carcinoma pre-clinical models both as a single modality treatment and in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel. TTFields has also shown to inhibit metastatic spread of malignant melanoma in in&#xD;
      vivo experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a small scale pilot study, patients with stage IIIB- IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      who had had tumor progression after at least one line of prior chemotherapy received&#xD;
      Pemetrexed together with NovoTTF Therapy applied to the chest and upper abdomen until disease&#xD;
      progression. Efficacy endpoints were remarkably high compared to historical data for&#xD;
      Pemetrexed alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a large prospective, randomized trial, in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The outcome of&#xD;
      subjects treated with NovoTTF Therapy was compared to those treated with an effective best&#xD;
      standard of care chemotherapy (including bevacizumab). NovoTTF Therapy subjects had&#xD;
      comparable overall survival to subjects receiving the best available chemotherapy in the US&#xD;
      today. Similar results showing comparability of NovoTTF Therapy to best standard of care&#xD;
      (BSC) chemotherapy were seen in all secondary endpoints. Recurrent GBM patients treated with&#xD;
      the NovoTTF Therapy in this trial experienced fewer side effects in general, significantly&#xD;
      fewer treatment related side effects, and significantly lower gastrointestinal, hematological&#xD;
      and infectious adverse events compared to controls. The only device-related adverse events&#xD;
      seen were a mild to moderate skin irritation beneath the device electrodes. Finally, quality&#xD;
      of life measures were better in NovoTTF Therapy subjects as a group when compared to subjects&#xD;
      receiving effective best standard of care chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in this trial are diagnosed with recurrent ovarian carcinoma. In&#xD;
      addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled, baseline tests will be performed and the patients will be&#xD;
      treated continuously with the device concomitant with weekly paclitaxel until disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NovoTTF-100L(O) treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrode&#xD;
      arrays on the torso. Electrode array placement will require shaving of the abdomen/back as&#xD;
      necessary before and during the treatment. After an initial short visit to the clinic for&#xD;
      training and monitoring, patients will be released to continue treatment at home where they&#xD;
      can maintain their regular daily routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, the patient will need to return once every 4 weeks to the clinic where an&#xD;
      examination by a physician and a routine laboratory examinations will be done. These routine&#xD;
      visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the monthly follow up visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically.&#xD;
      Additionally, routine blood tests will be performed. A routine CT scan of the chest and&#xD;
      abdomen will be performed at baseline and every 8 weeks thereafter, until disease&#xD;
      progression. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by&#xD;
      telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on&#xD;
      metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of&#xD;
      electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic&#xD;
      particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues.&#xD;
      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their&#xD;
      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200&#xD;
      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects&#xD;
      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the&#xD;
      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breakthrough finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very&#xD;
      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are&#xD;
      multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a&#xD;
      way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature&#xD;
      building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to&#xD;
      place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of&#xD;
      electric charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of these two effects, cancer tumor growth is slowed and can even reverse after&#xD;
      continuous exposure to TTFields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells&#xD;
      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to&#xD;
      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, TTField hold the promise of serving as a brand new cancer treatment with very&#xD;
      few side effects and promising affectivity in slowing or reversing this disease.&#xD;
