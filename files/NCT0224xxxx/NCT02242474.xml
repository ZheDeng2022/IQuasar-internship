  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a frequent inflammatory arthritis that can lead to severe joint&#xD;
      deformity and often requires orthopaedic surgical interventions. Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α&#xD;
      (anti-TNFα) are biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) increasingly used&#xD;
      in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. An increased risk of opportunistic infection was&#xD;
      demonstrated in patients treated with those drugs. This observation led many national&#xD;
      committees to recommend anti-TNFα suspension in the perioperative period to avoid a raise in&#xD;
      the postoperative infection risk in those patients. This approach is not supported by the&#xD;
      data available in the current literature and it exposes patients to an increased risk of&#xD;
      inflammatory flare ups of their disease during and after anti-TNFα suspension, which can&#xD;
      compromise their postoperative rehabilitation and their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this prospective randomized multicentric trial is to determine the effect of&#xD;
      anti-TNFα suspension in the perioperative period on the postoperative infection risk.&#xD;
      Overall, 660 rheumatoid arthritis patients requiring an elective foot or ankle surgery will&#xD;
      be randomized into two groups. In the first group, anti-TNFα will be stopped 3 half-lives&#xD;
      before the surgery while they will be continued in the second group. The postoperative&#xD;
      infection rate will be compared between the two groups. Postoperative complication rates,&#xD;
      flares and revision surgeries as well as the functional improvement will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in the risk of postoperative&#xD;
      infection between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will help determine the optimal way to use anti-TNFα in the&#xD;
      perioperative period and will therefore improve the quality of life of rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      A. STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective randomized multicentric trial. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups. Patients in Group A will continue their anti-TNF treatment during&#xD;
      the whole perioperative period. Anti-TNFα medication will be suspended prior to the surgery&#xD;
      in patients randomized in Group B. This design will allow us to minimize the important&#xD;
      selection bias that was affecting the observational studies previously conducted on this&#xD;
      topic. Due to safety concerns, patients and evaluators will not be blinded to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. RESEARCH LOCATION Considering the important number of patients required, we plan on&#xD;
      conducting a multicentric study. This will allow us to recruit enough patients in a&#xD;
      reasonable time frame to ensure sufficient power to our results. The main center where the&#xD;
      data will be gathered is the CHU de Québec. Other centers in Canada will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study for a maximum of 10 centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. INTERVENTION Medication Patients randomized to Group A will continue their anti-TNFα&#xD;
      treatment unaltered during the whole perioperative period. Surgery will be performed without&#xD;
      consideration in regards to the timing of the treatment. The time elapsed between the last&#xD;
      anti-TNFα administration and the surgery will nonetheless be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Group B will have their anti-TNFα therapy interrupted before surgery.&#xD;
      There is no consensus on the optimal timing of anti-TNFα suspension before surgery. Many&#xD;
      published guidelines suggest that the pharmacokinetics of the different anti-TNFα medications&#xD;
      should be an important consideration in the perioperative management of these drugs.&#xD;
      Different authors suggested that anti-TNFα therapies should be suspended between two and five&#xD;
      half-lives prior to surgery. Similar timing was used in previous publications. In the current&#xD;
      trial, anti-TNFα will be suspended three half-lives (± seven days) prior to surgery. All&#xD;
      other medications used in the treatment of the disease (methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine,&#xD;
      corticosteroid, etc.) will be documented and continued in the perioperative period.&#xD;
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) will be suspended seven days prior to surgery&#xD;
      and will be restarted postoperatively. Anti-TNFα will be restarted once wound healing is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries will be performed by experimented orthopaedic surgeons. Surgical techniques&#xD;
      will be determined by the treating surgeon and will not be subject to randomization. For&#xD;
      analysis purposes, surgeries will be subdivided in surgeries with and without permanent&#xD;
      implants. It will also be divided between forefoot, midfoot, hindfoot and ankle surgeries.&#xD;
      Use of prophylactic antibiotics will be standardized as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cephalexin 2g IV before the incision or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clindamycin 600mg IV before the incision if patient is allergic to cephalexin D.&#xD;
           RANDOMIZATION Randomization will be completed as soon as the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria are verified and the patient has given informed consent. Patients will be&#xD;
           randomized to treatment Group A or B. Randomization will be performed in blocks of 10&#xD;
           using the web site Randomizer.org. Blocks of 10 numbered, sealed and opaque envelopes&#xD;
           will be sent to the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE Patients will be followed for one year after surgery. There is going to&#xD;
      be one visit before surgery and five follow-up visits at two weeks, six week, three months,&#xD;
      six months and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION We calculated the sample size needed to test for equivalence&#xD;
      between the two groups with a statistical power of 80% and a type I error (alpha) of 5%. The&#xD;
      observed rate of infection following foot and ankle surgery in RA patient varies greatly in&#xD;
      the literature [46]. For the purpose of the sample size calculation, we used a 5% rate of&#xD;
      infection and considered a relative risk of 2 to be clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N1 = N2 = 2*((1.96+0.845)/0.05)^2*0.05*(1-0.05) = 299&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering a rate of lost to follow-up of 15%, we concluded that a sample of 660 patients,&#xD;
      330 in each treatment group, would provide us relevant results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive analysis Demographic data and baseline clinical&#xD;
      characteristics obtained will be analyzed. For each continuous variable, the mean, the&#xD;
      median, the standard deviation as well as the maximum and minimum values are going to be&#xD;
      presented for each group. For categorical variable, the frequencies and proportions are going&#xD;
      to be presented. All these variables are going to be compared between the two groups using&#xD;
      Student's T-test for continuous variables and the Chi-squared test for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main analysis The main outcome analysis is going to be made using the Chi-squared test. The&#xD;
      gross surgical site infection (SSI) relative risk between the two groups will be calculated.&#xD;
      The relative risk will also be adjusted using a multivariate regression analysis that will&#xD;
      consider relevant demographic variables. The model will include, but will not be limited, to&#xD;
      the variables that are statistically different between the two groups. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      related to disease flare up, poor wound healing and reoperation rate will also be analyzed&#xD;
      using Chi-squared test. A linear regression model with repeated measures will be used to&#xD;
      compare functional scores improvements between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-group analysis will be performed. They will include analysis by type of surgery, by use&#xD;
      of permanent implants, by baseline disease activity level and by type of anti-TNFα used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis An interim analysis will be performed at the midpoint of the recruitment&#xD;
      period to look for a significant difference in the primary outcome between the two groups.&#xD;
      The analysis will take place when 330 patients will have been followed for at least six weeks&#xD;
      after surgery. Based on the obtained results, a decision to interrupt the trial could&#xD;
      eventually be made by the safety committee.&#xD;

I. Modification of the medication made necessary by an increase in the disease symptoms.&#xD;
II. Increase in disease activity according to the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI):&#xD;
Increase from a remission or a low disease activity level at baseline to a moderate or high activity level.&#xD;
or&#xD;
Increase from a moderate disease activity level at baseline to a high activity level.&#xD;
or&#xD;
An increase of 12 points or more on the CDAI in patients having a high disease activity level at baseline.</description>
