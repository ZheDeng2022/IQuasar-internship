    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of treatment with telmisartan on patients in&#xD;
      whom the systolic BP is approximately 12 weeks after starting treatment under control for the&#xD;
      first time between patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) at the beginning to&#xD;
      patients with systolic/diastolic hypertension (SDH)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 55, with no upper limit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who has been treated and followed up for more than 12 months by the same&#xD;
             general practitioner (GP)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension measured at least once during the past 12 months and not under control at&#xD;
             the time of inclusion in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  isolated systolic hypertension, namely systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and&#xD;
                  diastolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  systolic/diastolic hypertension, namely systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and&#xD;
                  diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg, if the&#xD;
                  patient has diabetes or chronic renal insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with one or more antihypertensives which remains unchanged during the month&#xD;
             prior to collecting the data&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decision by the GP to add telmisartan (either in combination with hydrochlorothiazide&#xD;
             (HCTZ) or not) to the antihypertensive treatment; this decision is made by the&#xD;
             treating doctor regardless of participation in the study. The prescription is issued&#xD;
             in the normal way, in accordance with the conditions set down in the marketing&#xD;
             authorisation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent of the patient to collect his/her data&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient refuses to allow his/her data to be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Change in the antihypertensive treatment during the month prior to collection of the&#xD;
             data&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure under control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The recommended target values corresponding to control of diastolic and systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure are important because of the diseases associated with hypertension&#xD;
             consequently, and in order to prevent the collection process becoming too complicated,&#xD;
             data from patients with severe renal insufficiency or with proteinuria of ≥ 1 g/L or&#xD;
             more are not collected in the context of this study&#xD;
