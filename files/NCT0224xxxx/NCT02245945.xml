    <description>Participants will be instructed to use TFV 1% vaginal gel according to the BAT 24 regimen (2 gel doses) at least twice per week, regardless of sexual frequency.&#xD;
The BAT24 dosing regimen when used with sex is defined as one dose of gel within 12 hours before sex and a second dose of gel as soon as possible within 12 hours after sex and no more than two doses in a 24 hour period. Participants who do engage in sexual intercourse should use the BAT24 regimen with each sex act.&#xD;
If used without sex, the BAT24 dosing regimen is defined as 2 doses of gel administered 2-24 hours apart, with no more than two doses in a 24 hour period.</description>
