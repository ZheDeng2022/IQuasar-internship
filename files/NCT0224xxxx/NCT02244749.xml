      The researcher can proved that certain compounds play an important role in the prevention of&#xD;
      skin cancer. Researcher can use specific compounds, which classified as metabolic enzymes,&#xD;
      and lower concentrations and complete absent in skin cancer cells. Researcher can biopsies of&#xD;
      normal skin and precancerous or cancerous lesions, and can compare the concentrations of&#xD;
      these compounds to determine the difference between the two areas. The result can lead to&#xD;
      further understanding of skin cancers and pre-cancers. Because skin cancers and pre-cancers&#xD;
      are so common, any knowledge would be very useful for many people in the future and may be&#xD;
      used for development of future treatments or prevention strategies.&#xD;

      Biopsy procedure will be done at the Beckman Laser Institute or at the Dermatology Clinic&#xD;
      Gottschalk Medical Plaza, of University of California, Irvine. Standard procedure of punch&#xD;
      biopsy will be done in the areas determined by the physician researchers. The normal skin&#xD;
      biopsy will be obtained from an area of skin without any suspicious lesions located on an&#xD;
      area of the body. Biopsy specimens will be stored frozen at Beckman Laser Institute&#xD;
      chemistry-lab for research and will be assigned with subject ID number, there will be no&#xD;
      personnel health information attach to the skin specimens. There will be no cost to the&#xD;
      subject or their insurer for participation in this study, except in the specific scenario of&#xD;
      a suspected skin cancer that would undergo biopsy regardless of participation in this study.&#xD;
      The time commitment for each subject is approximately 1 hour for each set of biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers can test the hypothesis that expression of key metabolic enzymes is reduced&#xD;
      and/or lost during skin cancer progression. Total ribonucleic acid, a single-stranded&#xD;
      biologic molecule involved in gene transcription, regulation, and translation, can be&#xD;
      isolated from biopsied skin specimens. Quantitative Real-Time can be performed to determine&#xD;
      the expression levels of several key metabolic enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic enzymes regulate several vital signaling pathways in the human body. Some examples&#xD;
      include hormone and bioactive lipid regulation. Aberrant regulation of these signaling&#xD;
      pathways can lead to human diseases including cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence has shown that metabolic enzyme call UGT in the genes call&#xD;
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferases were shown to have significantly reduced expression in breast&#xD;
      tumors compared with normal breast tissue from the same patients This observed loss of&#xD;
      expression is hypothesized to be causal as these two enzymes are responsible for estrogen&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, relatively little is known about metabolic enzymes and skin cancer. We have&#xD;
      preliminary data that UGT enzyme expression is lost during melanoma progression which allows&#xD;
      deregulated lipoxygenase signaling.&#xD;
