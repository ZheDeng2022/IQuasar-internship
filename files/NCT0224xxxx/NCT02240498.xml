      The objectives of this Phase 1 study are to evaluate the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      methylene-blue-mediated photodynamic therapy (MB-PDT) performed at the time of abscess&#xD;
      drainage to treat deep tissue abscesses. Safety will be evaluated by physical examination and&#xD;
      imaging and laboratory studies in order to identify adverse events that may be induced by&#xD;
      MB-PDT. We hypothesize that MB-PDT will be a safe and feasible intervention for this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep tissue abscesses remain a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay&#xD;
      despite improved surgical techniques and increasing use of perioperative antibiotics.&#xD;
      Mortality ranges from 80-100% in undrained collections and, in patients with intraperitoneal&#xD;
      abscesses, reported hospital stays have been 21-47 days. The development of image-guided&#xD;
      percutaneous drainage accompanied by antimicrobial treatment has been shown to improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes and can significantly reduce mortality in uncomplicated fluid collections to&#xD;
      5% and morbidity to 10-15%. Even under favorable conditions, the use of long-term antibiotics&#xD;
      increases the risk of acquired resistance and incidence of polymicrobial infection, which may&#xD;
      limit future options for antibiotic treatment. Further, in 23% of patients, percutaneous&#xD;
      drainage and intravenous antibiotics fail, requiring open surgical drainage, particularly in&#xD;
      patients with abscesses infected with yeast or abscesses due to a pancreatic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which exerts antimicrobial activity through the generation of&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species, may serve as a useful adjunct to current standard care of treating&#xD;
      deep tissue abscesses by reducing the microbial burden following drainage. Recent work from&#xD;
      our group demonstrated the effectiveness of methylene blue photodynamic therapy (MB-PDT)&#xD;
      against organisms within primary aspirate fluid obtained from 32 patients who underwent&#xD;
      image-guided percutaneous drainage of an abscess cavity. We found that MB-PDT was effective&#xD;
      against multiple classes of organisms, including yeast and those displaying drug resistance.&#xD;
      In these complex samples, we found no evidence of resistance to MB-PDT. These preclinical&#xD;
      results obtained with samples harvested from the kinds of abscesses that we propose to treat&#xD;
      provide a compelling rationale for evaluating the technical feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      advancing optical fibers through catheters into an abscess cavity and performing PDT at the&#xD;
      time of drainage. This clinical strategy would offer a wide range of potential health&#xD;
      benefits to patients with deep tissue abscess. Among these advantages are reduced surgical&#xD;
      intervention, decreased spread of infection, shortened course of post-treatment antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy, and decreased selective pressure for antibiotic resistance. Ultimately, this would&#xD;
      promote early recovery, shorten hospital stay, and lead to lower overall health care costs&#xD;
      for patients undergoing image-guided percutaneous abscess drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image guided percutaneous drainage is performed at the University of Rochester using CT,&#xD;
      ultrasound, or fluoroscopy. Focused imaging is performed, which confirms that the collection&#xD;
      is amenable to drainage. The site is prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The&#xD;
      overlying skin is anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. A Hawkins/micropuncture needle is inserted,&#xD;
      and the location confirmed under image guidance. The needle is advanced and placement within&#xD;
      the collection is confirmed with imaging. Syringe aspiration of the abscess material is&#xD;
      collected and sent for gram stain and culture. The needle is exchanged for a dilator and the&#xD;
      018 wire is replaced with a Coon's wire. If abscess collection contains multiple loculations,&#xD;
      the end of the Coon's wire will be used to break up the loculations. The tract is further&#xD;
      dilated with a transitional dilator followed by placement of an appropriate sized All Purpose&#xD;
      Draining Locking pigtail catheter (8-14 French) into the fluid collection. The abscess will&#xD;
      be drained by aspiration with a syringe. The catheter will be secured to the skin using 2-0&#xD;
      silk or stat-lock, dressed appropriately and connected to a drainage bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After drainage, the cavity will be flushed with sterile saline as per routine procedure.&#xD;
      Following this, and using the same catheter, the cavity will then be filled with sterile,&#xD;
      clinical grade methylene blue solution diluted 10-fold from its stock concentration of 10&#xD;
      mg/mL. The volume introduced will be matched to the cavity volume, which we estimate will not&#xD;
      exceed 270 mL. This dose is within the therapeutic range used for methylene blue. In the&#xD;
      unlikely case of the entire methylene blue dose escaping into systemic circulation, this&#xD;
      results in a full body dose of 3.85 mg/kg for a typical patient weight of 70 kg. This is&#xD;
      below the range for which adverse events have been reported for methylene blue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 10-minute incubation interval, the methylene blue solution will be aspirated from the&#xD;
      cavity and flushed twice with sterile saline. The cavity will then be filled with sterile 1%&#xD;
      Intralipid solution to gently distend the cavity and, through efficient light scattering, to&#xD;
      homogenize the light dose to the walls of the cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sterile, FDA-approved optical fiber will be advanced to the approximate center of the&#xD;
      abscess cavity via the same catheter under image guidance. The proximal end of the fiber is&#xD;
      coupled to the output of a diode laser system emitting light at 665 nm, where methylene blue&#xD;
      is activated optimally. Laser power will be delivered to the cavity at a constant fluence&#xD;
      rate at the wall of 10 - 20 milliWatts (mW) cm-2. The laser power required to obtain the&#xD;
      desired fluence rate at the wall will be calculated and documented on a written form in the&#xD;
      procedure room based on the abscess size, with total laser power in the range of 1-2 W. The&#xD;
      diode laser system being used is capable of measuring optical power, and will be used to&#xD;
      directly measure the output from the optical fiber before treating each patient. These&#xD;
      fluence rates are within an appropriate range for effective photodynamic therapy but well&#xD;
      below the intensity at which modest thermal effects are observed in tissue. Immediately after&#xD;
      laser irradiation, the Intralipid solution will be aspirated and the cavity again flushed&#xD;
      with sterile saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluence escalation will be accomplished by systematically incrementing the duration of laser&#xD;
      exposure according to a &quot;3 + 3&quot; dose escalation scheme. Under this design, the first three&#xD;
      patients will receive a 5 minute exposure of laser light. If no dose-limiting toxicities are&#xD;
      encountered, the exposure duration will be increased by 5 minutes in the next group of three&#xD;
      patients. If one dose-limiting toxicity is encountered, the next group of patients will&#xD;
      receive the same exposure duration as the previous group. If two or more dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities are encountered, the exposure will be de-escalated by 5 minutes. This process will&#xD;
      continue until the maximum number of patients are treated, or 6 patients are treated at a&#xD;
      de-escalated dose. In order to avoid excessive increases in procedure duration, the maximum&#xD;
      duration of laser exposure will be 30 minutes. A dose-limiting toxicity is defined as&#xD;
      diminished clinical condition, with evidence of one or more of the following: (i) evidence of&#xD;
      fat embolism; (ii) methylene blue escape during procedure with evidence of adverse reaction;&#xD;
      (iii) imaging evidence of clinically significant, therapy-induced disruption of the abscess&#xD;
      wall and damage to surrounding tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics as prescribed by the subject's primary team will be administered before the&#xD;
      procedure and continued post-procedure. These are selected to ensure adequate coverage and&#xD;
      taking into account subject allergies. Such administration is considered the standard of&#xD;
      care, and serves to reduce the rate of post-procedure sepsis. The subject will also be&#xD;
      administered intravenous antiemetics as needed prior to the procedure for nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure and as per routine care, a combination of IV and PO antibiotics will&#xD;
      be continued to reduce the rate of post procedure sepsis. Antiemetics will also be continued&#xD;
      as needed to reduce symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Narcotics will be prescribed and&#xD;
      administered to control pain symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is an inpatient at the time of drainage, he/she will remain hospitalized&#xD;
      post-procedure. If the subject is an outpatient at the time of drainage, he/she will be&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital post-procedure only if clinically warranted. The study doctor or his&#xD;
      designate will visit hospitalized subjects daily to assess progress and AEs. The subject's&#xD;
      clinical course will be discussed daily with the primary clinical team. Hospitalized subjects&#xD;
      will be discharged based upon response to drainage and clinical course only if clinical&#xD;
      indicators (white blood cell count, heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) are stable.&#xD;
      If the subject remains hospitalized as a result of underlying health issues that are&#xD;
      unrelated to study participation, the study doctor or his designate will continue daily&#xD;
      visits through day 5 post-procedure, hospital discharge or until the drain is removed,&#xD;
      whichever comes first. The PI will follow up with all non-hospitalized subjects daily by&#xD;
      telephone through 7 days post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be seen again at one week following the procedure to further assess for&#xD;
      progress, AEs and abscess resolution. As per departmental protocols and procedures, if the&#xD;
      abscess has resolved at day 7 as evidenced by catheter output of less than 20 cc daily and&#xD;
      limited imaging of the abscess cavity, the drainage catheter will be removed. If the abscess&#xD;
      persists beyond 7 days despite drainage, the catheter will remain in place and be evaluated&#xD;
      again at day 14. If the abscess persists at day 7 and if clinically indicated, additional&#xD;
      procedures (i.e. repeat draining with a larger diameter catheter) will be performed. MB-PDT&#xD;
      will not be repeated. Abscess resolution will be determined by either ultrasound or CT scan&#xD;
      as outlined below. Imaging at the time of catheter removal is considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study visit at day 7 post procedure is required of all subjects. If the catheter is left in&#xD;
      at that time, a second visit will be required at day 14. If the catheter is removed at day 7&#xD;
      and there are no unresolved AEs, subject study participation will end after that visit. If&#xD;
      any subject cannot return as has been scheduled, the visit will be rescheduled to their&#xD;
      convenience. The visits at 7 and, if necessary, 14 days post procedure are primarily to&#xD;
      determine the timing for catheter removal and are standard of care following percutaneous&#xD;
      drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a minimum, CBC w/ diff and serum creatinine will be acquired prior to the procedure. Blood&#xD;
      cultures will be obtained as clinically indicated, and drainage cultures will be obtained at&#xD;
      day 0. Additional laboratory and imaging studies will be performed as deemed clinically&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is very minimal risk of systemic skin photosensitivity after exposure to methylene&#xD;
      blue. Based on studies of the pharmacokinetics of methylene blue, it was found that the&#xD;
      majority was rapidly converted to leucomethylene blue, which is photodynamically inactive. In&#xD;
      clinical studies of MB-PDT with MB administered intratumorally, intravesically, and via&#xD;
      gargling, no skin photosensitivity was reported. Subjects will be monitored for any evidence&#xD;
      of skin photosensitivity reaction after the procedure. Due to the rapid conversion of MB to&#xD;
      leucomethylene blue in systemic circulation and the lack of photosensitivity in previous&#xD;
      studies, no special precautions will be taken to limit the exposure of subjects to light&#xD;
      after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 21 subjects enrolled in the study will be followed until all clinical findings post&#xD;
      image-guided drainage and MB-PDT have cleared. Each subject will be evaluated by imaging and&#xD;
      laboratory studies at scheduled visits 7 days post procedure and, if necessary, 14 days post&#xD;
      procedure. It is estimated that this study will take approximately 1 year to complete.&#xD;
