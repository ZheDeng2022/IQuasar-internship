        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All renal-impaired subjects must have meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be&#xD;
        eligible to be enrolled into this study. Subjects were eligible for the study if they meet&#xD;
        all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects were 18-80 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have had a clinical diagnosis of chronic renal impairment for duration&#xD;
             of at least 6 months classified as mild, moderate or severe per Cockcroft Gault&#xD;
             criteria (see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Renal insufficiency should have been stable with no acute episodes of illness within&#xD;
             the previous 2 months due to deterioration of renal function due to any etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential including those who had a tubal ligation&#xD;
             surgery but excluding those who have not experienced a menstrual period for a minimum&#xD;
             of 2 years, must have had a negative pregnancy test at the Screening and Day -1&#xD;
             visits, and must consent to use a medically-acceptable method of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the entire study period and for 1 week after the study is completed.&#xD;
             Medically acceptable methods of contraception include but were not limited to&#xD;
             abstinence, birth control pills or patches, vaginal rings, diaphragm with vaginal&#xD;
             spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), and progestin implant or injection (used&#xD;
             consistently for 3 months prior to study dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have voluntarily provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects, in the Investigator's opinion, must have been able to complete all study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All healthy control subjects must have meet all renal subject inclusion criteria as&#xD;
        outlined above with the exception of Inclusion Criteria 2 and 3 which should be substituted&#xD;
        with the following to be enrolled into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2a. Must have matched by age (± 10 years) and BMI (±10% of BMI) with some consideration for&#xD;
        race and gender to subjects with renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3b. Were medically healthy with no clinically significant abnormalities in their laboratory&#xD;
        profile as deemed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects were not be eligible for the study if they meet any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any clinically significant condition that would, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             preclude study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Uncontrolled blood pressure, i.e., subjects has a sitting systolic blood pressure &gt;180&#xD;
             mmHg or &lt;90 mmHg, and/or a sitting diastolic blood pressure &gt;120 mmHg or &lt;50 mmHg at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A Body mass Index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A known allergy or hypersensitivity to hydrocodone, or other opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have taken any investigational drug within 30 days prior to the Day 1 visit or be&#xD;
             currently enrolled in another investigational drug study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 14 days prior to the Day 1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Were taking opioids during the 30 days prior to Day 1 or needing to take opioids&#xD;
             during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Positive for HIV. Healthy control subjects must have not been Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)&#xD;
             positive, renal-impaired subjects can be HCV positive but should not be receiving&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A history of any illicit substance abuse in the past 2 years or any history of opioids&#xD;
             abuse. Subjects should not have been current abusers of alcohol and must have a&#xD;
             negative serum alcohol at Screening and Day-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Had a positive quantitative urine drug screen for illicit drugs, or non-prescribed&#xD;
             controlled substances at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Had made a plasma donation within 7 days prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Had made any significant donation or loss of blood within 56 days prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Had taken CYP2D6 and/or 3A4 inhibitors within 7 days prior to Day 1 and/or CYP2D6&#xD;
             and/or 3A4 inducers within 21 days prior to Day 1.&#xD;
