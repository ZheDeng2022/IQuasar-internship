  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria and HIV are found in the same regions of the world and developing countries are most&#xD;
      affected by both diseases. For malaria, new drugs have been introduced called ACTs. These&#xD;
      drugs are effective against malaria but little is known about how the levels of these drugs&#xD;
      in blood relate to how effective these drugs are. For HIV, a new drug has been developed&#xD;
      called dolutegravir which has potential to be widely used in developing countries. This&#xD;
      proposal will explore how dolutegravir affects the drug levels of these antimalarial drugs&#xD;
      and vice versa. In total, 46 healthy volunteers will participate in this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 90% of the malaria occurs in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO 2008), the region bearing 67%&#xD;
      of the global HIV burden (WHO 2011). Given the extensive overlap in geographical distribution&#xD;
      of these diseases, interactions between them could have profound public health consequences.&#xD;
      Significant biological interactions exist between HIV and malaria. HIV is known to increase&#xD;
      susceptibility to malaria infection (Whitworth, Morgan et al. 2000), compromise the host's&#xD;
      ability to clear malaria parasites (characterised by higher parasite densities) (Francesconi,&#xD;
      Fabiani et al. 2001), increase the risk of symptomatic malaria and contribute to malaria&#xD;
      treatment failure (Hewitt, Steketee et al. 2006). In areas of unstable transmission, malaria&#xD;
      mortality is higher in HIV-positive individuals. Additionally, placental malaria infection in&#xD;
      HIV positive individuals is associated with higher perinatal mortality, low birth weight and&#xD;
      HIV transmission, and this effect is not attenuated in subsequent pregnancies, in contrast&#xD;
      with HIV-negative individuals. Conversely, malaria infection has been shown to increase HIV&#xD;
      viral load (Hoffman, Jere et al. 1999, Kublin, Patnaik et al. 2005), with the potential for&#xD;
      both accelerated HIV disease progression and increased HIV transmission (Abu-Raddad, Patnaik&#xD;
      et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of September 2011, Uganda had 1.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS; of those with&#xD;
      clinically advanced disease, 54% (313 117) were receiving ART (WHO). As southern African&#xD;
      countries are scaling up coverage of ART, they have also stepped up the fight against Pf&#xD;
      malaria by increasing the coverage of Insecticide Treated Nets and by adopting the use of&#xD;
      artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as first line treatment of malaria (USAID&#xD;
      2011). AL and AS-AQ are the most commonly utilized regimens in sub-Saharan Africa for first&#xD;
      line treatment for malaria (WHO 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence of high rates of HIV-malaria co-infection and increasing availability of&#xD;
      both ACTs and ART in southern Africa, progressively more co-infected people will receive both&#xD;
      classes of drugs. However, the pharmacokinetics, safety and/or efficacy of ACTs such as AL,&#xD;
      AS-AQ and DHA-piperaquine in HIV-infected individuals who are on ART are poorly understood.&#xD;
      Many efficacy studies conducted as part of the drug development process of ACTs have either&#xD;
      not assessed the HIV status of study participants or systematically excluded HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals. Few studies have systematically evaluated for potential drug-drug interactions&#xD;
      in a healthy volunteer setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label, fixed sequence healthy volunteer study to compare pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
      between DTG and AL (Study A; crossover design), or AS-AQ (Study B; parallel group design).&#xD;
      Whilst a cross-over study design would be theoretically ideal for investigating both ACTs in&#xD;
      combination with DTG, desethylamodiaquine, an active metabolite of AQ has an extensive&#xD;
      terminal t1/2 of approximately 10 days; therefore it is not considered feasible to undertake&#xD;
      a cross-over design for this arm of the study, since the washout period between the two&#xD;
      phases would exceed two months, risking subject attrition. Furthermore, during that time&#xD;
      period, intercurrent illnesses and other important changes may occur within a subject,&#xD;
      leading changes in eligibility for the study. Therefore, two study designs are planned as&#xD;
      detailed in the Study Design Section.&#xD;
