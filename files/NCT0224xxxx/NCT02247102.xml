      The study shall investigate whether isomaltulose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is digested and absorbed to a comparable degree like other carbohydrates (CHO) used as&#xD;
           ingredients for this age group (e.g. sucrose), by measuring the H2 exhalation in the&#xD;
           postprandial period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  does not mediate abdominal discomfort or diarrhoea and is therefore as well tolerated as&#xD;
           other CHO (e.g. sucrose), by/in healthy infants aged 6 to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that isomaltulose, provided with a standard follow-on formula,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. will not significantly increase the mean basal breath H2-excretion rate (determined as&#xD;
           the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of H2-exhalation) over a 3 h postprandial&#xD;
           period compared to a sucrose containing standard follow-on formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. will not lead to a significantly different gastrointestinal tolerance in the conse-quent&#xD;
           24 h after formula consumption compared to a sucrose containing standard follow-on&#xD;
           formula in infants aged 6 to 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will be scheduled on Study Day 1 and Study Day 2. The caretakers will be&#xD;
      asked to feed their infant with their usual standard formula in the morning of Study Day 1&#xD;
      and Study Day 2 at home (at their regular feeding time). At the study center, the infant will&#xD;
      consume his usual follow-up formula in the usual amount to wich the study product (palatinose&#xD;
      or sucrose 1 gram/kg body weight) will be added to the nearest 0.5 kg weight. The&#xD;
      introduction will be in the second meal of the day and the time between the first feeding and&#xD;
      the interventionwill be of 4h. Before and after the single consumption of the study formula&#xD;
      (baseline vs. test condition), the H2 exhalation of the infant will be measured and monitored&#xD;
      every 30 min for an additional period of 3 h. In between Study Days 1 and 2, a wash-out&#xD;
      period of at least 2 days will be implemented to reduce the potential occurrence of&#xD;
      carry-over effects.&#xD;
