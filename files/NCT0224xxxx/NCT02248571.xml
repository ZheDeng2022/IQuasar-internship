  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial with a crossover design to determine patients' preference for&#xD;
      capecitabine in combination with bevacizumab or everolimus in combination with exemestane for&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer patients and to evaluate, if any combination is associated with a&#xD;
      better quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify patients' preference for either therapy in this trial, patients without disease&#xD;
      progression or other reasons for early discontinuation will be asked for their treatment&#xD;
      preference and their treatment satisfaction. To correlate patients' preference with other&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes (PROs), quality of life (QoL) will be assessed at baseline and&#xD;
      throughout the study, using dedicated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With similarly active treatment options, it is of utmost importance to identify the treatment&#xD;
      that has the least negative impact on the patients' quality of life.&#xD;
