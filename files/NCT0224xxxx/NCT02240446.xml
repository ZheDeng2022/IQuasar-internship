    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to expand the traditional expertise in non-invasive&#xD;
      neuromodulation at the University of Minnesota towards developing novel neuromodulation&#xD;
      approaches using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for treating schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients with medication-resistant auditory hallucinations. The investigators will use tDCS&#xD;
      to stimulate prefrontal cortex. TDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can&#xD;
      modulate brain connectivity. Non-invasive brain neuromodulation will be combined&#xD;
      (paired-neuromodulation) with training of a task that requires top-down control of auditory&#xD;
      processes. Paired-neuromodulation can potentially be used as a therapeutic intervention to&#xD;
      decrease auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      25% of schizophrenia (SZ) patients report chronic auditory hallucinations (AH) despite being&#xD;
      on medication. Previous research proposed that hyperactivity of the left temporo-parietal&#xD;
      cortex (11) and hypoactivity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (12) are&#xD;
      associated with the onset of AH. While temporal cortex hyperactivity has been extensively&#xD;
      manipulated with neuromodulation interventions trying to reduce AH, results have not been&#xD;
      consistent (1,13). Recent transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) work that targeted&#xD;
      both regions above by applying excitatory stimulation over the left DLPFC and inhibitory&#xD;
      stimulation on the left temporo-parietal cortex reported a 30% reduction in AH in patients&#xD;
      with medication refractory AH that lasted up to 3 months after treatment (14). The&#xD;
      investigators are interested to further investigate whether the use of paired neuromodulation&#xD;
      (P-NM) with tDCS in co-targeting top-down executive control with bottom-up sensory processes&#xD;
      would result in a larger reduction in AH. To date, there are no studies that have used P-NM&#xD;
      to examine the magnitude of plasticity of executive control on sensory processing in SZ&#xD;
      patients. This type of P-NM would be relevant since AH are thought to be the result of a lack&#xD;
      of top-down control over perceptual distortions of internally generated speech. In the&#xD;
      forced-attention dichotic listening task (DL), two different syllables are simultaneously&#xD;
      presented to the left and the right ear. Subjects are required to pay attention to and report&#xD;
      either the left or right ear stimulus. Due to the preponderance of the contralateral&#xD;
      pathways, the right ear syllable is projected to the left temporal lobe for processing, while&#xD;
      the left ear stimulus is projected to the right temporal lobe and has to be transferred&#xD;
      across the corpus callosum to be processed in the left hemisphere. Healthy controls show a&#xD;
      right ear advantage (REA) while SZ patients do not (15). DL task performance requires&#xD;
      top-down control over auditory cortex and has been associated with increased DLPFC activation&#xD;
      in controls (16). Worse performance in this task has been associated with greater severity of&#xD;
      AH (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS: The overall aim is to examine the efficacy of tDCS intervention combined with&#xD;
      sensory gating training (paired neuro-modulation; P-NM) to reduce hallucinations (as measured&#xD;
      by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale). The&#xD;
      investigators will collect pilot data to explore the magnitude of DLPFC plasticity during&#xD;
      executive control on auditory processing using P-NM and its effect on hallucination-related&#xD;
      behavior. The investigators will combine tDCS to enhance left DLPFC activity with auditory&#xD;
      stimuli presented to the right ear. The investigators will use the DL task to assess&#xD;
      plasticity of top-down control over auditory sensory perception before and after&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators will correlate DL task performance to the magnitude of left&#xD;
      DLPFC plasticity and with AH severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that (a) DLPFC enhancement will facilitate REA in SZ patients&#xD;
      by supporting inhibition of attention to irrelevant syllable and facilitating attention to&#xD;
      the right ear syllable; (b) continued pairing of left DLPFC activity and auditory processing&#xD;
      will reduce auditory hallucinations (as measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and&#xD;
      the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will recruit 50 SZ patients with persistent severe AH despite&#xD;
      medication as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Auditory&#xD;
      Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS). To examine the effects of P-NM over time, patients will&#xD;
      receive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during five days, twice a day while&#xD;
      they practice the dichotic listening task (DL; Hugdahl 2013). During the DL task, patients&#xD;
      will be presented with consonant-vowel syllables via headphones. The syllables will consist&#xD;
      of paired presentations of the six stop-consonants /b/, /d/, /g/, /p/, /t/, and /k/ together&#xD;
      with the vowel /a/ to form dichotic consonant-vowel syllable pairs of the type /ba - ga/,/ta&#xD;
      - ka/ etc. The syllables were paired with each other for all possible combinations, thus&#xD;
      yielding 36 dichotic pairs, including the homonymic pairs. Patients will be given two&#xD;
      different instructions. In one instruction condition they will be told to focus attention to&#xD;
      and report from the right ear, and if think they hear something in the left ear, this should&#xD;
      be ignored (&quot;forced-right&quot; condition). In the other condition, patients will be asked to&#xD;
      focus attention to and report from the left ear, and if they think that they hear something&#xD;
      in the right ear, this should be ignored (&quot;forced-left&quot; condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive either active tDCS treatment or sham stimulation while performing&#xD;
      the DL task. Half of them (n=25) will receive either (a) electrical stimulation (2mA) for 20&#xD;
      minutes to the left DLPFC to enhance top-down control and improve the tuning or gating of the&#xD;
      extraneous information or (b) while the other half will receive sham stimulation to control&#xD;
      for placebo effects. Active tDCS and sham tDCS will be performed with the same tDCS&#xD;
      equipment. The difference is that while active tDCS will be configured to reach constant 2mA&#xD;
      stimulation for 20 minutes, sham tDCS will be a very brief 2mA stimulation for 30 seconds.&#xD;
      During sham tDCS the subject believes he/she is being stimulated normally, but there should&#xD;
      not be any real effects. This same procedure will be repeated during five days, twice a day.&#xD;
      At the end of day 5 all patients will complete the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and&#xD;
      the AHRS to evaluate change in AH. Patients will be asked to complete these scales 3, 6, and&#xD;
      9 months after tDCS intervention to examine long-term effects.&#xD;
