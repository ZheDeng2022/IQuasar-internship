      The purpose of the study is to test the safety of six cycles of cenersen treatment and to&#xD;
      begin to test the hypothesis that intermittent administration of cenersen may lead to a&#xD;
      reduced dependence on transfusion.&#xD;

      The study is a nonrandomized open-label treatment with varying doses of cenersen by&#xD;
      intravenous administration to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      *To assess the safety profile and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of cenersen for each of&#xD;
      three increasing dose levels as stipulated by the protocol in patients with lower risk MDS&#xD;
      defined as low or intermediate-1 risk by IPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the lowest pharmacologically active exposure from among three increasing&#xD;
           dose levels as stipulated by the protocol that exhibits the desired activity on&#xD;
           erythropoiesis after evaluation of all dose levels, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if intermittent treatment with cenersen will reduce transfusion&#xD;
           requirements for patients with lower risk MDS.&#xD;

          -  Active hepatitis B or C or other active liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic use (&gt;2 weeks) of greater than physiologic doses of corticosteroid agent (dose&#xD;
