  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inpatient treatment for complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) continues to have a high&#xD;
      mortality in Africa. This is partly because children are commonly brought for admission&#xD;
      because they are seriously ill, rather than being brought to hospital because of malnutrition&#xD;
      alone. Mortality rates are especially high where SAM is complicated by HIV or TB. The early&#xD;
      phase of inpatient nutritional treatment for severe acute malnutrition is based on a&#xD;
      low-protein milk known as F75, which is given to improve metabolic homeostasis prior to the&#xD;
      re-feeding to achieve catch-up growth. F75 provides a high proportion of energy from&#xD;
      carbohydrates, including sucrose, lactose and maltodextrin. However, malabsorption of&#xD;
      different types of carbohydrates, but lactose in particular, is known to occur in SAM and may&#xD;
      lead to osmotic diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is common in children with SAM and is associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality. Furthermore, switching from a catabolic state to a high energy diet that&#xD;
      consists of predominantly carbohydrates can lead to 're-feeding syndrome' that may lead to&#xD;
      severe electrolyte abnormalities and multiple organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to determine whether reducing the carbohydrate content of F75, and&#xD;
      removing lactose, improves the stabilisation of severely malnourished children. The trial&#xD;
      will involve randomising children who are eligible to receive F75 milk to either the current&#xD;
      formulation or a revised formulation. Both formulations will be given according to current&#xD;
      recommendations regarding frequency of feeding and caloric value. Since the purpose of F75 is&#xD;
      to stabilise the child metabolically and biochemically, the primary endpoint of the trial&#xD;
      will be time to stabilisation (the end of the first phase of treatment for severe acute&#xD;
      malnutrition). Blood and stool samples at admission and after three days will be used to&#xD;
      determine the effects on carbohydrate and fat malabsorption and evidence of the re-feeding&#xD;
      syndrome. Children will be followed up until discharge from hospital. The project has been&#xD;
      planned in consultation with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and, if the revised&#xD;
      formulation of F75 results in improved outcomes, will lead to a global change in&#xD;
      recommendations for its formulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Admission to hospital with complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Africa commonly has&#xD;
      a case fatality of 10-30%. Importantly, children are usually admitted to hospital because&#xD;
      they are severely ill rather than for malnutrition alone. Mortality may be improved to some&#xD;
      extent by adherence to WHO recommended management, but the direct application of these&#xD;
      guidelines to all contexts is controversial. The WHO guidelines were designed on the basis of&#xD;
      historical data on nutrient requirements and medical treatments and almost none of the&#xD;
      recommendations are supported by evidence from clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment of complicated inpatient SAM, the guidelines consist of three distinct&#xD;
      phases of treatment: phase 1 or stabilization phase where a low protein, liquid diet (F75) is&#xD;
      introduced with a reduced energy intake (80-100 kcal/kg/day). Once a child has stabilised,&#xD;
      there is a 'transition phase' consisting of either ready to use therapeutic foods (RUTF) with&#xD;
      supplemental F75 or alternatively another milk formula known as F100. RUTF is a peanut based,&#xD;
      energy dense supplement used to obtain catch-up growth. F100 is a liquid formula with a&#xD;
      higher energy density and protein content than F75. The caloric intake is increased daily to&#xD;
      a maximum of 130 kcal/kg/day. Finally, 'Phase 3' is the recovery phase during which the aim&#xD;
      is to achieve catch-up growth with either RUTF or F100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, the highest mortality rate is found in the early phases of treatment. Children who&#xD;
      fail treatment early often have profuse diarrhoea, signs of circulatory insufficiency which&#xD;
      is hard to treat. The most recent reports from Zambia and Kenya note a prevalence of&#xD;
      diarrhoea of more than 60% amongst children with SAM and it is associated with increased&#xD;
      mortality. Currently at Kilifi County Hospital and Coast Provincial General Hospital, ~20% of&#xD;
      children are given either a diluted or lactose-free milk feed during rehabilitation of SAM,&#xD;
      although there are no specific guidelines for this. Diarrhoea may be caused by a viral or&#xD;
      bacterial gastroenteritis, sepsis, or may be nutritionally induced (osmotic). There are no&#xD;
      routinely available tests to distinguish osmotic from infective or other causes of diarrhoea&#xD;
      in hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of energy derived from carbohydrates in F75 is high. The carbohydrates in F75&#xD;
      milk (as well as F100 and RUTF) consist of a mixture of maltodextrin, sucrose and lactose.&#xD;
      Disaccharides such as maltose, lactose or sucrose are normally hydrolysed into&#xD;
      monosaccharides by disaccharidases localized at the tip of small intestinal villi. The&#xD;
      monosaccharides such as glucose and galactose can then be transported across the apical&#xD;
      membrane through Na+ dependent glucose transporter, whilst fructose makes use of a&#xD;
      facilitative fructose transporter. There is limited information on the intestinal function&#xD;
      and intestinal carbohydrate absorption in malnourished children. However, data from Jamaica&#xD;
      and South Africa suggest that there is impaired absorption of disaccharides (lactose and&#xD;
      sucrose), regardless of the presence or suspicion of gastroenteritis. Limited histological&#xD;
      evidence has shown intestinal atrophy in children with SAM. These data are consistent with&#xD;
      clinical signs of lactose malabsorption found in children with severe malnutrition. Recently,&#xD;
      evidence of impaired absorption of monosaccharide glucose in children with SAM was reported&#xD;
      in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from diarrhoea, early deterioration may also be related to severe metabolic&#xD;
      derangements due to a sudden change from a catabolic to an anabolic state, resulting in&#xD;
      refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome is characterized by hypophosphataemia, hypokalaemia,&#xD;
      hypomagnesaemia and sodium retention. These severe electrolyte disturbances can lead to&#xD;
      impaired cardiac, pulmonary and neurological function and are often hard to treat. By&#xD;
      receiving energy predominantly from sugars, pancreatic insulin secretion is increased which&#xD;
      induces uptake of electrolytes including phosphate and potassium, into cells. Furthermore, as&#xD;
      protein synthesis is stimulated, increased production of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) leads&#xD;
      to a higher cellular demand for phosphate. Although insulin secretion appears to be partially&#xD;
      impaired in the early stages of refeeding, hypophosphatemia is a common feature during&#xD;
      refeeding of malnourished children, and is associated with mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigators aim to evaluate the outcome of using a revised formulation&#xD;
      of F75 milk with reduced carbohydrate composition and without lactose, compared to the&#xD;
      current formulation of F75 during the initial stabilisation period amongst children with&#xD;
      severe acute malnutrition. In the new formulation, more will be provided by lipids and the&#xD;
      total energy provided will be unchanged. The trial will be undertaken in two hospitals in&#xD;
      Kenya and one hospital in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment and follow up was completed in December 2015, laboratory analysis of plasma and&#xD;
      faecal samples in ongoing.&#xD;
