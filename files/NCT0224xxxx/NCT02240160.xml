  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of oral pH on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oromucosal dose of&#xD;
      Sativex (four sprays containing 10.8 mg Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 10 mg cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD)) by comparing the PK profile of Sativex in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical hypothesis is that there will be an effect of oral pH on the PK of&#xD;
      Sativex when administered as a single oromucosal dose (four sprays).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomised, open-label, three-way crossover study to assess the effects of&#xD;
      oral pH on the PK of Sativex. Subjects will receive each of the following treatments in a&#xD;
      random order across three residential treatment visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A (acidic oral pH): Sativex (four sprays) after pre-treatment with Coca-Cola;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B (neutral oral pH): Sativex (four sprays) after pre-treatment with tap water;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C (alkaline oral pH): Sativex (four sprays) after pre-treatment with an oral&#xD;
           suspension of magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target pH for each treatment will be determined from the results of a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose administration will be separated by at least seven days. Study subjects will&#xD;
      participate in a total of five study visits.&#xD;
