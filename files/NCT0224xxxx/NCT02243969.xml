    <textblock>
      Rationale: Increased intakes of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentanoic&#xD;
      acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), mainly found in fatty fish, are recommended for&#xD;
      the prevention of coronary heart disease. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3n-3) is the most&#xD;
      common vegetable-oil based n-3 fatty acid. Evidence exists that ALA supplementation can also&#xD;
      have a protective effect on the development on cardiovascular disease, but may exert its&#xD;
      cardio protective effects through different routes. The benefit may (partly) be due to blood&#xD;
      pressure lowering. However, evidence for beneficial effects of ALA on blood pressure is&#xD;
      conflicting. Therefore, we propose to investigate the effect of flaxseed oil, high in ALA,&#xD;
      using a study powered on 24-hour blood pressure, in a population with high normal blood&#xD;
      pressure and mild hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To study the effects of flaxseed oil, rich in ALA on 24h-ambulatory mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) in men and women with high-normal blood pressure and mild hypertension&#xD;
      compared to high oleic sunflower oil, poor in ALA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Using a double blind randomized, placebo-controlled parallel design, subjects&#xD;
      will receive at random daily 10 g of flaxseed oil or a high-oleic acid sunflower oil (HOSF)&#xD;
      as control for twelve weeks, with a run-in period of 14 days in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 72 men and women, aged 40-70 years, with untreated high-normal blood&#xD;
      pressure and stage I hypertension and a body mass index between 25 and 35 kg/m2 will&#xD;
      participate in the run-in and intervention period. It is estimated that 144 subject have to&#xD;
      be screened to find 72 subjects that will enter the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: During the run-in period, subjects will receive daily 10 g of palm super olein&#xD;
      oil. During the intervention period subjects receive either 10 g of HOSF or flaxseed oil. All&#xD;
      oils are provided in bottles of 5 g, one will be consumed at breakfast or lunch and one at&#xD;
      dinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the change in 24h-ambulatory&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure (MAP)&#xD;
