  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decompression sickness syndrome (DCS) is caused by microbubbles forming in blood vessels or&#xD;
      tissues during a reduction in environmental pressure (decompression). Bubbles have&#xD;
      mechanical, embolic and biochemical effects with manifestations ranging from none to fatal.&#xD;
      By reducing bubble volume and hastening inert gas elimination, recompression therapy with&#xD;
      hyperbaric treatment remains the main therapy for DCS. The most common hyperbaric protocol&#xD;
      used, is based on US Navy Treatment table 6, started as early as possible after surfacing.&#xD;
      The outcome of hyperbaric therapy varies with reported complete resolution in 13%-63% of the&#xD;
      patients suffering from severe DCS, and in 73%-100% of the patients with mild-moderate DCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of time to recompression is controversial. It has been suggested that early&#xD;
      hyperbaric treatment improves the outcome by decreasing bubble size and avoiding further&#xD;
      tissue injury. However, in recent studies time to recompression had very little effect on&#xD;
      clinical recovery. Moreover, the time beyond which hyperbaric treatment isn't effective has&#xD;
      not been determined yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of delayed hyperbaric treatment to&#xD;
      divers who referred to tertiary care hospital hyperbaric unit, more than 48 hours after&#xD;
      surfacing. The clinical outcome of the delayed hyperbaric treatments was compared to early&#xD;
      treatments given at the same hyperbaric unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From January 2000 to February 2014, 204 divers were treated for DCS in the institute of&#xD;
      Hyperbaric Medicine, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected retrospectively from medical records and include age, sex, diving&#xD;
      experience, maximal depth, DCS possible cause, DCS type, symptoms, time from surfacing to&#xD;
      symptoms onset, time from surfacing to recompression, recompression table, additional&#xD;
      treatment after the first recompression and treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done using univariant analysis was performed using Spearman's&#xD;
      correlation and Chi-Square in categoric variabales, independent t-test in numeric variables.&#xD;
      This will be performed in SPSS v.21 software.&#xD;
