      The purpose of this study is to investigate the cytokine levels in nasal lavage and gene&#xD;
      expression in nasal scraping following a single nasal dose of JNJ-43260295 in healthy&#xD;
      participants, and in atopic mild to mild-persistent asthmatic (breathing disorder in which&#xD;
      there is wheezing and difficulty in breathing) participants with and without nasal allergen&#xD;
      challenge prior to dosing.&#xD;

      This study consists of 2 parts. In first part, healthy adult participants will receive a&#xD;
      single nasal dose of JNJ-43260295 or placebo in a double blind (both the participant and&#xD;
      investigator do not know whether participant is assigned to receive study medication or&#xD;
      placebo), randomized (study medication or placebo assigned to participants by chance), and&#xD;
      placebo-controlled (study in which the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to a&#xD;
      placebo) setting. In second part, which will be open label (participants and investigators&#xD;
      are aware about the treatment, participants are receiving), atopic participants with mild to&#xD;
      mild-persistent asthma will participate in 3 consecutive treatment periods (Period 1, 2, and&#xD;
      3). In Period 1, each participant will receive a single nasal dose of JNJ-43260295 without&#xD;
      prior nasal allergen challenge. In Period 2, each participant will receive a single nasal&#xD;
      dose of JNJ-43260295, preceded by a nasal allergen challenge approximately 15 hours prior to&#xD;
      the JNJ-43260295 dosing. In Period 3, each participant will receive single nasal allergen&#xD;
      challenge without JNJ-43260295. There will be a washout period of at least 21 days between 3&#xD;
      consecutive treatment periods. Cytokine levels in nasal lavage and gene expression in nasal&#xD;
      scraping will be primarily evaluated during all treatment periods. Participants' safety will&#xD;
      be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
