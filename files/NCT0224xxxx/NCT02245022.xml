      Aim: To evaluate dolutegravir (DTG) pharmacokinetics in pregnant HIV-infected women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: In developing countries many women present with a new HIV diagnosis in late&#xD;
      pregnancy, and are at high risk of transmitting infection during delivery. Moreover, women&#xD;
      may acquire NNRTI resistance from primary transmission, or use of nevirapine (NVP) in&#xD;
      previous pregnancies. In these circumstances, DTG is likely to be more effective in reducing&#xD;
      mother to child transmission of HIV than NNRTI-based regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: HIV positive pregnant women presenting with untreated HIV infection in late&#xD;
      (≥28 -36 weeks gestation) pregnancy will be randomised 1:1 to receive DTG (50mg once daily)&#xD;
      or standard of care (nevirapine or efavirenz) + 2 NRTIs. PK (0-24h) profile will be sampled&#xD;
      in third trimester and post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this is primarily a PK study (and has been powered as such) randomisation is&#xD;
      included to allow comparison of plasma HIV VL responses against standard of care (NVP or EFV)&#xD;
      and is essential for evaluation of secondary endpoints of safety and efficacy of DTG in&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is able to effectively reduce mother-to-child&#xD;
      transmission (MTCT) of HIV. If untreated, the risk of transmission is around 25% (greater&#xD;
      with high viral loads) but ART administered optimally during pregnancy may reduce this risk&#xD;
      to 1-2%. In order to successfully prevent infection, ART should be started in the first or&#xD;
      second trimester, and should reduce maternal plasma viral load to undetectable levels.&#xD;
      Unfortunately throughout low-middle income countries, MTCT rates are unacceptably high with&#xD;
      an estimated 430 000 newborn children infected annually. The main causes for this are&#xD;
      undiagnosed or late diagnosis of maternal infection, suboptimal adherence to therapy and drug&#xD;
      resistance, particularly in mothers who have previously received single dose nevirapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), women frequently engage with health services late in pregnancy,&#xD;
      and new HIV diagnoses in the third trimester (≥28 weeks of pregnancy) are not uncommon. Risk&#xD;
      of MTCT is high, especially as NNRTI-based therapy takes a median of 2 months to&#xD;
      significantly reduce the HIV viral load, making it unlikely that commencement of these drugs&#xD;
      in late pregnancy will offer protection of the infant from intrapartum transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vertical transmission of HIV remains a significant challenge in developing countries and&#xD;
      antiretroviral prophylaxis for PMTCT is an important tool towards elimination of paediatric&#xD;
      infections. Between 2009 and 2010, coverage of antiretroviral prophylaxis for prevention of&#xD;
      mother to child transmission was 42% and an estimated 1.48 million infants were born to women&#xD;
      living with HIV (WHO 2010). Global efforts are geared towards improving access to&#xD;
      antiretrovirals for PMTCT by simplifying antiretroviral treatment protocols while ensuring&#xD;
      optimal outcomes for HIV-infected women and their children (WHO 2010; WHO 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under consolidated antiretroviral guidelines issued by the WHO in 2013, efavirenz-based ART&#xD;
      is now recommended the preferred NNRTI option for HIV-1 infected patients, including among&#xD;
      women of childbearing age and pregnant women (WHO 2013). In 2012, Uganda adopted the Option&#xD;
      B+ strategy for PMTCT of HIV. Under this strategy, lifelong ART is offered to all pregnant&#xD;
      ART naïve women irrespective of CD4 count with efavirenz-based ART as the preferred treatment&#xD;
      option. However, the effectiveness of this regimen could be compromised in the event of large&#xD;
      populations of women who may have been either exposed to single dose nevirapine in the past&#xD;
      or among women with transmitted NNRTI resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The justification for studying DTG in pregnancy includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Likely widespread availability of generic DTG in the coming years. The manufacturer has&#xD;
           indicated its willingness to make DTG available in low income countries, and is&#xD;
           currently engaging with generic manufacturers. Estimates from the Clinton Foundation&#xD;
           suggest that generic manufacture of DTG will make this drug affordable either as an&#xD;
           alternative first line, or else second line agent (Hill 2013). Clinical guidelines from&#xD;
           the US and Europe currently rank INSTIs such as raltegravir and elvitegravir alongside&#xD;
           NNRTIs as preferred first line agents. INSTIs may replace NNRTIs in first line regimens&#xD;
           due to their good safety and toxicity profile, lower propensity for drug interactions,&#xD;
           and superior efficacy. Large phase III RCTs comparing raltegravir (Rockstroh, Dejesus et&#xD;
           al. 2013), elvitegravir (Sax, DeJesus et al. 2012) and dolutegravir (van Lunzen,&#xD;
           Maggiolo et al. 2012) against efavirenz-based therapy have shown superior virological&#xD;
           outcome at 48 weeks, faster time to undetectable viral load, lower incidence of adverse&#xD;
           events, and fewer treatment discontinuations, and these findings have recently been&#xD;
           confirmed in a meta-analysis (Messiaen, Wensing et al. 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low risk for serious drug-drug interactions. The potential for drug-drug interactions is&#xD;
           significantly less for INSTIs compared with other antiretrovirals (relative risk&#xD;
           compared with raltegravir: boosted protease inhibitors [RR = 4.96], non-nucleoside&#xD;
           reverse transcriptase inhibitors [RR = 2.48](Patel, Abdelsayed et al. 2011). These are&#xD;
           particularly important considerations for low/middle income country settings where&#xD;
           adults with newly diagnosed HIV infection often present with tuberculosis, or during&#xD;
           antenatal screening in late pregnancy. Here DTG may carry significant advantages over&#xD;
           NNRTIs, and other INSTIs. In the absence of alternatives to rifampicin-based TB therapy,&#xD;
           DTG and raltegravir exposures are only moderately reduced (Dooley, Sayre et al. 2013),&#xD;
           compared to larger (50-90%) reductions in concentrations of boosted PIs, nevirapine and&#xD;
           elvitegravir. Dolutegravir is metabolized by glucuronidation (UGT1A1) with some&#xD;
           contribution from CYP3A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rapid viral load drop potentially beneficial in late diagnosis during pregnancy. In&#xD;
           Sub-Saharan Africa, pregnant mothers tend to engage with health services later in&#xD;
           pregnancy compared with Europe, and new HIV diagnoses resulting from universal testing&#xD;
           at ≥28w gestation are frequent. DTG results in a very rapid reduction in viral load;&#xD;
           median time to undetectable viral load in the SINGLE study was 28 days vs. 84 days with&#xD;
           Atripla (P&lt;0.0001) (Walmsley, Antela et al. 2012). Use of DTG may lower risk of&#xD;
           mother-to-child transmission of HIV in late presenters. Although meta-analysis shows no&#xD;
           increase in birth defects with maternal efavirenz (Ford, Mofenson et al. 2010), there&#xD;
           has been recent suspicion of neurological toxicity in a large French registry (Sibiude,&#xD;
           Madelbrot et al. 2013) and neurodevelopmental delay in a South African cohort&#xD;
           (Westreich, Rubel et al. 2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Proven efficacy in patients with established drug resistance to other antiretrovirals.&#xD;
           In most resource-poor settings, options for anti-retroviral therapy are limited (2011),&#xD;
           and the emergence of HIV drug resistance gives cause for concern (Hedt, Wadonda-Kabondo&#xD;
           et al. 2008; WHO 2012). In a cross-sectional study conducted among HIV-1 antiretroviral&#xD;
           naïve patients in five African countries, the highest prevalence of transmitted&#xD;
           resistance was observed in Kampala, Uganda 12.3% (22 of 179; 7.5-17.1) (Hamers, Wallis&#xD;
           et al. 2011). In Malawi, the prevalence of primary drug resistance in new infections was&#xD;
           6.1% which is comparable with figures of ~3% for South Africa (Manasa, Katzenstein et&#xD;
           al. 2012), and 5.7% for Zambia (Hamers, Siwale et al. 2010), with over half of all&#xD;
           mutations conferring resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptases (NNRTI)&#xD;
           (Wadonda-Kabondo, Banda et al. 2012). Studies across Africa have shown that treatment&#xD;
           response to NNRTIs in mothers and children exposed to nevirapine (particularly single&#xD;
           dose) during pregnancy is blunted (Musiime, Ssali et al. 2009). In this context, a novel&#xD;
           class of ARV which is safe, affordable and effective is an urgent need&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety profile in pregnancy. DTG is classified as FDA pregnancy Category B. There are no&#xD;
           adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction&#xD;
           studies are not always predictive of human response, and dolutegravir was shown to cross&#xD;
           the placenta in animal studies, the manufacturer recommends that this drug should be&#xD;
           used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (ViiV 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Necessity of investigating DTG PK in pregnant women. Alongside the clinical and&#xD;
           humanitarian imperative to provide effective treatment for preventing HIV transmission&#xD;
           in pregnant mothers with NNRTI-resistant HIV, there is an equally important ethical&#xD;
           imperative to establish the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of DTG in pregnant&#xD;
           mothers and their breastfed infants in SSA, especially given the implementation of WHO&#xD;
           Option B+, and the potential for widespread use of DTG in the forseeable future.&#xD;
           Previous experience suggests it is universally the case that pregnant women in SSA&#xD;
           receive new antiretrovirals (ARV) ahead of any proper evaluation, and clinical studies&#xD;
           (if undertaken at all) occur at a much later stage after many mothers and infants have&#xD;
           been exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Importance of undertaking the study in SSA. Any pivotal study if undertaken in developed&#xD;
           countries would have limited generalizability to an African setting because i) ARVs tend&#xD;
           to be initiated later in gestation in newly presenting pregnant women, ii) the standard&#xD;
           of care across SSA is likely to be an efavirenz or nevirapine-based regimen iii) infant&#xD;
           breastfeeding is recommended in the presence of ARVs ii) host factors such as BMI,&#xD;
           ethnicity etc may impact on pharmacokinetics (PK) of ARVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Continued administration of DTG for 2 weeks post-partum (whilst breastfeeding) to&#xD;
           characterize PK in non-pregnant state. Under standard of care, the infant will receive 6&#xD;
           weeks of nevirapine syrup, and would be exposed to the NNRTI/NRTI/NRTI combination&#xD;
           received by the mother under standard of care. In this study, infants will be exposed&#xD;
           DTG via the breastmilk for a 2 week period following birth. We believe this risk to be&#xD;
           acceptable given the potential benefits. Furthermore, the risk is unlikely to exceed any&#xD;
           potential risk of in utero exposure to DTG. Drug-drug interactions between directly&#xD;
           administered NVP and DTG ingested via the breastmilk are unlikely to have clinical&#xD;
           significance, although we will study this. The potential risks of breastfeeding are&#xD;
           fewer than those of giving formula feeding during the two week period that mothers&#xD;
           continue to receive DTG postpartum. Replacement of breast feeding with formula feeding&#xD;
           during the first two weeks post-partum would be unethical due to the loss of the immune&#xD;
           benefits of colostrum to the neonate, risks intrinsic to formula feeding in low resource&#xD;
           settings and increased risk of HIV transmission if mixed feeding occurs (Teasdale et al,&#xD;
           2011) The potential risks of low-level ARV causing drug-resistance in the infant should&#xD;
           the PMTCT fail exist for the standard of care NNRTIs and NRTIs; it is not anticipated&#xD;
           that DTG will carry a greater risk but nevertheless this is best monitored within a&#xD;
           clinical trial setting before widespread uptake without monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Open label randomized trial of DTG in late pregnancy. HIV+ pregnant women&#xD;
      (untreated at ≥28w gestation will be randomized 1:1 to receive a DTG-based regimen compared&#xD;
      with standard of care (regimen not containing INSTI).&#xD;
