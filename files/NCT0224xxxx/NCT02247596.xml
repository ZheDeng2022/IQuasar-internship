  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of our study was to examine the effects of two weeks of oral resveratrol on&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic obese male subjects.&#xD;
      Secondary variables included plasma lipid subfraction, blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin&#xD;
      (HbA1c).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients were recruited between July 2009 and July 2012 from a single hospital in Singapore.&#xD;
      Eligible patients were Chinese males, aged between 21 and 55 years old, with a body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or more and venous glucose of &lt;7.0 and &lt;11.1 mmol/L at 0 and 120&#xD;
      minutes respectively on oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) following a 12-hour fast. They&#xD;
      must be willing to abstain from embarking on an exercise regime or ingesting large quantities&#xD;
      of resveratrol-containing foods including alcohol during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial consisting of a screening&#xD;
      visit, a two-week treatment period and a post-treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was centrally performed during treatment assignment with a 2-digit reference&#xD;
      code placed in sealed opaque envelopes maintained by the person responsible for the&#xD;
      preparation of the intervention drug and placebo. Trans-resveratrol extract from Polygonum&#xD;
      Cuspidatum (Mega Resveratrol, Danbury, USA) was used in the trial. The placebo was not&#xD;
      distinguishable by color, form, or taste from the active drug. The randomization code was&#xD;
      unblinded only after all predefined data were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were given 1g three times a day of either resveratrol or placebo for two weeks and&#xD;
      instructed to abstain from foods with high resveratrol content during the entire duration of&#xD;
      the trial. Compliance was determined by pill counting at the end of the trial period.&#xD;
      Subjects in both arms were not allowed to commence on an exercise regimen or supplements&#xD;
      during the study period. Subjects who dropped out of the trial would not be replaced. All&#xD;
      variables were measured at baseline and at the end of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry using a breath-by-breath metabolic gas analyser via&#xD;
      the face-mask method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimated that a sample size of 18 patients per group (Total N = 36) was&#xD;
      needed to provide 80% power and two-sided 5% to detect a difference in a Cohen's effect size&#xD;
      of 1.0 between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 (IBM) with statistical significance set at p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 and with the percentage change from baseline as the unit of analysis. All data were&#xD;
      analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. MANOVA was performed to compare the&#xD;
      intervention and placebo groups for the unadjusted and adjusted p-values on the study&#xD;
      variables of interest. Normal distribution was verified with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and&#xD;
      data were presented as mean Â± standard deviation (SD).&#xD;
