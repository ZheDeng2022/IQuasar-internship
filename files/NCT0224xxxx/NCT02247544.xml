  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Italian, multicentre, single arm, phase II study, with an intra-patient comparison&#xD;
      end point. This study aims at confirming the activity of the drug trabectedin as&#xD;
      second/further line treatment in retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma and well&#xD;
      differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma expressed in terms of slowing down tumour growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another objective is to investigate this peculiar benefit of trabectedin in typical&#xD;
      retroperitoneal sarcomas may be exploited to help multidisciplinary clinical decision-making&#xD;
      in the management of retroperitoneal sarcomas&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas (R-STSs) are rare neoplasms, accounting for 10% to 15%&#xD;
      of Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STSs), which represent 1-3% of all cancers. They may show different&#xD;
      histological types, but the predominant ones in the retroperitoneal region are:&#xD;
      leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma. The most commonly encountered in the retroperitoneum is the well&#xD;
      differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-line chemotherapy usually consists of doxorubicin and/or ifosfamide. These two drugs&#xD;
      are the most active agents in adult STSs, with a dose-response relationship and response&#xD;
      rates between 20% and 50%. However, the sarcoma community is currently doubtful as to the&#xD;
      activity of ifosfamide in the subgroup of leiomyosarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trabectedin has been found to be mainly active in leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma and is&#xD;
      approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) as second-line chemotherapy for STSs. Although&#xD;
      the response rate observed in pre-registration studies did not exceed 10%, trabectedin&#xD;
      provided disease control, with progression arrest rates exceeding 50% and Progression Free&#xD;
      Survival (PFS) rates exceeding 20% at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since so far no phase II studies tested the activity of trabectedin in retroperitoneal&#xD;
      sarcomas, this is the specific aim of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: Patients with previously treated, histologically confirmed,&#xD;
      retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma and well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Patients&#xD;
      may be either unamenable to surgery or amenable but in whom the addition of medical treatment&#xD;
      is considered clinically advisable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational studies will be performed, with the aim of characterising the tumour biological&#xD;
      features associated with different response patterns to trabectedin. These assessments will&#xD;
      be done in 15-20 patients who will undergo surgery after trabectedin, comparing tumour tissue&#xD;
      specimens collected before and after treatment.&#xD;
