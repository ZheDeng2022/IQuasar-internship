      A part retrospective, part prospective cohort study to assess the difference in 2-year&#xD;
      overall survival in patients with stage III NSCLC receiving chemoradiotherapy with curative&#xD;
      intent in low and middle income countries before and after a training intervention on the use&#xD;
      of PET/CT for radiotherapy treatment planning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the years, the incidence of lung cancer has risen in some low and middle income&#xD;
      countries due to the rise in tobacco use. Patients commonly present with lung cancer in an&#xD;
      advanced stage (stage III and IV) are not suitable for surgical resection, but may be&#xD;
      considered for radiotherapy. For patients in those countries who are not suitable for&#xD;
      surgical resection, radiotherapy offers the best chance of cure, best improvement in local&#xD;
      cancer control, best palliation and fewest side-effects. For accurate patient selection for&#xD;
      curative treatment and accurate staging of lung cancer, the use of fused&#xD;
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography (FDG PET/CT) imaging&#xD;
      has been shown to be superior to CT alone. It has also been shown to have a significant&#xD;
      impact when used in the radiation treatment planning process and in particular for when used&#xD;
      for target volume delineation, where a significant reduction in interobserver variation has&#xD;
      been noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, many health care institutions in low and middle income countries have&#xD;
      established Nuclear Medicine (NM) imaging in routine clinical practice in conjunction with&#xD;
      modern Radiation Oncology (RO) facilities. The installation of hybrid PET/CT systems in these&#xD;
      countries permits more the increased use of PET/CT for both staging and radiotherapy&#xD;
      planning. However the successful implementation of PET/CT for radiotherapy planning (RTP)&#xD;
      requires a degree of expertise to safely and accurately implement this imaging technique. A&#xD;
      recently published review by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), about current&#xD;
      trends in NM in developing countries showed there is still lack of expertise, equipment and&#xD;
      human resources to gain benefit from this imaging technique. In RO, difficulties in the&#xD;
      implementation of this technique are mainly related to inadequate training of staff and lack&#xD;
      of local expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance of the PET/CT scanners might be compromised when not performed according to&#xD;
      accepted nuclear medicine quality assurance standards. Therefore, there is a concern that, if&#xD;
      used without appropriate training or expertise, suboptimal image quality may result and&#xD;
      inappropriate interpretation of the PET/CT for RTP may occur. In this study to help provide&#xD;
      PET Quality Control will be executed to aim for a standardized PET image quality that meets&#xD;
      the minimum requirements of European Association of Nuclear Medicine standards. Participating&#xD;
      centers will be assisted to earn the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Research&#xD;
      Ltd (EARL) accreditation. The quality of the imaging can be influenced by physiological and&#xD;
      technical factors. The Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) allows for semi quantitative&#xD;
      evaluation in PET imaging, and is influenced by these factors. Spatial resolution affects SUV&#xD;
      values significantly and this parameter can differ a lot between multiple centers. The EANM&#xD;
      NEMA NU 2001/2007 2 Image Quality Phantom allows for standardization of PET imaging between&#xD;
      centers with different scanners, using the activity coefficient recovery curve (ACRC) as a&#xD;
      parameter for quantification of this spatial resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is already known that FDG PET/CT based RTP enables appropriate selection of patients who&#xD;
      will benefit from curative radiation therapy. One possible cause of failure in radiotherapy&#xD;
      is the inability to accurately define the tumor edges. In these patients there are no other&#xD;
      possible curative salvage treatment options and the disease is incurable. It is hoped that&#xD;
      FDG PET/CT based RTP will improve tumor volume delineation (TVD) and hence improve outcomes&#xD;
      following curative radiotherapy. There is also clear evidence that PET/CT standardizes TVD in&#xD;
      patients with NSCLC. However, what is not known is the impact of PET/CT based TVD on patient&#xD;
      outcomes such as survival as distinct from the benefit of PET/CT for patient selection for&#xD;
      curative treatment. Furthermore, the impact of a training intervention on the use of PET/CT&#xD;
      RTP in 2-year overall survival has not been studied to the best of our knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the possible impact of the use of PET/CT for TVD on 2-year overall&#xD;
      survival in patients with stage III NSCLC referred for curative intent radiotherapy with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in low and middle income countries, this study involves a retrospective cohort&#xD;
      study, a training intervention, and a prospective cohort study. The training intervention&#xD;
      will focus on standard FDG PET/CT acquisition, FDG PET/CT image quality, staging procedure&#xD;
      for FDG PET/CT acquisition and FDG PET/CT for RTP acquisition and Tumor Volume Delineation.&#xD;
