      This pragmatic trial examines the uptake and effects of primary care clinician commitments to&#xD;
      follow 3 Choosing Wisely速 recommendations. The investigators hypothesize that pre-encounter&#xD;
      invitations to clinicians to commit to the recommendations will decrease ordering of: (1)&#xD;
      imaging tests for low back pain, (2) antibiotics for acute sinusitis, and (3) imaging tests&#xD;
      for headaches. The study is a mixed-methods, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in which&#xD;
      the intervention will be sequentially introduced to 6 clinics in southeastern Michigan in a&#xD;
      randomly assigned order.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians often make decisions about ordering low-value services in the midst of clinical&#xD;
      encounters when their thinking can be rushed and susceptible to patient demands. This&#xD;
      pragmatic trial examines the uptake and effects of shifting clinicians' decisions about&#xD;
      ordering low-value services to the pre-encounter period when their thinking is slower and&#xD;
      more deliberative; inviting clinicians to commit to avoid ordering those services during&#xD;
      patient encounters; and providing to clinicians who committed decision support resources such&#xD;
      as point-of-care reminders, patient education handouts, and access to brief communications&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a mixed-methods, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in 6&#xD;
      IHA primary care clinics in southeastern Michigan. The intervention will be introduced in&#xD;
      each clinic in sequence approximately one month apart and in a randomly assigned order (i.e.,&#xD;
      temporal randomization). In each clinic the intervention will continue for 1 to 6 months so&#xD;
      that the intervention ends in all clinics at the same time. For example, in the first clinic&#xD;
      the intervention will run for 6 months; in the sixth clinic the intervention will run for 1&#xD;
      month. The total length of the control period plus the intervention period will be 8 months&#xD;
      at all clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the study, IHA made its primary care clinicians aware of publicly&#xD;
      available recommendations from the ABIM Foundation's Choosing Wisely速 campaign applicable to&#xD;
      avoiding overuse of low-value services for 3 common conditions: (1) low back pain, (2) acute&#xD;
      sinusitis, and (3) headaches. However, research has shown that clinician behavior seldom&#xD;
      changes as a result of information alone. Therefore, at the start of the intervention period&#xD;
      clinicians will be invited to make a pre-encounter commitment to follow the 3 Choosing Wisely&#xD;
      recommendations. Clinicians who choose to commit will throughout the intervention period&#xD;
      receive point-of-care commitment reminders, Choosing Wisely patient education handouts, and&#xD;
      weekly emails with decision support resources. Clinicians will remain free to order services&#xD;
      at any time without penalty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure whether the clinician-focused intervention leads to declines&#xD;
      in rates of ordering imaging tests for low back pain, antibiotics for acute sinusitis, and&#xD;
      imaging tests for headaches. The study team will analyze ordering patterns and costs using&#xD;
      clinical operations datasets (drawn from electronic health records and from the billing and&#xD;
      practice management system). The following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Inviting primary care clinicians to commit to avoid ordering imaging for low&#xD;
      back pain, antibiotics for acute sinusitis, and imaging for headaches will decrease ordering&#xD;
      of these services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Inviting primary care clinicians to commit to avoid ordering imaging for low&#xD;
      back pain, antibiotics for acute sinusitis, and imaging for headaches will reduce health care&#xD;
      costs in patient visits for low back pain, acute sinusitis, and headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Inviting primary care clinicians to commit to avoid ordering low-value services&#xD;
      will reduce per-clinician per-visit health care costs across clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each outcome investigators will also compare differences between clinicians who did and&#xD;
      did not commit to follow the 3 Choosing Wisely recommendations. Additionally, investigators&#xD;
      will compare differences in outcomes between the 3-month follow-up period (immediately after&#xD;
      the intervention has ended) and the control and intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention period, the study team will conduct surveys and semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews with study clinicians. The survey results will be used to identify correlates of&#xD;
      primary care clinician uptake of invitations to commit to avoid ordering low-value services.&#xD;
      The semi-structured interviews will elicit qualitative data on clinician attitudes towards&#xD;
      overuse of low-value services, clinicians' responses to the intervention, and facilitators of&#xD;
      and barriers to avoidance of delivering low-value care.&#xD;
