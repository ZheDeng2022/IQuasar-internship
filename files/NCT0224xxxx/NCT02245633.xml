      The aim of this research is to study how vitamin D affects various aspects of the disease&#xD;
      process, such as inflammation, coagulation (ADAMTS13 and WVF) and miRNAs, in Diabetic kidney&#xD;
      disease hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common chronic diseases in nearly all countries.&#xD;
      Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) traditionally has been referred to as diabetic nephropathy and&#xD;
      is one of the microvascular complications of diabetes. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs&#xD;
      in 25%-40% of patients with diabetes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have shown that the high risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients&#xD;
      with nephropathy is associated with increased plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF)&#xD;
      and decreased ADAMTS13 levels. VWF is a glycoprotein that plays an important role in platelet&#xD;
      thrombus formation, whereas ADAMTS13 is a proteolytic enzyme that is responsible for&#xD;
      degradation of large multimers of VWF released in the plasma by endothelial cells and&#xD;
      platelets. Patients with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes have been shown to have&#xD;
      higher plasma levels of VWF and decreased ADAMTS13 activity compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased plasma levels of VWF, which reflects damage to endothelial cells and a&#xD;
      hypercoagulability state, have been reported in atherosclerosis and diabetes. Thus, VWF and&#xD;
      ADAMTS13 seem to be important players in the interface between diabetic nephropathy,&#xD;
      hypercoagulability and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D deficiency is a risk&#xD;
      factor for DM and hypertension. The investigators previous studies showed that adding&#xD;
      calcitriol (activated vitamin D) to endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells&#xD;
      significantly down-regulated the inflammatory response of gene and protein expression&#xD;
      involved in the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFÄ¸B) signal&#xD;
      transduction pathway. Micro RNA (miRNA) are short noncoding RNAs, 22-25 nucleotides long. As&#xD;
      an endogenous production transcript, miRNAs can bind to the 3 untranslated regions (3 UTR) of&#xD;
      its target messenger RNA (mRNA) in an imperfect, complementary manner, leading to&#xD;
      post-transcriptional gene silencing. As a result, miRNAs can inhibit gene expression via mRNA&#xD;
      degradation, translation inhibition, or transcriptional inhibition.The critical role of&#xD;
      miRNAs has been established in several cellular and biologic processes, such as&#xD;
      proliferation, differentiation, and development, and in the regulation of genes related to&#xD;
      immune responses, cancer, and insulin secretion. MiRNA are involved in various biological&#xD;
      processes and become novel biomarkers, modulators and therapeutic targets for diseases such&#xD;
      as cancer, atherosclerosis, and DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The high prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with&#xD;
      DM on chronic hemodialysis remains a significant clinical problem and the finding of&#xD;
      potential new biomarkers should be further investigated. This study aims to establish a link&#xD;
      between ADAMTS13, VWF miRNA expression and vitamin D levels that can contribute to the&#xD;
      development of new treatments for hemodialysis patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Each hemodialysis patient with diabetes in the investigators institute will be asked&#xD;
      to participate in the study. After explaining the research goals, patients that agree to&#xD;
      participate will sign an informed consent. The investigators estimate that the study will&#xD;
      include 70 patients. Each patient will be assessed by a physician and 4 vials of blood will&#xD;
      be taken while the patient is connected to the dialysis machine. The blood will be sent to&#xD;
      the laboratory to check: 1) chemistry; 2) 1-25 vitamin D and 25- vitamin D levels; 3)&#xD;
      ADAMTS13 activity and VWF; and 4) miRNA extraction. The patients will be grouped according to&#xD;
      vitamin D levels (deficient /sufficient), and ADAMTS13, VWF and miRNA expression will be&#xD;
      compared between the groups.&#xD;
