    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of H.P. Acthar gel for treating the cutaneous&#xD;
      manifestations in patients with refractory classic dermatomyositis, juvenile dermatomyositis,&#xD;
      and amyopathic dermatomyositis. Our hypothesis is that H.P. Acthar gel will be both safe and&#xD;
      effective for such patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult and juvenile dermatomyositis (DM) are systemic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases&#xD;
      most commonly affecting the skin and musculoskeletal system. Amyopathic dermatomyositis is a&#xD;
      subtype of dermatomyositis that affects only the skin and lacks the characteristic muscle&#xD;
      involvement. Treatment of these conditions, in particular the cutaneous manifestations, is&#xD;
      challenging and currently no universally effective single treatment exists. Many patients&#xD;
      have cutaneous manifestations that are refractory to numerous medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.P. Acthar gel (adrenocorticotropic hormone gel) received FDA approval for treatment of a&#xD;
      variety of diseases, including dermatomyositis, in 1952. Despite this there is a paucity of&#xD;
      clinical data concerning the efficacy of H.P. Acthar gel for treating dermatomyositis.&#xD;
      Recently a small, retrospective case series describing significant improvement in both&#xD;
      cutaneous and musculoskeletal symptoms in 5 patients with refractory dermatomyositis treated&#xD;
      with H.P. Acthar gel was reported and has resulted in renewed interest in use of this&#xD;
      medication in dermatomyositis patient (reference below). The proposed efficacy of H.P. Acthar&#xD;
      gel has been attributed to its unique ability to induce production of endogenous cortisol,&#xD;
      corticosterone, aldosterone, and to bind melanocortin receptors on lymphocytes and other&#xD;
      cells to modulate immunologic responses.&#xD;

             classic dermatomyositis (CD), juvenile dermatomyositis (JD), or amyopathic&#xD;
             dermatomyositis(AD). Diagnosis will be based on either Bohan and Peter criteria (CD&#xD;
             and JD) or Sontheimer's criteria (AD)&#xD;

             one steroid-sparing systemic treatment commonly found to be useful in patients with&#xD;
             dermatomyositis. These may include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil,&#xD;
             IVIG, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, sirolimus, adalimumab, infliximab&#xD;
             and rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of topical medications and sunscreen currently and in past will be noted but not&#xD;
             weighed for assessment of refractory cutaneous disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with dermatomyositis who have minimal-to-no active cutaneous features (focal&#xD;
             involvement with less than 1% total body surface area involved or minimal modified&#xD;
             CDASI activity score).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose cutaneous findings are not consistent with dermatomyositis and/or have&#xD;
             previous biopsy results suggestive of an alternative diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with inflammatory myositis other than dermatomyositis, such as polymyositis&#xD;
             or inclusion body myositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with malignancy-associated dermatomyositis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clear features of an overlap myositis&#xD;

             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;

          -  Patients with any medical condition that is felt by the primary investigator to place&#xD;
             the patient at unreasonable risk for adverse effects during treatment with H.P.&#xD;
             Acthar.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to H.P. Acthar, any of its components (allergy to pig-derived&#xD;
