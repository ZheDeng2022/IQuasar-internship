  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disease in both adults and children and is&#xD;
      caused by the obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. Unlike adults, most cases of&#xD;
      paediatric SDB are due to the presence of enlarged tonsils and adenoids, thus the main&#xD;
      treatment option is adenotonsillectomy (AT). It is well known that obstructive sleep apnoea&#xD;
      (OSA) in adults increases the risk for hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke, and&#xD;
      there is now mounting evidence that SDB also has a significant impact on the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system in children with reports of elevated blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction and&#xD;
      altered autonomic cardiovascular control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress seems to play a pivotal role in impairing flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and&#xD;
      consequently enhancing cardiovascular risk in SDB patients but the underlying mechanism is&#xD;
      still undefined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, we demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction is directly related to NADPH oxidase&#xD;
      activation. Furthermore, recently we assessed the association between OSA, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and oxidative stress in adults showing that increased NADPH oxidase-generated&#xD;
      oxidative stress and arterial dysfunction are partially reversed by nasal continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence in literature that cardiovascular morbidities associated with SDB are&#xD;
      potentially reversible in children; AT may have a significant role in reversing the&#xD;
      cardiovascular sequelae of SDB (e.g. children with OSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, there aren't studies that analyzed the role of NADPH oxidase-generated oxidative&#xD;
      stress in SDB children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current research project is to examine the role of NADPH oxidase activity,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial function in SDB children, understanding the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore we will analyse the effect of a AT on inflammation, oxidative stress, NADPH&#xD;
      oxidase activity and endothelial function in SDB children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a spectrum of diseases ranging from primary snoring to&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Recent studies suggested that the prevalence of SDB childhood&#xD;
      was 7.4%. In patients with OSA, there are intermittent episodes of complete or partial&#xD;
      obstruction leading to intermittent desaturations and/or arousals. This would result in&#xD;
      either stimulation of sympathetic system or suppression of the vagal tone that may persist&#xD;
      beyond sleep. The disturbance of the autonomic nervous system would result in significant&#xD;
      changes in the cardiovascular system. The process of intermittent hypoxaemia and subsequent&#xD;
      re-oxygenation also damages the endothelium because of the generation of free radicals.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the excessive negative intra-thoracic pressure swing generated during the&#xD;
      obstruction would also affect cardiac functions. In adults, OSA has been well documented to&#xD;
      be associated with cardiovascular abnormalities such as hypertension, ischaemic heart&#xD;
      disease, arrhythmia and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis.&#xD;
      In particular, an imbalance between superoxide and nitric oxide production could be&#xD;
      responsible for endothelial dysfunction, a key point for atherosclerotic process. Several&#xD;
      oxidative stress-generating enzymes, including myeloperoxidase, xanthine oxidase and&#xD;
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) may be implicated in arterial&#xD;
      dysfunction; NADPH oxidase represents, in human, the most important source of cellular&#xD;
      superoxide anion production. Experimental studies performed in animal models suggest a&#xD;
      pivotal role of NADPH oxidase in modulating arterial tone. In particular, overexpression of&#xD;
      gp91phox (NOX2), potentiates the hemodynamic response to angiotensin II. Furthermore,&#xD;
      individuals with impaired dilation show an overexpression of the NADPH oxidase subunit&#xD;
      p47phox in endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, we demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction is directly related to NADPH oxidase&#xD;
      activation; in particular we demonstrated that in patients with NADPH oxidase subunits&#xD;
      deletion, as chronic granulomatous disease, the oxidative stress is lower and flow-mediate&#xD;
      dilation is higher, compared to controls. Conversely, in other diseases characterized by high&#xD;
      rate of cardiovascular events (OSAS, Peripheral arterial disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity&#xD;
      and hypercholesterolemia), we found an endothelial dysfunction and a NOX2 overexpression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we assessed the association between OSAS, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative&#xD;
      stress in adults. Interestingly, the results of our study indicated that patients with OSAS&#xD;
      have increased NOX2-generated oxidative stress and arterial dysfunction that are partially&#xD;
      reversed by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence in literature that cardiovascular morbidities associated with SDB are&#xD;
      potentially reversible in children; AT may have a significant role in reversing the&#xD;
      cardiovascular sequelae of SDB (e.g. children affected by OSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current research project is to examine NADPH oxidase activity, oxidative&#xD;
      stress, inflammation and endothelial function in children with SDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes and their interest in advances in the frontier of knowledge and their&#xD;
      potential impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. understand the mechanisms mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress involved in SDB&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the assessment of NADPH oxidase activity could be a useful tool to identify SDB patients&#xD;
           at high risk of cardiovascular events in order to prevent their dramatic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyse the effect of a surgical correction (e.g. adenotonsillectomy) on inflammation,&#xD;
           oxidative stress, NADPH oxidase activity and endothelial function in children;&#xD;
           adenotonsillectomy could represent a potential therapeutic option to reduce the high&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk of SDB children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided in 2 phases: a cross-sectional and an interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the cross-sectional study we will include at least 100 children (50 SDB children with&#xD;
           SDB and 50 controls), assessing markers of oxidative stress (serum isoprostanes), NADPH&#xD;
           oxidase activity, inflammation, endothelial function (by flow-mediated dilation, FMD)&#xD;
           and the carotid intima media thickness (IMT) measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the interventional study we will include at least 10 with OSA and adenotonsillar&#xD;
           hypertrophy that will undergo to adenotonsillectomy, evaluating markers of oxidative&#xD;
           stress (serum isoprostanes), NADPH oxidase activity, inflammation and endothelial&#xD;
           function before and after (at least 30 days) the surgical procedure.&#xD;
