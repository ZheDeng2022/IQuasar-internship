  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome is a group of cardiometabolic risk factors that reflect a sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle and the excessive intake of food among the risk factors that comprise it are&#xD;
      located the obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been observed that the interventions of lifestyle changes that promote weight loss&#xD;
      through the practice of physical activity and intake of a hypocaloric diet, reduce the&#xD;
      prevalence of chronic diseases such as Metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence is defined as the extent to which a person's behaviour - taking medication,&#xD;
      following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations&#xD;
      from a health care provider. The World Health Organization has estimated that in developing&#xD;
      countries, as in Mexico, less than 27% of people with chronic diseases will continue&#xD;
      treatment as directed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to treatment of chronic disease is a multifactorial problem that includes not only&#xD;
      patient-related barriers, but also providers of health services and social security systems&#xD;
      themselves. Furthermore, as WHO has pointed out, as increasing prevalence of chronic&#xD;
      non-adherence to treatment will become a global problem even more serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is develop and implement a methodology to overcome barriers&#xD;
      affecting adherence to treatment of women over 20 years with non-communicable diseases such&#xD;
      as metabolic syndrome (diabetes , hypertension and dyslipidemia) evaluating its impact&#xD;
      through various quantitative indicators such as weight loss or metabolic syndrome prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1. Design. Qualitative methodology was used primarily to identify the barriers&#xD;
           faced by individuals to adhere to treatment. From this methodology, we developed a tool&#xD;
           to assess adherence to treatment of subjects with these conditions and then an&#xD;
           intervention to improve it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2. Implementation of intervention (24 weeks). To recruite a group of 180&#xD;
           overweight and two of the following comorbidities: diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia or&#xD;
           hypertension. All study subjects will be randomized to a control group and intervention.&#xD;
           The control group will receive a medical traditional clinical care. The intervention&#xD;
           group will receive a lifestyle treatment with behavioral intervention to improve&#xD;
           adherence for improve eating behaviors, physical activity and metabolic control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization estimates that worldwide one billion adults are overweight. In&#xD;
      Mexico, the prevalence of overweight and obesity using data from 2006 was nearly 70% in men&#xD;
      and women over 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being overweight is associated with other co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus (79.4%),&#xD;
      hypertension (78.0%) and dyslipidemia (82.8%). WHO has estimated that over 50% of these&#xD;
      patients have a poor grip and do not follow their treatment as indicated, generating costs&#xD;
      for managing these diseases of until $ 100 billion each year. Improve the effectiveness of&#xD;
      interventions on adherence to treatment, will significantly improve the health of these&#xD;
      patients and help reduce costs involving health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obesity and comorbidities affect 41% of the adults in Mexico and increases up to five&#xD;
      times the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and up to three times&#xD;
      the risk of developing coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Therefore, these&#xD;
      diseases are currently one of the main problems of public health in Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to short and long term is the result of a complex process that develops through&#xD;
      different stages: the acceptance of diagnosis, the perceived need for treatment successfully,&#xD;
      motivation, and skills training available, the ability to overcome the barriers or&#xD;
      difficulties arise, and maintenance of achievements over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of adherence to chronic disease is a multifactorial problem that includes not only&#xD;
      patient-related barriers, but also with service providers and health systems. Poor adherence&#xD;
      to long-term therapies severely compromises the effectiveness of treatment and negatively&#xD;
      impacts the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been observed that the interventions of lifestyle changes that promote weight loss&#xD;
      through the practice of physical activity and intake of a hypocaloric diet, reduce the&#xD;
      prevalence of Metabolic diseases and achieve a better control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in lifestyle are the foundation of any strategy for the treatment of chronical&#xD;
      diseases . The patients require counseling to effect change in their behavior and improve&#xD;
      their risk of mortality and morbidities. So far, interventions to improve treatment of&#xD;
      patients with chronic diseases, not including diet and exercise recommendations, has not&#xD;
      reported any significant positive change. Moreover, in Mexico there is still no method or&#xD;
      reference tool to assess adherence. It has been reported that healthy lifestyles achieve&#xD;
      positive changes on cardiovascular risk factors, however, no known methodology to help&#xD;
      patients overcome the barriers that prevent them from adopting and adhering to the&#xD;
      recommendations that are prescribed providers of health services. Therefore, the objective of&#xD;
      this study is to assess if a multidisciplinary treatment that stimulates the constant&#xD;
      practice of physical activity and intake of a hypocaloric diet, reduces the prevalence of&#xD;
      metabolic chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, and&#xD;
      improves the control, in comparison with a traditional medical treatment in Mexican women.&#xD;
      Also, to develop a methodology validated in Mexican population to identify barriers that&#xD;
      affect adherence to treatment assessing their impact through a variety of quantitative&#xD;
      indicators of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project was conducted in 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1 Development of the tool for identifying barriers. In a private hospital care to&#xD;
      chronic noncommunicable diseases, were called patients with co-morbidities associated with&#xD;
      overweight and obesity (diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension) to identify common&#xD;
      barriers they face to adequately follow through treatment the application of a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire. The results will be used as reference for the discussion of traditional&#xD;
      treatment algorithms based on the Mexican standards for the management of obesity,&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2. Design and implementation of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 began with the recruitment of study subjects. The recruitment was done by a local&#xD;
      advertising campaign that included posters and leaflets in the city the Cuernavaca, Morelos.&#xD;
      México.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were recruited a group of 180 patients with overweight and two of the following&#xD;
      co-morbidities: diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia or hypertension. All study subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to a control group and intervention. The intervention will last 24 weeks. The&#xD;
      control group will receive traditional clinical care and the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      a behavioral intervention to improve adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the intervention is based in the the stages-of-change model (also referred to&#xD;
      as the transtheoretical model) identifies five stages through which individuals progress as&#xD;
      they change behaviours, and stage-matched strategies that predict progress to each subsequent&#xD;
      stage of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stages of change are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precontemplation at this stage the subject does not plan to make an effort to adhere to&#xD;
      treatment or to change your behavior. (Not considering changing behavior in the next 6&#xD;
      months),&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second is called &quot;contemplation&quot;, the person admits that there is a risk behavior or&#xD;
      beneficial and begin thinking about trying to change or adopt. (Considering changing behavior&#xD;
      in the next 6 months),&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third is &quot;preparation&quot; in this stage the person intends to initiate behavior change,&#xD;
      strategies and plans to acquire solutions. (Planning to change behavior during the next 30&#xD;
      days),&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth is &quot;action&quot; has become the person intended in the expected action (in this study&#xD;
      the action is to improve adherence to treatment). (Currently changing behavior)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fifth is &quot;maintenance&quot;, here the change has been established as usual. (Successful&#xD;
      behavior change for at least 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a sixth stage called &quot;relapse&quot;, where the person returns to the behaviors that had&#xD;
      been changed, abandoned the effort and go to the pre-action stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of change describe an individual's motivational readiness to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific tools that contain the intervention program are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage various strategies will be developed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Educational texts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual medical advice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written contract of engagement The objective of this stage is to make the individual&#xD;
           reflect on his health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Action At this stage the individual begins proper actions to get a better adherence It will&#xD;
      provide enough printed material that allows it to achieve its goals in diet, physical&#xD;
      activity and taking medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a computerized database (software) with which you can update the progress and&#xD;
      barriers presented by the individual and be able to access either the nutritionist doctor or&#xD;
      psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Educational texts. Based on feedback from patients and doctors, nutritionists and&#xD;
           psychologists experts, will be designed brochures and educational leaflets with&#xD;
           practical advice to achieve intermediate goals and the end of each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consultation and personalized feedback Develop a scheme for service providers (doctors,&#xD;
           nutritionists and psychologists) to provide attention individual, the query will be&#xD;
           adjusted to the level of adherence achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the query are used as reference treatment guidelines of the ADA and the Third Adult&#xD;
      Treatment Panel (ATP III).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutrition. The consultation will be given by a nutritionist trained to give dietary&#xD;
           treatment based on available activities and times of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity. The type of activity will be designed by an expert in the field and&#xD;
           will be prescribed by nutritionist taking into account the patient's age and abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be done with different tools according to the phase of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Identification of barriers to treatment through the application of validated&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification and socioeconomic data through the application of two questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anthropometry: weight with scale Tanita model BC-418. Height with stadiometer SECA,&#xD;
           model 220. Waist with a ribbon of flexible glass fiber of 0.5 cm in width and a&#xD;
           precision of 1 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The measurement of intima-media thickness of carotid is made with Ultrasound SONOSITE&#xD;
           PLUS model 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collection of biological samples for determination of biochemical parameters like&#xD;
           glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol&#xD;
           and triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent. The dependent variable or outcome will be reduction in the prevalence of obesity&#xD;
      and comorbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia), and control measured&#xD;
      through weight loss, and decrease in blood pressure, fasting glucose, and cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent. The independent variable is the lifestyle and behavioral program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. Will present descriptive statistics for the dependent variables weight,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, blood pressure and intima-media&#xD;
      thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will analyze the mean difference in measurement time (initial, intermediate and&#xD;
      final) for mean difference test&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between the control and intervention group were analyzed using three&#xD;
      strategies: 1) by intention to treat (including patients who dropped out), 2) full support to&#xD;
      the intervention (patients who completed the program), and 3) for proper administration of&#xD;
      the intervention, ie an analysis will be specific to those subjects who received the&#xD;
      intervention effectively by the physician and nutritionist (patients intervened correctly).&#xD;
