    <textblock>
      Aphasia is one of the most disabling complications in language production in patients with&#xD;
      left hemisphere stroke. About 19% of patients who experience aphasia may have a spontaneously&#xD;
      recovery after several weeks or months. Some studies have reported that repetitive low&#xD;
      frequency Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS-r) in patients with ischemic stroke&#xD;
      generates left modulation of cortical excitability by facilitating and promoting functional&#xD;
      reorganization and recovery of language production. In spite of this, most of the studies in&#xD;
      patients with post-stroke aphasia, are small cases series without controls that correspond to&#xD;
      a descriptive design and does not perform long-term follow up. Currently the population is&#xD;
      heterogeneous respect to etiology, type of stroke and aphasia severity; also several authors&#xD;
      have concluded that the exact location of the site, would be possible through the&#xD;
      neuronavigation technique, to obtain better results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERALL OBJECTIVE Determine the efficacy of repetitive low-frequency TMS on oral language&#xD;
      recovery in post-ischemic stroke patients with non-fluent aphasia&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESPECIFIC OBJETIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the effect of repetitiveTMS treatment on right Lowe Frontal Gyrus (GFI), in the&#xD;
           evolution of the neuropsychological language test results in patients with non-fluent&#xD;
           aphasia, compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the behavior of depression and anxiety levels in both treatment groups (active&#xD;
           and placebo), through Zung anxiety and depression test, to establish their correlation&#xD;
           with production testing language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of repetitiveTMS technique compared to placebo, on the overall&#xD;
           functionality of the subject through Barthel scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the impact of language behavior on the quality of life of patients treated with&#xD;
           placebo and active EMT, assessed by the EuroQol test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY A placebo double blind controlled and randomize trial, to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of low frequency EMT-r in language recovery in 100 patients with first ischemic stroke event&#xD;
      among the first 4-8 months postinfarction and non-fluent aphasia. The patient will agree and&#xD;
      will sign the informed consent, in order to application aphasia diagnosis Boston test,&#xD;
      Edinburgh test, Barthel scale, Zung anxiety and depression test, and EuroQol scale, Neuropsi.&#xD;
      Subsequently the subjects will be randomizate to any of two arms of the study. A week before&#xD;
      the start of the stimulation sessions, the following tests will be applied to assess language&#xD;
      production: Boston Test and Verbal Fluency (FAS). Each patient will have a daily session&#xD;
      EMT-r low-frequency active or inactive coil with a biphasic stimulator pulses applied for ten&#xD;
      days in two weeks on the triangular area - homologous to injury Lower Front Gyrus (LFG),&#xD;
      (right brain hemisphere). Complete the treatment schedule of two weeks, the language&#xD;
      production will be evaluate again, and also scales as Barthel an Rankin-m, Zung anxiety and&#xD;
      depression and EuroQol. This monitoring will be achieved in five stages: after one week, one&#xD;
      month, 4 months, 8 months and 12 months post-stimulation, with the intention of determining&#xD;
      the duration and effectiveness effects in language production of the EMT-r.&#xD;

      Some studies have reported that low frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in&#xD;
      patients with ischemic stroke generates left modulation of cortical excitability by&#xD;
      facilitating, and promoting functional reorganization and facilitate the language production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is a major public health problem, one-third of patients do not survive the first year&#xD;
      after the vascular event, cause of severe disability and also is the third leading cause of&#xD;
      death worldwide. Two-thirds of the survivors have neurologic deficits including aphasia (19%)&#xD;
      generating functional disability, compromise on their daily living activities, and impact on&#xD;
      the quality of life (93% of patients with aphasia after stroke compared with 50% of those&#xD;
      survive without aphasia). Aphasia is an additional risk factor for depression (prevalence&#xD;
      5-63%), and also interfering with the functional and cognitive recovery, increasing the risk&#xD;
      of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally the treatment of aphasia is based on speech therapy and drug therapy oriented&#xD;
      comorbidities such as depression or anxiety. However, it has studied different interventions&#xD;
      in an effort to improve the speech recovery of aphasia, as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS), which facilitates recovery by stimulating contralesional and lesional regions. Most&#xD;
      studies have been based on the transcallosal disinhibition theory, which consist on blocking&#xD;
      homotopic regions through low frequency stimulation in the right posterior GFI (triangular&#xD;
      portion) to produce a GFI disinhibition from right to left and facilitate neuroplasticity&#xD;
      brain process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMT technique is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, proposed by Michael&#xD;
      Faraday (1831), in which posits that magnetic field depends on the stimulation time,&#xD;
      generating an electric field that eventually causes neuronal excitability.The strength of the&#xD;
      electric current produced in the coil between 5-10 Ka (Kiloamperes), while the strength of&#xD;
      the induced magnetic field is about 1 to 2 Tesla, and the cortical area to stimulated is&#xD;
      about 3 cm² and 2 cm depth. The magnetic field generated may have sufficient magnitude and&#xD;
      density to depolarize cortical neurons tract, directly through axonal cone or indirectly&#xD;
      through interneurons. When TMS pulses are applied repeatedly, which is known as repetitive&#xD;
      TMS (r-TMS) produce modulation of the cortical excitability, increasing or decreasing,&#xD;
      depending on the stimulation parameters. Those effects may persist beyond the train&#xD;
      stimulation; defined as repetitive series of regular pulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundamental mechanisms of EMT, are not yet fully understood, because due inter-session and&#xD;
      inter-subject variability have been observed in the modulation of induced excitability. The&#xD;
      EMT-r may also induce changes in hormonal and neurotransmitter systems, such as, serotonin,&#xD;
      dopamine, NMDA receptors, taurine, aspartate, serine axis and can regulate the expression of&#xD;
      some genes; cfos, c-jung, which are important for synaptic plasticity. It has been studied&#xD;
      several possible mechanisms involved in the functional regulation exerted by the EMT-r, such&#xD;
      as synaptic plasticity, which is the most explored one, changes in excitability of neuronal&#xD;
      networks, activation of feedback loops and metaplasticity, understood plasticity as synaptic&#xD;
      plasticity. However, although but not yet, been established whether the source of the&#xD;
      clinical benefit of any scheme of stimulation is a direct or indirect result of the&#xD;
      modulation of the excitability, is believed to be associated with neuromodulators release and&#xD;
      growth factors such as neurotrophic factor derived from the brain, which play an important&#xD;
      role in the mechanism of EMT.&#xD;
