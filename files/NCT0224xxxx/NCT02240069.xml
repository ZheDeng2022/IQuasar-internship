  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A critical need exists for efficient community-based interventions aimed at reduction of&#xD;
      environmental exposures relevant to health. Biomass smoke exposures due to residential wood&#xD;
      heating are common among rural Native American communities, and such exposures have been&#xD;
      associated with respiratory disease in susceptible populations. In many of these communities&#xD;
      wood stoves are the most economic and traditionally preferred method of residential heating,&#xD;
      but resource scarcity can result in burning of improper wood fuels and corresponding high&#xD;
      levels of indoor particulate matter. Community-based participatory research techniques will&#xD;
      be used to adapt intervention approaches to meet the cultural context of each participating&#xD;
      community. At the community level, investigators will facilitate local development of a&#xD;
      tribal agency-led wood bank program ensuring that elderly and/or persons with need have&#xD;
      access to dry wood for heating. At the household level, investigators will use a three arm&#xD;
      randomized placebo-controlled intervention trial to implement and assess education/outreach&#xD;
      on best burn practices (Tx1). The content and delivery strategies of the education&#xD;
      intervention will be adapted to each community according to stakeholder input. This&#xD;
      educational intervention will be evaluated against an indoor air filtration unit arm (Tx2),&#xD;
      as well as a placebo arm (Tx3, sham air filters). Tx3 will be used in comparison with the&#xD;
      other two treatment arms to evaluate the penetration and efficacy of the community-level wood&#xD;
      bank program. Outcomes will be evaluated with respect to changes in pulmonary function&#xD;
      measures and respiratory symptoms and conditions among household elders. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that locally-designed education-based interventions at the community and&#xD;
      household levels will result in efficacious and sustainable strategies for reducing personal&#xD;
      exposures to indoor particulate matter, and lead to respiratory health improvements in&#xD;
      elderly Native populations. This study will advance knowledge of cost-effective environmental&#xD;
      interventions within two unique Native American communities, and inform sustainable&#xD;
      multi-level strategies in similar communities throughout the US to improve respiratory health&#xD;
      among at-risk populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rural Native American (NA) communities experience disproportionate disease burden compared to&#xD;
      other US populations, with poor indoor air quality resulting from in-home biomass smoke&#xD;
      exposures (residential wood stoves) a likely contributor to these health burden&#xD;
      discrepancies. Epidemiological studies support the etiological association between indoor&#xD;
      biomass smoke exposure and several domains of global disease burden, particularly with&#xD;
      respect to pediatric respiratory tract infections and adult chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) and chronic bronchitis. Elderly populations are particularly susceptible to&#xD;
      chronic respiratory conditions, and declining pulmonary function is associated with increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Randomized trials in developing countries have demonstrated the&#xD;
      impact that improved cookstove technologies have in reducing biomass smoke exposures and&#xD;
      children's risk of acute respiratory infection. However limited knowledge is available&#xD;
      regarding the potential improvements in NA elderly populations following wood stove&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, a critical need exists for efficient community-based interventions aimed at promoting&#xD;
      healthy indoor environments in at-risk communities. Financial and logistical barriers that&#xD;
      currently exist in rural and economically disadvantaged NA communities prohibit the&#xD;
      implementation and sustainability of many environmental health interventions. Regarding wood&#xD;
      stoves, qualitative input from experts and Native communities underscores the need for&#xD;
      innovative low-cost, sustainable interventions targeting the reduction of in-home biomass&#xD;
      smoke exposures. In this proposal, investigators will test community-level and&#xD;
      education-based household-level strategies aimed at promoting and implementing best-burn&#xD;
      practices to improve air quality and respiratory health in at-risk elderly populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal represents a multidisciplinary collaboration between university and tribal&#xD;
      stakeholders from two Native American Reservations to develop, adapt, implement, and evaluate&#xD;
      a two-level intervention to reduce exposure to indoor biomass smoke and improve respiratory&#xD;
      health among elderly tribal members. Community-based participatory research techniques will&#xD;
      be used to adapt intervention approaches to meet the cultural context of each participating&#xD;
      community. At the community level, investigators will facilitate local development of tribal&#xD;
      agency-led wood yard and distribution programs ensuring that elderly and/or persons with need&#xD;
      have access to dry wood for heating. With community advisory guidance, investigators will use&#xD;
      a three arm randomized placebo-controlled intervention trial to implement and assess&#xD;
      education on best burn practices (Tx1) at the household level. This educational intervention&#xD;
      will be evaluated against an indoor air filtration unit arm (Tx2), as well as a placebo arm&#xD;
      (Tx3, sham air filters). Tx3 will be used in comparison with the other two treatment arms to&#xD;
      evaluate the penetration and efficacy of the community-level fuel program. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      evaluated with respect to changes in markers of respiratory health among elders and changes&#xD;
      in indoor air quality (PM2.5). The investigators hypothesize that locally-designed&#xD;
      education-based interventions, in the context of a community-based strategy focused on wood&#xD;
      fuels, will result in efficacious and sustainable strategies for reducing personal exposures&#xD;
      to indoor biomass smoke PM2.5 and lead to respiratory health improvements in elderly NA&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Facilitate the tribally-centered development, adaption, implementation, and evaluation&#xD;
      of community-level wood yard and distribution programs for participating tribal households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Facilitate the development, adaptation, implementation, and evaluation of&#xD;
      household-level education strategies targeting best-burn practices (Tx1) for each&#xD;
      participating tribal community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Compare effectiveness, both within and between communities, of household-level&#xD;
      interventions among elderly adults participating in a three-arm randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3a. Compare group changes in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3b. Compare group changes in indoor and personal PM2.5 exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Evaluate penetration, acceptance, and sustainability of community- and household-level&#xD;
      strategies using both qualitative and quantitative data generated in collaboration with&#xD;
      tribal community advisory boards and research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact. The long-term goal of this project will be to reduce mortality and morbidity in NA&#xD;
      communities from exposures related to residential home heating. This study will advance&#xD;
      knowledge of effective interventions within two unique NA Reservations and describe&#xD;
      improvements in sub-clinical indicators of pulmonary health in susceptible elderly&#xD;
      populations. Reducing in-home wood smoke exposures through community level facilitation of&#xD;
      access to proper fuels and introduction of sustainable, culturally appropriate best-burn&#xD;
      practices will inform strategies for translation to other NA communities or similar rural and&#xD;
      underserved populations.&#xD;
