      Drug resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem world wide. The current methods for&#xD;
      diagnosis are time consuming and may delay diagnosis and treatment for many weeks. In this&#xD;
      study the investigators wish to take sputum samples from patients to see if the investigators&#xD;
      can validate a molecular DNA based process for prompt identification of drug resistant&#xD;
      tuberculosis. The investigators wish to extract and amplify DNA from drug resistant&#xD;
      tuberculosis and identify genes within it that confer resistance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Drug resistant M. tuberculosis is an increasing problem in the United Kingdom and abroad. In&#xD;
      the United Kingdom (UK) as a whole the number of isolates that were shown to be resistant to&#xD;
      at least one of the first line drugs was nearly 400, with the total number of isolates&#xD;
      approaching 5000. A total of 9040 cases were reported in the UK in 2009 and of these 6.9%&#xD;
      demonstrated resistance to at least one first line drug(1). In certain populations the&#xD;
      incidence of drug resistance is higher: in London, homeless patients, those who have been in&#xD;
      prison and those from certain countries abroad, particularly Eastern Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difficulty of drug resistant tuberculosis is that the treatment duration, cost and&#xD;
      complexity is increased. Typically the patient will be on treatment for 18 months or more and&#xD;
      the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has estimated the cost of this as being upto Â£50000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current diagnosis rests on the culture of the M. tuberculosis and drug sensitivity testing.&#xD;
      This can take six or eight weeks, meaning that patients may be on ineffective therapy for&#xD;
      some time, leading to further transmission and deterioration of the patient's clinical&#xD;
      condition. In this study the investigators would hope to develop a new test to improve and&#xD;
      expedite the diagnosis of multi- drug resistant or MDR TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predominant mechanism by which resistance occurs in M. tuberculosis is by the development&#xD;
      and selection of mutants containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's)(2). Present&#xD;
      commercial assays enable only a common subset (5-10) of the (900+) documented resistance&#xD;
      mutations to be detected (www.tbdreamdb.com). It is highly likely that many more exist&#xD;
      particularly in regions of the genome that may modulate sensitivity or resistance. This&#xD;
      complexity is compounded by the requirement to treat TB with cocktails of antibiotics even&#xD;
      for fully drug sensitive M.tuberculosis for which treatment consists of isoniazid (H),&#xD;
      rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E). Multidrug resistant (MDR) and&#xD;
      extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB cases are treated with second line drugs such as&#xD;
      moxifloxacin, amikacin, capreomycin, para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), thiocetazone and others&#xD;
      for which genotypic markers of resistance are not tested. Such complex treatment combinations&#xD;
      increase the need to screen multiple gene targets with the imperative to treat immediately&#xD;
      with correct combinations of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The large number of mutations makes exhaustive detection of all known SNP's impossible with&#xD;
      existing diagnostic procedures. Whole genome sequencing offers the potential to interrogate&#xD;
      the genome of clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis for all known mutations and from this to&#xD;
      infer an antimicrobial sensitivity pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extensive cost of treating and managing MDR cases(3) could potentially be reduced by&#xD;
      obtaining a rapid genomic resistance profile early within the patients treatment. Cost&#xD;
      benefit analysis of immediate whole genome sequencing (WGS) on all TB cases would be highly&#xD;
      beneficial financially as well as clinically. The investigators propose to conduct a limited&#xD;
      pilot study to assess the potential to acquire whole genome sequence directly from sputum&#xD;
      specimens, early in a patient's treatment and to retrospectively define the potential impact&#xD;
      of the availability of this data on patient care. This proposal will thus provide an evidence&#xD;
      base for WGS to be developed into a routine diagnostic test/process with medical potential&#xD;
      both at local National Health Service (NHS) level and globally so as to improve care pathways&#xD;
      for MDR and XDR TB.&#xD;
