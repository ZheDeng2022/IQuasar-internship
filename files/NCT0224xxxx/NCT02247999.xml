      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths among women. Most cases of cervical&#xD;
           cancer are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is more common in women who&#xD;
           have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). India has one of the highest rates of women&#xD;
           who have both cervical cancer and HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical cancer can be discovered in early stages by screening for HPV infection.&#xD;
           Researchers want to compare new cervical cancer screening tests for HIV-infected women.&#xD;
           They also want to know more about how HPV can lead to cervical cancer in HIV-infected&#xD;
           women. To do so, they will hold a study to screen HIV-infected women in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To improve cervical cancer screening methods in HIV-infected women in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women at least 18 years of age who have HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recruited from HIV-focused health care clinics in Pune and Chennai,&#xD;
           India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will provide a urine&#xD;
           sample and proof of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a gynecological exam. This will involve a pelvic exam and Pap&#xD;
           smear to collect cells for study. It will also involve a cervical exam to look for&#xD;
           precancerous cells. Cervical tissue may be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also provide a blood sample for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return in 2 weeks for the test results. If there are signs of&#xD;
           precancerous or cancer cells, participants will be referred to a doctor for treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While HPV DNA testing is a highly sensitive screening method for cervical cancer, it cannot&#xD;
      differentiate between the majority of benign infections and few persistent infections linked&#xD;
      to cervical precancer. Given the high prevalence of carcinogenic HPV DNA and higher risk for&#xD;
      cervical precancer and cancer among HIV-infected women, there is a substantial need for&#xD;
      screening tests that are both adequately sensitive as well as specific, so as to maximize&#xD;
      detection while reducing false-positive referrals. Furthermore, the unique immunological&#xD;
      milieu in HIV-infected women presents significant opportunities to study natural history of&#xD;
      HPV-mediated cervical oncogenic process in the context of immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical performance of two novel biomarker assays&#xD;
      for detection of histologically-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 or&#xD;
      more severe (greater than or equal to CIN2 and greater than or equal to CIN3) among&#xD;
      HIV-infected women. These tests include: (i) immunocytostaining by p16(INK4a)/Ki-67&#xD;
      (biomarkers correlated with the oncogenic transformation of cervical cells following&#xD;
      persistent carcinogenic HPV infection) and (ii) testing for HPV E6/E7 mRNA (expressed during&#xD;
      progression of a transient to a transforming HPV infection). Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      studying the association of risk factors and biomarkers with specific HPV genotypes and&#xD;
      studying the interaction of HIV and HPV in cervical disease categories and in the context of&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected women, 18 years or older, with no history of previous treatment for cervical&#xD;
      precancer/cancer, not currently pregnant, and able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross sectional study will be conducted in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical&#xD;
      Research (ICMR), in three institutions, with substantial experience in conduct of clinical&#xD;
      research on HIV/AIDS and HPV/cervical cancer: the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in&#xD;
      Pune, the National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) in Chennai, and the Jawaharlal Nehru&#xD;
      Medical College (JNMC) in Belgaum. A total of 1000 HIV-infected women attending HIV care and&#xD;
      treatment clinics in Pune (n=400) and Chennai (n=400), and Belgaum (n=200) will be recruited.&#xD;
      According to routine practice, participants will undergo per-speculum examination and&#xD;
      cervical specimen collection, followed by a detailed diagnostic colposcopy exam with biopsies&#xD;
      as indicated for histological analysis. Cervical specimens will be used for liquid-based&#xD;
      cytology as well as simultaneous independent assessment with p16(INK4a)/Ki-67 and HPV E6/E7&#xD;
      mRNA testing. HPV DNA genotyping will be conducted by Linear Array HPV polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction. We will estimate the clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and&#xD;
      negative predictive values, Youden s Index, and positive and negative likelihood ratios with&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals) of individual tests and combinations for prevalent detection of&#xD;
      histologically-confirmed greater than or equal to CIN2 and greater than or equal to CIN3&#xD;
      among HIV-infected women. Additionally we will estimate age-specific and disease-specific HPV&#xD;
      prevalence rates and HPV genotype composition, examine factors associated with greater than&#xD;
      or equal to CIN2/greater than or equal to CIN3 lesions, examine the relationships of&#xD;
      biomarker positivity at the HPV genotype-specific level, and evaluate the role of&#xD;
      immunosuppression on HPV-mediated carcinogenesis. This study will permit validation of&#xD;
      collection, transport, storage, and implementation protocols, allow evaluation of the field&#xD;
      adoption and efficacy of these newer assays, describe the sensitivity and specificity of any&#xD;
      of the tests or combinations with reasonable precision for a wide range of prevalence of&#xD;
      greater than or equal to CIN3, and provide a resource for studies of HIV-HPV coinfection.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Female greater than or equal to 18 years of age at study entry. This ensures that&#xD;
                  all participants are at or above legal age in India for giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Confirmed HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. For women of reproductive potential, a negative urine pregnancy test with a&#xD;
                  sensitivity of &lt;25mlU/mL prior to study entry. This ensures that only&#xD;
                  non-pregnant women are included. While pregnancy is not an absolute&#xD;
                  contraindication for screening, certain invasive clinical procedures are often&#xD;
                  postponed until after pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. If recently given birth, must be at least 12 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Physical and mental ability and willingness of participant to provide written&#xD;
                  informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current or prior history of cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior treatment for cervical disease; including treatment by cervical cryotherapy,&#xD;
             LEEP, cervical conization, total or partial hysterectomy, chemotherapy, or radiation&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior cervical procedure in the past 6 months, including dilatation and curettage&#xD;
             (D&amp;C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment or hospitalization within 21 days prior&#xD;
             to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence or any other condition that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the site investigator, would interfere with the participant s ability to adhere to&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
