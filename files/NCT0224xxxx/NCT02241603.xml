  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a common problem in the Veteran population as at least 1 in 3 Veterans are obese.&#xD;
      When obese people eat food they have less response in areas of the brain that sense pleasure&#xD;
      (reward). Decreased pleasure response to food predicts future weight gain. It is not known if&#xD;
      this poor brain response is reversible or why obese people's brains respond this way. Insulin&#xD;
      in the brain regulates the brain's sensing of pleasure. As people gain weight the function of&#xD;
      insulin becomes impaired. The investigators will study if impaired function of insulin is&#xD;
      related to a poor brain response to food and if this brain response predicts voluntary intake&#xD;
      of food and response to a diet. The investigators will also study if improving the function&#xD;
      of insulin with weight loss improves the brain response. These studies will improve the&#xD;
      understanding as to why weight loss is difficult and inform us if improving insulin signaling&#xD;
      is a potential way to treat obesity.&#xD;

      The current research proposal will investigate the relationship of insulin sensitivity to&#xD;
      brain reward signaling. In most obese individuals, insulin signaling is impaired (insulin&#xD;
      resistance). Preclinical animal studies suggest that insulin resistance in brain regions&#xD;
      important for reward contribute to overeating. This proposal aims to test these hypotheses in&#xD;
      humans and to determine if these characteristics are pertinent to clinical outcomes (food&#xD;
      intake and weight loss). In humans increased body mass index (BMI) and weight gain occur with&#xD;
      decreased food consumption-induced neural activation (consummatory reward) in the caudate of&#xD;
      the dorsal striatum. It has been speculated that diminished consummatory reward causes&#xD;
      overeating and prevents weight loss, however, this hypothesis has not been directly tested.&#xD;
      Further, mechanisms for impaired food consumption-induced neural activation in obesity have&#xD;
      not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research outcomes of the proposed study are: 1) insulin sensitivity determined by&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, 2) food consumption-induced neural activation as&#xD;
      determined by blood-oxygen dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI)&#xD;
      scanning, 3) caloric intake at a buffet meal, and 4) weight loss during a weight loss&#xD;
      intervention. Based on screening and baseline outcome assessments half of participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled in a weight loss intervention and then repeat outcomes measures after&#xD;
      intervention. Others will only complete baseline outcome measures. Secondary measures of the&#xD;
      study include whole brain activation analyses, neuroendocrine hormone measurement at the time&#xD;
      of imaging, psychometric measures including eating behaviors and personality characteristics,&#xD;
      and measures of reward sensitivity.&#xD;
