  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the&#xD;
      United States, but markers that predict risk of developing disease outside of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking have not been identified. Individuals with lung disease frequently have concurrent&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, but the reason for this is not well understood. In this study, we&#xD;
      will identify markers that predict risk of future lung disease and evaluate the concurrent&#xD;
      subclinical evolution of lung and heart dysfunction. This will allow for targeting of&#xD;
      preventive strategies to stop the rising incidence of COPD and other lung diseases and&#xD;
      provide insights into why heart and lung disease frequently occur together.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the&#xD;
      United States. Although smoking is a major risk factor for COPD, only a minority of smokers&#xD;
      develops COPD. Markers that predict risk of future COPD in young adults would be valuable to&#xD;
      target risk reduction strategies and identify subclinical disease. Although COPD is&#xD;
      classically defined by obstructive lung physiology, many individuals, including smokers, have&#xD;
      spirometric restrictive physiology. Reduced lung function, whether manifesting as COPD or&#xD;
      restriction, is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Our long-term goals are to&#xD;
      identify subclinical manifestations of COPD and other lung disease and explore why heart and&#xD;
      lung disease co-exist. This is an ancillary study to the Coronary Artery Risk Development in&#xD;
      Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort study's year 30 examination. We will add pre- and&#xD;
      post-bronchodilator spirometry to the exam and evaluate the lung parenchymal and vascular&#xD;
      structure on cardiac CT scans from year 25. Informed by our preliminary data which documents&#xD;
      that markers of systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are associated with&#xD;
      subsequent lung function decline in young adults, that lung function decline in young adults&#xD;
      is associated with incident hypertension, and that there is a divergence in cardiac structure&#xD;
      and function depending on the pattern of lung function decline, we propose the following&#xD;
      specific aims: (1) To evaluate factors in young adults that predict incident COPD and/or&#xD;
      restriction; (2) To determine whether incident COPD and incident restriction are associated&#xD;
      with distinct cardiac structural and functional changes; and (3) To determine the lung&#xD;
      structural and intrathoracic vascular changes associated with incident COPD and incident&#xD;
      restriction. We will test the hypothesis that early life markers of systemic inflammation and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction are associated with risk of subsequent lung disease and explore&#xD;
      whether different inflammatory markers predict different lung phenotypes. We will then&#xD;
      evaluate the cardiac structural changes associated with different lung phenotypes and&#xD;
      evaluate the lung structural and pulmonary vascular alterations that may explain the&#xD;
      concurrently evolving cardiovascular findings associated with developing lung disease. These&#xD;
      studies will describe the subclinical manifestations of lung disease, identify markers that&#xD;
      predict risk of future lung disease, and expand our understanding of heart-lung interactions&#xD;
      as they evolve from health in young adults to disease in middle age.&#xD;
