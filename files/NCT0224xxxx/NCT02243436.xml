      Phase I trial aimed to determine the Maximum Tolerable Dose of the BV in combination with&#xD;
      ESHAP in relapsed/resistant Hodgkin Lymphona patients and to evaluate response to treatment&#xD;
      with BV-ESHAP as salvage regimen prior to autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients suffering from Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) can be successfully treated with&#xD;
      standard chemo- and/or radiotherapy. However, in patients with refractory disease/relapsing&#xD;
      after first line of therapy, conventional-dose chemotherapy regimens induce low remission&#xD;
      rates, with long-term disease free survival not higher than 10% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has become the&#xD;
      standard treatment for these patients. This treatment approach results in long-term&#xD;
      remissions in approximately 40-50% of relapsed patients, and in up to 25-30% of those with&#xD;
      primary refractory disease. The possibility of a cure depends on several prognostic factors,&#xD;
      however, in almost all series, the strongest prognostic factor has been the disease status&#xD;
      before ASCT. Patients with HL who do not achieve complete remission (CR) after induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy and those with unresponsive relapse have a very poor prognosis. Therefore, the&#xD;
      choice of a very active pre-transplant salvage chemotherapy regimen is extremely important to&#xD;
      improve results after ASCT. In addition, this activity should also be combined with a good&#xD;
      stem cell mobilizing potential and low toxicity profiled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several pre-transplant salvage regimens for refractory/relapsed HL are currently used with an&#xD;
      overall response (OR) and CR rates ranging from 60% to 88% and from 17% to 49%, respectively.&#xD;
      No randomized trial exists comparing the effectiveness of these regimens. ESHAP (Etoposide,&#xD;
      Solumoderin (methylprednisolone), Ara-C (Cytarabine) and cisplatin) is one of the most&#xD;
      commonly used regimens. ESHAP induces an OR and CR of 73% and 41%, respectively, with 5%&#xD;
      toxic deaths. In the present study, a combination of ESHAP plus Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) is&#xD;
      proposed as pre-transplant therapy with the aim to improve the CR rate before ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HL is characterized by the presence of CD30-positive Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells. The&#xD;
      antibody-drug conjugate BV delivers the highly potent antimicrotubule agent monomethyl&#xD;
      auristatin E (MMAE) to CD30-positive malignant cells by binding specifically to CD30 on the&#xD;
      cell surface and releasing MMAE inside the cell via lysosomal degradation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Binding of MMAE to tubulin results in apoptotic death of the CD30 expressing tumor cell.&#xD;
