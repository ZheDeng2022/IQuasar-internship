  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase III clinical trial, approximately 320 eligible patients with OA of the knee&#xD;
      will receive Ampion™ 4 mL or Saline 4 mL (1:1) administered as three IA injections, 2 weeks&#xD;
      apart at Day 0, Week 2, and Week 4.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 320 male or female subjects, aged from 40 to 85 years, with OA knee&#xD;
      pain, will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 across two study arms, to receive three (3) IA&#xD;
      injections of either the active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or a placebo injection at Baseline (Day&#xD;
      0) and Weeks 2 and 4 after confirming eligibility regarding the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      listed below. Enrollment of Kellgren subjects will be limited to Kellgren III and IV only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be seven (7) in-clinic visits and three (3) phone visits. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      three (3) IA injections of active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and&#xD;
      Weeks 2 and 4. Subjects will also attend in-clinic visits at Week 6, Week 12, Week 20, Week&#xD;
      24 (final assessment). Post-treatment follow-up telephone calls will be made to each subject&#xD;
      within 24 hours of each IA injection (Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 2 and 4) with each call&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical effects of treatment on OA knee pain will be evaluated during clinic visits at&#xD;
      Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 20, and 24 using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis&#xD;
      Index (WOMAC®) osteoarthritis Index 3.1 (pain subscore and function subscore) and an overall&#xD;
      global severity assessment (Subject's Global Assessment [PGA]).&#xD;

    <description>The primary study objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ampion™ 4 mL versus a placebo injection from Baseline to Week 20 when administered as three IA injections (at Baseline Day 0 and Weeks 2 and 4) in improving knee pain in subjects suffering from OA of the knee.</description>

             study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, 40 years to 85 years old (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Index knee must be symptomatic for greater than 6 months with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
             OA and supported by radiological evidence (x-ray) acquired at screening and assessed&#xD;
             by a central reader. Subjects must have a Kellgren Lawrence Grade of III or IV for&#xD;
             inclusion in the study.&#xD;

             WOMAC® Index 3.1 5-point Likert Pain Subscale) assessed at screening and confirmed at&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to moderately-severe OA pain in the index knee (even if chronic doses of&#xD;
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID], which have not changed in the 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to screening, have been/are being used).&#xD;
