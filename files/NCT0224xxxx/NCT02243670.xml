    <textblock>
      This study uses an artificial intelligence platform to automatically confirm medication&#xD;
      ingestion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant platform&#xD;
      can be downloaded as an 'app' onto any smartphone to automate directly observed therapy&#xD;
      (Automated DOT®). Real-time patient adherence data are encrypted and automatically sent to a&#xD;
      centralized web-based dashboard for use by healthcare professionals or research staff. Unlike&#xD;
      Facetime® or Skype®, the system relies on computer vision algorithms to confirm the process&#xD;
      of medication administration; no human review is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability, and measure the&#xD;
      accuracy, of the AiCure platform (&quot;platform&quot;) in patients being treated for opioid dependence&#xD;
      with Zubsolv® over the course of 12 weeks. The following aims will be tested: 1) to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability to both participants and study staff in using AiCure to&#xD;
      monitor medication adherence; 2) to evaluate the acceptability of using AiCure to optimize&#xD;
      care pathways; and 3) to measure the reliability and validity of AiCure in detecting&#xD;
      interruptions in treatment. To assess feasibility and acceptability of the platform, we will&#xD;
      measure rates of physician satisfaction and user acceptance. Optimization of care pathways&#xD;
      will be measured by assessing the sustainability of AiCure use over 12 weeks (retention&#xD;
      rates) and measuring illicit opioid use (urine drug screens) compared to historical data.&#xD;
      Reliability and validity of AiCure will be measured by comparing AiCure adherence against&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be requested to take each of their prescribed doses using the app.&#xD;
      Participants will be able to download the app onto their own smartphone or will be&#xD;
      provisioned a device at the start of the study. The data captured during the medication&#xD;
      ingestion process will be automatically encrypted and stored on the participant smartphone&#xD;
      and uploaded wirelessly to a cloud-based dashboard. If a participant is non-adherent (missed&#xD;
      dose, incorrect dosage) or if suspicious behavior is detected, an automated alert will be&#xD;
      sent to study staff via email or SMS to prompt immediate intervention. In addition, all&#xD;
      participants will receive treatment as usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a multi-site, single-arm design. A total of approximately 50-100&#xD;
      participants - patients stable for at least 2 weeks on their current opioid replacement&#xD;
      medication - will be recruited for the study. All participants will receive their doctor's&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual. Patients not currently prescribed Zubsolv® will be switched to Zubsolv®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits include a screening visit, one baseline visit (which ideally will occur between&#xD;
      7 and 14 days after the screening visit), and bi-weekly visits for the 12 weeks (six visits)&#xD;
      following the baseline visit. During the baseline visit, participants will be trained on how&#xD;
      to use the AiCure app. Training consists of a number of interactive training steps to teach&#xD;
      the participant how to use the app correctly. Participants will be provided with three&#xD;
      placebo tablets for the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be reimbursed to cover their time and transportation costs in&#xD;
      accordance with Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines. Participants will receive&#xD;
      contingency management (CM) to reinforce regular use of the app. Orexo AB will provide the&#xD;
      study drug, Zubsolv®, to all participants throughout the 12-week treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the length of the study, participants will be requested to take each dose of their&#xD;
      prescribed Zubsolv® regimen using the AiCure app. Each medication administration event will&#xD;
      be saved onto the participant's smartphone and encrypted data (including de-identified video&#xD;
      and time and date of administration) will be automatically transmitted to the centralized&#xD;
      dashboard. Research staff will have access to the dashboard to view real-time and detailed&#xD;
      dosing histories for each participant. Access to the dashboard is roles-based and&#xD;
      password-protected. If a participant does not dose using the AiCure app (misses/skips a&#xD;
      dose), self-reports on the device or over the phone, or is tagged for suspicious behavior,&#xD;
      the participant will receive a combination of automated SMS text messages and tailored SMS&#xD;
      text messages / phone calls from research staff based on the pre-defined escalation protocol.&#xD;
