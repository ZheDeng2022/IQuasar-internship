    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder that occurs in genetically&#xD;
      predisposed populations. Patients affected by the disease may be asymptomatic or manifest&#xD;
      classic malabsorption symptoms of diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss&#xD;
      after gluten ingestion (and related derivatives found in other grains). Diagnosis and&#xD;
      screening begin with the use of serologic tests, i.e. IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG)&#xD;
      and IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (EmA). Duodenal biopsy, still considered by many as the&#xD;
      criterion necessary for diagnosis, demonstrates the pathologic findings of small intestinal&#xD;
      villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and intraepithelial lymphocytosis that occur on exposure&#xD;
      to dietary gluten. Genetic tests, revealing permissive haplotypes, may be helpful in&#xD;
      identifying susceptible individuals. CD diagnosis is still anchored to the criteria&#xD;
      established by the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition in&#xD;
      1990. These require the mandatory presence of (a) villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and&#xD;
      increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count when the patient is eating gluten, and (b)&#xD;
      a full clinical remission after elimination of gluten from the diet. As a consequence,&#xD;
      patients with minimal or no intestinal histology lesions pose a considerable problem, as&#xD;
      serum anti-tTG and EmA are known to be often negative, or weakly positive, in patients with&#xD;
      CD with mild intestinal damage. The investigators, in 2002, measured anti-tTG antibody in the&#xD;
      culture medium of intestinal biopsy specimens from patients with suspected CD and evaluated&#xD;
      the relationship between antibody production and severity of intestinal mucosal damage, and&#xD;
      demonstrated that anti-tTG assay of the culture medium of biopsy specimens can improve the&#xD;
      accuracy of CD diagnosis in patients negative for serum antibodies. The same investigators,&#xD;
      in 2011, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of EmA assay in the culture medium of intestinal&#xD;
      biopsies for CD diagnosis and demonstrated that EmA assay in the culture medium had a higher&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity than serum EmA and anti-tTG assay. The present study is performed&#xD;
      to investigate the clinical usefulness of the in vitro production of EmA in CD diagnosis in a&#xD;
      large number of consecutive adult patients with suspected CD and weakly positive [e.g. 2-3xN]&#xD;
      serum anti-tTG.&#xD;

      Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder that occurs in genetically&#xD;
      predisposed populations. Patients affected by the disease may be asymptomatic or manifest&#xD;
      classic malabsorption symptoms of diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss&#xD;
      after gluten ingestion (and related derivatives found in other grains). The astute clinician&#xD;
      must be aware of a more subtle GI picture, as well as non-GI signs and symptoms (e.g.,&#xD;
      iron-deficiency anemia, abnormal liver function tests, and type 1 diabetes mellitus).&#xD;
      Diagnosis and screening begin with the use of serologic tests, i.e. immunoglobulin A (IgA)&#xD;
      anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (EmA). The EmA test is&#xD;
      performed by indirect immunofluorescence against reagent monkey esophagus or human umbilical&#xD;
      cord. The EmA bind to the smooth muscle antigen tTG, and the test result is reported as&#xD;
      titers. EmA are both moderately sensitive and highly specific (sensitivity 85%-98%,&#xD;
      specificity 97%-100%) for CD, but quickly become negative when the patient starts a&#xD;
      gluten-free diet. Anti-tTG is a highly sensitive and specific test for CD and is widely&#xD;
      available as an automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from multiple manufacturers.&#xD;
      Although the sensitivity and specificity of this test is high, tTG can be present in as many&#xD;
      as 5% of control patients. In addition, false-positive tTG has been reported in patients with&#xD;
      Crohn's disease. Duodenal biopsy, still considered by many as the criterion necessary for&#xD;
      diagnosis, demonstrates the pathologic findings of small intestinal villous atrophy, crypt&#xD;
      hyperplasia, and intraepithelial lymphocytosis that occur on exposure to dietary gluten.&#xD;
      These changes exhibit improvement after withdrawal of gluten from the diet. Genetic tests,&#xD;
      revealing permissive haplotypes, may be helpful in identifying susceptible individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD diagnosis is still anchored to the criteria established by the European Society of&#xD;
      Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition in 1990. These require the mandatory&#xD;
      presence of (a) villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased intraepithelial&#xD;
      lymphocytes (IELs) count when the patient is eating gluten, and (b) a full clinical remission&#xD;
      after elimination of gluten from the diet. However, 20 years after those diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      were established, there is now growing evidence that at least two other factors must be&#xD;
      considered. First, symptomatic gluten sensitivity and malabsorption may coexist with a&#xD;
      normal-looking mucosa. Second, the finding of circulating IgA antibodies to tissue&#xD;
      transglutaminase (anti-tTG) or endomysium (EmA) at diagnosis is an extremely accurate&#xD;
      diagnostic instrument. As a consequence, CD diagnosis is nowadays also being done in&#xD;
      symptomatic patients presenting with a normal-looking mucosa but with a high titer of serum&#xD;
      EMA and/or anti-tTG antibodies. However, patients with minimal or no intestinal histology&#xD;
      lesions pose a considerable problem, as serum anti-tTG and EmA are known to be often&#xD;
      negative, or weakly positive, in patients with CD with mild intestinal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Picarelli et al., in 1996, tried to establish whether the small intestine of CD patients is&#xD;
      the site of EmA production and whether gliadin challenge could induce their release. The&#xD;
      authors evaluated small intestine biopsy samples from treated and untreated CD patients and&#xD;
      controls, cultured in vitro for 24-48 h in the presence of gliadin. EmA were detected in the&#xD;
      supernatants of these organ culture biopsy samples by immunofluorescence technique and&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. No EmA were found in the culture&#xD;
      supernatants of biopsy samples of controls, whereas they were detected in the culture&#xD;
      supernatants of all untreated CD patients, irrespective of gliadin challenge. Conversely, EmA&#xD;
      were not detected in supernatants of biopsy samples cultured in medium only from treated CD&#xD;
      patients, but were detected in the majority of the biopsy samples challenged with gliadin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators, in 2002, measured anti-tTG antibody in the culture medium of intestinal&#xD;
      biopsy specimens from patients with suspected CD and evaluated the relationship between&#xD;
      antibody production and severity of intestinal mucosal damage, and demonstrated that anti-tTG&#xD;
      assay of the culture medium of biopsy specimens can improve the accuracy of CD diagnosis in&#xD;
      patients negative for serum antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same investigators, in 2011, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of EmA assay in the&#xD;
      culture medium of intestinal biopsies for CD diagnosis and demonstrated that EmA assay in the&#xD;
      culture medium had a higher sensitivity and specificity than serum EmA and anti-tTG assay.&#xD;
      All patients with CD who were tested as false-negatives for serum EmA and/or anti-tTG carried&#xD;
      the human leukocyte antigen alleles associated to CD. Furthermore, during the follow-up, a&#xD;
      subgroup of patients with negative-serum EmA/anti-tTG, normal villi architecture, and&#xD;
      positive-EmA in the culture medium, developed villous atrophy and underwent gluten-free diet,&#xD;
      with consequent resolution of the symptoms and complete intestinal histology recovery. The&#xD;
      investigators concluded that EmA assay in the culture medium should be included in the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for CD diagnosis in &quot;seronegative&quot; patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is performed to investigate the clinical usefulness of the in vitro&#xD;
      production of EmA in CD diagnosis in a large number of consecutive adult patients with&#xD;
      suspected CD and weakly positive [e.g. normal value multiplied for 2-3 times, 2-3xN] serum&#xD;
      anti-tTG.&#xD;
