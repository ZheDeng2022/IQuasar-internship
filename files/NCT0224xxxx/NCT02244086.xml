      Abstract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural analgesia is the most safe and effective for the treatment of pain of childbirth&#xD;
      method. Epidural Bupivacaine provided excellent analgesia for labor and remains the most&#xD;
      widely used local anesthetic in obstetric anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of two concentrations of bupivacaine in women&#xD;
      in labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 114 patients were included in labor with term pregnancy. Were grouped randomly into&#xD;
      two groups: patients who received bupivacaine 0.125 % (Group A) and 0.25% bupivacaine (group&#xD;
      B). Patients in group A received 10 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine bolus. The patients in group B&#xD;
      received 10 ml. Bupivacaine 0.25% bolus. Pain intensity according to VAS, blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, respiratory rate, degree of motor block was assessed using the Bromage scale at&#xD;
      different periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Demographic characteristics and parity were compared, no statistically significant&#xD;
      differences. By comparing the values of the VAS measure 0, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes into&#xD;
      statistically significant differences in favor of the group with 0.25% Bupivacaine with&#xD;
      decreased pain perception after 30 minutes, p-value found 0.02. No differences in arterial&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate were found between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The concentration of 0.25% Bupivacaine has greater analgesic efficacy compared&#xD;
      with 0.125% bupivacaine.&#xD;

      Registration number 2013-2301-21 by Local Committee on Ethics in Health Research and the&#xD;
      Mexican Institute of Social Security General Hospital Zone 03. The investigators conduct the&#xD;
      study at the Hospital General Regional No. 17 in cancun, Quintana Roo. México. At time in&#xD;
      which the obstetrician determined active phase labor and requested obstetric analgesia,&#xD;
      patients randomly to one of two study groups being the group A which was administered 0.125%&#xD;
      bupivacaine and group B was administered 0.25 % bupivacaine, informed consent for the study&#xD;
      was collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood count, glucose, urea, creatinine and clotting times in the third trimester were&#xD;
      included. Preoperative coagulation tests in patients without underlying disease, are&#xD;
      expendable if clinical signs of hemorrhage are discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators were masking the patient. The patient was asked for which analgesia&#xD;
      bupivacaine unknown concentration that was applied to control the bias of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators were asking the applicator. One of the researchers selected from a randomized&#xD;
      list containing pages in both groups with numbers ranging from 0001 to 0114 with 57 subjects&#xD;
      for each group and these numbers selected were prepared in sterile form and start the day in&#xD;
      the morning, the amount of 10 ml syringes with foil for each mixture. Ten analgesics were&#xD;
      preparing during the day, those not performed bupivacaine were discarded, and the new day&#xD;
      preparations were made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardization of the technique and applicator. All anesthesiologists who participated in&#xD;
      the study were given a written description of the anesthetic technique used to standardize&#xD;
      procedures and avoid bias in the methodology of implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to performing the technique 500 ml of Ringer lactate was infused. Epidural Block (BP)&#xD;
      measurement was performed and performed a non-invasive monitoring of heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation monitor electronically. Which were recorded on the data collection sheet designed&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was placed in the left lateral position with knees flexed (fetal position) or&#xD;
      sitting. anesthesiologist used surgical clothes, cap and surgical masks, performed surgical&#xD;
      handwashing and used sterile gloves and sterile gown and performed surgical toilet of the&#xD;
      lumbar back region with iodine solution and sterile drapes were placed delimiting the&#xD;
      selected area. Puncture was performed at the level of the L2- L3 with a needle of 17 gauge&#xD;
      tuohy -Weiss . Epidural space The search was performed using the technique of loss of&#xD;
      resistance to air. The catheter was inserted and left inserted 3-4 cm into the epidural&#xD;
      space; was aspirated with a syringe of 3 ml and was determined not to leave blood or&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid. Sterile prefilled syringe medication to the anesthesiologist who&#xD;
      performed the procedure was given; which were injected with either a dose of 10 ml with the&#xD;
      corresponding concentration according to the group to which he belonged. Group A or 0.125%&#xD;
      bupivacaine dose of 10 ml and group B of 0.25 % bupivacaine. Catheter is firmly fixed to the&#xD;
      skin, to prevent their displacement with tape, leaving sealing the proximal end of the&#xD;
      epidural catheter. Sensory level as measured by thermal sensitivity this is done with closed&#xD;
      eyes of the patient, two test tubes filled, one with cold 5 water use - 10 ° C, and one with&#xD;
      hot water at 40-45 ° C, the skin touched the bottom of the tube for more than 3 seconds and&#xD;
      was asked to identify the patient saying &quot;cold&quot; or &quot;hot&quot;. The region was delimiting with&#xD;
      sensory block from zone to zone without blocking lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blocking engine if there was assessed using the modified Bromage scale. which was performed&#xD;
      by asking the patient to move his legs or feet and motor block grades were classified as&#xD;
      null, partial, complete or almost complete; purposes of numerical comparison gave these&#xD;
      categories numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively, where (0) is normal movement of legs and feet&#xD;
      (zero ), 1 the patient is able to flex knees with normal movement of feet (part), 2 Unable to&#xD;
      flex knees, but with normal foot movement (almost complete ), 3 Unable to move legs or feet&#xD;
      (full).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A applied 15 minutes of analgesia again recorded vital signs and note the analgesic level&#xD;
      were taken by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by the responsible investigator which collected the&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Values Blood Pressure Media (TAM ) &lt; 60mmHg presented the infusion of ringer lactate solution&#xD;
      at 5 ml / kg bolus and increase of 5 mg ephedrine was administered iv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of the variables involved in the preanalgesia and at 15, 30, 60 and 90&#xD;
      minutes after drug administration were registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables were measured: Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate),&#xD;
      sensitive metameric level, engine Block, degree of analgesia according to the VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was performed according to the following. Metameric sensory level: No blocking, below&#xD;
      umbilicus (&lt; T10), between the navel and xiphoid appendix him (T10 - T6), above the xiphoid&#xD;
      (&gt; T6). Motor block: 0: can lift both legs straight, 1: You can bend the knee and move your&#xD;
      feet, 2: You can only move your feet, 3: You cannot move the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS: value between 0 and 10 control / time. 0: no pain 10: Maximum pain imaginable. It was&#xD;
      determined by visual analog scale of 0 to 10 cm. Considering effective analgesia according to&#xD;
      centimeters decrease from baseline or pre VAS analgesia. Optimal reduction of the initial 4&#xD;
      cm, enough to decrease 3 cm, good with decrease of 2 cm, zero with reduced or unchanged 1cm .&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no analgesic efficacy with VAS valuation at 15 minutes, 5 ml was administered. Mixture&#xD;
      used over bupivacaine 0.25% or 0.125 and would restart measurement variables with the set&#xD;
      times at 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes, taking as required for registration and validity of the&#xD;
      study variables measuring at least 3 times, if delivery occurs before the scheduled time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      91 minutes was terminated measuring pain analysis records, and records of completion delivery&#xD;
      was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building a database was performed and the statistical program SPSS version 20.0 for Windows 7&#xD;
      was used and proceeded to perform the statistical analysis of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic efficacy according to the result of the measurement of the visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS), according to the result of the evaluation of this scale which is expressed in a&#xD;
      numerical value was determined, estimates of frequency measurement were performed, measures&#xD;
      dispersion and central tendency for each variable. Comparison of sociodemographic variables&#xD;
      (age, number of pregnancy, previous cesarean sections and previous births) and clinical (mild&#xD;
      pain, moderate pain, severe pain) that were generated was performed using Student's t test&#xD;
      for independent samples, and X2 and trend in the case of nominal variables. To compare&#xD;
      differences in variables in blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate, EVA, ANOVA for&#xD;
      repeated samples was performed.&#xD;
