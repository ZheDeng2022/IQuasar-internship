        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients have to sign and date an informed consent consistent with International&#xD;
             committee on harmonisation (ICH) - Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines prior to&#xD;
             participation in the trial, which included medication washout and restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and must&#xD;
             meet the following spirometric criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an&#xD;
             FEV1 ≤ 60% of predicted normal and FEV1 ≤ 70% of FVC (Visits 1 and 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients must have an increase in FEV1 of at least 12% from baseline 45 min after&#xD;
             inhalation of 80 μg of ipratropium inhaled via Hydro Fluoro Alkane (HFA) - Metered&#xD;
             Dose Inhaler (MDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older. Female patients of child bearing&#xD;
             potential could not participate in this study&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or who have a total blood&#xD;
             eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3. A repeat eosinophil count was not conducted in these&#xD;
             patients&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis or clinically evident bronchiectasis&#xD;

             conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six&#xD;
             weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone&#xD;

             be either:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Post-menopausal for at least two years&#xD;

         24. Patients with previous participation (receipt of randomized treatment) in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Patients who are participating in another study&#xD;
