  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit and require mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      frequently develop profound respiratory and limb muscle weakness. Studies show that the&#xD;
      development of weakness during the ICU stay results in poor outcomes. Currently there are no&#xD;
      treatments for this muscle weakness, but it has been suggested that this weakness might&#xD;
      improve with physical therapy. Electrical stimulation is a method to provide direct&#xD;
      stimulation to the muscles potentially enhancing function and improving strength. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to test the hypothesis that neuromuscular electrical stimulation of the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle will improve muscle strength in patients who are critically ill on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

      The basic study design is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtain informed consent from patient or the patients LAR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomize subjects to treatment with either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sham therapy, consisting of bilateral placement of Niveus Medical Muscle&#xD;
                Stimulation System 110 electrodes for 30 minutes twice daily without activation of&#xD;
                the electrical circuitry of the unit, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Active therapy, using the Niveus Medical Muscle Stimulation System 110 electrodes&#xD;
                to actively produce a rhythmic quadriceps contraction for 30 minutes twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure magnetic stimulated quadriceps twitch (QuadTw) strength bilaterally as well as&#xD;
           ultrasound assessment of quadriceps size&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Continue sham or active treatment daily for 7 days for a total of 14 sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Repeat measurements of magnetic stimulated QuadTw strength and ultrasound assessment of&#xD;
           quadriceps size on Day 8 or before Day 8 if the subject is to be discharged from the&#xD;
           hospital prior to the allotted duration of sham or active treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Functional measurement of the patient using the Functional Status Score for the ICU&#xD;
           (FSS-ICU) at the end of the treatment period or upon discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A member of the research team will visit the subject until hospital discharge and will&#xD;
           record total duration (days) of mechanical ventilation, duration (days) of mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation following study entry, duration of ICU stay, ventilator weaning time (days&#xD;
           measured from time of first spontaneous breathing trial to extubation), and total&#xD;
           duration (days) of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The investigators will also review each subject's medical record on entry into the study&#xD;
           to obtain demographic information including the following: age, sex, diagnoses,&#xD;
           medications, reason for institution of mechanical ventilation, vital signs at the time&#xD;
           of the initial visit, bedside parameters of mechanical ventilation use (including mode&#xD;
           of ventilation, duration of ventilation, level of oxygen, breath volume and rate, %&#xD;
           triggered breaths), most recent arterial blood gas values, and chest radiograph readings&#xD;
           at the time of the initial visit. The investigators will also record the subject's&#xD;
           weight, BMI and total intake and output values since admission to the ICU. In addition,&#xD;
           investigators will monitor each subject's progress in the ICU daily by reviewing the&#xD;
           subject's medical record and recording the clinical parameters as well as recording&#xD;
           daily weights and total intake and output. These parameters will also be assessed until&#xD;
           the time that the patient is discharged from the ICU. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
           will record and note all physical therapy and occupational therapy sessions that the&#xD;
           subject receives as part of the standard of care in the ICU and in the hospital up until&#xD;
           the time of discharge. In the University of Kentucky hospital, occupational therapy&#xD;
           records the Barthel Index at each session which uses a scale of 0-100 to assess an&#xD;
           individual's functional independence when performing activities of daily living (ADLs).&#xD;
           Physical therapy assesses functional status using Kansas University Hospital Physical&#xD;
           Therapy Acute Care Functional Outcomes, which also assesses functional status in the&#xD;
           categories of bed mobility, transfer, gait and walking distance.&#xD;
