      Target recruitment: 1000 subjects. The purpose of this research study is to continue to&#xD;
      investigate the safety and effectiveness of using MR (magnetic resonance) guided laser focal&#xD;
      therapy for prostate cancer and to evaluate oncologic control over 20 years. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that laser focal therapy can be used to achieve oncologic control in carefully selected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR uses large magnets to produce pictures of areas/organs inside the body. The laser uses&#xD;
      light to heat a target area to try to destroy cancerous cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laser system that will be used is called the Visualase® Thermal Therapy System. This&#xD;
      system has been used for the treatment of brain, bone (spine), thyroid, and liver cancers.&#xD;
      However; this study is the first time this system has been studied for use in the treatment&#xD;
      of prostate cancer with a trans-rectal approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR-guided biopsies and laser applicator placement will be performed using the Invivo DynaTRIM&#xD;
      trans-rectal biopsy guidance system. This system is cleared (approved) by the U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) for such uses.&#xD;

      Laser-induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel form of controlled, targeted&#xD;
      thermal ablation that may offer measurable advantages over other ablative therapies for focal&#xD;
      prostate therapy. Because LITT is magnetic resonance (MR) compatible, it enables an imaging&#xD;
      advantage over other surgical or ablation techniques that utilize transrectal ultrasound to&#xD;
      target and monitor treatment. MR imaging provides excellent soft-tissue contrast and&#xD;
      three-dimensional (3D) anatomical imaging in any arbitrary plane, which can help to improve&#xD;
      treatment planning and targeting. Additionally, MR-based temperature monitoring allows&#xD;
      real-time feedback during MRI-guided thermal therapy as both deposition of light energy and&#xD;
      MR signal acquisition can be performed simultaneously without degradation in the MR signal.&#xD;
      Also, being in the MR diagnostic environment allows use of post- treatment imaging to verify&#xD;
      tissue damage. Because MR images clearly depict the prostate anatomy and the surrounding&#xD;
      critical structures, MR imaging has been incorporated into planning for external- beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and other treatments of the prostate. In addition to these basic&#xD;
      features, Multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI) may be used to identify regions of disease in&#xD;
      the prostate and better target therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of a novel, FDA-approved&#xD;
      thermal therapy and feedback system (Visualase® Thermal Therapy System) for the treatment of&#xD;
      biopsy confirmed and MR-imageable prostate lesions. This system has been used in humans for&#xD;
      the treatment of brain, bone (spine), thyroid, and liver cancers. Early feasibility studies&#xD;
      for prostate cancer used a transperineal approach; however it is now being evaluated for the&#xD;
      primary treatment of prostate cancer using a transrectal approach. This system allows&#xD;
      delivery of laser energy while the patient is simultaneously being imaged by an MRI unit. The&#xD;
      system's real-time MR thermal imaging (MRTI) provides information on the thermal dose&#xD;
      delivered to the target, resulting in a more precise and controlled delivery which has&#xD;
      previously not been possible with other ablative therapies. The investigators hypothesize the&#xD;
      system can be integrated into a practical and feasible outpatient treatment paradigm for&#xD;
      focal treatment of localized prostate cancer and allow patients to avoid the complications&#xD;
      associated with radical whole-gland therapy.&#xD;
