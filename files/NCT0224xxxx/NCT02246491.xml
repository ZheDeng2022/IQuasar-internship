  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to better understand the causes of the disease&#xD;
      Ataxia-Telangiectasia and, in the longer-term, develop new therapies for the disease using&#xD;
      stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are a type of cells that can be made in the laboratory&#xD;
      from cells in your body, such as blood cells or skin cells (fibroblasts). These stem cells&#xD;
      can then be used for research purposes. For example, stem cells can be used to investigate&#xD;
      how the mutation in ATM causes the actual symptoms of Ataxia-Telangiectasia. In addition, the&#xD;
      stem cells can be used to screen for drugs that could be helpful to treat the disease or to&#xD;
      develop new laboratory techniques to correct the mutation that causes Ataxia-Telangiectasia.&#xD;
      where the mutation that causes the disease is corrected by the investigators. The stem cells&#xD;
      generated in this study will not be used directly for patient therapy and therefore this&#xD;
      research does not have a direct benefit to you. However, it will help advance our&#xD;
      understanding of the disease and develop future therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who enroll in this study will get all of the standard therapy they would get for&#xD;
      their tumor whether or not they participate in this study. There is no extra or different&#xD;
      therapy given. The study involves a one-time procedure (either blood collection or skin&#xD;
      biopsy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is a devastating genetic syndrome of neurodegeneration,&#xD;
      immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition caused by mutations in the locus encoding ATM&#xD;
      (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated). The current standard of care for A-T consists of aggressive&#xD;
      supportive measures, and the prognosis remains poor. There is therefore a pressing need to&#xD;
      develop novel experimental approaches and treatments for this disease. In this application,&#xD;
      we propose to address this need by developing for the first time human stem cell-based&#xD;
      technologies to: 1) generate novel experimental models for A-T that faithfully recapitulate&#xD;
      the features of the disease across its complex spectrum of clinical manifestations (Aim 1);&#xD;
      and 2) start to test the feasibility of regenerative therapies for A-T, via generation of&#xD;
      autologous stem cells that have been rendered disease-free by correction of the mutation (Aim&#xD;
      2). Mutations causing A-T are private, resulting in variable reduction in ATM activity and,&#xD;
      correspondingly, a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Although the most severe form of&#xD;
      the disease (&quot;classical&quot; A-T, with no detectable ATM) has been modeled in the mouse (ATM&#xD;
      &quot;knock out&quot;), this approach fails to recapitulate the neurological symptoms of the disease&#xD;
      and its characteristic tumor spectrum. Moreover, we are currently lacking experimental models&#xD;
      for those patients whose mutations result in reduced ATM activity (&quot;variant&quot; A-T). To address&#xD;
      these issues, experiments in Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the genotype-phenotype&#xD;
      correlation in A-T is maintained in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we will reprogram fibroblasts from A-T patients with variable&#xD;
      reduction of ATM levels and determine whether: 1) ATM expression and activity in the iPSCs&#xD;
      correlate directly with those observed in the patient fibroblasts they are derived from; 2)&#xD;
      the iPSCs recapitulate the phenotypes observed in the fibroblasts, including impaired cell&#xD;
      cycle checkpoint activation, defective DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, radiosensitivity&#xD;
      and genomic instability; and 3) these phenotypes in the iPSCs directly correlate with their&#xD;
      level of ATM expression/activity. If we find that the genotype-phenotype correlation is&#xD;
      maintained in A-T iPSCs, this work would validate a more general use of autologous iPSCs for&#xD;
      preclinical studies of A-T, including the evaluation of disease biomarkers, drug testing or&#xD;
      genetic screening. The clinical manifestations of A-T result from progressive cell loss and&#xD;
      tissue degeneration, making A-T a candidate disease for regenerative therapies. Experiments&#xD;
      in Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that correction of the ATM mutation in A-T somatic cells&#xD;
      will rescue their severe reprogramming defect and allow the generation of disease-free iPSCs.&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we propose a series of proof-of-principle experiments using a&#xD;
      well-characterized compound heterozygous A-T fibroblast cell line. First, we will &quot;repair&quot;&#xD;
      either one or the two ATM mutations in this line by recombination with an exogenous donor&#xD;
      plasmid carrying the intact sequence, to generate either &quot;carriers&quot; (one normal allele and&#xD;
      one mutated allele) or &quot;intact&quot; cells (two normal alleles). To increase the efficiency of&#xD;
      recombination, we will introduce a DSB in close proximity to the mutation using Transcription&#xD;
      Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENS) that bind specifically to the mutated region. In&#xD;
      Preliminary Experiments, we find that we can successfully induce DSBs and site-specific&#xD;
      recombination at a human &quot;safe harbor&quot; locus as well as at the ATM locus itself. After&#xD;
      verifying that recombination restores ATM expression and function, we will reprogram the&#xD;
      corrected cells into iPSCs and characterize their level of ATM expression, activity and&#xD;
      function with passage. Because the &quot;null&quot;, &quot;carrier&quot; and &quot;intact&quot; lines are isogenic, the&#xD;
      effect of ATM gene dose on reprogramming and iPSC function can be evaluated in these&#xD;
      experiments. In this regard, approximately 1% of the US general population is an A-T&#xD;
      &quot;carrier&quot;, extending the significance of this work well beyond A-T patients. Overall,&#xD;
      completion of this Exploratory Project will provide the rationale, expertise and reagents for&#xD;
      longer-term studies aimed at modeling and treating A-T with autologous iPSCs and/or their&#xD;
      derived products and optimizing the use of regenerative therapies for the general population.&#xD;
