    <textblock>
      Building on the success of community-based peer education and counselling in breastfeeding,&#xD;
      it is possible to address young child feeding and health practices in the surveyed district.&#xD;
      Opportunities that can optimise success and encourage behaviour change in the district&#xD;
      include mothers willingness to modify some feeding options; support of family members;&#xD;
      seasonal availability and accessibility of foods; established set-up of village peers and&#xD;
      existence of health centres and health staff in some villages. This study has developed a&#xD;
      feasible, context-specific nutrition education package for use in rural Tanzania. The package&#xD;
      is composed of 4 components, namely 1) education and counselling of mothers, 2) training of&#xD;
      community-based nutrition counsellors, 3) sensitisation meetings with health staff and family&#xD;
      members, and 4) supervision of community-based nutrition counsellors. The intervention will&#xD;
      use a parallel cluster-randomised controlled trial design where infants will be recruited&#xD;
      when aged 6 months and followed up for 9 months. The intervention expects to provide&#xD;
      information and, where appropriate, recommendations to strengthen the nutrition component in&#xD;
      the health education programme of the Tanzania child health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesises that the nutrition education package will be more effective than the&#xD;
      routine health education in improving feeding practices, dietary adequacy and growth of&#xD;
      infants and young children. Specific objectives of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of a nutrition education package on feeding practices and&#xD;
           dietary adequacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effectiveness of a nutrition education package in improving growth and&#xD;
           health of infants and young children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the process of implementation of the nutrition education package to promote&#xD;
           optimal feeding and health practice&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parallel cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in rural central Tanzania in&#xD;
      9 intervention and 9 control villages. A simple randomisation with a 1:1 allocation using a&#xD;
      list of random numbers generated in Microsoft Excel 2007 will be used to randomise villages&#xD;
      to either control or intervention group. Generation of allocation sequence and randomisation&#xD;
      of clusters will be done by a statistician blinded to study groups and not participating in&#xD;
      the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and collection of baseline information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cluster randomisation, sub-village leaders will identify all infants aged 6 months and&#xD;
      their parents in a systematic door-to-door survey. Parents will be invited to a meeting where&#xD;
      the nature and purpose of the trial and eligibility criteria will be explained. Thereafter,&#xD;
      their infants will be screened for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and infants who meet the inclusion criteria, agree to participate in the trial and&#xD;
      give a written informed consent will have their infants recruited. Baseline information of&#xD;
      recruited infants and their parents (i.e. household's, parents' and infant's characteristics)&#xD;
      will be collected using a structured questionnaire. Structured interviews with village and&#xD;
      sub-village leaders will also be conducted to collect village information (i.e. population,&#xD;
      health facility, water supply, schools, livelihoods, resources, economic opportunities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive routine health education offered monthly by health staff at&#xD;
      health facilities. Routine health education is a standard government health service for&#xD;
      children below the age of five years. It is offered to mothers during growth monitoring and&#xD;
      immunisation contacts. The sessions usually take 10-15 minutes and focus on general health&#xD;
      issues including child feeding, prevention of diseases such as malaria and importance of&#xD;
      immunisations. The intervention group will receive a nutrition education package in addition&#xD;
      to the routine health education. With the nutrition education package, mothers and caregivers&#xD;
      will receive 3 sessions of education and counselling on optimal infant and young child&#xD;
      feeding and health, when a child is aged 6, 9 and 12 months. Nutrition counsellors will&#xD;
      receive training at baseline and the session will be repeated after 6 months. After training,&#xD;
      the nutrition counsellors will conduct monthly home visits to counsel and support mothers and&#xD;
      their families. Supervisory visits will be conducted by the research team after every 2&#xD;
      months to assess counsellors' work. Separate sensitisation meetings with families and health&#xD;
      staff responsible for child health will be conducted at baseline and meeting will be repeated&#xD;
      after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection forms (structured questionnaires, observation checklists, etc.) have been&#xD;
      pre-tested in a neighbouring district and standardised. Interviewers will administer the&#xD;
      surveys in national language, Kiswahili. After data collection, all filled forms will be&#xD;
      manually checked for completeness and consistency. To enhance blinding, precise objectives of&#xD;
      the study and village allocation to trial will not be disclosed to data collectors; nutrition&#xD;
      counsellors will not be responsible for data collection; and data collection schedule will be&#xD;
      randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact evaluation data: In the intervention group, data on primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline and ages 9, 12 and 15 months. In the control group, the same&#xD;
      variables will be collected at baseline, and ages 12 and 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation data: A process evaluation will document the intervention implementation&#xD;
      process so as to 1) assess whether the intervention activities are implemented as planned&#xD;
      (i.e. fidelity), 2) evaluate the extent to which the intervention reaches the intended&#xD;
      mothers and their families (i.e. reach), 3) determine the degree to which targeted mothers&#xD;
      are exposed to intervention components and extent to which they use intervention resources&#xD;
      (i.e. exposure or dose received), and 4) describe the setting (i.e. contextual factors,&#xD;
      facilitators, barriers, contamination) into which the intervention is being implemented that&#xD;
      may have an influence on intervention effectiveness. In control villages, process evaluation&#xD;
      will identify and describe actions, events and context which may reveal new interventions,&#xD;
      evidence of contamination or other factors external to the intervention. Process evaluation&#xD;
      data will be collected two months after baseline (when infants are 8 months-old) and at the&#xD;
      end of intervention (when infants are 15 months-old). Structured and semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews, review of records (e.g. training and education attendance sheet, activity logs,&#xD;
      training test scores, etc) and structured observations will be carried out with mothers,&#xD;
      nutrition counsellors, health workers and village leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will visit intervention villages every 2 weeks in the first 2 months of&#xD;
      intervention, and thereafter visits will be made at 2-months interval. Researchers will log&#xD;
      and report all activities related to the delivery and quality of training, education,&#xD;
      supervision and sensitisation meetings using monitoring tools (e.g. forms, logs, observation&#xD;
      checklists, supervisory reports). Nutrition counsellors will document home visits in&#xD;
      workbooks. Actions or events external to the intervention which happen in the intervention&#xD;
      villages will be documented in event forms and semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered in Epi-data version 3.1 and consistency analysed by range checks of data&#xD;
      values. Data will be analysed using STATA release 12.0 (STATA Corporation, Texas, 2007).&#xD;
      Frequency distributions will be run to identify outliers. Impact evaluation data will be&#xD;
      compared between intervention and control villages using hierarchical or multi-level models&#xD;
      and presented at the cluster and individual levels. The methods will provide adjustment for&#xD;
      potential covariates and confounders at the cluster and individual levels. Data will be&#xD;
      analysed by intention to treat. The process evaluation data will use both inductive and&#xD;
      deductive approaches to analyse qualitative data using NVivo 10 for Windows (QSR&#xD;
      International, Australia).&#xD;
