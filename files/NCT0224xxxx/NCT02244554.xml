    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laser tattoo removal with&#xD;
      picosecond pulse durations as compared to treatment with nanosecond pulse durations using a&#xD;
      single novel Q-Switched (QS) Nd:YAG laser.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, split-tattoo, open-label, single-center study of up to 25 subjects with&#xD;
      tattoos containing black or dark blue ink, alone or in combination with other colors. It will&#xD;
      compare the safety and efficacy of nanosecond and picosecond pulse durations with the Cutera&#xD;
      Picosecond Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser for tattoo removal.&#xD;
