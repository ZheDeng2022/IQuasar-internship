      Depressive mood and anxiety are prevalent in patients suffering from early psychosis.&#xD;
      Treatments focused on these dimensions are rarely seen. Meanwhile, growing evidence showed&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) as an effective option in handling depression and&#xD;
      anxiety. There is a great possibility that MBI is also useful in depression and anxiety&#xD;
      associating with early psychosis. Given that cost-effectiveness is widely concerned in Hong&#xD;
      Kong or any other countries, a brief intervention is more favored. Current paper is a study&#xD;
      protocol for a randomized controlled trial which assess the feasibility of a 7-week&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention in patients with early psychosis targeting on their depressive&#xD;
      mood and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this RCT, 60 patients aged 18-65 with early psychosis less than 5 years' duration and mild&#xD;
      depressive mood or anxiety will be invited to join this single blind randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. After baseline assessments, eligible participants will be, using third party simple&#xD;
      randomization, randomly assigned to either the 7-week Mindfulness-based Intervention (MBI),&#xD;
      or the psychoeducation group as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is depressive mood and anxiety levels at post-intervention and 3 months.&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes include life functioning, quality of life, other general clinical&#xD;
      symptoms and mindfulness ability. Qualitative interviews will help evaluate and measure the&#xD;
      feasibility of the intervention. Data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized trial offers an insight into mindfulness-based intervention and its&#xD;
      effectiveness on psychosis concomitants. It provides the foundation for future evaluation and&#xD;
      implementation of an effective and cost-efficient treatment option.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Psychosis is a set of symptoms associated with distorted perception and cognition. Clinical&#xD;
      treatments that focus on positive symptoms, hallucination, and delusion are increasingly well&#xD;
      developed throughout the century. However peripheral facets such as depressive mood&#xD;
      (post-psychotic depression to its extreme) and anxiety have never been the foci of attention;&#xD;
      they are often viewed as less important than positive, negative, or cognitive symptoms, if&#xD;
      not entirely ignored. Sadly, depression and anxiety are prevalent in early psychotic&#xD;
      patients. Depression was found in 22% of people with First Episode Psychosis (FEP), and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders of social phobia was found in 32%, and obsessive compulsive disorder in&#xD;
      4-15% of people with FEP. These adverse conditions after the early acute stage of psychosis&#xD;
      are linked with poor engagement in treatment services and adverse impact on the change&#xD;
      process, resulting in poor treatment outcomes, lowered quality of life, and increased&#xD;
      likelihood of suicide. Given the high prevalence and extensive impact, there is a need to&#xD;
      explore adjunction intervention that targets mood and anxiety symptoms following onset of&#xD;
      psychotic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness is the awareness that emerges from paying attention to the present moment without&#xD;
      judgment. It is a skill that can be achieved through meditation practices, and has been shown&#xD;
      to improve general well-being. Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) has been referred to as&#xD;
      the &quot;third wave&quot; of psychological interventions after the first wave behavioral and the&#xD;
      second wave cognitive interventions. Research relating to MBIs has increased exponentially in&#xD;
      the past decade. Key, fully developed, MBIs in the literature include mindfulness-based&#xD;
      stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and acceptance and&#xD;
      commitment therapy (ACT). These interventions are increasingly used with individuals&#xD;
      suffering from depression or anxiety and have gained positive findings. Hofmann and&#xD;
      colleagues conducted an effect size analysis on 39 studies of MBI for anxiety and mood&#xD;
      symptoms in clinical samples. They found a moderately strong uncontrolled pre-post effect&#xD;
      size of MBIs on reducing anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms among individuals with&#xD;
      disorders not limited to anxiety disorders or major depression. The authors postulated that&#xD;
      MBIs may not be diagnosis-specific. Rather it is effective in reducing stress in general and&#xD;
      hence improves symptoms of anxiety and depression across a relatively wide range of&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since MBIs are efficacious in reducing mood and anxiety symptoms across various disorders, it&#xD;
      has potential intervention value for early psychosis as well. In a recent meta-review, Khoury&#xD;
      and colleagues concluded that MBIs have moderate therapeutic effects for psychosis. At the&#xD;
      same time, there are arguments against mindfulness practices on active psychotic patients,&#xD;
      and in people at risk of developing psychosis. In response, Chadwick et al. demonstrated in a&#xD;
      feasibility study the safe use of a mindfulness intervention on nine active psychotic&#xD;
      patients. Given the small sample size, further careful research, especially randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs), is needed to support its usage .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence on mindfulness-based interventions in treatment of mood and anxiety symptoms is&#xD;
      encouraging. Yet, only a small number of RCTs have been conducted on patients with early&#xD;
      psychosis to date. Further, with the limited resources available to the health system in Hong&#xD;
      Kong, we aimed to create a simple MBI specific for early psychosis patients, with a&#xD;
      user-friendly protocol that can be operated by health practitioners after sufficient yet&#xD;
      time-efficient training. Therefore, the current RCT protocol in assessing the efficacy of a&#xD;
      brief MBI on patients with early psychosis is of value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question is whether positive changes on depressive and anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      can be obtained through a 7-week MBI program designed for early psychotic patients.&#xD;
      Specifically, we hypothesized that the anxiety level and depressive mood can be significantly&#xD;
      reduced by our MBI. The second question we sought to answer is whether this change can be&#xD;
      maintained, as reflected in a 3-month follow up. Our secondary hypotheses are that since&#xD;
      depression and anxiety are lowered, those receiving the MBI will perceive having better&#xD;
      quality of life and overall functioning as a result&#xD;
