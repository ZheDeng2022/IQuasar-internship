    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      of a multi-peptide immunotherapy (BB-MPI-03) at three peptide+adjuvant dose levels. The&#xD;
      peptides stimulate cytotoxic T-cells targeting oncofetal antigen (OFA). Subjects with AML,&#xD;
      MM, sMM, or MDS who are off treatment and with stable disease or better, or who are not&#xD;
      eligible for or refuse allogeneic HSCT are to be enrolled. The study will be conducted at 2&#xD;
      to 4 study centers in the US.&#xD;

      The current study is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate safety, immunogencity, and potential anti-tumor activity of BB-MPI-03 at three&#xD;
      peptide plus adjuvant dose levels. Subjects with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (MM), smoldering multiple myeloma (sMM), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are&#xD;
      off treatment and with stable disease or better or who are not eligible for or refuse&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are to be enrolled. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted at 2 to 4 study centers in the United States (US).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study employs a sequential group, open-label, 3+3 dose- escalation design to determine&#xD;
      the safety and MTD of BB- MPI-03.&#xD;

    <measure>Determine the safety, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and optimal biologic dose (OBD) of BB-MPI-03 and adjuvants in subjects with hematologic cancers who are off treatment and with stable disease (SD) or better.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months treatment, 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The safety and tolerability of BB-MPI-03 in Montanide emulsion preceded by sargramostim will be measured by:&#xD;
The proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), DLTs, and AEs leading to study vaccine discontinuation.&#xD;
The proportion of subjects requiring a modification of the study treatment dose or schedule.&#xD;
Change from baseline in absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and platelet counts.&#xD;
The proportion of subjects with local injection site reactivity.&#xD;
Proportion of subjects experiencing infections or fevers requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the in vivo cellular immune response profile of BB-MPI-03 and adjuvants in subjects who receive 5 and 6 intradermal (ID) injections over a 6- month period.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Immunologic responses (change from Baseline) will be assessed by:&#xD;
DTH reaction to the peptides, as measured and photographed at 7 months using the &quot;ballpoint pen&quot; method.&#xD;
Peptide-specific T-cell proliferation to ELISPOT and tetramer assay.&#xD;
