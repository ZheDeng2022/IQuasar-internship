      This pilot research trial studies circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in predicting&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with stage IV head and neck cancer or stage III-IV non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer. Studying circulating tumor DNA from patients with head and neck or lung cancer in the&#xD;
      laboratory may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the predictive value of the circulating tumor DNA for disease-free&#xD;
      survival/progression-free survival in patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma (HNC)&#xD;
      and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate the levels of plasma tumor DNA with the salivary tumor DNA. II. To correlate&#xD;
      the mutations found in the circulating tumor DNA with the mutations in the tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the association between presence and absence of circulating tumor DNA&#xD;
      mutation with the tumor burden assessed by using the radiological findings and pre-treatment&#xD;
      fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-derived metrics: metabolic tumor&#xD;
      volume (MTV), maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), total glycolytic activity (TGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To quantify tumor-specific exosomes from plasma. V. To evaluate the utility of&#xD;
      cancer-derived exosomes to serve as prognostic biomarkers for real-time monitoring of&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy and identifying early recurrence using longitudinal samples from cancer&#xD;
      patients undergoing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection within 1 month before surgery, radiation therapy, or&#xD;
      chemotherapy; within 1 week after surgical resection (for patients having upfront surgery);&#xD;
      within 1 month before beginning of post-operative radiation therapy (for patients having&#xD;
      upfront surgery); during the second week of radiation therapy, during the last week of&#xD;
      radiation therapy; and at 1 and 3 months after radiation therapy and then every 3 months for&#xD;
      up to 18 months. Patients also undergo saliva sample collection within 1 month before&#xD;
      surgery, radiation therapy, chemoradiation therapy, or system chemotherapy and tissue&#xD;
      collection at the time of surgery (if upfront surgery is indicated). Blood, saliva, and&#xD;
      tissue samples are analyzed for tumor mutations via next generation sequencing.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the predictive value of circulating tumor DNA for DFS/PFS, Cox proportional model will be utilized. Circulating tumor DNA will be treated as either continuous or categorical variables in the regression models. The optimal cut-off value to dichotomize the patients by circulating tumor DNA will be determined by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve.</description>
