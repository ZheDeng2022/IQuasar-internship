  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. Patients will be assessed pre-operatively, at 24&#xD;
      and 48 hours for the primary outcome and secondary outcomes (except for Oxford Knee Score&#xD;
      which will be assessed pre-operatively and at 6 months post-operatively by the ortho-paedic&#xD;
      team).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To demonstrate whether adductor canal nerve infusions result in superior&#xD;
      patient mobilisation within the first 48 hours following total knee replacement compared to&#xD;
      femoral nerve catheter infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To identify whether adductor canal nerve infusions result in superior&#xD;
      analgesia within the first 48 hours following total knee replacement compared to femoral&#xD;
      nerve catheter infusions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are comparing a continuous adductor canal block with a low concentration continuous&#xD;
      femoral nerve block. We currently use a low dose femoral nerve catheter based technique as&#xD;
      part of our standard treatment strategy for total knee arthroplasty. The use of a catheter&#xD;
      provides prolonged analgesia compared to a single shot block, and also allows a lower&#xD;
      concentration of local anaesthetic to be employed, thus potentially reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      motor blockade. The concentration of local anaesthetic employed in our routine practice&#xD;
      (0.0625% L- Bupivacaine) is lower than that routinely used in many other centres, and most&#xD;
      clinical studies have compared higher concentrations of local anaesthetic - this might be&#xD;
      expected to produce more motor blockade. The concentration we use is higher than the minimum&#xD;
      effective concentration for a femoral catheter infusion for knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
