    <measure>Hypertrophic Scarring (HTS) as Assessed by Score on the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) Rated by Blinded Plastic Surgeons</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) assesses color match to surrounding skin, skin texture, contour, and distortion, and total MSS score ranges from 4 to 14, with a higher score indicating worse scarring. Scars were analyzed by three blinded plastic surgeons, who evaluated frontal and basal photographs of participants. The median of the three surgeon scores per participant was first calculated, and then the median all medians was calculated per arm.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) assesses color match to surrounding skin, skin texture, contour, and distortion, and total MSS score ranges from 4 to 14, with a higher score indicating worse scarring. Scars were analyzed by crowdsourced raters via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The crowdsourced raters evaluated frontal and basal photographs of participants. 100 unique responses were elicited per participant. The mean of all crowdsourced ratings for each arm is reported per arm.</description>

        <title>Hypertrophic Scarring (HTS) as Assessed by Score on the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) Rated by Blinded Plastic Surgeons</title>
        <description>The Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) assesses color match to surrounding skin, skin texture, contour, and distortion, and total MSS score ranges from 4 to 14, with a higher score indicating worse scarring. Scars were analyzed by three blinded plastic surgeons, who evaluated frontal and basal photographs of participants. The median of the three surgeon scores per participant was first calculated, and then the median all medians was calculated per arm.</description>

        <description>The Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) assesses color match to surrounding skin, skin texture, contour, and distortion, and total MSS score ranges from 4 to 14, with a higher score indicating worse scarring. Scars were analyzed by crowdsourced raters via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The crowdsourced raters evaluated frontal and basal photographs of participants. 100 unique responses were elicited per participant. The mean of all crowdsourced ratings for each arm is reported per arm.</description>
