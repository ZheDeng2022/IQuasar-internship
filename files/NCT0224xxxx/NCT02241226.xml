    <textblock>
      It is becoming increasingly recognized in the literature that ancient practices for&#xD;
      wellbeing, including meditation, yoga, and specific herbs, can improve health and promote&#xD;
      longevity. While studies have documented such effects for a variety of individual practices&#xD;
      for wellbeing, few studies have taken a more whole systems approach that is simultaneously&#xD;
      inclusive of numerous practices. This intervention study, the &quot;Self-Directed Biological&#xD;
      Transformation Initiative&quot;, will examine the effects of a comprehensive whole systems&#xD;
      approach to wellbeing on key biochemical, physiological, and psychosocial endpoints.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the Perfect Health program at the Chopra Center for Wellbeing will&#xD;
      be compared to individuals not taking the program.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the effects of the Self-Directed Biological Transformation Initiative (SBTI)&#xD;
           course participants compared to control group participants on key biochemical and&#xD;
           physiological markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effects of the SBTI course participants compared to control group&#xD;
           participants on short- and long-term changes in heart rate variability, level of&#xD;
           activity, and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the effects of the SBTI course participants as compared to control group&#xD;
           participants on mood and wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE It has long been thought that ancient practices can promote&#xD;
      longevity and wellbeing but there is little empirical evidence and it is difficult to test&#xD;
      this under controlled or experimental conditions. Recently, however, there have been several&#xD;
      cellular-based markers that may index rate of biological aging. The rate of telomere&#xD;
      shortening, as indexed by change in telomere length and telomerase activity, predicts both&#xD;
      cellular and human longevity (Lin et al, 2012). It is related to malleable factors, lifestyle&#xD;
      and psychological state (Puterman &amp; Epel, 2012). A secondary measure that shows promise of&#xD;
      understanding rate of cellular aging is examination of gene expression, particularly genes&#xD;
      related to aging. Preliminary evidence suggests that mind-body practices may slow the rate of&#xD;
      cellular aging by improving the telomere/telomerase maintenance system. This has been&#xD;
      examined in four small studies so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first study of its kind, a four month intensive lifestyle modification program,&#xD;
      including yoga and group support was associated with an increase in telomerase in 39 men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer (in preparation). There was no control group in this study. However, those&#xD;
      with the greatest decreases in distressing thoughts about having cancer showed the biggest&#xD;
      increases in telomerase activity (Ornish et al, 2008). In a second study, healthy men and&#xD;
      women were randomized to a 3-month intensive in-residence meditation group or wait list&#xD;
      control group. The researchers examined telomerase only post intervention and found that the&#xD;
      meditation group had 30% higher telomerase, and further increases in wellbeing were&#xD;
      associated with increases in telomerase (Jacobs et al, 2011). In another study with an active&#xD;
      control group, examined 39 elderly high stress dementia caregivers. They randomized half the&#xD;
      group to Yoga Nidra, listening to a 15 minute tape each day of Yoga Nidra, which includes&#xD;
      instruction on breathing and hand movements and half to a control group which listened to a&#xD;
      relaxation tape for 15 minutes each day. Eight weeks later, they found greater telomerase&#xD;
      increases in the Yoga Nidra group, and across the sample, decreases in depressive symptoms&#xD;
      were associated with increases in telomerase activity (Lavretsky et al, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar studies have reported positive effects of such practices on inflammatory profiles and&#xD;
      gene expression (Tang, Ma et al. 2009, Bhasin, Dusek et al. 2013, Saatcioglu 2013). Another&#xD;
      well studied parameter for practices such as meditation and yoga is heart rate variability&#xD;
      (HRV) as it provides a broad measure of autonomic nervous system activity. Observational&#xD;
      studies report HRV to be associated with stress in the workplace,(Jarczok, Jarczok et al.&#xD;
      2013) depressive and anxiety disorders (Gorman and Sloan 2000), and in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic somatic complaints (Tak, Riese et al. 2009). Meditation and yoga interventions to&#xD;
      improve HRV can lead to improved physiologic and clinical outcomes (Wheat and Larkin 2010,&#xD;
      Papp, Lindfors et al. 2013). Other parameters can also be of potential benefit in evaluating&#xD;
      an individual's overall wellbeing. For example, sleep duration and quality, as well as&#xD;
      general activity levels can both contribute to and reflect overall wellbeing. To date,&#xD;
      however, lack of compelling data around objective measures of wellbeing is in large part due&#xD;
      to challenges associated with long term monitoring of monitoring of appropriate patient&#xD;
      populations. However, recent advances in biosensor technologies have overcome this limitation&#xD;
      and now allow for the non-obtrusive and passive monitoring of individuals for long periods of&#xD;
      time. These new data streams of real-time physiologic data, couple with sophisticated and&#xD;
      individualized data analytics can potentially identify novel measures of individual wellness,&#xD;
      which will allow for the development of personalized therapeutic interventions to improve&#xD;
      wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, while the results of many of the studies of traditional practices are compelling, in&#xD;
      reality, and according the more whole system approaches such as Ayurveda and Chines Medicine,&#xD;
      traditional practices are rarely practiced singularly, i.e, typically yoga asanas are&#xD;
      practiced with meditation as well as a form of pranayama (breathing). With this&#xD;
      consideration, few scientific studies have taken a more comprehensive &quot;whole systems&quot;&#xD;
      approach that is simultaneously inclusive of numerous practices. Regarding outcomes, this&#xD;
      study will take a systems biology approach to examining the biochemical, physiological, and&#xD;
      psychosocial effects of the intervention. It is anticipated that the findings will&#xD;
      demonstrate the value of taking a more inclusive and comprehensive whole systems approach to&#xD;
      improving wellbeing and improved health.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women between the ages of 40-80 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Self-reported diagnosis of a major medical condition, such as cancer (including those&#xD;
             who have received past radiation or chemotherapy treatment), heart disease, autoimmune&#xD;
             disease, or diabetes, as these can affect the cell aging system and possibly the&#xD;
             ability for telomerase to change in short periods&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals taking antidepressant medication will be excluded since such medication&#xD;
             appears to increase telomerase (Wolkowitz et al, 2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individuals with diagnosed PTSD will be excluded; there is evidence that those with&#xD;
             PTSD may have lower telomere length as compared to those without PTSD (O'Donovan et&#xD;
             al, 2011). It is currently unknown how PTSD may impact telomerase levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Estrogen use is excluded as it increases telomerase (Lin et al, 2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Smokers will be excluded since smoking decreases telomerase. We will base smoking&#xD;
             status on self report. If participants have not smoked regularly for the past 6&#xD;
             months, they will be considered a 'non-smoker&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women are excluded since the cell aging system changes during pregnancy in&#xD;
             ways that have not been studied&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or greater will be excluded due to&#xD;
             differences in telomerase activity in obese women&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Potential eligible participants who are unable to secure the week off from work or&#xD;
             other responsibilities will not be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known atrial fibrillation or other chronic dysrhythmia&#xD;
