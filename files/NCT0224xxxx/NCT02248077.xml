    <description>AutoloGel consists of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel produced from the patient's own peripheral blood and pharmaceutical additives including calcium chloride, thrombin and ascorbic acid. The AutoloGel product is obtained by processing the patient's own blood using the AutoloGel System. After the final AutoloGel formulation is produced it is used immediately for patient's specific ulcer care.</description>

          6. For patients with multiple potential Index DFUs, the largest ulcer will be selected.&#xD;
             There must be at least 4 cm between the Index Ulcer and other ulcers; if all ulcers&#xD;
             are closer than 4 cm, the patient should not be enrolled (screen failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Demonstrated offloading regimen&#xD;

          8. A wound age of ≥ 30 days at the Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient must be willing to comply with the protocol, which will be assessed by&#xD;
             enrolling clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

             are available&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The non-healing wound is located between the knee and ankle and may include ankle&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For patients with multiple potential Index VLUs, the largest ulcer will be selected.&#xD;
             There must be at least 4 cm between the Index Ulcer and other ulcers; if all ulcers&#xD;
             are closer than 4 cm, the patient should not be enrolled (screen failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Demonstrated compression regimen&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients have been seen at the site for 2 weeks prior to randomization with no greater&#xD;
             than 20% reduction in wound area or volume and documented wound measurements are&#xD;
             available&#xD;
