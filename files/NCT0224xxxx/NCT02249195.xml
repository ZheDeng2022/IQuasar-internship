      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, the numbers of women who have a pre-existing cardiovascular disease or develop&#xD;
      cardiac problems during pregnancy are increasing and, due to the lack of evidenced-based&#xD;
      data, this provides challenges for the treating physician. Cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      pregnancy is a complex topic as women can present either pre- or postpartum, due to a&#xD;
      pre-existing heart disease such as e.g. operated or unoperated congenital heart disease,&#xD;
      valvular heart disease, and chronic hypertension or familial dilated cardiomyopathy. On the&#xD;
      other hand, there are diseases which are directly associated with pregnancy such as&#xD;
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). Women often present&#xD;
      with symptoms and signs of cardiovascular disease such as palpitations and shortness of&#xD;
      breath, or even directly in acute heart failure. There is, in particular, a paucity of data&#xD;
      from developing countries of this unique disease pattern and presentations. Pregnancy poses a&#xD;
      physiological stress test as cardiac output increases by 30-50% close to term. Further&#xD;
      haemodynamic stress occurs during labour and many of the effects of pregnancy on&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) persist for several months after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awareness of the different cardiovascular diseases that can occur in pregnancy or postpartum&#xD;
      has received limited attention and the main focus has been on hypertension and preeclampsia.&#xD;
      The global impact of elevated blood pressure (BP)/hypertension, in general, is profound, as&#xD;
      it is responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other cardiovascular risk factor,&#xD;
      including tobacco use, obesity and lipid disorders (Vos, Sliwa et al. Lancet 2012; Gersh &amp;&#xD;
      Sliwa, Eur Heart J 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the higher income countries, 80% of worldwide CVD-related deaths now occur in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries (LMICs) (Sliwa, Stewart Circulation 2011; Abergunde, Mathers et al,&#xD;
      Lancet, 2007). In LMICs, morbid and fatal CVD-related events typically occur at a younger age&#xD;
      and affect more women (commonly in pregnancy), thereby exerting a more profound impact on the&#xD;
      family unit and the workforce. The recently published Global Burden of Disease Study which&#xD;
      reports on Years Lived with Disabilities (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and&#xD;
      injuries does not report on the prevalence of CVD pre- and postpartum as an entity. However,&#xD;
      globally, it is estimated that CVD and, in particular, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,&#xD;
      complicate 2-8% of pregnancies contributing, to a major extent, to maternal mortality&#xD;
      worldwide (Sliwa, Cardiovascular Research, in press 2014). Chronic hypertension is now&#xD;
      prevalent in 3% of women falling pregnant in the US (Seely and Ecker, N Engl J Med, 2011) and&#xD;
      will also influence the prevalence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent confidential inquiry into maternal death in South Africa reported that of the 4867&#xD;
      deaths reported over 2 years, 14% were due to hypertensive disorders, with another 8.8% due&#xD;
      to medical and surgical conditions (www.hst.org/za/saving-mothers-2008-2010. This makes&#xD;
      cardiac disease in pregnancy a key focus area, with the aim of reducing morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, not only by the South African Department of Health but also by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization and World Heart Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently carried out a single-centre prospective study on women presenting with CVD&#xD;
      in pregnancy at Groote Schuur Hospital, University of Cape Town, South Africa (manuscript&#xD;
      submitted). This study investigates an appropriate referral algorithm and reports on disease&#xD;
      presentation (n=226) and outcome of those patients, with significant disease warranting&#xD;
      follow-up at a tertiary care (n=152). Of the 152 women that were asked to come back for&#xD;
      follow-up, the CDMC 122 (80.2%) presented prepartum. The most common diagnoses where&#xD;
      congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy and other diagnoses such as&#xD;
      e.g. Wolf-Parkinson-White, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmogenic right ventricular&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of these patients is complex as palpitations in pregnancy are common due to&#xD;
      increased sympathetic tone. It is important to distinguish palpitations secondary to benign&#xD;
      tachycardias, such as sinus tachycardia, from more important arrhythmias, such as&#xD;
      supraventricular or ventricular tachyarrythmias. Supraventricular arrhythmias are known to&#xD;
      increase in pregnancy, presumably because of an increase in sympathetic tone. Ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmias secondary to some long QT syndrome subtypes are known to increase in the&#xD;
      peripartum period. On the other hand, undiagnosed complex arrhythmia can have serious&#xD;
      consequences for the mother and fetus, including stroke and death. Most CV drugs are&#xD;
      contraindicated in pregnancy or have a FDA class C and D classification - e.g. beta-blockers&#xD;
      (C &amp; D), soltalol (C) and amiodarone (D). The treating physician therefore needs to document&#xD;
      the exact nature of the arrhythmia-causing symptoms, such as palpitations, dizziness and&#xD;
      syncope, prior to making a decision on pharmacological or device management. As 24-hour&#xD;
      holters have a low diagnostic yield, the use of an ECG loop recorder ( REVEAL) could&#xD;
      potentially influence management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, we have used the REVEAL XT in 2 pregnant women with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      arrrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and a strong family history of sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death. Sinus tachycardia was present and correlated with the symptoms of palpitations. As&#xD;
      only supraventricular tachycardia was detected, patients could be managed conservatively and&#xD;
      had good maternal and fetal outcome. On the other hand, 2 other women presenting with&#xD;
      palpitations and dizziness in pregnancy were subsequently diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis,&#xD;
      a serious condition associated with sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. To investigate the use of a small ECG loop recorder (REVEAL devices) in pregnant&#xD;
           women, with or without structural heart disease, in whom supra/ventricular&#xD;
           tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrythmias are suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. To investigate if the REVEAL device will change management compared to a single 24&#xD;
           hour holter done at presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our research question is based on preliminary information, having used the REVEAL XT in&#xD;
           2 pregnant women with newly diagnosed arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy&#xD;
           and a strong family history of sudden cardiac death. As only supraventricular sinus&#xD;
           tachycardia was detected, patients could be managed conservatively and had good maternal&#xD;
           and fetal outcome. On the other hand, 2 other women presenting with palpitations and&#xD;
           dizziness in pregnancy were subsequently diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis, a serious&#xD;
           condition associated with sudden cardiac death. A REVEAL device should have been used to&#xD;
           guide the physician in management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients will be recruited via a single-centre, prospective study of women with&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease presenting pre- or postpartum, attending Groote Schuur Hospital.&#xD;
           Since 1 July 2010, these patients have been seen at a weekly clinic, jointly run by&#xD;
           cardiologists and obstetricians, under the leadership of Prof. Karen Sliwa and Prof John&#xD;
           Anthony. We see about 100 new patients presenting with cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
           pregnancy per annum. About 200 newly diagnosed pregnant women with documented or&#xD;
           suspected cardiovascular disease will be screened for the indication to insert a REVEAL&#xD;
           device. Those patients will be part of an ongoing registry entitled: Registry of newly&#xD;
           diagnosed cases with cardiac disease in maternity-Phase II ( CDM-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The REVEAL device has the size of a larger USB stick and can be inserted under local&#xD;
           anaesthetic under sterile conditions as e.g. a minor procedure room. It is inserted&#xD;
           under the skin and there are no wires connecting it e.g. to the cardiac chambers or any&#xD;
           vessels. The device can record the cardiac rhythm for the period to up to one year. The&#xD;
           REVEAL is routinely ised in South Africa for more than 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design and treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
           A single-centre, observational outcome study investigating peripartum women presenting&#xD;
           with symptoms and signs of arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We aim to recruit 20 consecutive women with an indication for the REVEAL, from a&#xD;
           population of about 200 pregnant women with documented or suspected cardiovascular&#xD;
           disease as part of the ongoing cardiovascular disease in pregnancy registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Human Ethics Committee approval has been obtained for the overall prospective outcome&#xD;
           study on cardiovascular disease in pregnancy (HEC REF: 173/2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Estimate study duration: 2 years Estimate study start date: June 2014 Estimate study end&#xD;
           date: May 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our prospective study will answer the questions whether REVEAL devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. Are acceptable as a diagnostic tool in pregnant women. This will be assessed by&#xD;
           documentation of a number of women presenting with an indication to have the REVEAL&#xD;
           inserted (based on standard criteria) and a number of women accepting to have the&#xD;
           device. We see about 100 new patients presenting with cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
           pregnancy per annum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2. Detect arrhythmias in pregnancy and can guide the cardiologist and obstetrician in&#xD;
           appropriate management, ranging from assurance, to medical therapy, to device therapy or&#xD;
           termination of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3. Change the management of the condition compared to a single ECG performed at the&#xD;
           day of offering insertion of the REVEAL device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurable outputs and Publication Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presentation of data In the past decade I have been invited annually to present my research&#xD;
      in the form of invited lectures at the following meetings: Congress of the Heart Failure&#xD;
      Association of the ESC; European Cardiac Society of Cardiology, World Congress of Cardiology,&#xD;
      South African Heart Failure Society, Pan African Cardiac Society. The data obtained from the&#xD;
      study will be presented at those meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of Original Data The data will be published as part of the overall cardiac&#xD;
      disease in pregnancy registry and as a separate paper.&#xD;
