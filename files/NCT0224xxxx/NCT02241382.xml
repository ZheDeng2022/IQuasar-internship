      Implantation of internal defibrillators, capable of monitoring the heart and shocking life&#xD;
      threatening arrhythmias back to normal rhythm, for patients with severe heart failure&#xD;
      increases the probability of survival. Arrhythmias of the atria of the heart are common in&#xD;
      these patients. Administering a direct current electrical shock under anesthesia&#xD;
      (cardioversion) is the method of choice to reestablish normal sinus rhythm in this instance.&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy of external electrical cardioversion (CV) in patients with ICDs was&#xD;
      demonstrated in several studies. Safety of internal cardioversion (shocking the heart back&#xD;
      into normal rhythm via the implanted defibrillator) was described in several smaller trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing external instead of internal cardioversion in patients with implanted ICDs is more&#xD;
      feasible for most hospitals, as CV can be performed without a programming computer and an&#xD;
      additional specialist present, e.g. on the intensive care ward, and device interrogation can&#xD;
      be done after CV at the remote ICD/pacemaker clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No scientific data on safety and efficacy endpoints comparing internal vs external CV is&#xD;
      currently available. The aim of the study is to compare external vs internal electrical&#xD;
      cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias and establish a safety and efficacy profile for external&#xD;
      and internal cardioversion in large cohort of ICD patients.&#xD;

      Introduction A mortality benefit of implanted cardiac defibrillators in patients (pts) with&#xD;
      severely impaired LV function has been established in multiple large trials. Atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, -flutter and -tachycardia are a common comorbidity in this patient population.&#xD;
      Cardioversion is the method of choice to reestablish normal sinus rhythm in this instance.&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy of external electrical cardioversion (CV) in patients with pacemakers and&#xD;
      ICDs could be shown in several smaller single center trials. Safety of internal cardioversion&#xD;
      was described in several smaller trials. Reports on efficacy of internal CV vary between 33%&#xD;
      and 83% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing external instead of internal cardioversion in pts with implanted ICDs is more&#xD;
      feasible for most hospitals, as CV can be performed without a programmer present, e.g. on the&#xD;
      ICU ward, and device interrogation can be done after CV at the remote ICD/pacemaker clinic. A&#xD;
      working group of the German cardiac society recommends internal CV for patients carrying an&#xD;
      ICD, suggesting a superior safety profile for internal CV, despite conflicting data and a&#xD;
      lack of evidence and on this issue. Thus, posing a problem in logistics for many hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No scientific data on safety and efficacy endpoints comparing internal vs external CV is&#xD;
      currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study To compare external vs internal electrical cardioversion for atrial&#xD;
      arrhythmias and establish a safety and efficacy profile for external and internal&#xD;
      cardioversion in large cohort of ICD patients. This study will provide vital evidence for&#xD;
      future recommendations regarding cardioversion in the growing population of patients carrying&#xD;
      implanted ICD and pacemakers. The main purpose will be to establish non-inferiority of&#xD;
      external electrical cardioversion to internal electrical cardioversion. This would impact day&#xD;
      to day practice in many arrhythmia centers and smaller hospitals around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial populations and choice of primary analysis set The full-analysis set (FAS) is derived&#xD;
      from the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. This dataset includes all trial subjects&#xD;
      randomized, with any valid data on the primary target variables &quot;occurrence of severe lead&#xD;
      and device impairment&quot; and &quot;restoration of normal sinus rhythm&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The per-protocol set includes all trial subjects who were essentially treated according to&#xD;
      protocol (i.e. who have been cardioverted as assigned) and for whom the primary target&#xD;
      variables &quot;occurrence of severe lead and device impairment&quot; and &quot;restoration of normal sinus&#xD;
      rhythm&quot; could be determined based on complete and meaningful documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a non-inferiority trial there are special issues in the choice of primary analysis set.&#xD;
      Conservatism or anticonversatism of the ITT or PP analysis depends on various factors as type&#xD;
      of protocol deviation and missingness, and the method of handling missing data in ITT&#xD;
      population (see Sanchez MM, Chen X. Choosing the analysis population in non-inferiority&#xD;
      studies: per protocol or intent-to-treat. Stat Med. 25, 1169-81;2006). Due to our setting&#xD;
      (randomization immediately before intervention, allowance for cross-over from internal to&#xD;
      external CV, intervention in hospital setting) we do not expect a relevant amount of protocol&#xD;
      violations. As the follow-up period of 2 weeks is short, we expect &lt;1% losses to follow-up.&#xD;
      So we assume only minor discrepancies between ITT and PP population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not expect any missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint, as it is measured&#xD;
      immediately after CV. The primary safety endpoint is measured within two weeks after CV, and&#xD;
      we do not expect non-trivial missingness such as dropout due to lack of efficacy. As the&#xD;
      expected number of events for the primary safety endpoint is low, especially for internal CV&#xD;
      patients, any method of handling of missing data in ITT analysis may cause relevant bias.&#xD;
      Thus, the per-protocol set is considered the primary analysis population; the ITT analysis is&#xD;
      treated secondary/supportive and should lead to similar conclusions. Patients without any&#xD;
      valid data on the primary target variables will be excluded from the FAS (modified ITT), in&#xD;
      case of missing data on safety endpoint the valid value will be used. In a sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis a conservative scenario will be performed treating missing values as event in&#xD;
      external CV group and as no event in internal CV group. Any relevant discrepancies in&#xD;
      drop-out rates between CV groups will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data and data analysis In case of cross-over from internal to external CV the primary&#xD;
      endpoints will be assessed after internal shock. Patient's death during intervention or&#xD;
      within the follow-up period is unlikely and not to be expected. In the case of patient death&#xD;
      during intervention, after the shock, the primary efficacy endpoint will be treated as&#xD;
      failure. In the case of a patient death during intervention, after the shock or during follow&#xD;
      up, the primary safety value will be counted as failure/severe device or lead impairment.&#xD;
      This may be revised after the cause of death was proven not to be lead or device associated&#xD;
      by interrogation and analysis by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification by study center is not feasible due to the low number of expected events, and&#xD;
      subgroup analyses by study center will be done for descriptive reasons only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration and study size This study is a multicenter trial. Additional local ethics&#xD;
      application is required at each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary safety endpoint &quot;severe lead and device impairment&quot; we expect an incidence of&#xD;
      10% in the external CV group and of 5% in the internal CV group. Thus, for one-sided alpha&#xD;
      5%, non-inferiority margin of 15%, and power 80%, a sample size of 103 patients per arm, i.e.&#xD;
      206 in total, is required. To account for loss to follow-up (&lt;1% within 2 weeks after CV) and&#xD;
      heterogeneity between centers, 230 patients (≈206/(1-0.05)^2) (see Donner, A. Approaches to&#xD;
      sample size estimation in the design of clinical trials--a review. Stat Med 3, 199-214;1984)&#xD;
      will be randomized. A non-inferiority margin of 15% is large, however, we chose several&#xD;
      endpoints acting as sensitive surrogates of possible or temporary lead affectation, rather&#xD;
      than relying solely on hard endpoints such as permanent lead or device failure with necessity&#xD;
      of surgical revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As no data on placebo-controlled trials exists in the setting of ICD trials to determine the&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin on statistical grounds, the margin was chosen on clinically as well as&#xD;
      practicality grounds. A relevantly smaller alpha or tighter margin would lead to an&#xD;
      unachievable sample size and render the trial unfeasible (see D'Agostino, R. B., Massaro, J.&#xD;
      M. &amp; Sullivan, L. M. Non-inferiority trials: design concepts and issues - the encounters of&#xD;
      academic consultants in statistics. Stat Med 22, 169-186;2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, to detect an absolute risk reduction of 20% in the primary efficacy endpoint&#xD;
      &quot;restoration of normal sinus rhythm&quot;, assuming an incidence of 90% in the external CV group&#xD;
      and 70% in the internal CV group, a sample size of 72 patients per arm, i.e. 144 in total, is&#xD;
      required (two-sided alpha 5%, power 80%, continuity corrected chi-squared test). Sample size&#xD;
      determination was performed with ADDPLAN™ 6.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of trial subject groups At baseline (i.e. before CV) treatment groups will be&#xD;
      described and compared using mean, standard deviation and percentiles (0, 25, 50, 75, 100)&#xD;
      for continuous variables, count and percentage for categorical variables. Variables to be&#xD;
      summarized include among other sex, age, BMI, comorbidities, type of device, site of&#xD;
      implantation, LV ejection fraction, type of anticoagulation, duration of arrhythmia, left&#xD;
      atrial diameter, pacing threshold, lead impedance, shock impedance, ventricular and&#xD;
      biventricular pacing percentage, battery voltage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary safety endpoint The primary hypothesis &quot;non-inferiority of external CV to internal&#xD;
      CV&quot; regarding the primary safety endpoint &quot;severe lead and device impairment&quot; will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the confidence interval (CI) approach. A one-sided 95% CI for the difference&#xD;
      &quot;observed proportion in external group - observed proportion in internal group&quot; will be&#xD;
      calculated by Newcombe's method 10 and non-inferiority is declared to be shown at one-sided&#xD;
      level 5% if its upper bound lies below the non-inferiority bound of 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint If non-inferiority regarding the primary safety endpoint &quot;severe&#xD;
      lead and device impairment&quot; could be demonstrated, the hypothesis &quot;superiority of external CV&#xD;
      to internal CV&quot; regarding the primary efficacy endpoint &quot;restoration of normal sinus rhythm&quot;&#xD;
      will be tested in a confirmatory way at two-sided level 5%. Due to the fixed sequence of&#xD;
      these two hypotheses, the type I error is not inflated. The proportion of the primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint will be compared between treatment groups by Fisher's exact test with&#xD;
      two-sided 95% CI calculated by Newcombe's method 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints The components of the primary safety endpoint (i.e. a rise in threshold&#xD;
      (at constant duration) of &gt;0.5V, exit block, loss of programming, rise in shock impedance by&#xD;
      50%, rise in charge time by 50%, drop in battery voltage of ≥0.2V within 2 weeks) will be&#xD;
      analyzed along the same line as the composite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, recurrence of atrial arrhythmia at FU, lead impedance and sensing changes,&#xD;
      inadvertent induction of VF during CV, high-sensitive Troponin T level 3h after CV will be&#xD;
      summarized by treatment group and compared by statistical hypothesis tests as applicable;&#xD;
      confidence intervals for treatment differences/effect sizes will be calculated to aid&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subanalysis of predefined subgroups will be performed for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRT-D patients to assess safety of external CV in pts with LV leads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRT-D patients with quadripolar leads (including thresholds for all 16 pacing vectors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRT-D patients with AV-VV optimization algorithms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and suspension/termination criteria Based on published data and own previous work 10&#xD;
      an interim safety analysis will be performed after 50% of target sample size, i.e. 115 pts,&#xD;
      have been included. A statistically significant difference in the primary safety endpoint&#xD;
      between the groups at interim analysis will lead to a subsequent early termination of the&#xD;
      trial (using Fisher's exact test, two-sided level 5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific termination criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant difference in primary safety endpoint at interim analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction of VF in internal CV group n &gt; 3&#xD;
