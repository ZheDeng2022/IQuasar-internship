  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is currently treated with chemotherapy by combining several&#xD;
      drugs with different ways of inhibiting the cell growth. In this trial, standard&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics that have proven their effectiveness for years, Ara-C and Idarubicin, will&#xD;
      be combined with a new drug called Selinexor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selinexor inhibits the growth of cancer cells by keeping certain proteins in the nucleus&#xD;
      which control the cell growth.&#xD;
