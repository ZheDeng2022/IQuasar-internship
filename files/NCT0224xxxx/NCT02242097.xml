  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see whether or not a drug called ibrutinib can be given to&#xD;
      patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) as maintenance therapy after induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
      This drug blocks an enzyme that affects how the lymphocytes grow and survive. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to learn how safe and effective ibrutinib is for treating patients with&#xD;
      MCL after responding to induction chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate after 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess toxicity. II. Determine rates of conversion from partial response (PR) to complete&#xD;
      response (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine median overall survival (OS) after 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare minimal residual disease (MRD) results overtime by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
      and correlate these with PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 4 years in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      patient preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients who completed 4 years of treatment are followed&#xD;
      up at 30 days. Patients who did not complete 4 years of treatment are followed up for up to 4&#xD;
      years post-first dose of treatment (every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 4&#xD;
      years).&#xD;
