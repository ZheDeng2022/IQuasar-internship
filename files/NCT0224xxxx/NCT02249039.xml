  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill infants and children who are mechanically ventilated are often given large&#xD;
      doses of opiates and benzodiazepines to provide analgesia-sedation. These drugs significantly&#xD;
      cause tolerance and dependence, depresses the drive to breathe, and thus prolongs the need&#xD;
      for mechanical ventilation and the associated complications. We propose IV CLON could be used&#xD;
      as effectively as DEX.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All critically ill mechanically ventilated infants and children receive intravenous&#xD;
      analgesic-sedatives which often include opiates and benzodiazepines (BENZO). Undesirable side&#xD;
      effects from these drugs include respiratory depression, tolerance and dependence. Alpha&#xD;
      2-adrenergic receptor agonists, dexmedetomidine (DEX) and clonidine (CLON) have excellent&#xD;
      sedative-analgesics effects, do not cause respiratory depression and are opiate/BENZO&#xD;
      sparing. While both are efficacious in providing sedation, several factors have led to a&#xD;
      substantial increase in the use of the newer drug DEX over the more established drug CLON in&#xD;
      adults, children and infants. However, studies to guide therapy and dosing for infants and&#xD;
      children are lacking. While these infants and children do require less opiate/BENZO therapy&#xD;
      and fewer days on mechanical ventilation, they quickly develop tolerance to and have&#xD;
      significant withdrawal from DEX. This necessitates protracted weaning of DEX and longer&#xD;
      length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) since DEX can only be administered&#xD;
      as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion. CLON, on the other hand, has a longer half-life&#xD;
      and has formulations that allow for continuous or intermittent IV and oral administration.&#xD;
      Dr. Gauda has an approved IND to use the epidural formulation of CLON intravenously in&#xD;
      infants and children. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the effective IV dosing&#xD;
      scheme of CLON that can be safely used as an adjunct to analgesic-sedation management for&#xD;
      infants and children in the PICU. It will include a total of 24 infants and children with 4&#xD;
      CLON and DEX exposed in each age stratum: 0-3, 4-6, and 7-12 months. We hypothesize that IV&#xD;
      CLON can achieve optimal sedation and reduce the need for opiate/BENZO therapy in critically&#xD;
      ill infants and children who would otherwise receive DEX, and thus, reduce the length of stay&#xD;
      in the PICU. Data from this study will be used to inform a larger randomized trial and will&#xD;
      directly benefit infants and children in Baltimore who are critically ill. Funds are&#xD;
      requested to cover the cost of the CLON drug levels and the investigational pharmacy.&#xD;
