      INTRODUCTION Exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of iron deficiency. American Academy&#xD;
      of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends iron supplementation in exclusively breastfed infants&#xD;
      beginning at 4 months of age. Uncertainty exists regarding the effects of iron&#xD;
      supplementation during infancy on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the absence of anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To establish whether psychomotor and mental development is influenced by early iron&#xD;
      supplementation in healthy, non-anemic, exclusively or predominantly breastfed infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Healthy term newborns will be recruited shortly after birth. If predominantly&#xD;
      breastfed (&gt;50% daily feedings) and non-anemic at 4 months, they will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either an iron supplement (approx.1mg/kg/day) or placebo until 9 months of age.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed with use of Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development&#xD;
      (Bayley III) at 12, 24 and 36 months of age.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Iron is a nutrient of essential importance to the human organism. It takes part&#xD;
      in energy production, oxygen transportation, and DNA synthesis and is indispensable for the&#xD;
      development of the central nervous system. Iron is required for the myelination and&#xD;
      production of neurotransmitters. It has been well documented that iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      (IDA) impairs child development. If the diagnosis of IDA is delayed, the deficits may be&#xD;
      irreversible. Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common single nutrient deficiency and may&#xD;
      affect 12% of children &lt; 3 years of age in industrialized countries. ID has the potential to&#xD;
      negatively influence psychomotor development. However, a causal relationship is not as clear&#xD;
      as for IDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have suggested that iron supplementation in healthy infants may enhance&#xD;
      psychomotor development. A meta-analysis carried out by our group (Szajewska et al. ) aimed&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of iron supplementation in non-anemic pregnant women and in&#xD;
      non-anemic healthy children aged &lt;3 years on the mental performance and psychomotor&#xD;
      development of children. The authors identified 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 5 of&#xD;
      which referred to supplementation during infancy. The polled results of 3 RCTs (n = 561)&#xD;
      showed significant improvement on the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) of the Bayley&#xD;
      Scales of Infant Development at approximately 12 months of age in the iron-supplemented group&#xD;
      compared with the control group (mean difference: 4.21; 95% CI 2.31 to 6.12). No significant&#xD;
      effect of iron supplementation on the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) or behavior was found.&#xD;
      Since the meta-analysis was performed, one relevant new study has been published. In this&#xD;
      follow-up study, cognitive and school performance was measured at the age of 9 years. In the&#xD;
      original study, infants were randomized to receive daily supplementation of iron, zinc, iron&#xD;
      and zinc or placebo from 4 to 6 months of age and an assessment of iron and zinc status, as&#xD;
      well as growth, was performed. No statistically significant difference in cognitive&#xD;
      performance or school performance was reported between the four groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that ID is a common problem in small children, measures to prevent ID are being taken.&#xD;
      According to Committee of Nutrition of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology,&#xD;
      Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN CoN), this should be achieved by the promotion of exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding, the use of iron-fortified formulas when formula feeding is needed, the&#xD;
      postponement of the introduction of whole cow milk as the main drink until the end of the&#xD;
      first year of life, and the promotion of consumption of complementary foods rich in iron.&#xD;
      More recently, the ESPGHAN CoN concluded that there is no convincing evidence that iron&#xD;
      supplements should be provided to normal birth weight, exclusively breastfed infants during&#xD;
      the first 6 months of life in populations with a low prevalence of IDA among 6-month-olds. In&#xD;
      contrast, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends iron supplementation (1 mg/kg)&#xD;
      in exclusively breastfed infants beginning at 4 months of age that should be continued until&#xD;
      iron from complementary foods is available. Since in partially breastfed infants iron intake&#xD;
      is uncertain, those who receive more than one half of their daily feedings as human milk,&#xD;
      should also be supplemented with 1mg/kg iron beginning at 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional studies of good methodological quality evaluating the role of iron&#xD;
      supplementation of infants without anemia on their mental and psychomotor development are&#xD;
      still needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants Healthy singleton newborns born at term in a university hospital (St. Anna&#xD;
           Mazowiecka Hospital, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The Medical University of&#xD;
           Warsaw, Poland) will be considered for inclusion. Their mothers will be approached&#xD;
           shortly after birth and informed consent will be obtained. Parents will be contacted&#xD;
           after approximately 3 months in order to establish weather an infant is being&#xD;
           exclusively breastfed. If so, the infant will be randomised to receive either an iron&#xD;
           supplement or a placebo from the age of 4 completed months until 9 months of age.&#xD;
           Infants will also be recruited in well-baby clinics. Apart from recruitment, all study&#xD;
           procedures will be pursued in The Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of&#xD;
           Warsaw, Poland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size Sample size was calculated with the main outcome of fine and gross motor&#xD;
           scales, cognitive and language development of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler&#xD;
           Development (Bayley III). In the previous editions of the test, these elements of the&#xD;
           assessment were combined into Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) and Mental&#xD;
           Developmental Index (MDI). To detect a difference of 5 points between the study groups&#xD;
           with a power of 80% and Î± =0.05, a sample of 91 infants is needed in each study group.&#xD;
           To account for 20% of loss to follow up, we aim to recruit 220 infants for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventions Infant in the experimental group will receive ferric pyrophosphate (7mg,&#xD;
           10mg or 15 mg depending on body weight daily, i.e. approx.1 mg/kg/day) or placebo from 4&#xD;
           months to 9 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allocation concealment and blinding A computer-generated randomisation list will be&#xD;
           prepared. Blocks of ten will be applied. Randomisation will be stratified by infant's&#xD;
           gender. Consecutive randomisation numbers (each number assigned to intervention or&#xD;
           placebo in a blinded way) will be given to participants at enrollment. The study&#xD;
           products will be delivered to the centre in boxes labelled with the letters A and B&#xD;
           (meaning of A and B blinded, information deposited in a sealed envelope in a safe at the&#xD;
           administrative part of the department). The boxes will also carry the information on the&#xD;
           specific dose (7, 10 or 15mg). Subsequently, the letters A and B will be removed from&#xD;
           the boxes by an independent person unrelated to the study planning and conduct, and&#xD;
           replaced with numeric codes corresponding to the randomisation numbers, e.g. 001 - 7mg,&#xD;
           001 - 10mg, 001 - 15mg, 002 - 7mg, 002 - 10mg, 002 - 15mg etc. Sachets containing the&#xD;
           study product will be packed in small packages of 30 pieces each. Neither the collective&#xD;
           packages, nor the sachets will carry any labelling and all the unused sachets will&#xD;
           always be returned by parents before switching to higher dose. The active product and&#xD;
           placebo will be packed in identical sachets and the content will look and taste the&#xD;
           same. Researchers, caregivers, outcome assessors, and a person responsible for the&#xD;
           statistical analysis will be blinded to the intervention until a statistical report for&#xD;
           the 12-months' developmental assessment is available. After that, both the caregivers&#xD;
           and main outcome assessor will remain blinded until the completion of the study. The&#xD;
           information on intervention assignment will be stored in a sealed envelope in a safe in&#xD;
           the administrative part of the department.&#xD;
