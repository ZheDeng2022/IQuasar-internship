  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer detection and disease progression monitoring relies on systematic multi-core&#xD;
      biopsies. Minimal invasive imaging capacities for lesion targeting and monitoring are badly&#xD;
      needed. The purpose of this study is to determine if a new MRI technique can identify and&#xD;
      monitor prostate disease progression. If so biopsy core number can be reduced to as small as&#xD;
      one, and frequency for biopsy repeat can be reduced. The new technique is about a new way of&#xD;
      analyzing the pictures taken as part of prostate MRI exam. This part is called dynamic&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced MRI. It involves an injection of contrast reagent (or dye) through the arm&#xD;
      vein during a time period when prostate MRI pictures are continuously taken.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to perform contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at&#xD;
      OHSU on subjects with diagnosed prostate cancer. This pilot project will study 20 subjects&#xD;
      prior to their next scheduled clinical procedures (biopsy or radical prostatectomy). Data&#xD;
      from this project will be used to explore new capabilities of the software platform developed&#xD;
      under current SBIR funding. CE-MRI will involve the use of an extracellular (Gadolinium&#xD;
      based, Gd) contrast agent. When Gd is used, (dynamic-contrast-enhanced) DCE-MRI signal&#xD;
      intensity time-course data will be analyzed analytically using the so called &quot;shutter-speed&quot;&#xD;
      paradigm which takes into account of the effects of finite water exchange kinetics. Region of&#xD;
      interest (ROI) and high resolution (~millimeter) parametric maps of pathophysiologic&#xD;
      quantities, such as tumor vessel permeability, tumor perfusion, extracellular extravascular&#xD;
      volume fraction, will be generated from the DCE-MRI data. All parameters will be compared to&#xD;
      literature results for software validation and correlated with pathology for clinical&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;

        A total of 20 subjects will be studied under this protocol. Subjects will be selected from&#xD;
        patients scheduled for prostate biopsies with known prostate lesions. Subjects will also be&#xD;
        recruited from prostate cancer patients who choose radical prostatectomy as disease&#xD;
        management plan. The research project will be introduced to a potential subject by a&#xD;
        urologist at OHSU. If interested, the subject will then be contacted through phone to&#xD;
        participate in the study by an investigator or a research assistant on the research team.&#xD;
