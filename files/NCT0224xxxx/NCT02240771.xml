  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In India, majority of our patients have advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at&#xD;
      presentation and hence are unsuitable for the available curative treatment options. In such&#xD;
      patients the treatment options are mainly palliative. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE),&#xD;
      transarterial chemotherapy (TAC) and various forms of oral chemotherapy are the only&#xD;
      available options currently. Many patients have more advanced disease with the involvement of&#xD;
      branches of portal vein. This further limits the therapeutic options. According to Barcelona&#xD;
      Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging, involvement of portal vein precludes any standard form of&#xD;
      therapy. TAC and oral chemotherapy has been tried in this group of patients by few&#xD;
      researchers. Which treatment (TAC or oral chemotherapy) would be better suitable for advanced&#xD;
      stage (BCLC C) needs to be explored. However, there are no randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCT's) available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAC is the procedure for treating patients of HCC with portal vein invasion where only the&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic drugs are injected into the feeding vessels of the tumor with no subsequent&#xD;
      embolization of the feeding vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to select a modality which would produce better outcomes in advanced HCC patients&#xD;
      (BCLC C), this study was planned.&#xD;

      1. Aim of the study: To see the efficacy of transarterial chemotherapy in prolonging the&#xD;
      survival of patients with unresectable HCC when compared to oral chemotherapy 2. Diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Cirrhosis of liver- Diagnosis will be founded on the basis of clinical, biochemical,&#xD;
      imaging and endoscopy findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Hepatocellular carcinoma- when any one of the following is present&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two imaging modalities (dual phase CT (DPCT)/ contrast enhanced MRI) showing&#xD;
           arterialization of the hepatic mass&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Alpha feto protein (AFP) more than 400ng/ml along with arterialization on one imaging&#xD;
           modality (DPCT/ contrast enhanced MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Unresectable HCC- • Liver mass larger than 5cm in diameter (single/ multiple) ,&#xD;
      involving main portal vein with underlying cirrhotic liver&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Tumor response This will be based on Dual phase CT findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete response (CR)- Tumor fully covered with lipiodol showing no viable tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partial response (PR)- Tumor partially covered (&gt;75%) by lipiodol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild response (MR)- About 50 to 75% coverage of the tumor by lipiodol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No response (NR) - About 25 to 50% coverage of the tumor by lipiodol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fresh lesions (FL)- Appearance of new mass lesions in the liver with or without&#xD;
           recurrence at the site of previous mass&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Patient tolerance Grade 1: no side effects Grade 2: moderate side effects Grade 3: severe&#xD;
      side effects Grade 4: life threatening side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Performance status (PST score) PST score of 0-5 would be assessed on the following basis&#xD;
      0- No cancer related symptoms. Normal life style&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Minor symptoms related to cancer. Capable of non-strenuous activity. Fully ambulatory&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities.&#xD;
           Confined to bed less than 50% of waking hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Capable of only limited self-care. Confined to bed more than 50% of waking hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Sample Size Systematic review of RCT's for TAC show a 2-year survival of 40 %. Expecting&#xD;
      that oral chemotherapy has a 2-year survival of 40% with 5% non-inferiority margin with 80%&#xD;
      power and 5% error, a sample size of 124 patients in each arm would be required.(Total 248&#xD;
      patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients will be randomized after the confirmation of diagnosis and obtaining written&#xD;
      consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequences will be generated by the Statistician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratified randomization will be done. Two strata of child's A and B will be made&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization will be done by drawing consecutively numbered opaque sealed envelopes&#xD;
           Randomization into A (TAC) and B (oral chemotherapy) will be done&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Follow up post TAC&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Clinical follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients would be followed up in the Liver clinic monthly unless their clinical&#xD;
           condition warrants earlier follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver function tests/ complete blood count would also be done at each visit and AFP (if&#xD;
           elevated earlier) every six months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient tolerance, child's status would be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Imaging follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At one month, a dual phase CT would be done to ascertain the response to therapy and the&#xD;
           need to repeat the procedure. Subsequently, the DPCT would be done at 3 and 6 monthly&#xD;
           intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Repeat TAC on follow up This would be done if any of the following is noted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DPCT shows viable tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fresh lesions appear&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elevated serum AFP occurs with or without appearance of viable mass on DPCT&#xD;
