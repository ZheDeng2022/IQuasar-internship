  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to establish non-inferiority of lung function&#xD;
      response to tiotropium 10 μg, formulated as inhalation powder in the polyethylene hard&#xD;
      capsule and delivered via the HandiHaler® 2, compared to tiotropium 18 μg, formulated as&#xD;
      inhalation powder in the hard gelatine capsule and delivered via the HandiHaler® (Spiriva®)&#xD;
      following single dose inhalation in patients with COPD. A hard polyethylene (PE) capsule with&#xD;
      half the strength (tiotropium 5 μg) was included to investigate a dose ordering effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium inhalation&#xD;
      powder hard PE capsule (delivered via HandiHaler® 2) and tiotropium inhalation powder hard&#xD;
      gelatine capsule (delivered via HandiHaler®) and to compare the safety of the two&#xD;
      pharmaceutical formulations.&#xD;
