      The present study will evaluate whether treatment with daily remote ischemic conditioning for&#xD;
      a 28±4-day period induces beneficial effects in subjects with and without chronic ischemic&#xD;
      heart failure in terms of improved left ventricular contractile function and exercise&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;

      Background Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      throughout the world, and the incidence and prevalence are increasing as more patients&#xD;
      survive their acute coronary syndrome. The disease is caused by abnormalities in cardiac&#xD;
      structure or function leading to insufficient delivery of oxygen to the metabolizing tissues.&#xD;
      These patients are often debilitated, require chronic medications, and many receive expensive&#xD;
      device therapy to manage symptoms. Consequently, this has led to an increasing economic and&#xD;
      health burden from heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHF is the end-stage of a broad range of underlying cardiovascular diseases, but is most&#xD;
      frequently caused by ischemic heart disease. Other contributory causes include hypertension,&#xD;
      heart valve diseases, arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies, all resulting in myocardial tissue&#xD;
      damage and loss of ventricular function. Activation of neurohormonal and inflammatory&#xD;
      compensatory mechanisms lead to a vicious circle through adaptive metabolic and remodeling&#xD;
      processes, eventually resulting in a progressive decline of cardiac function with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of the specific underlying cardiac condition is crucial for the therapeutic&#xD;
      approach in patients suffering from CHF. While pharmacological treatment remains dominating,&#xD;
      resynchronization therapy and surgical resection of non-contractile tissue are also&#xD;
      increasingly being conducted. Despite the fact that activation of the inflammatory system&#xD;
      greatly contributes to the remodeling process through initiation of myocardial fibrosis and&#xD;
      hypertrophy, most clinical studies targeting inflammatory components have been discouraging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) by brief non-lethal episodes of ischemia in a remote organ&#xD;
      or tissue (e.g. a limb) is a novel therapeutic method to achieve protection against&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion injury in the target organ, e.g. the heart . In the clinical setting,&#xD;
      RIC is most often performed by repeated episodes of limb ischemia achieved by intermittent&#xD;
      inflation of a blood pressure cuff placed around the upper arm. In clinical randomized&#xD;
      trials, RIC has been shown to reduce the amount of myocardial injury and improve long-term&#xD;
      outcome in patients admitted with STEMI for primary percutaneous coronary intervention and&#xD;
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery or elective coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIC is a low-cost, simple and safe procedure that can easily be conducted using a standard&#xD;
      blood pressure cuff, and the method is increasingly used in clinical trials. The mechanisms&#xD;
      behind RIC are not yet fully understood, but the cardioprotective effects are believed to be&#xD;
      caused by neural and humoral signaling cascades as well as systemic anti-inflammatory effects&#xD;
      resulting in a cytoprotective state. In addition, RIC has been shown to reduce thrombus&#xD;
      formation. Since activation of platelets and the coagulation system are fundamental in&#xD;
      thrombus formation and degradation, another possible mechanism of the described effects of&#xD;
      RIC could be a result from effect on arterial thrombus formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of experimental and clinical studies have utilized RIC as single-occasion&#xD;
      treatment (i.e. 3 or 4 bouts of short limb ischemia conducted once). However, experimental&#xD;
      studies have recently suggested that repeated RIC treatment may infer further beneficial&#xD;
      effects. Repeated RIC application has been shown to improve endothelial function and modify&#xD;
      leukocyte adhesion in healthy volunteers. In a rat model of myocardial infarction, RIC&#xD;
      repeated daily for 28 days after infarction reduced adverse ventricular remodeling and&#xD;
      improved survival. Consequently, two on-going clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov: DREAM&#xD;
      study NCT01664611 and CRIC-RCT study NCT01817114) are investigating the effect of repeated&#xD;
      RIC on LVEF function in patients with reduced ventricular function after an acute coronary&#xD;
      event. Another study investigates the effect of repeated RIC on patients with severe heart&#xD;
      failure and left ventricular assist device (IMPULSE study NCT02044471).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, the effect of RIC on patients suffering from stable chronic ischemic heart failure is&#xD;
      unknown. Furthermore, no registered studies have evaluated the effect of long-term RIC given&#xD;
      as additive treatment to the standard medical therapy in patients with chronic ischemic heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      • We hypothesize, that the combination of anti-remodelling and anti-inflammatory properties&#xD;
      together with improved endothelial function induced by repetitive RIC treatment translate&#xD;
      into improved left ventricular function and better physical performance in subjects with CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether RIC applied on a daily basis for 4 weeks improves left ventricular&#xD;
           function as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in subjects with CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether RIC applied on a daily basis for 4 weeks improves muscle&#xD;
           strength, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and thrombocyte function, and changes blood&#xD;
           biomarker levels of inflammation and heart failure in subjects with CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether the above-mentioned measurements differ between patients with CHF&#xD;
           and matched subjects after RIC applied on a daily basis for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives The present study will elucidate whether long-term RIC treatment induces&#xD;
      beneficial effects in subjects with and without chronic ischemic heart failure in terms of&#xD;
      improved left ventricular contractile function and exercise capacity, and whether long-term&#xD;
      RIC treatment induces systemic anti-inflammatory effects in these subjects. Moreover, we find&#xD;
      that the study can uncover some of the mechanisms behind RIC and thus potentially optimize&#xD;
      future treatment for patients suffering, or at risk, from ischemic heart diseases.&#xD;
