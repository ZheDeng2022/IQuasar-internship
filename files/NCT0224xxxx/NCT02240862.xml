      The objective of C2R is to promote the rapid initiation and completion of enrollment in the&#xD;
      CREST-2 randomized clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT02089217). Patients with severe&#xD;
      symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease will be treated with carotid&#xD;
      artery stenting (CAS) performed by experienced and skilled interventionists.&#xD;
      Interventionists' eligibility will be determined by a multi-specialty Interventional&#xD;
      Management Committee (IMC). Patient eligibility will include patients with standard or&#xD;
      high-risk, symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid artery disease. Patients will be followed for&#xD;
      the occurrence of post-procedural complications. The primary safety and quality endpoint will&#xD;
      be the occurrence of any stroke or death within the 30-day period following the stenting&#xD;
      procedure. The safety and quality results from C2R will guide selection of interventionists&#xD;
      for participation in the CREST-2 randomized clinical trial. Enrollment into C2R will begin in&#xD;
      2015 and continue until publication of the primary results of the randomized trial.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Promote the rapid initiation and completion of enrollment in CREST-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CAS will be performed by experienced operators&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical outcomes will be closely monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prevent inappropriate use of CAS outside of the registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will leverage the existing data-collection infrastructure of the Society for&#xD;
      Vascular Surgery's (SVS) Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) and the American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology's (ACC) National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR). Both organizations have&#xD;
      agreed to participate in this effort. The specific logistics of data-collection and transfer&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The interventionist must pick a registry, SVS VQI or ACC NCDR to enter data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The interventionist instructs their registry to transfer de-identified information about&#xD;
           their cases to C2R.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cases are reviewed by the C2R Management Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reports of the cases, including whether or not they are CREST-2 eligible, will be&#xD;
           maintained. These reports will allow close monitoring of C2R interventionists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C2R Management Committee, and other parties (NINDS, CMS) will be informed of the&#xD;
           progress periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will collect information on key co-morbidities and limit the outcome measures to&#xD;
      essential, easily used standardized measures that are commonly part of carotid trials,&#xD;
      including the NIH Stroke Scale and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The 30-day visit will be&#xD;
      conducted face-to-face with a history, examination and testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEMOGRAPHICS AND MEDICAL HISTORY: Gender, symptomatic status, carotid artery to be&#xD;
           treated, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and&#xD;
           renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MONITORING ENROLLMENT: The Registry will also collect information on features that&#xD;
           represent inclusion/exclusion criteria for the CREST-2 randomized trial. The purpose is&#xD;
           to facilitate monitoring of the type of patients being enrolled in C2R, and ensuring&#xD;
           that CREST-2-eligible patients are not being enrolled excessively into C2R in preference&#xD;
           to CREST-2. Data- collection, transfer and review will occur rapidly enough that sites&#xD;
           not complying with enrollment limitations will be identified rapidly and appropriate&#xD;
           action taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROCEDURAL DETAILS: The C2R focuses on procedural details that will facilitate an&#xD;
           assessment for credentialing interventionists into the CREST-2 trial. The interventional&#xD;
           management committee will review this data to make decisions regarding whether or not to&#xD;
           approve a particular operator for randomizing patients into the trial. Some of the&#xD;
           factors to be considered will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total number of cases performed per year, total number of cases performed in career&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selection of devices, case selection, stroke rate, hemorrhagic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Techniques for access, sheath placement, wire access, embolic protection, angioplasty,&#xD;
           stent deployment, use of post-stent angioplasty, selection of closure devices, use of&#xD;
           medications (antiplatelets, anticoagulation, atropine, nitroglycerine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PATIENT ASSESSMENT AND OUTCOMES: NIH Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Score, access site&#xD;
           hemorrhage, recurrent hospitalization or need for second carotid procedure, new onset of&#xD;
           renal failure, stroke, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility to participate in the C2R&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any center currently certified by CMS to provide CAS will be eligible to apply for&#xD;
           participation in the C2R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operators&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual operators must have done at least 50 total procedures to be eligible for the&#xD;
           registry. If they have done less than 50 procedures, then they must have done at least 8&#xD;
           procedures over the last 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual operators must have been reviewed and approved by the interventional&#xD;
           management committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The final decision regarding eligibility will also depend on an assessment of technique,&#xD;
           outcomes and anticipated carotid disease volume at a particular site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures to ensure enrollment into the randomized trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The maximal enrollment number for C2R for a given site prior to randomization into&#xD;
           CREST-2 will be a total of 75 cases or 30 CREST-2 eligible patients, whichever comes&#xD;
           first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operators that have been credentialed by the IMC to enroll patients in CREST-2 must&#xD;
           begin to enroll eligible patients in the trial, while other operators at the same site&#xD;
           continue to work toward credentialed status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sites that have reached the maximum thresholds above and are not initiated as CREST-2&#xD;
           sites will have registry status denied at the discretion of the C2R Management committee&#xD;
           depending on bona fide, good faith efforts to meet CREST-2 site initiation requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The C2R will track whether or not each patient enrolled in the registry was CREST-2&#xD;
           eligible. Once any operator at a site has been approved to enroll patients in CREST-2,&#xD;
           the site will be expected to offer enrollment into CREST- 2 to every CREST-2 eligible&#xD;
           patient. It is anticipated that not all such CREST-2 eligible patients will consent to&#xD;
           randomization into CREST-2; such patients, can be enrolled into the registry. However,&#xD;
           only 1 CREST-2-eligible patient can be enrolled into C2R for each patient enrolled into&#xD;
           CREST-2, i.e. in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sites that do not maintain the 1:1 ratio of patients enrolled in CREST-2 to&#xD;
           trial-eligible patients enrolled in C2R will be notified by the C2R Management Committee&#xD;
           that they are on a probationary status to remedy the situation. If not remedied, they&#xD;
           will be notified that their C2R status is being revoked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sites that are not enrolling into CREST-2 at a reasonable rate (to be determined by the&#xD;
           C2R Management Committee and the CREST-2 Executive Committee) will have their&#xD;
           eligibility to enroll in the C2R suspended until they are adequately enrolling in the&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the CAS arm of CREST-2 is fully enrolled, continued enrollment of eligible patients&#xD;
           (see inclusion/exclusion criteria above) in the C2R will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The DSMB will review CREST-2 trial results at the end of enrollment of the CREST-2 trial&#xD;
           to decide at that time if it is ethical to continue C2R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry Oversight / Governance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The C2R will be operated under a multi-specialty Steering Committee. The Steering Committee&#xD;
      will include members from relevant disciplines. Representatives from the CREST-2, NINDS, and&#xD;
      CMS will be members of the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee shall provide strategic&#xD;
      direction to C2R, monitor all activities, and have ultimate authority and responsibility for&#xD;
      the scientific integrity and appropriate use of the C2R data for research and publications.&#xD;
      Operational responsibilities of the Steering Committee will include oversight of the CAS&#xD;
      operator/facility credentialing process as well as developing and improving other key aspects&#xD;
      of registry functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Steering Committee will also have the discretion to modify elements of this protocol if&#xD;
      such changes are determined to be necessary for the successful implementation of C2R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Management Committee will carry out day-to-day management and regulatory&#xD;
      responsibilities, reporting to the Steering Committee. Membership will include at least one&#xD;
      leader from the surgical, stenting, and neurological communities. The registry Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (PI) will be Brajesh K. Lal, Co-Principal Investigator of CREST-2.&#xD;
