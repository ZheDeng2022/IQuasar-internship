      The TVT Registryâ„¢ is a benchmarking tool developed to track patient safety and real-world&#xD;
      outcomes related to the transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) procedure. Created by The&#xD;
      Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the TVT&#xD;
      Registry is designed to monitor the safety and efficacy of this new procedure for the&#xD;
      treatment of mitral valve disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TVT Registry was designed to support a national surveillance system to assess the&#xD;
      characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients receiving transcutaneous valve&#xD;
      therapies. Patient-level data are submitted by participating hospitals to The Society of&#xD;
      Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and American College of Cardiology Foundation's (ACCF) joint TVT&#xD;
      Registry. The purposes of the TVT Registry include: (i) collecting pertinent and standardized&#xD;
      data elements from participating hospitals, health care providers and others that measure and&#xD;
      assess the quality of care for patients receiving TVT; (ii) providing confidential periodic&#xD;
      reports to participating hospitals, health care providers and others, to evaluate and improve&#xD;
      the quality of care in these areas; and (iii) permitting and fostering appropriate research&#xD;
      based upon the data collected by means of the TVT Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of the TVT Registry is to serve as a scalable data infrastructure for post&#xD;
      market studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter valve therapies are now emerging into clinical practice from the research phase&#xD;
      in the United States. An Expert Consensus Document on Transcatheter Valve Therapy has&#xD;
      outlined the initial technology, targeted patient population, and the multidisciplinary heart&#xD;
      team and specialized facilities needed. The document also proposes the establishment of a&#xD;
      national registry of patients with valvular heart disease that can collect and analyze data&#xD;
      as these new valve treatment options become available. Surveillance of device performance,&#xD;
      monitoring of long-term outcomes, and performance of comparative effectiveness research are&#xD;
      some of the proposed uses of the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter valve therapies have emerged because of unmet patient needs. Furthermore, TVT&#xD;
      has developed at a time when degenerative heart valve diseases of both the mitral and aortic&#xD;
      valves are increasing in frequency as the population ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these patients there are unique issues such as the prioritization of the health related&#xD;
      quality of life versus the quantity of life, the desire to preserve independence and avoid&#xD;
      becoming a burden to families, and the need to clearly understand what about their current&#xD;
      condition is reversible versus irreversible and linked to other conditions and aging. These&#xD;
      issues become further highlighted when considering the considerable costs and other treatment&#xD;
      burdens of the TVT technologies versus the disabling symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations&#xD;
      caused by untreated severe valvular heart disease.&#xD;
