      The establishment of a number of training programs in therapeutic endoscopy, standardization&#xD;
      of the performance of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopy retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and definition of competence is of paramount importance. The&#xD;
      length of training and minimum number of procedures, requisite theoretical learning and&#xD;
      methodology to define competence in EUS and ERCP are not well defined. The investigators&#xD;
      research has demonstrated that individuals in training acquire skills at different rates and&#xD;
      the number of procedures completed alone is a suboptimal marker for competency in a given&#xD;
      procedure. Hence, emphasis needs to be shifted away from the number of procedures performed&#xD;
      to performance metrics with well-defined and validated thresholds of performance. Multicenter&#xD;
      prospective data are needed to help guide development of competency based medical education&#xD;
      that define learning curves in EUS and ERCP and set evidence-based benchmarks required to&#xD;
      achieve competence using a validated competency assessment tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The central hypothesis is that a validated EUS and ERCP competency assessment&#xD;
      tool will allow for reliable and generalizable standardized learning curves, competency&#xD;
      benchmarks and creation of a centralized national database that compares a trainee's&#xD;
      performance amongst peers.&#xD;

      Competency-based medical education and milestones: Given the increasing emphasis on quality&#xD;
      metrics and competency in health care, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical&#xD;
      Education (ACGME) recently announced plans to replace their current reporting system in 2014&#xD;
      with the Next Accreditation System (NAS). This reporting system focused on: 1) ensuring that&#xD;
      milestones are reached at various points in training, 2) ensuring that competence is achieved&#xD;
      by all trainees, and 3) making certain that these assessments are documented by their&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning curves and competence in EUS: EUS is a vital tool in the diagnosis and staging of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and certain non-gastrointestinal malignancies and diseases. EUS is operator&#xD;
      dependent and training in EUS requires the development of technical and cognitive skills&#xD;
      beyond that required for standard endoscopic procedures. It is intuitive that the quality of&#xD;
      EUS in provision of patient care is directly proportional to the training, skill and&#xD;
      experience of the endosonographer. Unfortunately, the intensity and length of training and&#xD;
      minimum number of procedures required, requisite curriculum and extent of theoretical&#xD;
      learning, and methodology to define competence are not well defined. There are limited data&#xD;
      on learning curves in EUS imaging. Based on expert opinion, the ACGME recommends a minimum of&#xD;
      150 total supervised procedures, 75 of which have a pancreatobiliary indication and 50 cases&#xD;
      of fine needle aspiration (FNA) (25 of which are pancreatic FNA) before competency can be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar guidelines were recently proposed by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG)&#xD;
      and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. However, these guidelines have not&#xD;
      been validated. This does not account for the different rates at which people learn and in&#xD;
      fact, many experts believe that the majority of trainees will require double the number of&#xD;
      proposed procedures to achieve competency in EUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning curves and competence in ERCP: ERCP is an effective modality in the evaluation and&#xD;
      management of pancreatobiliary diseases. This procedure can be technically demanding and&#xD;
      associated with a wide range of adverse events. Technically failed ERCP may result in&#xD;
      complications, need for additional procedures and their associated costs. Similar to EUS,&#xD;
      ERCP is operator dependent and requires acquisition of certain technical and cognitive&#xD;
      skills. There are limited data on learning curves and competence in ERCP, a cannulation rate&#xD;
      of &gt;80% (with some suggesting &gt;90%) has been considered a surrogate for trainee competency.&#xD;
      The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recommends a minimum of 180 total&#xD;
      procedures, the majority of which are therapeutic before competency can be achieved. However,&#xD;
      this threshold is based predominantly on biliary cannulation success rate and does not take&#xD;
      into account procedure complexity and the different rates at which people learn. It is also&#xD;
      important to note that none of the previous studies have evaluated learning curves and&#xD;
      competency in other quality indicators such as successful stone extraction, traversing and&#xD;
      dilating a stricture, stent placement to name a few.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competency assessment tools: Previous competency assessment tools have focused primarily on a&#xD;
      limited number of motor skills involved in EUS and ERCP with no procedure-related cognitive&#xD;
      skill assessment. The investigators have designed a prospective comprehensive competency&#xD;
      assessment tool using validated benchmarks to define competency thresholds. The EUS and ERCP&#xD;
      Skills Assessment Tool (TEESAT) can be used in a continuous fashion throughout the duration&#xD;
      of training to grade technical and cognitive skills in EUS and ERCP in a balanced manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance, Innovation and Impact on Training and Education With the launch of the ACGME's&#xD;
      NAS, advanced endoscopy training programs should utilize competency based medical education&#xD;
      and demonstrate that advanced endoscopy trainees (AETs) have attained the technical and&#xD;
      cognitive skills required for safe and effective unsupervised practice in advanced endoscopy.&#xD;
      Based on the investigators research, the investigators can draw two conclusions: a)&#xD;
      individuals in training in any technical procedure acquire skills at different rates and&#xD;
      emphasis needs to be shifted away from the number of procedures performed to performance&#xD;
      metrics with defined and validated competency thresholds of performance and b) current&#xD;
      guidelines of performing 150 EUS and 180 ERCPs are inadequate to achieve competence in EUS&#xD;
      and ERCP, respectively. With the expanding indications and applications of EUS and ERCP and&#xD;
      establishment of a number of &quot;third tier&quot; training programs in advanced endoscopy,&#xD;
      standardization of the performance of EUS and ERCP and definition of competence and training&#xD;
      among AETs is of paramount importance. The potential impacts of this study's results are&#xD;
      multifold: i) facilitate the ability of training programs to evolve with the new ACGME/NAS&#xD;
      reporting requirements, (ii) help program directors/trainers and trainees identify specific&#xD;
      skill deficiencies in training and allowing for tailored, individualized remediation, (iii)&#xD;
      create a centralized national database that would allow generation of &quot;on-demand&quot; detailed&#xD;
      reports on how individual trainees are progressing compared with their peers across the&#xD;
      nation, (iv) establish reliable and generalizable standardized learning curves (milestones)&#xD;
      and competency benchmarks that national GI societies and training programs can use to develop&#xD;
      credentialing guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH AND RESEARCH STRATEGY Setting and Subject Recruitment: Program directors and AETs at&#xD;
      all advanced endoscopy programs registered with the ASGE will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      this study and will be considered as study participants. AETs will complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      to determine baseline characteristics and prior experience with EUS and ERCP. AETs' prior&#xD;
      experience with EUS and ERCP will not be an exclusion criterion for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competency-assessment tool: TEESAT, a tool designed for competency assessment, will be used&#xD;
      in a continuous fashion throughout the duration of training to grade technical and cognitive&#xD;
      skills in EUS and ERCP. The investigators have demonstrated he feasibility and validity of&#xD;
      this tool in previous studies.3-5 This tool uses a 4-point scoring system: 1-no assistance,&#xD;
      2-achieves with minimal verbal cues, 3-multiple verbal cues or hands on assistance needed,&#xD;
      4-unable to complete. Setting these anchors for specifics skills and behaviors for what is&#xD;
      expected to achieve each score will ensure that the data collected are reproducible from one&#xD;
      evaluator to the next. Technical aspects during EUS exams include grading of individual EUS&#xD;
      stations and technical success in EUS-FNA. Cognitive aspects include identification of lesion&#xD;
      of interest, appropriate classification of malignant tumors (TNM) staging characterization of&#xD;
      subepithelial lesions. Technical aspects during biliary/pancreatic ERCP include endpoints&#xD;
      such as intubation, achieving the short position, identification of the papilla, cannulation&#xD;
      of desired duct, sphincterotomy, stone removal and stent placement. Cognitive aspects will&#xD;
      include clear demonstration of indication of the procedure, appropriate use of fluoroscopy&#xD;
      and logical plan based on cholangiogram/pancreatogram findings. This tool includes&#xD;
      documentation of immediate and post-procedure complications. Grading protocol: All AETs will&#xD;
      be introduced to both the cognitive and technical aspects of EUS and ERCP procedures at the&#xD;
      onset of training. Although TEESAT is self-explanatory, the program directors at each center&#xD;
      will ensure that the AETs and trainers are familiar with TEESAT's specific assessment&#xD;
      parameters and score explanations. After completion of 25 hands-on EUS and ERCP exams, AETs&#xD;
      will be graded on every ERCP and 3rd EUS exam by attending endoscopists (trainers) at each&#xD;
      center. This frequency of grading was chosen based on the investigators pilot data. Grading&#xD;
      of every 3rd EUS exam as opposed to every exam was chosen given the fairly homogenous&#xD;
      population undergoing EUS compared to ERCP. Procedures that the AETs have no hands-on&#xD;
      participation will be excluded for grading. If the exam eligible for grading is an incomplete&#xD;
      procedure for reasons such as medical instability, this exam will not be used for grading.&#xD;
      Trainers will complete the assessment immediately after the procedure.&#xD;
