  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, ultrasound imaging of the lung parenchyma has been challenging because of the&#xD;
      high total ultrasound energy attenuation and scattering by the air in the lungs. However,&#xD;
      recent technological advancements have allowed for rapid assessment of various pulmonary&#xD;
      diseases via the use of lung ultrasound. Furthermore, it has been shown that clear&#xD;
      reproducible Doppler signals can be recorded from the lung parenchyma by means of a pulsed&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound system incorporating a special signal-processing package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LDS may contain information of significant diagnostic and physiological value regarding&#xD;
      the pulmonary parenchyma and vasculature, as well as the cardio-vascular system in general.&#xD;
      In a pilot clinical validation study of patients with acute decompensated heart failure&#xD;
      (ADHF) patients, LDS signals unique to ADHF patients were identified, that superpose on the&#xD;
      normal Lung Doppler Signals (unpublished data). These are high velocity &quot;disorganized&quot;&#xD;
      variable signals that are not synchronous with the cardiac cycle but rather sometimes with&#xD;
      respiration.&#xD;

      Study Purpose and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of noninvasive assessment of lung Doppler&#xD;
      signals performed via transthoracic parametric Doppler. The study has two major objectives&#xD;
      and is thus, divided into two phases, which are on a continuum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: The objective is to further evaluate LDS among patients presenting to the emergency&#xD;
      department with acute dyspnea, in order to determine the diagnostic value of this&#xD;
      non-invasive method to distinguish cardiac from pulmonary causes of dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: In addition, for those patients admitted to the hospital with a clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of ADHF, we would like to further characterize changes in daily lung Doppler signal as a&#xD;
      surrogate biomarker of intravascular volume status, as assessed by clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Overall study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort study of patients presenting to the Massachusetts General Hospital&#xD;
      emergency department with acute dyspnea. . In addition, at MGH, pts admitted to the cardiac&#xD;
      floors (Ellison 9, 10, 11) and general medicine floors (White 9, 10, 11) with an admitting&#xD;
      diagnosis of heart failure, who presented with acute dyspnea, will be approached for&#xD;
      enrollment within 24 hours of hospital admission. All patients with acute dyspnea will&#xD;
      undergo routine clinical assessment, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. In addition,&#xD;
      all patients will also undergo transthoracic parametric Doppler ultrasound based assessment&#xD;
      of LDS. Patients will be treated as usual, under the direction of the attending physician.&#xD;
      Two independent cardiologists will perform detailed chart review on all patients to determine&#xD;
      the etiology of acute dyspnea. They will be blinded to the results of the LDS. In the event&#xD;
      of discrepant findings, a third cardiologist will perform a final detailed chart review to&#xD;
      adjudicate the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, radiologist employed at MGH and who are independent to the study may perform&#xD;
      blinded adjudication of the study participants' chest x-rays (CXR) obtained in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department on the day of enrollment into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients diagnosed with ADHF (diagnosed based on the criteria described below),&#xD;
      will undergo daily TPD and assessment of LDS to further characterize changes in LDS over&#xD;
      time, until the day of discharge or up to day 7 of hospitalization, whichever comes first. In&#xD;
      addition to the initial inpatient scans, study staff will try to acquire a final scan within&#xD;
      72 hours of discharge for patients diagnosed with ADHF, regardless of the day of&#xD;
      hospitalization. This cohort of patients will also undergo daily clinical assessment of&#xD;
      volume status, weight measurement, and BNP assessment. In the event that repeat BNP or&#xD;
      NT-proBNP labs have not been drawn within 72 hours of discharge, study staff will coordinate&#xD;
      with the pathology laboratory (Dr. Kent Lewandrowski) to perform the assay as a research test&#xD;
      using excess clinical specimen from the subject's routine clinical blood draw if available.&#xD;
      Research subjects will not be charged for the cost of the BNP or NT-Pro-BNP assay.&#xD;
