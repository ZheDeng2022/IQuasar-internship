    <textblock>
      Objective measures of health are relatively expensive; meanwhile, self-reports are critiqued&#xD;
      to be subjective and not comparable. A middle ground approach is to apply the frontier work&#xD;
      of vignette methods. The aim of the survey experiment is to explore the validity of survey&#xD;
      instruments to identify students who need glasses, using objectively measured visual acuity&#xD;
      as a gold standard. It is hypothesized that direct comparison against vignette (DCV) is&#xD;
      significantly different from indirect comparison against vignette (ICV); meanwhile,&#xD;
      self-assessment of vision (SAV) is significantly different from primed self-assessment of&#xD;
      vision (PSAV). It is also hypothesized that DCV is a more valid survey instrument than ICV to&#xD;
      classify students who need glasses, using objective visual acuity as a gold standard. Lastly,&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that priming effect from vignettes improves the validity of&#xD;
      self-assessment. It is planned to enroll 3,755 subjects in the survey experiment.&#xD;

      The schools will be visited to announce this project on survey experiment and measuring&#xD;
      visual acuity, for which all participants will receive free eye examinations. After receiving&#xD;
      consent/assent, two data collection strategies will be applied in this survey - DCV and ICV,&#xD;
      to identify individual perceptions of vision. In the arm of ICV, the self-assessment of&#xD;
      vision (SAV) is listed before the vignette questions; however, in the arm of DCV, the&#xD;
      self-assessed vision (PSAV) is listed after the vignette questions to estimate priming&#xD;
      effect. With randomization prior to administration of survey, 50% of the students will be&#xD;
      enrolled in &quot;direct comparison against vignettes&quot; (DCV) and another 50% for &quot;implied&#xD;
      comparison against vignettes&quot; (ICV). Each participant will self-administer the survey. The&#xD;
      objective measure of vision will be set up in a vacant classroom with assistance from members&#xD;
      of the Health Center Jingning County. DCV, ICV, SAV, and PSAV are estimated from randomized&#xD;
      survey questionnaires. Objectively measured vision is from simplified Snellen chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures - All subjects will be asked to respond to the questions about vision acuity without&#xD;
      glasses or contact lenses for themselves and these hypothetical scenarios. Information&#xD;
      collected through the survey includes self-assessed vision, vignettes, clusters (school,&#xD;
      grade, and class), whether the subjects wear glasses or contact lenses, and two demographic&#xD;
      variables (age and sex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-assessed vision - Data of self-assessed vision is collected by asking students to think&#xD;
      about their own vision without glasses or contact lenses. Specifically, each student was&#xD;
      asked to respond to this question: &quot;at the present time, would you say your distance eyesight&#xD;
      is excellent, good, fair, poor, or very poor?&quot; Vignettes - The DCV questionnaire asks&#xD;
      subjects to jointly evaluate their own vision and vignette situations; meanwhile, the ICV&#xD;
      questionnaire asks subjects to conduct single evaluation of vignette questions. Even though&#xD;
      subjects in ICV questionnaires were not asked to compare their visual acuity with the&#xD;
      hypothetical person Zhang, the experimenter could conduct the comparison through data&#xD;
      analysis. Accordingly this approach is named the &quot;indirect comparison against vignettes&quot;&#xD;
      (ICV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, in the DCV questionnaire, the subjects will be asked to respond to the following&#xD;
      question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitting in the last row in the classroom, [Xiao Zhang] does recognize teacher's faces clearly&#xD;
      but cannot identify small hand writing on the blackboard clearly. Would you say your distance&#xD;
      eyesight is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Better than Zhang's&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The same as Zhang's&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Worse than Zhang's Comparatively, in the ICV questionnaire, the subjects will be asked&#xD;
           to respond to the following question instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitting in the last row in the classroom, [Xiao Zhang] does recognize teacher's faces clearly&#xD;
      but cannot identify small hand writing on the blackboard clearly. Would you say [Zhang]'s&#xD;
      distance eyesight is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Excellent,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Good,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fair,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Poor, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Very poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two vignettes are designed in this study. More specifically, two hypothetical persons with&#xD;
      common Chinese names, Xiao Wang and Xiao Zhang will be introduced in the survey, who would be&#xD;
      mentioned as V1 and V2 in the following discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V1: In the dining hall, [Xiao Wang] has no difficulty to see students on the same table&#xD;
      clearly but he cannot not see students on next tables clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V2: Sitting in the last row in the classroom, [Xiao Zhang] does recognize teacher's faces&#xD;
      clearly but cannot identify small hand writing on the blackboard clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two vignettes is designed in the ascending level of visual acuity and the vignettes is&#xD;
      arranged in the questionnaires in this way: V1 and V2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question in DCV is, &quot;Would you say your distance eyesight is better than Wang's, the same&#xD;
      as Wang's, or worse than Wang's?&quot; and the question in ICV was, &quot;Would you say Wang's distance&#xD;
      eyesight is excellent, good, fair, poor, or very poor?&quot; respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective visual acuity - The simplified Snellen chart only consists of letter &quot;E&quot; with&#xD;
      different directions, which was approved by the National Bureau of Standards in China to be a&#xD;
      national standard in testing visual acuity (GB115331989). It was approved by the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health to be used nationwide in China on March 27th, 1989. The simplified Snellen chart is&#xD;
      used to estimate visual acuity with the respondent standing at 5 meters. The measurement&#xD;
      ranges from 4.0 to 5.3, an arithmetic sequence with 0.1 progression. The larger the number&#xD;
      is, the better the respondent's vision is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capability to respond to this eye chart is most likely to be independent from educational&#xD;
      level. Furthermore, simplified Snellen chart also rules out of the difficulties of Snellen&#xD;
      letters and common misidentifications(Mathew, Shah et al. 2011). Therefore, it is less likely&#xD;
      than a standard Snellen chart to underestimate true vision due to low literacy rate. In the&#xD;
      line with vision 4.0, only one letter &quot;E&quot; is presented, and in the line with vision 4.1,&#xD;
      there are two &quot;E&quot;s. Except those two lines, the probability to overestimate true vision by&#xD;
      0.1 due to chance alone is smaller than 6.25% (i.e., 1/64), since a correct response to at&#xD;
      least three &quot;E&quot;s in each line is required in this survey experiment. More specifically, the&#xD;
      probability to guess the direction of one letter &quot;E&quot; correctly by chance is 1/4 and the&#xD;
      probability to guess the directions of three &quot;E&quot;s correctly by chance is only 1/64. Using eye&#xD;
      examination as a gold standard, the empirical research addressed the validity of vignette&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
