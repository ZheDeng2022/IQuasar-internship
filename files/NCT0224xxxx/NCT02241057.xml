  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study. A total of approximately 60 subjects will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive either the heat patch (30 subjects) with a temperature probe/skin reference probe&#xD;
      or a heat patch (30 subjects) alone. The study will consist of 2 visits.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who complete an appropriately administered informed consent process that&#xD;
             includes signing the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects 18-75 years old of either sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are of any skin type or race, providing the skin pigmentation will allow discernment&#xD;
             of erythema;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are in good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are willing and able to have the test products applied as directed, and&#xD;
             comply with study instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to restrict their activity for the 8 hour patch wear&#xD;
             time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants agree to wear a t-shirt provided by the site for the entire 8 hour&#xD;
             patch wear time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a history of sensitivity to any of the test products or adhesion&#xD;
             material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with excessive hair at the application sites, scar tissue, tattoo, or&#xD;
             coloration that would interfere with placement of test product or skin assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, poor circulation or have any clinically&#xD;
             significant chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active dermatitis (including sunburn) in the treatment area, or other&#xD;
             visible dermatological disease which, in the investigator's opinion, might interfere&#xD;
             with the response to the test products or interfere with the skin assessments&#xD;
             associated with the test products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have history of significant dermatologic cancers (eg, melanoma, squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have used topical dermatological products in the application area within&#xD;
             24 hours prior to the test product application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject using a concomitant medication that, in the investigator's opinion, could&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results. Examples of such drugs include&#xD;
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g., aspirin), topical or systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids, and cold/cough products containing antihistamines and/or either&#xD;
             phentolamine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received an investigational medication or device within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to enrolment into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are currently participating in an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who are known to be noncompliant or are unlikely to comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, drug dependency, mental&#xD;
             incapacity) in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
