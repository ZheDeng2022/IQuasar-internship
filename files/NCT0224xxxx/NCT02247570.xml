  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of Vestibular&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (VR) in patients with PTSD who have suffered combat related traumatic brain&#xD;
      injuries in a randomized controlled trial in terms of PTSD symptom reduction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has been approved by our Institutional IRB and conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial will be registered at&#xD;
      Clinicaltrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. There is equipoise.&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of VR in in patients with&#xD;
      PTSD who have suffered combat related traumatic brain injuries. A blinded investigator that&#xD;
      will not be involved in the study will perform the randomization and allocation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will accomplish the specific aim of our study by analyzing the difference in the Clinician&#xD;
      Administered DSM-IV PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores between the two groups in our study as outcomes&#xD;
      to compare the effectiveness of VR. The CAPS is considered to be the gold standard for&#xD;
      diagnosing PTSD and assessing symptom severity. We expect differences in the outcomes between&#xD;
      both treatments to be immediate and at follow-up over time, i.e. immediately after 3 months,&#xD;
      6 months and 12 months after cessation of a 2 week treatment period. The study design will&#xD;
      include one pre-treatment assessment and our post-treatment assessments (at 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months and 12 months). Investigators who will be blinded for the allocated treatment will&#xD;
      perform all assessments. The study will be performed at the department of Neurology of our&#xD;
      Institutional Brain Center in Dallas, Texas. Patient recruitment will begin starting in&#xD;
      September 2014.&#xD;
