  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of orally administered CB-5083 in adult&#xD;
      subjects with advanced metastatic solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: an&#xD;
      initial Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1a) of CB-5083 in subjects with advanced metastatic&#xD;
      solid tumors who have progressed or are non-responsive to available therapies and for which&#xD;
      no standard therapy exists, followed by a Dose Expansion Phase (Phase 1b) which will include&#xD;
      1 to 4 arms: one arm in subjects with RAS mutated mCRC; optionally, at sponsors discretion, 3&#xD;
      additional arms may be added for subjects with advanced RCC, advanced pNET, or solid tumors&#xD;
      with mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the Dose Escalation Phase are to determine the safety, tolerability, PK and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic profiles, the MTD and/or RP2D, and the effect of fed vs. fasted state on the&#xD;
      bioavailability of orally administered CB-5083. The objectives of the dose expansion phase&#xD;
      are to confirm the safety and tolerability of the RP2D, to further assess the PK and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic profiles and to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of CB-5083 in&#xD;
      subjects with tumors for which there is biologic plausibility of unique sensitivity to&#xD;
      CB-5083 mechanism of action (MOA) based on pre-clinical data. The objectives of the Food&#xD;
      Effect Stage is to determine the effect of fed vs. fasted state on the bioavailability of&#xD;
      orally administered CB-5083.&#xD;
