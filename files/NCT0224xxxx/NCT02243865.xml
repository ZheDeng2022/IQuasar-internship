    <masking_description>A placebo module, with one input and 6 outputs, was added to the Chordate S200 system. Some outputs delivered active treatment and others placebo. The operator received a coded envelope and according to that, either active treatment or placebo was selected. The operator did not know which outputs delivered treatment and which did not.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Migraine Days Per Four Weeks During the Three Months Post Treatment Investigation Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (28 days pre-treatment) to visit 4 (day 98, ± 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A diary was used where patients added information each day on experienced migraine (yes/no). Baseline was defined as any migraine days from Day -29 until Day -1, i.e. the day before first treatment (Day 1). If full time period for baseline or the post treatment period was not documented, number of migraine days was recalculated with the formula:&#xD;
Number of migraine days = (Number of migraine days x 28) / Number of days observed&#xD;
If data was missing for any patient for more than 14 days during any period of interest, that patient was excluded from analysis.&#xD;
The change from baseline in number of migraine days was calculated as follows:&#xD;
Change = number of migraine days per four weeks for the 3 months post treatment period - number of migraine days per four weeks of the baseline period&#xD;
As the difference between the post treatment period and baseline is presented, negative numbers indicate a post treatment decrease in number of migraine days.</description>

The change from baseline in number of migraine days was calculated as follows:&#xD;
Change = number of migraine days per four weeks for applicable post treatment period - number of migraine days per four weeks of the baseline period&#xD;
As the difference between applicable post treatment period and baseline is presented, negative numbers indicate a post treatment decrease in number of migraine days.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Migraine Pain Intensity During the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Month, the Final 4 Weeks and the Complete Three Month Post Treatment Investigation Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (day ≥ - 28 days) to visit 4 (day 98, ± 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A diary was used where patients added information on the maximum pain intensity on each day according to a 4-point categorical scale (none, mild, medium, severe).&#xD;
The maximum documented pain intensity for each patient during each post treatment time period was tabulated for the active treatment and placebo groups.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Median Migraine Duration (Hours/Day) During the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Month, the Final 4 Weeks and the Complete Three Month Post Treatment Investigation Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (28 days pre-treatment) to visit 4 (day 98, ± 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A diary was used where patients added information each day on the number of hours with migraine. The median migraine duration in hours per day was determined for each patient, for each post treatment time period. Baseline for each patient was defined as the median number of migraine hours/day from Day -29 until Day -1, i.e. the day before the first treatment (Day 1).&#xD;
The change in median migraine hours/day from baseline, for each defined post treatment time period, was then determined and the mean change is presented.&#xD;
As the differences between applicable post treatment period and baseline is presented, negative numbers indicate a post treatment decrease in number of migraine hours/day.</description>

    <measure>Patient's Satisfaction as Measured on Clinical Global Impression Scales (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At visit 4 day 98, ± 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction, evaluated by a clinician, was measured using 8-point clinical global impression (CGI) scores on an improvement scale (CGI-I: compared to condition at baseline, how much has changed: 0 = Not assessed, 1 = Very much improved, 2 = Much improved, 3 = Minimally improved, 4 = No change, 5 = Minimally worse, 6 = Much worse, 7 = Very much worse).</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline (day 0, visit 2) to visit 4 (day 98, ± 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of Participants with a Change in Disease-specific Quality of Life, as measured by EQ-5D-3L, from Baseline (day 0, visit 2 before first treatment) to End of the Three Month Investigation Duration. EQ-5D-3L uses 5 categorical dimensions - motility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, each classified as improved, no change or worsened.</description>

    <measure>Disease-specific Quality of Life (VAS Pain Scale) From Baseline to End of the Three Month Study Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (day 0, visit 2) to visit 4 (day 98, ± 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-specific quality of life, as measured by EQ-VAS, at baseline (day 0, visit 2 before first treatment) and at end of the three month study duration after treatment. The EQ VAS is a standard vertical 20 cm visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual's rating for their current health-related quality of life state, with a score from 0-100, where a higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Migraine Days Per Four Weeks During the Three Months Post Treatment Investigation Duration</title>
        <description>A diary was used where patients added information each day on experienced migraine (yes/no). Baseline was defined as any migraine days from Day -29 until Day -1, i.e. the day before first treatment (Day 1). If full time period for baseline or the post treatment period was not documented, number of migraine days was recalculated with the formula:&#xD;
Number of migraine days = (Number of migraine days x 28) / Number of days observed&#xD;
If data was missing for any patient for more than 14 days during any period of interest, that patient was excluded from analysis.&#xD;
The change from baseline in number of migraine days was calculated as follows:&#xD;
Change = number of migraine days per four weeks for the 3 months post treatment period - number of migraine days per four weeks of the baseline period&#xD;
As the difference between the post treatment period and baseline is presented, negative numbers indicate a post treatment decrease in number of migraine days.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Median Migraine Duration (Hours/Day) During the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Month, the Final 4 Weeks and the Complete Three Month Post Treatment Investigation Duration</title>
        <description>A diary was used where patients added information each day on the number of hours with migraine. The median migraine duration in hours per day was determined for each patient, for each post treatment time period. Baseline for each patient was defined as the median number of migraine hours/day from Day -29 until Day -1, i.e. the day before the first treatment (Day 1).&#xD;
The change in median migraine hours/day from baseline, for each defined post treatment time period, was then determined and the mean change is presented.&#xD;
As the differences between applicable post treatment period and baseline is presented, negative numbers indicate a post treatment decrease in number of migraine hours/day.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline (28 days pre-treatment) to visit 4 (day 98, ± 7 days)</time_frame>
        <population>44 patients were allocated to active treatment and 43 to placebo. Out of these 40 patients completed the active treatment and 38 patients completed placebo treatment (see participant flow). Only patients who completed treatment were included in analysis. If a patient had missing data for more than 14 days for any of the periods of interest, that period was excluded from the statistical analysis of the applicable endpoint.</population>

        <description>Disease-specific quality of life, as measured by EQ-VAS, at baseline (day 0, visit 2 before first treatment) and at end of the three month study duration after treatment. The EQ VAS is a standard vertical 20 cm visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual's rating for their current health-related quality of life state, with a score from 0-100, where a higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>
