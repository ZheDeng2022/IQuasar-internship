      TSB-9-W1, prepared by Taiwan Sunpan Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (TSB) is a botanical drug and&#xD;
      applied patent in the United States (US patent No. 7,138,428 B2), Japan (Patent No.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5441947) and Taiwan (Patent No. I432191 and I282280). The R&amp;D laboratory in TSB is ISO/IEC&#xD;
      17025 certified by Taiwan Accreditation Foundation (TAF) and the laboratory number is&#xD;
      2026.The trade name of TSB-9-W1 is &quot;IDS&quot; in English, the registration number is 01472800 at&#xD;
      2011 by Intellectual Property Office (IPO), Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I and pk study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy profiles of TSB-9-W1 in pre-treated patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      there are 5 cohorts and a minimal 2 patients and up to 30 patients are required at phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm study. All eligible patients with mCRC will receive TSB-9-W1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle is composed by a contiguous 2-day oral administration and a contiguous&#xD;
      3-day rest. Patient should take the study drug once daily before meal with approximately 250&#xD;
      ml or appropriate amount of water.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to establish the MTD of TSB-9-W1 for mCRC patients with a traditional 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Structure&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose escalation scenario is designed to determine the MTD according to the DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose levels of investigation product are planned to be administered for determining MTD&#xD;
      and DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation scenario:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in a cohort of 3 patients for each dose level. Dose escalation will&#xD;
      proceed sequentially from the lowest dose cohort. No intra-subject dose escalation is&#xD;
      allowed. Each patient's first dose will be at least 3-day apart from the very next patient's&#xD;
      first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLT (except diarrhea) is determined by (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03 (2010/6/14) defined treatment&#xD;
      related toxicity ≥ grade 3 and is worsen from the baseline. Any grade ≥ 3 toxicity (except&#xD;
      for diarrhea) is considered a DLT unless there is a clear alternative explanation as to the&#xD;
      attribution of the adverse event. Diarrhea event is considered as a DLT if the episode is&#xD;
      with NCI-CTCAE Grade of 3 and this event lasts &gt; 3 days despite appropriate supportive cares&#xD;
      or if it is a Grade 4 event. Diarrhea event reaches Grade 4 will trigger the patient to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study. AEs are evaluated according to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.03 as&#xD;
      determined by the investigator to be at least possibly related in causality to the IP&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLT is to be observed during the first 6-treatment cycles (1 cycle = 5 days). If none of the&#xD;
      first 3 patients experience DLT, then dose escalation will proceed for the next cohort of&#xD;
      patients unless the present dose level is level 5 (1000 mg/day). If 1 of 3 patients develops&#xD;
      DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients (another 3 patients to be added subsequently).&#xD;
      If no more than 1 of the 6 patients experiences DLT, then escalation to the next dose level&#xD;
      will proceed unless the present dose level is level 5. If more than 1 patient develops DLT in&#xD;
      any dose cohort, the dose escalation will be withheld and the prior dose level is considered&#xD;
      as the MTD unless present dose level is level 1 (200 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meeting will be held to review safety data prior to&#xD;
      each dose escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cut-off criteria Enrolled patients will be treated until disease progression. This study will&#xD;
      be ended while either condition below is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients are Disease Progression (PD) or death or loss of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Last treated patient receives 9-month treatment.&#xD;

      Duration of Treatment&#xD;
