      Development of a training concept for health care professionals (nursing and medical staff),&#xD;
      according to the current guidelines on treatment of in-patients with Diabetes. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the change in hypoglycaemia rates comparing data before and after the training.&#xD;
      Hereby we can derive the effects of staff training on the quality of health care in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Diabetes in in-patients is about 32% and therefore exceeds significantly&#xD;
      the prevalence in general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases Diabetes is only a secondary diagnosis the medical staff has to deal with&#xD;
      daily. The diagnosis which leads to hospital admission and the often multiple comorbidities&#xD;
      complicate the metabolic control. Blood sugar imbalances present an additional risk for these&#xD;
      patients and increase in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay and general&#xD;
      complications as nosocomial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve hospital care for diabetics the Endocrine Society and the American College of&#xD;
      Physicians published new guidelines on blood glucose management for non-ICU wards. Primarily&#xD;
      they contain recommendations for blood glucose target range and standards to improve&#xD;
      inpatient hospital care like standard operating procedures for blood glucose monitoring as&#xD;
      well as hyper- and hypoglycaemic disturbances through to discharge management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed a training concept for health care professionals (nursing and medical staff),&#xD;
      according to the current guidelines on treatment of in-patients with Diabetes. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the change in hypoglycaemia rates comparing data before and after the training.&#xD;
      Hereby we can derive the effects of staff training on the quality of health care in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far there was only one comparable study published which showed a significant improvement&#xD;
      of treatment quality by reducing hypoglycaemia rates considerably . The results of this study&#xD;
      cannot be transferred due to substantial structural differences. More over there are no&#xD;
      national diabetes management guidelines for inpatient treatment in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric data (Age, Sex, Bodyweight, Height)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  POCT blood glucose values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other laboratory values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study conforms to the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki, Revision of 1996.&#xD;
