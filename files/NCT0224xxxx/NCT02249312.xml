&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent signed and dated prior to participation into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females aged 18 - 65 years. Female patients of child bearing potential&#xD;
             cannot participate in this study. Female patients are eligible to participate only if&#xD;
             they are surgically sterilized or two years post menopausal. Women entering into this&#xD;
             trial will have a pregnancy test before and after participation in the trial. Testing&#xD;
             will be done during visit 1 and visit 5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A documented diagnosis of asthma as defined by the American thoracic society i.e.,&#xD;
             episodic wheezing, chest tightness, cough and/or shortness of breath at least&#xD;
             partially relieved by bronchodilator medication. No hospital admission in the last&#xD;
             eight weeks for the treatment of asthma; no requirement for steroid therapy (systemic&#xD;
             or inhaled) for the previous four weeks, nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate in&#xD;
             the previous two weeks; asthma therapy stable and limited to intermittent use of&#xD;
             inhaled Î²2-agonists or anticholinergics on an as required basis, or occasional use of&#xD;
             antihistamines. Predicted equations for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)&#xD;
             of Caucasians and African - Americans are those of Morris et. al. and Glindmeyer et.&#xD;
             al. At visit 2, 3, and 5, immediately prior to the induced sputum test, but following&#xD;
             albuterol administration, a patient's FEV1 must be above 60 % of predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of, at least, 25 % of neutrophils in induced sputum during screening&#xD;
             visit 2 (this requirement refers to the neutrophils percentage exclusive of squamous&#xD;
             cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to produce an adequate induced sputum sample (visit 2) as defined by: Volume &gt;&#xD;
             1 ml, squamous cells &lt; 80 % and ability to tolerate the procedure for at least 4&#xD;
             minutes with no bronchoconstriction (a fall in FEV1 &gt; 20 %)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with PC20 methacholine &lt;= 8 mg/ml as determined at visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers (patients who have never smoked) or ex-smokers for at least one year with&#xD;
             a smoking history, no greater than five pack-years (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes per&#xD;
             day for 1 year)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to be trained in the proper use of peak flow meter (Mini Wright peak flow&#xD;
             meter, Clement Clarke, Inc.) and in performing and recording technically satisfactory&#xD;
             pulmonary function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to attend an outpatient clinic on a regular basis and undergo three induced&#xD;
             sputum challenges during which they will be confined to the investigational unit for&#xD;
             up to two hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to comply with the concomitant therapy restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be off all prescription drug therapy other than that specifically for&#xD;
             asthma or hay fever. Over the counter (O.T.C.) drugs must be discontinued for at least&#xD;
             two weeks prior to participation in the study. If any O.T.C. medication is needed by&#xD;
             patients throughout the study, the investigator will call the clinical monitor and&#xD;
             this will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will have no evidence of clinically relevant concomitant disease based upon&#xD;
             complete medical history, full physical examination, chest x-ray (if not done in&#xD;
             previous 6 months), electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests. These tests&#xD;
             should indicate that the patient is healthy except for changes related to asthma or&#xD;
             atopy (e.g., eosinophilia based on a total eosinophil count). Patient may have a&#xD;
             history of allergic rhinitis or urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The following laboratory parameters must be within the normal range, or if not,&#xD;
