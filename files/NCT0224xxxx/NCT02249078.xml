    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      sequential-cohort, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 3 subcutaneous and 1 intravenous dose of&#xD;
      E6011 in subjects with active Crohn's disease (CD). Thirty-two subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of 4 dose cohorts (8 per cohort) and will receive E6011 or placebo for 10 weeks. The&#xD;
      first 3 cohorts will receive E6011 or placebo via subcutaneous injection and the last cohort&#xD;
      will receive E6011 or placebo by intravenous injection. The ratio of E6011 to placebo within&#xD;
      each cohort will be 3:1. The study has 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization.&#xD;
