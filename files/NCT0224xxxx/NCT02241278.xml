      The analgesic properties of ketamine are associated with its non-competitive antagonism of&#xD;
      the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; these receptors exhibit an excitatory function on pain&#xD;
      transmission and this binding seems to inhibit or reverse the central sensitization of pain.&#xD;
      In the literature, the value of this anesthetic for preemptive analgesia in the control of&#xD;
      postoperative pain is uncertain. The objective of this study was to ascertain whether&#xD;
      preoperative low-dose ketamine reduces postoperative pain and morphine consumption in adults&#xD;
      undergoing colon surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a double-blind, randomized trial, 48 patients were studied. Patients in the ketamine group&#xD;
      received 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine before surgical incision, while the control group&#xD;
      received normal saline. The postoperative analgesia was achieved with a continuous infusion&#xD;
      of morphine at 0.015 mg∙kgˉ¹∙hˉ¹ with the possibility of 0.02 mg/kg bolus every 10 min. Pain&#xD;
      was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), morphine consumption, and hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours postoperatively. We quantified times to&#xD;
      rescue analgesic (Paracetamol), adverse effects and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the techniques we have at our disposal and the elementary nature of incisional&#xD;
      pain, optimal pain management remains a challenge. Because the severity of early&#xD;
      postoperative pain relates to residual pain after some types of surgery, perioperative pain&#xD;
      management can considerably influence the long-term quality of life in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Woolf, in 1983, first introduced the theory of preemptive analgesia to attenuate&#xD;
      postoperative pain, confirming the presence of a central factor of post-injury pain&#xD;
      hypersensitivity in experimental research. After this, experimental studies showed that&#xD;
      various anti-nociceptive methods applied before injuries were more effective in reducing&#xD;
      post-injury central sensitization in contrast to administration after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After activation of C-fibers by noxious stimuli, sensory neurons become more sensitive to&#xD;
      peripheral inputs, a process called central sensitization. 'Wind up, another mechanism&#xD;
      activating spinal sensory neurons, is seen after reiterated stimulation of C-fibers. These&#xD;
      sensitizations produce c-fos expression in sensory neurons, and are related to the activation&#xD;
      of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and neurokinin receptors. These genes produce long-lasting&#xD;
      changes in the pain-processing system, resulting in hyperexcitation. According to Wall,&#xD;
      protection of sensory neurons against central sensitization may provide relief from pain&#xD;
      after surgery. Based on this assumption, preemptive analgesia has been recommended as an&#xD;
      effective aid to control postsurgical pain. NMDA antagonists have been demonstrated to block&#xD;
      the induction of central sensitization and revoke the hypersensitivity once it is&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is an old drug that is increasingly being considered for the treatment of acute and&#xD;
      chronic pain. Its pharmacology and mechanism of action as an NMDA receptor antagonist are&#xD;
      adequately known, but in clinical practice it presents irregular results. Since ketamine is&#xD;
      an NMDA-receptor antagonist, it is supposed to avoid or revoke central sensitization, and&#xD;
      thus to attenuate postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This antihyperalgesic action can be achieved by smaller doses than those required for&#xD;
      anesthesia. Small-dose ketamine has been specified as not more than 1 mg/kg when given as an&#xD;
      iv bolus, and not higher than 20 µg∙kgˉ¹∙minˉ¹ when given as a constant infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-doses preemptive ketamine administered iv seem to reduce postoperative pain and/or&#xD;
      analgesic consumption. According to one study, a single dose of ketamine 1 mg/kg, when&#xD;
      administered in conjunction with local anesthetics, opioids or other anesthetics, provides&#xD;
      good postoperative pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the overwhelming effectiveness of preemptive ketamine in animal experiments,&#xD;
      clinical reports are mixed; some authors have described positive effects while others have&#xD;
      not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While early reviews of clinical findings were mostly contradictory, there is still conviction&#xD;
      in the effectiveness of preemptive analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no prior controlled study has determined the effectiveness of preoperative&#xD;
      low-dose iv ketamine as contrasted with placebo in adults after open colon surgery. Thus,&#xD;
      this clinical trial was designed to examine the postoperative analgesic effectiveness and&#xD;
      opioid-sparing effect of single low-dose iv ketamine in contrast with placebo administered&#xD;
      preoperatively.&#xD;
