        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of COPD as defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.&#xD;
             Patients had to have relatively stable airway obstruction with a FEV1 ≥ 20 % and ≤ 70&#xD;
             % of predicted value and FEV1/ FVC ≤ 70 % at screening Visit 1. Predicted normal&#xD;
             values were based on the guidelines for standardised lung function testing of the&#xD;
             European Community for Steel and Coal (ECSC) for patients of the Caucasian race and on&#xD;
             the predicted equations for patients belonging to the Black race. Patients had to have&#xD;
             lung hyperinflation as demonstrated by thoracic gas volume box (TGVbox) ≥ 100 % of&#xD;
             predicted value (same as predicted value for functional residual capacity (FRC)&#xD;
             measured by body plethysmography)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or females aged 40 years or older. Female patients of childbearing potential&#xD;
             could not participate in this study. Female patients had to be either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  surgically sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  post-menopausal for at least two years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A smoking history of more than ten pack-years (p.y.). A p.y. was defined as the&#xD;
             equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients had to be able to perform pulmonary function testings (PFTs), exercise&#xD;
             endurance test not terminated due to leg discomfort alone or other restrictions&#xD;
             diseases (e.g. claudicatio intermittens, etc.) only and maintain records during the&#xD;
             study period as required in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients had to sign both informed consent forms (one on specific study&#xD;
             procedures, one related to DNA derived determinations) prior to participation in the&#xD;
             trial i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications if they&#xD;
             agreed to participate in both portions of the trial. The patient was not obligated to&#xD;
             participate in the DNA collection portion of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical and/or radiographic evidence and/or antibiotic treatment of an upper or lower&#xD;
             respiratory tract infection within the previous four weeks or during the screening&#xD;
             period of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant diseases other than COPD were excluded. A significant disease was defined&#xD;
             as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator could either put the patient at&#xD;
             risk because of participation in the study or a disease which could influence the&#xD;
             results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study. Patients&#xD;
             with inflammatory diseases, e.g., Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, and those&#xD;
             with autoimmune diseases were excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, liver function, blood chemistry&#xD;
             or urinalysis. If the abnormality defined a disease listed as an exclusion criterion&#xD;
             the patient was excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A recent history (i.e., within six months) of myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A recent history (i.e., within three months) of refractory heart failure or unstable&#xD;
             arrhythmia requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma were allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of life-threatening airway obstruction or a history of cystic fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a history of a&#xD;
             thoracotomy without pulmonary resection were evaluated as per exclusion criterion No.&#xD;
             2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A change in pulmonary therapy, including rehabilitation therapy, within the four weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first screening Visit (Visit 1) in order to control the patient's COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of asthma or a total blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3. A repeat eosinophil&#xD;
             count was not conducted in these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history (within the past five years) of and/or current alcohol abuse and/or drug&#xD;
             abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of an investigational drug within one month or six half lives (which ever is&#xD;
             greater) of the first Screening Visit (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring oxygen therapy 24 hours a day or requiring oxygen during exercise.&#xD;
             Patients that desaturated during exercise were only excluded upon medical judgement of&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
