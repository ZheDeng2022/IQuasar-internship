    <textblock>
      This study is an observational multicenter descriptive study. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      primary outpatient medical institutions in different cities of the RF. Primary care doctors&#xD;
      who are primary contact for greater part of the population in RF including COPD patients will&#xD;
      be invited as investigators. This observational descriptive study will be conducted within&#xD;
      the routine practice of outpatient institutions. Since spirometry is not an integral part of&#xD;
      the current all-round clinical practice, only those sites where spirometry test is routinely&#xD;
      used in examination of patients with COPD risk factors and when monitoring condition of COPD&#xD;
      patients will take part in the study. Thus the decision about spirometry in every study&#xD;
      subject will be determined only by the existing treatment approaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an observational multicenter descriptive study. No hypothesis is checked in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3000 patients with COPD risk factors are planned to be enrolled into the study (current&#xD;
      smokers and former smokers with smoking history of ≥10 pack/years at the age of &gt;40 years who&#xD;
      have respiratory complaints) and 1450 patients previously diagnosed with COPD who contacted&#xD;
      the physicians of outpatient institutions during the study (for 3 months) and are currently&#xD;
      in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients with COPD risk factors and approximately 50 patients early diagnosed with COPD&#xD;
      currently being stable are planned to be enrolled in each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians and pulmonologists of the outpatient institutions of the Russian Federation will&#xD;
      take part in the study in about 30 sites in 18 cities (a total of 31% of RF population live&#xD;
      in the cities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observational descriptive study will be conducted within the routine practice of&#xD;
      outpatient institutions. Examining and treatment of patients will be performed according to&#xD;
      the rules of the routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled into the study as they visit the outpatient institutions for the&#xD;
      medical care. The study does not imply any special invitation of COPD patients to the sites&#xD;
      for them to be enrolled into the study. Therefore the conditions are made for the study&#xD;
      population to reflect the typical visitors of the primary care medical institutions in&#xD;
      different RF (Russian Federation) regions. Patients are enrolled into the study regardless&#xD;
      the reason for appointment with a doctor. A reason for the appointment can be respiratory&#xD;
      complaints as well as any other diseases or certificates and conclusions. To be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study the subjects must sign the written Informed Consent Form (ICF) to participate in&#xD;
      the study and to use personal data confidentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the role of spirometry in diagnostics and management of the COPD patients, two&#xD;
      groups of patients are supposed to be included into the study.&#xD;
