      This study evaluates whether a diet rich in poly-unsaturated fats can compensate for the&#xD;
      negative effects of high saturated fat meals on metabolic, inflammatory, and coagulation&#xD;
      responses. Half of the participants will receive a high polyunsaturated fat diet )50%&#xD;
      carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 35% fat. 21% of total energy will be poly-unsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids, 9% mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and 5% saturated fatty acids) for 7 days, while the&#xD;
      other half will receive a control diet 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein 50%&#xD;
      carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein. Only, 7% of total energy will be poly-unsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids, 15% of total energy will be mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and 13% of total&#xD;
      energy will be saturated fatty acids.) for 7 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating more saturated fats has been shown to decrease how many calories an individual burns&#xD;
      and increase chronic disease risk by increasing inflammation, coagulation (blood clotting)&#xD;
      potential, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Conversely, eating more poly-unsaturated fats has&#xD;
      been linked to decreased risk of chronic diseases. The goal of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether or not eating a diet containing a lot of poly-unsaturated fats can compensate for the&#xD;
      damaging effects of eating occasional high-fat meals that are high in saturated fats. Those&#xD;
      damaging effects we are interested in studying include how much fat and calories a person's&#xD;
      body burns, and measuring some markers of chronic disease risk in the blood (inflammation&#xD;
      markers and blood clotting markers).&#xD;
