  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our purpose is to investigate the improvement of the cognitive, neuropsychologic and physical&#xD;
      capabilities using a standardized multidimensional geriatric assessment (MGA) consisting of a&#xD;
      battery of validated assays after correction of hyponatremia in patients 70 years or older.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With an occurrence of up to 30%, hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium concentration of&#xD;
      less than 135 mmol/L, is the most commonly encountered electrolyte disorder in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients today. The highest incidence of hyponatremia is found in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective analyses clearly show an association between hyponatremia and mortality as well&#xD;
      as morbidity and this association is not confined only to severely decreased sodium levels.&#xD;
      Hyponatremia can be an acute and life-threatening condition, which is usually reflected by&#xD;
      severe signs and symptoms, e.g. coma or seizures,but more often it is of chronic nature, and&#xD;
      symptoms may be subtle or even apparently absent due to cerebral adaptation processes. Signs&#xD;
      and symptoms include, among others, nausea, drowsiness, cognitive impairment, memory&#xD;
      deficits, depression, muscle cramps, or gait instability. However, our knowledge of the&#xD;
      highly diverse clinical picture of hyponatremia stems from anecdotic reports and experiments&#xD;
      that were performed by the investigators on themselves in the 1930ies. Thus, no accurate and&#xD;
      thorough description of the symptomatology of hyponatremiain disease has been carried out so&#xD;
      far, except maybe for the extreme conditions, i.e. in patients suffering from seizures or&#xD;
      coma. This is why especially patients with chronic mild-to-moderate hyponatremia (sometimes&#xD;
      defined as a sodium concentration &gt; 125 mmol/L) who may well have subtle or unspecific&#xD;
      symptoms are often perceived as being asymptomatic. Recent investigations have demonstrated&#xD;
      that such patients have a significantly increased risk for falls and bone fractures and&#xD;
      reduced cognitive capacities. Moreover, anecdotic reports have shown that some patients that&#xD;
      were believed to suffer from depression or dementia improved markedly after correction of&#xD;
      their concomitanthyponatremia. There is also mounting evidence that hyponatremia induces&#xD;
      osteoporosis which adds to the risk of bone fractures. Furthermore, in the SALT-trials, the&#xD;
      mental component of the SF-12 questionnaire (Short Form-12) improved significantly after&#xD;
      hyponatremia had been corrected. Interestingly, the mean sodium concentration prior to&#xD;
      treatment was 129 mmol/L indicating mild or moderate hyponatremia. Given the high prevalence&#xD;
      of mild-to-moderate hyponatremiain the elderly, unspecific symptoms like mood instability,&#xD;
      cognitive deficits or others, thatare often attributed to old age could simply be a&#xD;
      consequence of their low sodium level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, it might well be that by treating hyponatremia the morbidity/mortality in this&#xD;
      population could be reduced and quality of life improved. In light of the growing&#xD;
      medico-economic challenges we are facing secondary to the steadily increasing life expectancy&#xD;
      and the demographic evolution in the western world and the medical problems that come along&#xD;
      with this development the influence of successful correction of hyponatremia on mental and&#xD;
      physical health should be evaluated. To our knowledge this has not been investigated so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) accounts for more than a third of all&#xD;
      cases of hyponatremia and probably is by far the most frequent aetiology of chronic mild to&#xD;
      moderate hyponatremia. While newly developed SIADH is often induced by malignancies,&#xD;
      pulmonary or cerebral disease in the general population, longstanding chronic hyponatremia in&#xD;
      elderly is usually due to idiopathic or drug-associated SIADH. Apart from SIADH, hypovolemia&#xD;
      or reduction of the effective arterial blood volume, e.g. in cardiac failure or liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, are common causes of hyponatremia. Although hyponatremia might have an impact on&#xD;
      the mental and physical status as well as on the patient's prognosis regardless of the&#xD;
      underlying cause, most aetiologies except for SIADH might be confounding factors, since they&#xD;
      often induce a &quot;hyponatremia-like&quot; clinical picture by themselves, e.g. hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy in liver disease etc. Another possible confounder may be hemoglobin. Recent&#xD;
      work shows that hyponatremia is associated with anaemia, which is a highly prevalent symptom&#xD;
      in elderly patients and an acknowledged risk factor for poor outcome in this population. The&#xD;
      underlying pathogenesis of this association is still unknown. Regarding the fact that anaemia&#xD;
      and hyponatremia are both risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality in elderly&#xD;
      patients that are potentially curable, analysis of influence on the multidimensional&#xD;
      geriatric assessment (MGA) before and after correction is challenging. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      these possible confounders have not been accounted for in the existing literature. Moreover,&#xD;
      no accurate evaluation of the origin of hyponatremia has been reported.&#xD;

    <description>The impact of serum sodium concentration on geriatric assessment scores will be evaluated individually for each assessment score in a linear model, independent variables being a) increment of serum sodium [mmol/L] from the time of the first MGA at hospital admission to the time of the second MGA prior to discharge, and b) baseline serum sodium [mmol/L] at the time of the first MGA at hospital admission, the dependent variable being change of assessment score. A subgroup analysis will be done for SIADH patients.&#xD;
The association between geriatric assessments and serum sodium [mmol/L] will be analysed by correlation analysis at the time of the first and second MGA.</description>
