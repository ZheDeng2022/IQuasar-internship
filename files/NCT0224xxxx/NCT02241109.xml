    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease and an important public-health&#xD;
      problem. Surgical or interventional aortic valve replacement are based on symptoms and&#xD;
      measures of valvular and ventricular function using echocardiography.There is no uniform&#xD;
      pattern of progression. Instead, marked differences not only between individuals, but also&#xD;
      during the time course of the disease can be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several prospective studies have been performed to enhance the predictability of disease&#xD;
      behavior. Individually it is still prone to large errors and hard to predict aortic stenosis&#xD;
      progression. Therefore, in patients with aortic sclerosis without severe stenosis, it is&#xD;
      desirable to find a strong predictor of rapid disease progression. This would allow&#xD;
      anticipating cardiovascular deterioration by identifying individuals at particular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with aortic sclerosis, increased serum calcification propensity, as measured by&#xD;
      the T50-Test, is related to the amount of stenosis progression in one year.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease and an important public-health&#xD;
      problem. It is present in approximately 25% of all adults aged &gt;65 years. Decisions about&#xD;
      surgical or interventional aortic valve replacement are based on symptoms and measures of&#xD;
      valvular and ventricular function using echocardiography. Such valvular affections are the&#xD;
      result of a chronic progressive disease, usually starting with hemodynamically&#xD;
      non-significant aortic sclerosis, and then progressing to severe stenosis over years. There&#xD;
      is no uniform pattern of progression. Instead, marked differences not only between&#xD;
      individuals, but also during the time course of the disease can be observed. Aortic sclerosis&#xD;
      progresses to mild aortic stenosis in &lt;15% of patients over 2 to 7 years. Once moderate&#xD;
      stenosis is present (jet velocity &gt;3 m/s), the average progression is 0.3 m/s per year, but&#xD;
      still highly variable. When peak jet velocity exceeds 4 m/s, survival free from symptoms and&#xD;
      valve replacement is significantly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, several prospective studies have been performed to enhance the predictability of&#xD;
      disease behavior. Some determinants of rapid progression and adverse outcome have been&#xD;
      identified, such as: age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, B-natriuretic peptide,&#xD;
      stenosis severity, degree of valvular calcification and others. Although it appears that&#xD;
      progression is more rapid in degenerative calcific disease than congenital or rheumatic&#xD;
      disease, predicting progression individually is still prone to large errors even when&#xD;
      considering these determinants. Therefore, regular clinical follow-up is mandatory in&#xD;
      patients with asymptomatic aortic valve affections. In patients with aortic sclerosis without&#xD;
      severe stenosis, it is desirable to find a strong predictor of rapid disease progression.&#xD;
      This would allow anticipating cardiovascular deterioration by identifying individuals at&#xD;
      particular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background of Tissue Calcification&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a biochemical and histological point of view, aortic sclerosis is a valvular disease&#xD;
      characterized by focal plaque-like lesions containing microscopic calcifications. Because&#xD;
      calcium and phosphate concentrations in serum are near supersaturation, the balance of&#xD;
      inhibitors and promoters critically influences the development of calcification. The serum&#xD;
      protein fetuin-A is a major systemic inhibitor of calcification. Together with additional&#xD;
      blood components, fetuin-A prevents the supersaturated calcium and phosphate from&#xD;
      precipitating by forming soluble colloidal protein-mineral nanoparticles and is therefore an&#xD;
      integral part of the defense system preventing calcifications. Low serum concentrations of&#xD;
      fetuin-A are associated with a reduced capacity to inhibit calcification in vitro.&#xD;
      Calcification takes place when this humoral line of defense is overwhelmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Koos et al. showed that serum levels of the calcification inhibitor fetuin-A are associated&#xD;
      with the progression of aortic valve calcifications and major adverse clinical events,&#xD;
      independent of the renal function and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel in vitro blood test developed by Pasch et al. provides an overall measure of&#xD;
      calcification propensity by monitoring the maturation time (T50) of calciprotein particles.&#xD;
      First published clinical data indicate that the T50 test is a helpful biomarker for the&#xD;
      prediction of future vascular calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Index test (parameter to be evaluated): T50-Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparator tests (tests to define disease status):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression of peak aortic jet velocity over one year (m/s per year)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression of peak aortic jet velocity &gt;20% in one year (dichotomized primary comparator)&#xD;
      Combined endpoint: death, hospitalizations, aortic-valve replacement, heart failure, angina,&#xD;
      syncope&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient referred to routine clinical echocardiography at the Department of Cardiology,&#xD;
           Inselspital Bern&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aortic sclerosis with or without stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to recruit a population comprising a large variety of clinical conditions.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aortic valve replacement scheduled within 1 year after inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any aortic valvular disease other than degenerative sclerotic, bi- or unicuspid valves&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known disease with expected survival &lt;1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known malignant tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subvalvular obstruction (in LVOT) with mean pressure gradient &gt;10mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be examined by standard echocardiography including a comprehensive assessment&#xD;
      of cavity and wall dimensions, ventricular and valvular function, morphologic appraisal and&#xD;
      pressure predictions. In particular, peak aortic jet velocity will be recorded using CW&#xD;
      Doppler from the window yielding the highest velocity signal. Aortic stenosis severity will&#xD;
      be measured using peak flow velocity (m/s). Progression will be expressed as peak flow&#xD;
      velocity change per year (m/s per year). Aortic valve sclerosis will be assessed visually&#xD;
      from a short axis according to Rosenhek: 1, no calcification; 2, mildly calcified (small&#xD;
      isolated spots); 3, moderately calcified (multiple larger spots); and 4, heavily calcified&#xD;
      (extensive thickening and calcification of all cusps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      T50-Test The addition of calcium and phosphate to serum triggers the formation of primary&#xD;
      calciprotein particles (CPP, see figures 2 and 3). As nano-suspension of calcium-phosphate,&#xD;
      these particles represent a defense mechanism of the serum against calcification. Primary&#xD;
      CPPs undergo spontaneous transition to secondary CPPs. The formation of these particles&#xD;
      represents calcification. In the T50-Test, the time elapsed for the transformation of 50% of&#xD;
      the particles is measured and is specific for individual sera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood-sample will be taken immediately after completion of the echocardiographic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study in patients with aortic sclerosis with and without stenosis is to&#xD;
      establish an independent predictor of progression of aortic valve obstruction using a new&#xD;
      calcification propensity measure in the serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment 200 consecutive patients referred for a routine clinical echocardiographic exam&#xD;
      showing varying degrees of aortic sclerosis will be included.&#xD;
