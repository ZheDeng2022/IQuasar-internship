  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with ADHD commonly report an improvement in behavioural symptoms when using&#xD;
      cannabis with some reporting a preference towards cannabis over their ADHD stimulant&#xD;
      medication. The EMA-C study aims to investigate the effects of a cannabis based medication,&#xD;
      Sativex Oromucosal Spray on behaviour and cognition in adults with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be carried out by conducting a placebo controlled trial. 30 adults with ADHD will&#xD;
      take Sativex or a dummy medication (a placebo) every day for 6 weeks. There is a 50% chance&#xD;
      of receiving the Sativex or Placebo. Measures of behaviour and cognition will be taken before&#xD;
      and after 6 weeks of treatment. We hypothesise that treatment with Sativex will result in&#xD;
      improvements in behaviour and cognition above that of the placebo group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study is open for both men and women aged 18-55 who meet DSM 5 criteria for ADHD&#xD;
             (N= 30). Subjects will be either unmedicated or medicated with stimulant medication&#xD;
             only and be willing to come of this medication for 1 week before and for the duration&#xD;
             of the study. To ensure that this does not disadvantage patients we will only include&#xD;
             those on stimulant medication who do not take medication on a regular basis and where&#xD;
             short periods of medication are not thought by both the patient and psychiatrist to&#xD;
             represent a clinical problem in the overall control of the symptoms and impairments.&#xD;
             For example, by including patients who are considering a &quot;stimulant drug holiday&quot;,&#xD;
             which is a common clinical procedure in ADHD. Subjects must not use other prescription&#xD;
             and non-prescription medication or recreational drugs during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria will include autism spectrum disorders and other psychiatric&#xD;
             disorders including recurrent major depression, bipolar I disorder, any psychotic&#xD;
             disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder and learning difficulties defined as an IQ&#xD;
             &lt; 70. Neurological problems and known or suspected history of a drug or alcohol&#xD;
             dependence disorder. Subjects who are using or have used cannabis or cannabis based&#xD;
             medications in the 30 day period prior to study entry. Concurrent history of renal,&#xD;
             hepatic, cardiovascular or convulsive disorders. Females who are pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding. Female subjects of child bearing potential and male subjects whose&#xD;
             partner is of child bearing potential, unless willing to ensure that they or their&#xD;
             partner use two effective forms of contraception, for example, oral contraception,&#xD;
             double barrier, intra-uterine device, during the study and for three months thereafter&#xD;
             (Note: a male condom should not be used in conjunction with a female condom).&#xD;
