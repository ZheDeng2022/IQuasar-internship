  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Massive cerebral infarction is an ischemic stroke caused by complete blockage of the internal&#xD;
      carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, or their cortical branches. The widespread&#xD;
      infarction, pathological severity and high fatality rate associated with massive cerebral&#xD;
      infarction pose a major threat to affected patients. However, there is a lack of unified&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria. Many researchers use Adams' classification, in which massive cerebral&#xD;
      infarction is diagnosed when the following criteria are met: infarct size &gt; 13 cm2; a major&#xD;
      brain-feeding artery is involved; the focal site affects more than two cerebral lobes;&#xD;
      infarct diameter line ≥ 3 cm in internal capsule of striatum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged cerebral ischemia/reperfusion can induce complex secondary changes in brain tissue,&#xD;
      so the use of neuroprotective agents is very important. Remarkable progress has been made&#xD;
      over the last decade in understanding the protective effect of calcium antagonists against&#xD;
      cerebral ischemia. In particular, the liposoluble dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist nimodipine&#xD;
      selectively acts on cerebral vessels and neurons and can protect ischemic brain tissue,&#xD;
      providing a new way of treating ischemic cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical tests have shown that nimodipine has a protective effect on ischemic&#xD;
      brain tissue, and indicate that patients should take the drug as soon as possible. However,&#xD;
      there are no reports of double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials addressing the&#xD;
      administration of nimodipine via intravenous drip within the time window for successful&#xD;
      treatment of acute massive cerebral infarction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the clinic, physicians are reluctant to use thrombolysis, Defibrase and anticoagulation&#xD;
      therapy because of the severity of symptoms, poor prognosis, risk of hemorrhage and high&#xD;
      fatality rate that occur with acute massive cerebral infarction. Nimodipine, as a selective&#xD;
      Ca2+ antagonist, is highly liposoluble, effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier,&#xD;
      selectively acts on intracranial blood vessels, and is an accepted neuroprotective agent that&#xD;
      can be applied in the clinic. The aim of the present study is to perform a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized and controlled trial of the clinical efficacy and safety of nimodipine&#xD;
      administered as an intravenous drip in the early stages of acute massive cerebral infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive nimodipine within 3 days of infarction onset. We will closely monitor&#xD;
      the following: (1) Blood pressure and heart rate of the patient before treatment, since&#xD;
      nimodipine is contraindicated in patients with hypotension and low heart rate. Where blood&#xD;
      pressure is ≥ 100/80 mmHg and heart rate ≥ 60 BPM, nimodipine will be administered. (2) Speed&#xD;
      of infusion. This should not be too fast; we suggest 1-2 drops per minute initially,&#xD;
      increasing gradually until the drop in systolic pressure exceeds 10 mmHg. The average drip&#xD;
      speed should be 6-8 drops/minute, and the fastest drip speed 10 drops/minute. (3) During the&#xD;
      infusion, physicians should monitor adverse reactions such as headache, dizziness, flushing&#xD;
      or sweating. If any occur, the infusion speed must be reduced. If the patients remain&#xD;
      uncomfortable, nimodipine should be withdrawn. (4) Liver and kidney function should be&#xD;
      monitored throughout nimodipine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although nimodipine is relatively safe, there is still a risk of some adverse effects, such&#xD;
      as cardiovascular system reactions (blood pressure decreases, bradycardia, angina, and&#xD;
      atrioventricular block), headache, dizziness, edema, and liver and kidney dysfunction. It is&#xD;
      necessary to determine the optimal therapeutic time window and dose of nimodipine in&#xD;
      multi-center, large-scale clinical trials.&#xD;
