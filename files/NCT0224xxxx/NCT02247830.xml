      It aims to evaluate the efficacy of the chamomile recutita gel and urea cream in the&#xD;
      prevention of radiodermatitis in patients with breast cancer or head and neck cancer&#xD;
      undergoing radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic Trial will consist of a control group and two experimental groups, namely&#xD;
      control group (usual care), Experimental Group 01 (usual care + topical application of the&#xD;
      gel C. recutita) and Experimental Group 02 (usual care + topical application of Urea based&#xD;
      cream).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses used in the different compounds are being in test since february 2014 by a&#xD;
      dose-response curve study, using 6 groups with three doses of urea cream and three doses of&#xD;
      C. recutita gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Center for High Complexity Oncology at University Hospital&#xD;
      of Brasília (CACON/HUB), Brazil. The degree of radiodermatitis is evaluated weekly, according&#xD;
      to established criteria to classify the effects of radiotherapy, which identifies grades 0,&#xD;
      1, 2 , 3 and 4, according to the score of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group - RTOG. To&#xD;
      evaluate the skin reaction will also be applied scale Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (CTCAE) and Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS).&#xD;

      It is considered that patients undergoing radiotherapy in use gel based on C. recutita or use&#xD;
      of cream based urea three times a day, concomitant radiotherapy, would present the following&#xD;
      hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Null: equal incidence and severity of radiodermatitis when compared to the control group&#xD;
           (usual care);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternative 1: low incidence and severity of radiodermatitis when compared to patients&#xD;
           who comprised the control group (usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternative 2: lower incidence and severity of radiodermatitis between the experimental&#xD;
           groups (urea and chamomile).&#xD;
