      Clinical evaluation of the Orsiro LESS in subjects requiring coronary revascularization with&#xD;
      Drug Eluting Stents (DES). Along with it, an explanatory (hypothesis-finding) problem will be&#xD;
      investigated, whether the patient's body inflammation status correlates with the clinical&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the majority of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) treatment with Percutaneous Transluminal&#xD;
      Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) provides high initial procedure success. However, the medium to&#xD;
      long-term complications range from rather immediate elastic coil or vessel contraction to&#xD;
      longer processes like smooth muscle cell proliferation and excessive production of extra&#xD;
      cellular matrix, thrombus formation and atherosclerotic changes like restenosis or&#xD;
      angiographic re-narrowing. The reported incidence of restenosis after PTCA ranges from 30 to&#xD;
      50%. Such rates of recurrence have serious economic consequences. Bare Metal Stents (BMS),&#xD;
      designed to address the limitations of PTCA, reduced the angiographic and clinical restenosis&#xD;
      rates in De Novo lesions compared to PTCA alone and decreased the need for CABG. BMS&#xD;
      substantially reduced the incidence of abrupt artery closure, but restenosis still occurred&#xD;
      in about 20 to 40% of cases, necessitating repeat procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invention of Drug Eluting Stents (DES) significantly improved on the principle of BMS by&#xD;
      adding an antiproliferative drug (directly immobilized on the stent surface or released from&#xD;
      a polymer matrix), which inhibits neointimal hyperplasia. The introduction of DES greatly&#xD;
      reduced the incidence of restenosis and resulted in better safety profile as compared to BMS&#xD;
      with systemic drug administration. These advantages and a lower cost compared to surgical&#xD;
      interventions has made DES an attractive option to treat coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this observational registry has been designed for the clinical evaluation of the&#xD;
      ORSIRO LESS requiring coronary revascularization with DES. It is designed to investigate and&#xD;
      collect clinical evidence for the clinical performance and safety of the Orsiro Drug Eluting&#xD;
      Stent System in an all-comers patient population in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with it, an explanatory (hypothesis-finding) problem will be investigated, whether the&#xD;
      patient's body inflammation status correlates with the clinical outcome.&#xD;
