      This study investigates the use of radiation to treat wet age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
      (AMD). The radiation is delivered using a robotically controlled device that projects&#xD;
      overlapping beams of radiation onto the macula, the part of the eye that is affected by wet&#xD;
      AMD. Participants will be randomized to receive radiation (stereotactic radiotherapy) or&#xD;
      simulated placebo treatment (sham control). They will be followed up regularly for two years,&#xD;
      and then again at the end of three and four years for a safety visit. Participants will also&#xD;
      receive injections of ranibizumab (Lucentis) into their eye if their wet AMD is active.&#xD;
      Ranibizumab is the standard anti-VEGF agent that is used to treat wet AMD. The study aims to&#xD;
      determine if stereotactic radiosurgery can maintain vision and reduce the need for such&#xD;
      regular anti-VEGF injections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) leads more people to go blind than all other eye&#xD;
      diseases combined. 'Wet' AMD occurs when abnormal new blood vessels grow into the macula. The&#xD;
      macula is an area inside the back of the eye, which is tightly packed with the&#xD;
      light-sensitive cells that give fine central vision for driving, reading, facial recognition&#xD;
      etc. Most patients are treated with repeated injections of ranibizumab (Lucentis),&#xD;
      bevacizumab (Avastin) , or aflibercept (Eylea) into the eye (these drugs suppresses the new&#xD;
      vessel growth). Unsurprisingly, the need for hospital visits every 1-2 months, and regular&#xD;
      injections into the eye, is not favoured by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study investigates the use of radiation to treat wet AMD. Radiation&#xD;
      preferentially damages proliferating cells, such as those forming the abnormal new blood&#xD;
      vessels. It has the potential to kill off the abnormal cells, unlike the injections which&#xD;
      just suppress the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiation is delivered using a robotically controlled device that aims three beams of&#xD;
      radiation in through the white of eye, to overlap at the macula. Initial studies of&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) were promising, and established the best dose of radiation.&#xD;
      They showed that radiation has the potential to significantly reduce the need for injections.&#xD;
      Each injection costs the National Health Service (NHS) approximately £600, hence the&#xD;
      potential cost savings are substantial. For those who respond well, disease activity is&#xD;
      reduced, and injections can be eliminated or greatly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye charities have run focus groups of people with wet AMD to help set priorities, and&#xD;
      participants identified the burden of treating wet AMD as one of their most pressing&#xD;
      concerns, as it greatly restricts their freedom and quality of life. Repeated injections also&#xD;
      carry risks of rare but blinding complications, and long term they may possibly lead to other&#xD;
      eye diseases such as glaucoma and atrophy of the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preliminary SRT studies were not designed to determine if the visual outcome was the&#xD;
      same, better, or worse than standard injection therapy, and follow up was too short to&#xD;
      determine long term risks. A larger study is therefore required to confirm that SRT reduces&#xD;
      the number of injections and to determine if the visual outcomes are acceptable. There is&#xD;
      also a need for longer term safety monitoring, as radiation damage typically has a delayed&#xD;
      onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAR will use ranibizumab as the anti-VEGF agent in both the treatment and control arms.&#xD;
      Ranibizumab was chosen over bevacizumab as it is licensed for use in the eye, and at present&#xD;
      bevacizumab is used in only a small minority of NHS hospitals, such that the results with&#xD;
      bevacizumab may be less generalisable. Bevacizumab may slow recruitment if prospective&#xD;
      participants are anxious about swapping to an off label treatment, and preliminary&#xD;
      discussions with prospective sites indicated some investigators would prefer to use&#xD;
      ranibizumab. Further, ranibizumab was used in the phase II INTREPID study (detailed below),&#xD;
      which helps inform the STAR statistical analysis. Aflibercept's mandated dosing in year 1&#xD;
      means it is not possible to determine if radiation reduces the need for anti-VEGF treatment,&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to dummy SRT (0 Gray dose) or live SRT (16 Gray).&#xD;
      Neither the treating doctor nor participant will know if a 0 or 16 Gray dose was given. SRT&#xD;
      will be performed in approximately 3 national treatment centres, but 25 NHS recruiting&#xD;
      hospitals will refer patients for SRT, and then review them afterwards, treating them with&#xD;
      ranibizumab as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend for examination monthly for two years. They will then revert to&#xD;
      standard NHS care, but with two further study visits - one at the end of year 3 and one at&#xD;
      the end of year 4. These two late safety visits are to exclude delayed radiation damage. At&#xD;
      the 24 monthly visits participants will have their vision tested on an eye chart, and a laser&#xD;
      scan (OCT) of their macula. If the vision drops or the OCT shows disease activity, then they&#xD;
      will receive an injection of ranibizumab. Participants will have imaging of the blood vessels&#xD;
      in the macula (angiography) at baseline and yearly thereafter for 4 years. The images will be&#xD;
      interpreted by an independent, specialist reading centre to quantify the effect of treatment,&#xD;
      to study the interaction of radiation and wet AMD, to look for subtle radiation damage, and&#xD;
      to subclassify disease to determine who responds best to SRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We predict that SRT will produce a similar, or possibly better vision than ranibizumab alone,&#xD;
      but with fewer injections. With 411 participants we will have 90% certainty that our results&#xD;
      are valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide feedback using established questionnaires about how acceptable they&#xD;
      found SRT, their visual function, and their overall quality of life. Experienced health&#xD;
      economists will then look at the cost of treatment in relation to any improvement in quality&#xD;
      of life, to see if SRT is cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcomes we will monitor are the number of eye injections and visual function on an&#xD;
      eye chart, but several other observations will be made. In particular, we will monitor the&#xD;
      safety of treatment, any collateral damage caused by radiation, and the interactions between&#xD;
      radiation and diseased eye tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If proven to be effective, SRT has the potential to save the NHS money, but more importantly,&#xD;
      it may reduce the burden of care faced by more than 250,000 people with wet AMD.&#xD;
