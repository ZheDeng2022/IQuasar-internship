    <textblock>
      This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-site study has been&#xD;
      designed to compare the safety and efficacy of a generic Fluticasone propionate Nasal Spray,&#xD;
      50 mcg (Teva Pharmaceuticals USA) to the FDA Reference Listed Drug, Flonase速 (fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate) 50 mcg nasal spray (GlaxoSmithKline), in the relief of the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis. Additionally, both the test and reference formulations will be&#xD;
      tested for superiority against a placebo nasal spray.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in average AM/PM reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) over days 1 to 14.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) is defined as the sum of the patient-rated severity scores for the following four allergy symptoms: Runny Nose, Nasal Congestion, Itchy Nose, and Sneezing. The severity score for each symptom will be based on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).&#xD;
The primary analysis for determining the therapeutic equivalence of the Test and Reference treatments will be based on each treatment's mean change from baseline for average rTNSS over the 2 week randomization treatment period.&#xD;
The Per-Protocol Population (PPP) will be used for the primary analysis of bioequivalence.</description>
