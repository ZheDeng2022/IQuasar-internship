  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with acute clots (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) the investigators&#xD;
      will collect real world data on their short and long term outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesise that in patients treated from the outset with rivaroxaban that: 1. treatment will&#xD;
      be non-inferior to treatment with conventional anticoagulants (heparins and warfarin); 2.&#xD;
      there will be less bleeding than when patients are on conventional anticoagulants; 3. there&#xD;
      will be a lower long-term incidence of morbidity from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and post-thrombotic limb syndrome.&#xD;

      United Kingdom-only prospective, non-interventional, investigator-led, multi-centre, single&#xD;
      cohort, registry. The observation period for each patient covers the treatment period with&#xD;
      rivaroxaban and follow up until study end. For each patient, the treating health care&#xD;
      professional records patient demographics, medical history, signs and symptoms, diagnosis,&#xD;
      treatment and safety parameters at an initial visit and subsequent follow-up visit(s). Data&#xD;
      monitoring will be undertaken by the Sponsor.&#xD;
