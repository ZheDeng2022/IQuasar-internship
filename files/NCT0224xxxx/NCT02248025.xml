  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid responsiveness in a context of circulatory failure can be assessed by different way.&#xD;
      Microcirculatory evaluation to assess fluid responsiveness could be interesting, but the&#xD;
      available device are expensive and the analysis are delayed. Capillary refill time (CRT) is&#xD;
      hampered by its variability. The investigators have developed a method to standardize the&#xD;
      pressure, the length of compression and a computerized analysis to calculate the capillary&#xD;
      refill time. This method enables accurate measure of CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study if CRT variation induced by a passive leg raising (PLR) can&#xD;
      predict CRT after a 500 ml Fluid Load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About thirty patients in circulatory failure with a continuous cardiac output monitoring for&#xD;
      whom, the attending physician has decided a fluid load, will be included. hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters (arterial pressure, venous pressure, cardiac output), metabolic parameters&#xD;
      (arterial and venous blood gas and lactate), microcirculatory parameters (assessed by&#xD;
      sublingual video-microscopy) and capillary refill time measured on the thorax and on the&#xD;
      gingival area will be recorded. Data collection will be made before and after a passive leg&#xD;
      raising and after a 500 ml fluid load of crystalloids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be aposteriori sorted in two groups: responders and non responders, defined by&#xD;
      the reduction of CRT after the fluid load. The diagnosis ability of the CRT variation after&#xD;
      PLR to predict in which group each patient is classified will be investigate and receiver&#xD;
      operative characteristic curve will be built. These results will be compared to the metabolic&#xD;
      response, the macrocirculatory response, and the microcirculatory response.&#xD;
