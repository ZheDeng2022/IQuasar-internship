      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind (to subjects and&#xD;
      examiners), two-arm (ExAblate treated arm vs ExAblate Sham treated control arm) feasibility&#xD;
      study. All treated subjects will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected to establish the basic safety and clinical efficacy of this type of&#xD;
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate the full clinical efficacy.&#xD;

Primary efficacy will be evaluated using basic summary statistics including comparison of between- and within-group differences in the mean change (from baseline to 4 months) of the motor MDS-UPDRS Part III score for the side contralateral to subthalamotomy in the off-medication condition.</description>
