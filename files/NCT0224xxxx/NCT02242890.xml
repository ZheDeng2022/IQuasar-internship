  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two goals: 1) to test an approach to helping women who use intrauterine&#xD;
      contraception (IUC) spread the word about this type of long-lasting, highly effective birth&#xD;
      control method among their friends and family and; 2) to test ways of getting in touch with&#xD;
      these women's friends and family so that investigators can track whether this approach is&#xD;
      effective at spreading birth control information through social groups.&#xD;

      Pilot of peer IUC intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a low-cost intervention&#xD;
      implemented at a clinic providing family planning care. The intervention was first piloted in&#xD;
      the an earlier phase of this study (ClincalTrials.gov ID: NCT01965743) which is currently in&#xD;
      the analysis phase. Based off of participant feedback from this first pilot, investigators&#xD;
      have revised and optimized the intervention which investigators will be testing again here at&#xD;
      a new clinic and with a new population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New IUC users as well as experienced IUC users will be recruited as &quot;dissemination agents&quot; to&#xD;
      provide information about the option of IUC to their peers. Ten to sixteen IUC users will be&#xD;
      recruited from a family planning clinic to receive the intervention.The intervention which&#xD;
      will be delivered by a clinic staff member to new or existing IUC users includes handing her&#xD;
      a packet of pamphlets, encouraging her to sign up for a series of SMS messages, and informing&#xD;
      her about the intervention's website. The content on the intervention across all media forms&#xD;
      consists of a brief education about IUC and development of interpersonal skills for IUC&#xD;
      users, including how to initiate conversations about reproductive health issues and their&#xD;
      personal experience with IUC in social settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct baseline and 3 month quantitative surveys as well as 3-month&#xD;
      qualitative interviews of dissemination agents to asses the feasibility and impact of the&#xD;
      intervention on IUC knowledge, attitudes and social communication practices. As described in&#xD;
      more detail below, investigators will also enroll the social contacts of dissemination agents&#xD;
      to measure the effect of the intervention on their IUC knowledge and attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of dissemination agent enrollment and intervention implementation in&#xD;
      clinic, investigators will also conduct a focus group with clinic staff about the feasibility&#xD;
      of implementing the intervention in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test of snowball sampling for social network analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The social contacts of dissemination agents will be recruited via one of two snowball&#xD;
      sampling methods: baseline or follow up recruitment methods. Dissemination agents will be&#xD;
      randomized into each recruitment arm. In both recruitment arms, dissemination agents will&#xD;
      list at baseline and at 3 month follow up their female social contacts between the ages of&#xD;
      15-45 with whom they feel comfortable talking about birth control with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the baseline recruitment arm, the dissemination agents within the first 2 weeks of being&#xD;
      enrolled will ask their listed social contacts if they are interested in joining a study&#xD;
      about birth control and for permission for the dissemination agent to share their contact&#xD;
      info with the study staff. Study staff will then reach out to the social contacts whom have&#xD;
      shared their contact information with us to ask if they would like to enroll in the study.&#xD;
      Social contacts who choose to enroll will complete a baseline survey as well as another&#xD;
      follow up survey 3 months from when their respective dissemination agent enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the follow up recruitment arm, dissemination agents at 3 months from their enrollment will&#xD;
      recruit in the same manner as the baseline arm their social contacts. They will be asked to&#xD;
      recruit all social contacts listed at baseline and any additional ones added at 3 months.&#xD;
      Social contacts who enroll will complete 1 survey at the time of their enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, dissemination agents will receive a small &quot;finder's fee&quot; for each social&#xD;
      contact with whom the study is able to make contact with and confirms that she gave the&#xD;
      dissemination agent permission to share her contact info.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will assess which recruitment method is most effective at enrolling members of&#xD;
      the dissemination agents' social network and whether social contacts in the baseline arm had&#xD;
      more conversations about IUC with their dissemination agents between baseline and follow up&#xD;
      due to the presence of recruitment conversations happening concurrently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomly selected sub-set of social contacts in both arms will be selected to complete a&#xD;
      more detailed qualitative interview after quantitative data collection is complete. To&#xD;
      minimize any potential Hawthorne effect, social contacts will initially be blinded as to the&#xD;
      specific aims being assessed, and will be debriefed at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will provide the data necessary to prepare for a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      of this intervention.&#xD;
