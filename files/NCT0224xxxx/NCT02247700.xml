  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory disorders are the leading cause of respiratory failure in children. Thousands of&#xD;
      children are admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit each year and placed on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilators. Despite over 40 years since the first pediatric-specific ventilator was&#xD;
      designed, there has been no specific cardiopulmonary directed therapy that has proven&#xD;
      superior. While mechanical ventilation is generally lifesaving, it can be associated with&#xD;
      adverse events. There is evidence building to suggest that adopting a lung protective&#xD;
      ventilation strategy by the avoidance of lung over-distension and collapse reduces death.&#xD;
      Therefore, timely discovery of these two lung conditions is extremely important in order to&#xD;
      mitigate the effects associated with positive pressure mechanical ventilation. The&#xD;
      investigators research team has extensive research experience with a non-invasive and&#xD;
      radiation free medical device called electrical impendence tomography (EIT). EIT is intended&#xD;
      to generate regional information of changes in ventilation. Meaning it can detect this&#xD;
      collapse and overdistension. This additional source of information could help fine tune the&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator. A baseline of understanding of how often this occurs in the patients&#xD;
      the investigators serve is required. Therefore the investigators propose an EIT observation&#xD;
      study in their pediatric ICU patient population.&#xD;

      A. Specific Aims/Objectives Specific Aim 1: To determine regional compliance and distribution&#xD;
      of ventilation in a cohort of children requiring mechanical ventilation. Hypothesis -&#xD;
      Abnormal distribution of ventilation will be discovered in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine changes in regional distribution of ventilation over the course&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation therapy. Hypothesis - Distribution of regional ventilation will&#xD;
      change significantly as the patient's lung function improves and as they progress towards&#xD;
      liberation from mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To compare previously developed EIT guided ventilation algorithms by BCH&#xD;
      research team with medical team decisions regarding mechanical ventilation. Hypothesis - EIT&#xD;
      guided ventilation algorithms will identify changes to minimize atelectasis and&#xD;
      overdistension sooner than clinical team decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance Clinical decisions regarding the mechanical ventilator rely&#xD;
      heavily on clinical judgment typically based on intermittent and subjective assessments of&#xD;
      relevant physiologic parameters which only reflect global lung function and without&#xD;
      consideration for regional distribution of ventilation. Until recently there has not been a&#xD;
      way to determine regional distribution of ventilation without exposing a patient to radiation&#xD;
      in the form of a chest radiograph (CXR) or computer aided tomography (CT). CT and CXR provide&#xD;
      regionally specific information but only as a snapshot in time. Determining how different&#xD;
      regions of the lung respond to therapeutic interventions over time is challenging. However,&#xD;
      our research team has extensive research experience with a non-invasive and radiation free&#xD;
      medical imaging technology called electrical impendence tomography (EIT). EIT provides&#xD;
      regional information of changes in ventilation. This additional source of information could&#xD;
      help optimize mechanical ventilation by providing bedside clinicians with continuous decision&#xD;
      support as the EIT data may be utilized to alert when regional collapse or over-distension is&#xD;
      detected. However, there is little data describing changes in distribution of ventilation&#xD;
      over time or as the patient's condition changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) Barber and Brown introduced electrical impedance&#xD;
      tomography to the medical community in the early 1980s. From there a wide spectrum of&#xD;
      applications in medicine ranging from gastric emptying, brain function, breast imaging, to&#xD;
      lung function have been explored. It is our belief that the most valuable benefit of EIT is&#xD;
      in the monitoring of regional lung function in critically ill patients. Early EIT devices&#xD;
      fell susceptible to poor sensitivity and signal interference in the clinical setting. After&#xD;
      years and a renewed interest from a few commercial companies interested in ventilation&#xD;
      technology, many of these shortcomings have been resolved. As with any new modality, EIT and&#xD;
      its clinical utility and application need to be methodically explored; therefore we propose&#xD;
      this IRB protocol to take us a step closer on this journey to develop a clinically useful&#xD;
      tool9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical impedance tomography capitalizes on changes in electrical impendence between&#xD;
      air-filled versus tissue or fluid-filled spaces in order to characterize and quantify&#xD;
      regional distribution of lung volume at the bedside. This technology has been validated in&#xD;
      animal10 and human11, 12 studies. The technology utilizes a series of 16 electrodes placed&#xD;
      across the patient's chest. As small currents, which are undetectable to the subject, are&#xD;
      passed between the electrodes, impedance is measured between and amongst the series. Through&#xD;
      a complex interrogation and manipulation of these impedance values, a two-dimensional image&#xD;
      is formed, and has been shown to correlate with clinical and radiographic changes in&#xD;
      patients.11 The ability to estimate lung volume and regional distribution of gas&#xD;
      non-invasively and in real time may give us insight as to what mode of ventilation or setting&#xD;
      is more effective in optimizing positive pressure ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have chosen to partner with Draeger Medical (Lubeck, Germany) through a CTA to explore the&#xD;
      use of their commercially available product in Europe (not FDA cleared), through European&#xD;
      Directive 93/42/EEC (medical devices) and meets the EN ISO 9001 and EN ISO 13485&#xD;
      requirements. Boston Children's Hospital has extensive experience with their prototype system&#xD;
      that led to the final product named PulmoVista 500. The PulmoVista 500 uses 16 electrodes to&#xD;
      measure the voltages utilized for image reconstruction. Mathematical simulations based on&#xD;
      this electrode arrangement demonstrate a spatial resolution of 15% of the thoracic diameter;&#xD;
      however the resolution decreases to 20% towards the center of the body. While CT scanners&#xD;
      typically provide images consisting of 512 x 512 or higher pixels, EIT images from the&#xD;
      PulmoVista 500 only consist of 32 x 32 pixels, which are 256 times less pixels when compared&#xD;
      to CT images9. However, our team intends to use EIT at the bedside and within the ICU&#xD;
      environment to guide ventilation therapy in the future rather than be a high-resolution&#xD;
      diagnostic tool such as CT or MRI. Our intent is not to replace CT or MRI imaging of the&#xD;
      lung, but develop a bedside tool to guide ventilation in the future that can be applied&#xD;
      continuously and with very few risks. The characterization of a cohort of critically ill&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated children, as proposed in this protocol represents an important step&#xD;
      towards clinical utility of EIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Preliminary Studies Current strategies to provide lung protective ventilation rely on&#xD;
      avoiding conditions associated with lung injury. There is growing interest in development of&#xD;
      individualized mechanical ventilation treatment plans. The use of EIT has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to be an accurate method of monitoring regional lung volume changes in animals and humans.10,&#xD;
      13, 14 While radiological and EIT images both provide information about the regional&#xD;
      distribution of air in the lungs the image characteristics provided by these modalities are&#xD;
      quite different. Radiological images of the lung provide information on the air content and&#xD;
      reflect, depending on the moment the images were taken, the endinspiratory, the&#xD;
      end-expiratory status or a lung condition somewhere in between. EIT images reflect the lung&#xD;
      function, not the lung itself, which means EIT displays ventilated lung regions rather than&#xD;
      morphological or anatomical structures of the lung.9 Nonetheless, the regional information&#xD;
      contained in EIT and CT images is closely related to each other when pathological conditions&#xD;
      such as pleural effusion or atelectasis lead to non-aerated and non-ventilated lung regions.&#xD;
      While CT images display lungs regions with trapped air (e.g. pneumothorax) in black because&#xD;
      of the large air content, EIT also displays those regions in black because they are not&#xD;
      ventilated.15, 16 Conversely a CT image may indicate a region of consolidated lung tissue in&#xD;
      a white color because of the high fluid content, while this region might be displayed in the&#xD;
      EIT image in black or dark blue color, if this region is not or only partially ventilated.17&#xD;
      EIT has been proven in animal models and human case reports to be accurate determinant of&#xD;
      pneumothoraces.15, 18, 19 More recently, EIT-derived parameters have been used to&#xD;
      differentiate atelectatic, overdistened, and adequately recruited lung in different lung&#xD;
      regions by a number of investigators.10, 20-28 Despite the ability of EIT to monitor regional&#xD;
      lung behavior, the use of EIT derived indices has not been shown to improve outcomes in&#xD;
      animals or humans with acute lung injury until last year when Drs. Wolf, Arnold and&#xD;
      colleagues developed an EIT guided mechanical ventilation strategy that demonstrated promise&#xD;
      in an animal model.29 Through this translational model they were able to demonstrate that EIT&#xD;
      guided ventilation was superior to a national and standardized ventilation protocol called&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network (ARDSNet) Ventilator Protocol.30-33 The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to survey regional distribution in pediatric patients who require mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Design and Methods (1) Study Design In a prospective observational trial we will&#xD;
      objectively measure regional compliance and distribution of ventilation by EIT in patients&#xD;
      who require mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Description of Study Treatments or Exposures/Predictors Following attending approval and&#xD;
      informed consent, patients who meet inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will (1) transition to the exact same setting on the FDA approved Draeger V500 ventilator.&#xD;
      (2) A clinical assessment by the responsible respiratory therapist and nurse will be&#xD;
      conducted to ensure the transitioned settings are appropriate and according to the standard&#xD;
      of practice. (3) The PulmoVista 500 EIT device will be set-up and safety checked according to&#xD;
      provided training and operating manual. (4) The provided electrode system will be placed&#xD;
      around the patient's chest as in figure 2. (5) The EIT system will be connected to the&#xD;
      electrodes array and the V500 ventilator. (6) Once signal quality is determined to be&#xD;
      appropriate, a recording will be performed and saved securely. (7) The EIT belt and device&#xD;
      will be removed and returned to storage and the V500 ventilator will remain on the patient&#xD;
      for the ventilator course. The initial set-up and monitoring time commitment is approximately&#xD;
      1 hour. (8) Repeat recordings will be performed each morning for the first 5 days, then every&#xD;
      other day if &gt; 5 days of mechanical ventilation is required and within 2 hours following&#xD;
      major interventions such as prone positioning, increasing or decrease of PEEP or MAP of 2&#xD;
      cmH2O or more, recruitment maneuvers, intubation (if on non-invasive ventilation), and prior&#xD;
      to and following extubation. Follow-up monitoring events will be approximately 30 minutes. No&#xD;
      set-up or monitoring session will be done without the approval of the bedside nurse and&#xD;
      respiratory therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment exposures modification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transition of the patient to the Draeger V500 Ventilator will not occur in the following&#xD;
      situations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who are deemed too unstable by the research in collaboration with the medical&#xD;
           team to transition to the V500, yet are stable enough to apply the EIT belt will be&#xD;
           studied without the Draeger V500 ventilator. Manual recording of the ventilator settings&#xD;
           and measurements will be conducted instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients enrolled who are receiving non-invasive ventilation. (5) Data Collection&#xD;
           Methods, Assessments, Interventions and Schedule (what assessments performed, how often)&#xD;
           Data will be collected from several sources. Initial evaluation will be performed within&#xD;
           48 hours of initiation of mechanical ventilation. Vital signs, latest blood gas, CXR&#xD;
           report, ventilator settings, pulmonary mechanic and EIT images will be recorded. Vital&#xD;
           signs will be gathered from T3. Blood gas will be captured from Powerchart. Pulmonary&#xD;
           mechanics and EIT images will be obtained from the PulmoVista 500 system. The PulmoVista&#xD;
           will obtain the ventilator settings and pulmonary mechanics via a connection to the&#xD;
           Draeger V500 ventilator. A manual flowsheet (paper) of findings will be recorded and&#xD;
           compared to the electronic files. Once verified, the manual flowsheet will be properly&#xD;
           disposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pulmovista 500 system trends not only regional distribution of ventilation, but&#xD;
      clinically useful and currently recorded information such as dynamic compliance, resistance,&#xD;
      and ventilator settings. While the research team will not guide ventilation at this time from&#xD;
      EIT images/data, the trending data summarized daily maybe useful. Parents will not be&#xD;
      excluded from see the images if they desire. However, no data will be shared unless requested&#xD;
      by the team. EIT images or data will not be used for routine clinical care or interventions,&#xD;
      unless there is safety concern in which the team will be immediately notified and asked to&#xD;
      clinically assess. Please see Risk/Benefit section of the online CHeRP protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (6) Study Timeline (as applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial set-up and recording will conducted as soon as possible following initiation of&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation. Total set-up and recording is anticipated to take 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Routine subsequent recordings will be conducted every morning for the first 5 days of&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation; then every other day until liberation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interventional recordings will be conducted within 2 hours following changes of 2 cmH2O&#xD;
           or more in PEEP or MAP, prone positioning, intubation, extubation, or modes of&#xD;
           ventilation (inclusive of ECMO or HFV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Adverse Event Criteria and Reporting Procedures The following complications will be&#xD;
      monitored for during the imagining process which include study timelines 1-3 above and major&#xD;
      complications will be immediately reported to the IRB. Minor events include: skin irritation&#xD;
      that continues for &gt; than 1 hour after the belt is removed, increase in respiratory rate by &gt;&#xD;
      20%, temporal hypoventilation determined by an increase in ETCO2 by 10 mmHg, temporal&#xD;
      increase in FIO2 of &gt; 0.3, and temporal hypoxia determined by an desaturation (&lt;88%) for&#xD;
      greater than 1 minute. Minor events that occur more than 3 times will be reported to the IRB&#xD;
      with a plan of action of how to avoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major events that will halt the study and be immediately reported to the IRB are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Desaturation &lt; 80% (continuously monitored by pulse oximetry) for longer than 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bradycardia &lt; 60 BPM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in lung compliance determined to be associated with the belt. All adverse&#xD;
           events will be reviewed by the entire research team weekly and a detailed case report&#xD;
           will be developed. If major or minor events occurring more than 3 times, the study will&#xD;
           not continue until the research team and IRB feel as though it is safe to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Data Management Methods Upon entry, each patient will be assigned a number unique and&#xD;
      unlinked from their medical record for the purpose of patient tracking. This number will be&#xD;
      entered into a privately owned BCH, password protected research database (RedCap) accessible&#xD;
      only by BCH study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A spreadsheet will be kept at the bedside during the data collection periods for each data&#xD;
      point to be entered manually. This spreadsheet will be destroyed once the electric and manual&#xD;
      data have been verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Quality Control Method Quality of the transfer of data will be ensured by a second&#xD;
      investigator, who will confirm the manual and electronic data. RedCap and SPSS software will&#xD;
      be used to help analyze the data and ensuring data integrity by establishing alerts for&#xD;
      non-filled fields as well as unexpected or possibly misentered results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Data Analysis Plan EIT data: The lung imaging system is the Dräger PulmoVista 500 (Dräger&#xD;
      Medical, Lübeck, Germany). Sixteen coplanar electrodes will be placed equidistantly around&#xD;
      the thorax at the level of the parasternal sixth intercostal space. The reference electrode&#xD;
      will be placed on the right side of the abdomen near the waistline. Electrodes #1 and #16 are&#xD;
      symmetrically placed to the left and the right of the sternum, respectively, so that&#xD;
      electrodes #8 and #9 straddled the spinal column. This configuration leads to transverse&#xD;
      images in the radiological convention, caudal to cranial, similar to a cat scan. Lung image&#xD;
      reconstruction will be done according to the Graz consensus for electrical impedance&#xD;
      tomography (GREIT)34 using the Electrical Impedance and Diffuse Optical Reconstruction&#xD;
      Software.35 Each subjects' data will be filtered and images will be reconstructed using the&#xD;
      aforementioned open source software platform. Each reconstructed lung image will then be&#xD;
      segmented in to regions of interest and changes in impedance for each region will be&#xD;
      transcribed. The procedure will be repeated for each of the individual subjects EIT&#xD;
      recordings. Furthermore, we will employ, in an observational manner only, an algorithm which&#xD;
      was developed by the current research group in order to identify when changes in lung&#xD;
      mechanics are likely to reflect overdistention or collapse of lung.20 These discrete points,&#xD;
      and the mechanical ventilator settings upon which they were collected will be transcribed and&#xD;
      compared to the standard of care per unit practice. Impedance changes indicate how open or&#xD;
      closed the lung is. This approach has been previously described in detail by our research&#xD;
      group.20 I. Statistical Power and Sample Considerations Age Categories&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- &lt; 6 months 6 months - &lt; 1 year 1-7 years 8-14 years &gt; 14 years This is a pilot&#xD;
      observational study of mechanically ventilated children within our pediatric ICUs. We have&#xD;
      proposed a target of 50 patients within two years. We anticipate a 10% dropout rate. Our goal&#xD;
      would be to obtain 5-7 patients for each age category below. Since our experience and the&#xD;
      preliminary data within this field is in severe lung injury and the fact that we wish to&#xD;
      explore a heterogeneous mechanically ventilated patients, we have not been able to accurately&#xD;
      determine a sample size and have therefore determined this to be a pilot study. Preference&#xD;
      will be given to low volume lung disease patients such as but not limited to ARDS, CDH,&#xD;
      hypoxic respiratory failure, patients transferred for possible ECMO, and asthmatics.&#xD;
