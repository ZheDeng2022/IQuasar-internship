    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first administration of BI 836858 to start of the third administration of BI 836858, excluding the day of the third administration of BI 836858, up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is defined as the highest dose of BI 836858 with less than 25% risk of the true dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate being above 33% during the MTD evaluation period. MTD determination will be based on a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control.&#xD;
For any dose-escalation cohort, at least 3 patients (pts) will be required. However, in the case that only 2 pts are evaluable and neither has experienced a DLT within the first cycle (2 administrations - 28 days), then dose-escalation can occur based on these 2 pts. After all pts in a cohort have either experienced a DLT or have been observed for at least one cycle (2 administrations - 28 days) without experiencing a DLT, the Bayesian model will be updated with the newly accumulated data.&#xD;
The MTD may be considered reached if either the posterior probability of the true DLT rate in the target interval (16%-33%) is above 50%, or at least 12 pts have been treated at MTD, including the two expansion cohorts.</description>

        <description>The MTD is defined as the highest dose of BI 836858 with less than 25% risk of the true dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate being above 33% during the MTD evaluation period. MTD determination will be based on a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control.&#xD;
For any dose-escalation cohort, at least 3 patients (pts) will be required. However, in the case that only 2 pts are evaluable and neither has experienced a DLT within the first cycle (2 administrations - 28 days), then dose-escalation can occur based on these 2 pts. After all pts in a cohort have either experienced a DLT or have been observed for at least one cycle (2 administrations - 28 days) without experiencing a DLT, the Bayesian model will be updated with the newly accumulated data.&#xD;
The MTD may be considered reached if either the posterior probability of the true DLT rate in the target interval (16%-33%) is above 50%, or at least 12 pts have been treated at MTD, including the two expansion cohorts.</description>

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence and platelet transfusion independence will be evaluated in patients who are transfusion dependent at baseline. Percentages will be calculated using all treated patients as the denominator.&#xD;
A patient is considered transfusion independent at baseline if the patient has had no transfusions during the 56 days prior to and including the first day of treatment. Otherwise, the patient is considered to be transfusion dependent.&#xD;
A patient is considered transfusion independent if the patient has had no transfusions over the course of ≥ 56 consecutive days.</description>

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence and platelet transfusion independence will be evaluated in patients who are transfusion dependent at baseline. Percentages will be calculated using all treated patients as the denominator.&#xD;
A patient is considered transfusion independent at baseline if the patient has had no transfusions during the 56 days prior to and including the first day of treatment. Otherwise, the patient is considered to be transfusion dependent.&#xD;
A patient is considered transfusion independent if the patient has had no transfusions over the course of ≥ 56 consecutive days.</description>

Erythroid response (HI-E): Patients with a pretreatment hemoglobin &lt;11 grams per deciliters (g/dL) demonstrate erythroid response if their hemoglobin increases by ≥1.5 g/dL for at least eight weeks, and there is a reduction in the units of red cell transfusions by an absolute number of at least four red cell transfusions per eight weeks compared with the pretreatment transfusion number in the previous eight weeks. Only red cell transfusions given for a hemoglobin ≤9 g/dL pretreatment will count in the red cell transfusion response evaluation.</description>
          <population>Treated set (TS): The TS included all patients who had been enrolled and treated with at least 1 dose of study drug. The treated set was used for safety analyses.</population>

Overall Objective Response is defined as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), HI-N, HI-P, or HI-E. A patient's &quot; Overall Objective Response &quot; = &quot;Yes&quot; if one of these responses was reported at least once throughout the trial.&#xD;
CR defined as: -Bone marrow: &lt;5 % blasts with normal maturation of all cell lines (Dysplastic changes should consider the normal range of dysplastic changes), persistent dysplasia will be noted; -Peripheral blood: Hgb &gt; 11 grams per deciliters (g/dL), Platelets &gt;100 x 109/liters (L), Neutrophils &gt; 1.0 x 109/L, Blasts 0 % PR defined as: -All CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except: Bone marrow blasts decreased by &gt;50 % to pre-treatment but still &gt;5 %, Cellularity and morphology not relevant.&#xD;

          <description>Number of patients with overall Objective Response (OR) [Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Hematologic Improvement (HI)] is presented.&#xD;
Overall Objective Response is defined as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), HI-N, HI-P, or HI-E. A patient's &quot; Overall Objective Response &quot; = &quot;Yes&quot; if one of these responses was reported at least once throughout the trial.&#xD;
CR defined as: -Bone marrow: &lt;5 % blasts with normal maturation of all cell lines (Dysplastic changes should consider the normal range of dysplastic changes), persistent dysplasia will be noted; -Peripheral blood: Hgb &gt; 11 grams per deciliters (g/dL), Platelets &gt;100 x 109/liters (L), Neutrophils &gt; 1.0 x 109/L, Blasts 0 % PR defined as: -All CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except: Bone marrow blasts decreased by &gt;50 % to pre-treatment but still &gt;5 %, Cellularity and morphology not relevant.&#xD;
