    <textblock>
      Purposes are to determine whether various cohorts of bladder cancer patients have detectable&#xD;
      tCTC's, determine it tCTC levels vary with the natural history of bladder cancer and to see&#xD;
      if tCTC's provide novel information.Study population are various cohorts of patients&#xD;
      diangosed with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.Procedures include a venous blood draw, up&#xD;
      to two times, over a 6 month period for collection of tCTC's. Up to 15 mL's of blood will be&#xD;
      collected at each blood draw.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a.Urothelial carcinoma or mixed urothelial carcinoma arising from the bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  b.Age 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusions by cohort Cohort 1. Patients with localized muscle-invasive disease&#xD;
             (cT1,cN0, M0) at the time of initial diagnosis or who have progressed from superficial&#xD;
             disease (cT2) who have not had any systemic chemotherapy and who will be treated with&#xD;
             upfront radical cystectomy. PriorTURBT and intravesical therapies are allowed but&#xD;
             should not have been done within one week of CTC measurement. If the patient is found&#xD;
             to have no evidence of tumor (pT0) upon evaluation of the cystectomy specimen, the&#xD;
             patient will not be dropped. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression&#xD;
             by any clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the&#xD;
             patient will be dropped from Cohort 1 and included in Cohort 9 instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2. Patients with localized muscle-invasive disease (cT1, cN0, M0) at the time&#xD;
             of initial diagnosis prior to definitivechemo-radiation. Prior TURBT and intravesical&#xD;
             therapies are allowed but should not have been done within one week of CTC&#xD;
             measurement. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression by anyclinical&#xD;
             evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the patient will be&#xD;
             droppedfrom Cohort 2 and included in Cohort 9 instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 3. Patients with localized muscle-invasive disease (cT1, cN0, M0) at the time&#xD;
             of initial diagnosis or who have progressed from superficial disease (cT2) who have&#xD;
             not had any systemic chemotherapy and who will be treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy. Prior TURBT and intravesical therapies are allowed but should not have&#xD;
             been done within one week of CTC measurement. If the patient is found to have evidence&#xD;
             of progression by any clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the&#xD;
             post-treatment sample, the patient will be dropped from Cohort 3 and included in&#xD;
             Cohort 9 instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 4. Patients with metastatic disease (anyT, anyN, M1) at initial presentation or&#xD;
             recurrent after definitive treatment prior to any salvage systemic chemotherapy. If&#xD;
             the patient is found to have evidence of progression by any clinical evaluation&#xD;
             performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the patient will be dropped&#xD;
             from Cohort 4 and included in Cohort 9 instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 5. Patients with newly diagnosed non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T2) prior&#xD;
             to any intravesical therapy. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression&#xD;
             by any clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the&#xD;
             patient will be dropped.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 6. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy with&#xD;
             or without peri-operative systemic chemotherapy (pT2, anyN, M0) who will be treated&#xD;
             with adjuvant radiation. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression by&#xD;
             any clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the&#xD;
             patient will be dropped from Cohort 6 and includedin Cohort 9 instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 7. Patients with a history of muscle invasive bladder cancer (cT1, any N,M0)&#xD;
             who have no evidence of disease at least 2 years after the date of radical cystectomy.&#xD;
             If the patient is found to have evidence of progression by any clinical evaluation&#xD;
             performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the patient will be dropped&#xD;
             from Cohort 7 but may be considered for inclusion in Cohort 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 8. Patients with a history of muscle invasive bladder cancer (cT1, any N, M0)&#xD;
             who have no evidence of disease at least 2 years after the completion of definitive&#xD;
             chemo-radiation. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression by any&#xD;
             clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the&#xD;
             patient will be dropped from Cohort 8 but may be considered for inclusion in Cohort 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 9. Patients who were initially included in Cohorts 1-6 but were found to have&#xD;
             progression at the time of their post-treatment blood draw. Of note, patients may be&#xD;
             included in more than one cohort over time so long as inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
             are met. In addition, twenty samples from normal controls without any history of&#xD;
             malignancy will be used for this study but havealready been collected as part of a&#xD;
             separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pure squamous or pure adenocarcinoma bladder cancer histology. This exclusion may be&#xD;
             waved at the discretion of the protocol PI. 2. Prior cancer diagnosed within 3 years&#xD;
             of enrollment other than a prior bladder, prostate, or skin cancer. This exclusion may&#xD;
