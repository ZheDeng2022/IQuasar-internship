      Background: Inappropriate use of antibiotics is one of the main causes for the increase of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance strains. In Denmark general practice accounts for 90% of all prescribed&#xD;
      antibiotics and one of the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics is the suspicion&#xD;
      of a urinary tract infection (UTI). The use of point-of-care test is meant to decrease the&#xD;
      uncertainty about the bacterial origin of the symptoms; however, there is a paucity of&#xD;
      knowledge about the validity of the different diagnostic approaches, thus impacting on the&#xD;
      proper use of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the diagnostic validity of different diagnostic approaches in patients&#xD;
      with a suspected urinary tract infection and assess the impact on appropriate use of&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 70 practices at the capital region will consecutively include 15-20 patients. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria of the patients comprise: a) Suspected Urinary tract infection, b) &gt; 18&#xD;
      years of age, c) patient consulting during office hours. Data at patient and GP level will be&#xD;
      gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      16 diagnostic approaches will be compared and proper use of antibiotics will be assessed as a&#xD;
      two-step process. The first step is the decision made during the consultation and the second&#xD;
      step is the decision made after the consultation. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive&#xD;
      values will be measure for each diagnostic approach using urine culture as a gold standard.&#xD;
      The impact on proper use of antibiotics will be assessed in a hierarchical multivariable&#xD;
      logistic model.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest report from the Staten Serum Institute (SSI)1 showed that primary health care in&#xD;
      Denmark represents 90% of all prescribed defined daily dose(DDD) of antibiotics, and that a&#xD;
      growing consumption of antibiotics is running alongside increasing resistance to E. coli,&#xD;
      specifically ESBL-producing E. coli (Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase Producing E. coli) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cause of E. coli infection at primary care level is a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)&#xD;
      which is one of the most frequent reasons for consultation in general practice in Denmark.&#xD;
      Interestingly, there is no consensus yet about the most effective diagnostic approach to&#xD;
      identify those patients that will benefit from antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently in Denmark, a wide variety of diagnostic approaches can be identified in primary&#xD;
      care settings (i.e. only history taking, dipsticks, microscopy, culture and susceptibility&#xD;
      testing in practice). Nonetheless, there is not conclusive evidence yet about the diagnostic&#xD;
      validity of all these approaches and the association with appropriate prescription of&#xD;
      antibiotics(i.e. correct decision to prescribe and correct choice of antibiotics reflecting&#xD;
      the bacterial cause and resistance) and impact on patients' clinical and microbiological&#xD;
      cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, some studies that only include uncomplicated UTIs have shown that symptoms alone&#xD;
      have a very low predictive value leading to overuse of antibiotics2,3. However, Richards et&#xD;
      al after comparing the response to antibiotics of women with symptoms of UTI and a negative&#xD;
      dipstick test result, concluded that empirical antibiotic use guided only by symptoms was a&#xD;
      reasonable option4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, microscopy and more recent diagnostic tools such as a culture performed in&#xD;
      primary care settings have not been included in the latest pragmatic validation studies5,6.&#xD;
      Phase-contrast microscopy is widely used in primary care in Denmark, although the very few&#xD;
      studies on the subject show wide variation in sensitivity (60-100%) and specificity (49-100%)&#xD;
      of urine microscopy to predict significant bacteriuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides susceptibility testing at primary care level is only done in Denmark and the quality&#xD;
      control of the performance of these tests differs across the country. MIKAP (the Danish&#xD;
      agency in charge of the surveillance of the quality of the microbiological tests performed in&#xD;
      general practices) supervises only some Danish Regions and has not authority on the quality&#xD;
      control of the tests carried out in the capital region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to curb the development of resistance bacteria strains in patients with urinary&#xD;
      tract symptoms and infections, we need to increase our knowledge of the validity of the&#xD;
      different diagnostic approaches and its impact on proper use of antibiotics and recovery&#xD;
      across the heterogeneous group of patients seeking health care in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central research question will be answered throughout the following specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the diagnostic validity (i.e. sensitivity and specificity, positive and&#xD;
           negative predictive value) of different diagnostic approaches in ruling in or ruling out&#xD;
           a UTI in different sub-population groups in general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the impact of different diagnostic approaches on the appropriateness of&#xD;
           antibiotic therapy (i.e. decision to prescribe and choice of antibiotic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the impact of different diagnostic approaches on clinical and&#xD;
           microbiological cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To measure the prevalence of ESBL-resistant E.coli in patients with urinary tract&#xD;
           symptoms in general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and setting: Prospective observational study with comparison of different diagnostic&#xD;
      approaches to gold standard in general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Before the index consultation, the participating GPs will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a background questionnaire about experience, organization of the service and access&#xD;
      to different diagnostic tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the index consultation, when the GP types the ICPC code for dysuria (U01) or&#xD;
      frequency (U02), as a main motive of consultation, a pop-up will automatically appear with a&#xD;
      questionnaire about the anamnesis, diagnostic approach, treatment and other relevant&#xD;
      decisions made during the consultation; this questionnaire will be directly linked to&#xD;
      DAK-E/DAMD database (Danish General Practice database aimed at improving quality in the&#xD;
      delivery of primary medical care services). Afterwards, the patient will also be asked to&#xD;
      provide a urine sample which will be sent to the Staten's Serum Institute (SSI) for culture,&#xD;
      which will be used as the reference gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following 14 days after the index consultation, the patients will complete a symptom&#xD;
      diary (attached). They will be asked to rate some symptoms each day until recovery (or for 7&#xD;
      days if symptoms are ongoing) on a 3 point scale from &quot;nothing &quot; to &quot;a lot&quot;. After 14 days&#xD;
      patients will have to send a control urine sample. Patients with a persistently positive&#xD;
      culture will be followed up after 1and 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further information about patient background regarding co-morbidities, previous&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and previous use of antibiotics will be gathered from national registers&#xD;
      such as The Danish national patients register and The Danish national prescription register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biobank: 10 µl of urine will be stored following the safety and hygiene procedures of the&#xD;
      Staten's Serum Institute microbiological laboratory only for those urine samples positive for&#xD;
      ESBL-producing E. coli. After detection of a positive resistant strain, the samples will be&#xD;
      anonymized and stored for a period of 2 years after completion of the current study. We plan&#xD;
      to carry out further microbiological analysis of the resistant bacteria in collaboration with&#xD;
      experts in proteonomics and genomics within the bigger UC-CARE projects. The collection of&#xD;
      the urine sample does not represent any risk for the patients as it follows the normal&#xD;
      procedure in general practice, it means, the patients is requested to collect a random urine&#xD;
      sample in a plastic cup at the practice facility and 14 days after at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: All data will be entered into a database which will be linked to different&#xD;
      national registers to obtain detailed data about background information at patient level.&#xD;
      Data will be screened for data entry errors and extreme values using tables, plots and&#xD;
      specific commands of the SAS 9.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables: considering the multidimensional and multivariable models that will have to be&#xD;
      constructed in order to accurately answer the objectives, the following variables with the&#xD;
      corresponding data source will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' demographics (gender, age), dysuria, frequency, supra-pubic pressure, polyuria,&#xD;
      Fever (&gt;38oC), trembling, urine offensive smell, gynecological complaints (vaginal discharge,&#xD;
      pruritus), low back pain, blood in urine. Number of days since first symptom started.&#xD;
      Diagnostic test:, diagnose, treatment, severity of symptoms, bothersomeness, impact on daily&#xD;
      activities. Previous hospitalization within the last year: diagnosis, discharge date.&#xD;
      Consumption of antibiotics within the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GP level Number of consultations during office hours due to dysuria and/or frequency as a&#xD;
      main motive of consultation, GPs' demographics, number of patients in the GPs' list,&#xD;
      point-of-care test for urine examination: type of point-of-care tests available in the&#xD;
      practice, brand and technical specifications for each test. Attendance to courses about&#xD;
      performance of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data will be analyzed using SAS 9.03. A comparison of proportions will&#xD;
      be performed using the chi-square test. For the first two objectives, the result of the urine&#xD;
      culture will be used as the gold standard, a cut-off value of &gt;=103cfu/ml, or pure growth of&#xD;
      E.coli, and &gt; 10 4 for more unusual organisms or mixed growth will be used to define a&#xD;
      positive culture,and we will calculate sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value&#xD;
      and positive predictive value for each diagnostic approach against the gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the third objective prescription of antibiotics and choice of the right antibiotic&#xD;
      will be operationalized as binary dependent variables in a logistic regression model, while&#xD;
      for the last two objectives number of days until symptomatic and microbiological cure will be&#xD;
      analyzed as continuous dependent variables in a multiple linear regression model. Depending&#xD;
      on the number of cases included in the one month and three months follow-up of&#xD;
      microbiological cure, a Poisson regression model will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The propensity score matching technic will be employed to adjust for pre-test imbalances in&#xD;
      the different groups of treatment approaches in order to produce unbiased estimates of the&#xD;
      tests effect on the main outcomes and create participant characteristic balance among the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample calculation Different samples sizes will be needed to compare proper use of&#xD;
      antibiotics between the 16 diagnostic profiles. Due to the observational design of the study,&#xD;
      we do not know yet with certainty the distribution of the diagnostic profiles, so at least&#xD;
      there are two samples sized we are aiming at. The first one aims to see a clinically relevant&#xD;
      10% difference in proper use of antibiotics when comparing the diagnostic profiles that&#xD;
      affect the decision during the consultation versus the diagnostic profiles that affect the&#xD;
      decision after the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assumptions are: a) the 4 diagnostic profiles that influence the decision during the&#xD;
      consultation are use in 60% of the patients, b) the correct decision is taken in 60% of the&#xD;
      patients in this group, while c) the correct decision during the consultation is taken only&#xD;
      in 40% of the patients in which any of the remaining 12 diagnostic profiles are performed. We&#xD;
      will need 60 practices recruiting 15 patients each (n=900). Intra-class correlation =0.2,&#xD;
      α=0.05 and β=0.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second sample size relates to the detection of a prevalence of ESBL-producing E. Coli&#xD;
      between 0 to 6% in patients with a suspected UTI in primary care. Our assumptions for the&#xD;
      sample calculation are as follows: a) 60% of patients with symptoms do not have a positive&#xD;
      culture, b) 80% of the patients with a positive culture are infected with a E.Coli strain.&#xD;
      Therefore, we need 1500 patients with a suspected UTI attending primary care to detect a&#xD;
      prevalence of ESBL-resistant E.coli between 0 to 6% with a 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not represent any risk for the patients due to the observational design. It&#xD;
      means the diagnostic process and the treatment will be register as it is done in every day&#xD;
      practice. Participation in the study implies for the patient that they have to fill in a&#xD;
      diary about symptoms for 7 days and they should be willing to be contacted 3 days and 14 days&#xD;
      after by the personnel from the practice to know whether they have filled in the diary, sent&#xD;
      it to the research unit and sent the second sample to the microbiological department.&#xD;
      Consequently, the course of the symptoms/disease is not affected by the fact of participating&#xD;
      or not in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the personnel at each practice will be informed about the study, so as soon as the&#xD;
      patient contacts the practice due to the symptoms listed at the inclusion criteria section,&#xD;
      they will receive the first information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first contact person (i.e. secretary, nurse, general practitioner) will ask the patient&#xD;
      whether they are interested in participating in a project that aims to improve the management&#xD;
      of patients with a suspected urinary tract infection. If the person is interested in&#xD;
      participating in the study, then he/she will be given a leaflet with information about the&#xD;
      study. This leaflet can be read while waiting for the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has further questions, they will be answered during the consultation to&#xD;
      guarantee privacy. The patient is welcome to have a companion, in case they consider it is&#xD;
      necessary in order to make a well-informed and thorough decision. However, due to the fact&#xD;
      that these symptoms are acute and non-life-threatening complaints, in every day practice the&#xD;
      patient uses to come alone. It means, to guarantee that the patient makes a non-influenced&#xD;
      decision, the personnel is instructed to emphasize to the patients that they have as much&#xD;
      time as the want to think about, they can ask questions and they can be sure that they&#xD;
      refusal to participating in the project won't change the normal diagnostic process and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
