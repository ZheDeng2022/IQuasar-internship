  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of an additional VR training program on&#xD;
      unilateral spatial neglect (USN) after stroke. Principally, clinical assessment of the&#xD;
      presence of unilateral spatial neglect and additionally the severity of USN will be measured&#xD;
      using the Behavioral Inattention test (BIT), using only the BIT Conventional subtest (BITC).&#xD;
      Secondarily, the VR outcomes will be included as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we want to determine if the effects last over a short period of time. It is&#xD;
      important to know whether the potential effects of the VR-training remain without continuing&#xD;
      the intervention. Therefore, we will perform a follow-up assessment after 1 week.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of this study is a 1-week, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial with a&#xD;
      1-week follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HMD VR system 'Oculus Rift' (Oculus, LLS, US) is a low-cost HMD that fully integrates the&#xD;
      user into the virtual environment by blocking out perception of the real-world. It includes a&#xD;
      headset, two oculus touch controllers and two sensors. To power the Oculus Rift, a compatible&#xD;
      laptop will be used. The &quot;Oculus Rift&quot; will assure a fully immersive virtual environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment assessment: First, eligible patients will be screened and assessed. For&#xD;
      screening and assessment, patients will undergo 2 tests: a VR test and a conventional test.&#xD;
      The patient will be seated in a (wheel)chair while performing the assessment tests, with one&#xD;
      of the researchers present for safety. All patients will immediately complete the tests,&#xD;
      without a try-out session. Instructions will be given in a consistent way and during the&#xD;
      tests no feedback will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the VR-test, the HMD will be used. The VR test consists of 5 different tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. penguin search (1min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. smartphone search (1min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. apple examination (12 apples)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. penguin extinction (10 times)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. grabbing cubes (6 cubes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the conventional test, patients will need to perform the Behavioral Inattention test -&#xD;
      conventional subtest (BITC), which consists of 6 different tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. line crossing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. letter cancellation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. star cancellation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. figure and shape copying&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. line bisection&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. representational drawing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the assessment is completed, all patients will receive a standard care program provided&#xD;
      by the rehabilitation hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the intervention group will receive a VR training for 30 min consisting of&#xD;
      various specific developed tasks for unilateral neglect training for a period of five&#xD;
      consecutive days (one session a day). The VR training consists of the same 5 tasks used for&#xD;
      the assessment. On the last day of the intervention and one week after, patients will be&#xD;
      assessed again by completing the BITC test and the VR tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1: Penguin search: the patient has to search a penguin, which is randomly placed in the&#xD;
      virtual environment. The patient has to aim for the penguin with this crosshair for a certain&#xD;
      amount of time (until the loading bar is filled) in order to receive a point. The penguin is&#xD;
      teleported to a new position afterwards. The subject has 2 minutes to gain as many points as&#xD;
      possible. When the patient is not able to locate the penguin, arrows will indicate the&#xD;
      direction of the penguin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2: Smartphone search: The Smartphone Search task is similar to the Penguin Search task.&#xD;
      This time it takes place in a kitchen and the subject has to search for a smartphone on the&#xD;
      kitchen counter. This kitchen counter is located in front of the subject. As in task 1, a&#xD;
      crosshair is placed in the center of the camera canvas and the player receives points by&#xD;
      aiming at the target. Like before, the subject has 2 minutes to gain as many points as&#xD;
      possible. Like in the previous task, some arrows show up after ten seconds to help the&#xD;
      subjects when they are not able to find the smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 3: Apple examination: In the Apple Examination task, the patient has to distinguish&#xD;
      normal apples from distractors. The subject is placed in a grass landscape with 8 normal&#xD;
      apples and 12 distractors. As in the previous tasks, a crosshair is attached to the canvas of&#xD;
      the camera. The subject has to aim for the normal apples and press button A or X of the&#xD;
      oculus controllers to get a point. The task ends when all normal apples are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 4: Penguin extinction: This task takes place in the same mountain environment as the&#xD;
      Penguin Search task. In contrast with the other tasks, the subject doesn't have to search in&#xD;
      the virtual environment, since everything takes place in the subject's field of view. There&#xD;
      are three scenario's: either there is one penguin present on the right side, either there is&#xD;
      one present on the left, or two penguins are present, one on each side. The subject has to&#xD;
      say which scenario was presented by moving the thumbstick of the right or left oculus&#xD;
      controller accordingly to the right (correct answer for scenario 1), to the left (correct&#xD;
      answer for scenario 2) or upwards (correct answer for scenario 3). A point is gained for&#xD;
      every correct answer. The task is completed when the subject has reached a score of thirty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 5: Grabbing cubes: The last task is called Grabbing Cubes. Ten cubes are randomly placed&#xD;
      on a table which is located in front of the player. The subjects have to grab the cubes and&#xD;
      remove them from the table by dropping them on the ground. Grabbing an object is done by&#xD;
      pressing the hand trigger of the left or right oculus controller. In order to complete the&#xD;
      task, they have to remove all the cubes from the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive a placebo VR intervention. Patients in the control group will&#xD;
      also use the HMD but they will look at another virtual environment with no specific tasks.&#xD;
      The virtual environment represents a park outside where other avatars (hikers, joggers) are&#xD;
      passing by. Patients will be looking at the environment for the same time as the VR training&#xD;
      of the intervention group, i.e. 1 session a day for 5 days. On the last day of the&#xD;
      intervention and one week after, patients will be assessed again by completing the BITC test&#xD;
      and the VR tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group&#xD;
      (1:1 ratio). Patients will be assigned to a group by block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since heterogeneity between groups will be present at baseline, an ANCOVA analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted to correct this matter. If significant changes are found at postintervention and&#xD;
      follow-up, post-hoc analyses for multiple comparisons will be performed using the Bonferroni&#xD;
      correction.&#xD;
