  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of in-home decluttering&#xD;
      augmentation of group CBT for reducing hoarding severity in adults with HD. The trial takes&#xD;
      place in Sweden.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the current evidence-based treatment for HD but the&#xD;
      majority of sufferers remain symptomatic after CBT with impairing levels of clutter in their&#xD;
      homes. Home visits, with a focus on in-home decluttering, have in previous research been&#xD;
      shown to be a promising intervention when combined with CBT. However, augmenting CBT with&#xD;
      subsequent home visits has not yet been tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In&#xD;
      response to this, in this trial, we aim to investigate the efficacy of a coordinated&#xD;
      intervention, consisting of CBT and in-home decluttering for HD, in an RCT. In this trial, 90&#xD;
      participants with HD will initially receive 12 sessions of CBT through a psychiatric&#xD;
      outpatient service. After CBT, participants will be randomized to receive either 10 home&#xD;
      visits in 10 weeks, or to a wait list condition. Our hypothesis is that augmenting CBT with&#xD;
      home visits will lead to a reduction in hoarding symptoms and clutter and improved daily&#xD;
      functioning compared to wait list. We will also investigate the cost-economical aspects of&#xD;
      the intervention. Results from this trial have the potential to reveal whether in-home&#xD;
      decluttering should be added to CBT in order to reduce symptoms of hoarding and improve&#xD;
      function in indviduals with HD.&#xD;

    <description>The in-home decluttering intervention comprises 10, 1.5-hour home-visits over the course of 10 weeks.&#xD;
These home visits are personalized, goal-oriented and focused on decluttering. They include 1) a brief check-in, 2) guided unclutter time 3) a reflective period during which participants share their thoughts and objectives for the coming week, and 4) homework assignments.</description>
