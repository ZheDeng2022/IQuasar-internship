  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: There are several manifestations in the oral mucosa resulting from&#xD;
      antineoplastic treatments by chemo (QT) or radiotherapy (RT). In this study we will collect&#xD;
      the variables referring to oral mucositis (OM), radiodermatitis, osteonecrosis of the jaws&#xD;
      (ONJ), hyposalivation and xerostomia, dysgeusia, pain, oral candidiasis (opportunistic&#xD;
      infection), trismus, quality of life, oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MO and hyposalivation, which are related to damage to the salivary glands, are the most&#xD;
      common manifestations, and ONJ is the most difficult to treat. The dentist can play an&#xD;
      important role in prevention and treatment these oral lesions, directly influencing the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life and adherence to antineoplastic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention, using LLL&#xD;
      phototherapy and topical Vit E, in the OM. And the intervention through LLL phototherapy and&#xD;
      LPRP in the ONJ. These interventions will be performed by dentists during antineoplastic&#xD;
      medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: clinical trial, randomized, with balanced randomization, single-blind&#xD;
      (for the evaluator of the results) with 2 experimental arms and a control group, carried out&#xD;
      in a single center. Group 1, intervention with LLL phototherapy, Group 2, intervention with&#xD;
      application of topical Vit E and Group 3, mouthwash with 0.12% chlorhexidine (usual clinical&#xD;
      information). 360 patients will participate in this study from the Units of Oncology&#xD;
      Medicine, Radiotetaphic Medicine and Oral Medicine, Oral Surgery and Implantology at the&#xD;
      University of Santiago de Compostela. The segment of the patients will be given, an initial&#xD;
      visit and returns every day that hears the application of antineoplastic treatment for the&#xD;
      group of LLL phototherapy, returns of 15 days, one month, three months, six months, nine&#xD;
      months and one year. In these return visits, evaluations and questionnaires will be carried&#xD;
      out regarding all the variables that we will collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictable results: If the application of laser phototherapy or topical Vit E contributes to&#xD;
      the cessation, reduction or improvement of the clinical evolution of the manifestation of&#xD;
      oral lesions, these treatments could be immediately implemented in our Oral Medicine unit and&#xD;
      could lay the foundations for its implementation in different public centers and private.&#xD;
