      We will evaluate a brief group-based cognitive-behavioral treatment program for adolescents&#xD;
      aged 13-17 years with internalizing problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Internalizing disorders (anxiety and depression) are among the most prevalent psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders in youth (1, 2). Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) is well-establed treatment&#xD;
      for internalizing disorders (10-13). The evidence originates mostly from disorder-specific&#xD;
      CBT for youth [e.g., (14, 15)]. However, the validity of specific diagnosis has been&#xD;
      questioned, especially because of high symptom overlap between disorders (16-19) and the high&#xD;
      rates of diagnostic comorbidity (20, 21). In addition, research has suggested that depressive&#xD;
      comorbidity is associated with reduced treatment effectiveness for primary anxiety disorder&#xD;
      (22-24) and vice versa (18). A recent meta-analysis, of the collective evidence of&#xD;
      psychotherapy throught 50 years, revealed that there were no effects of disorder-specific&#xD;
      psychotherapy for youths with one or more comorbid disorder (25). Which indicates that&#xD;
      disorder-specific treatment is not sufficient for children with comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transdiagnostic treatments have been developed and evaluated to address this problem. These&#xD;
      treatments emphasize effective therapeutic principles which may be applied across multiple&#xD;
      disorders (26, 27). Transidagnostic treatment may be more cost effective and practical than&#xD;
      disorder-specific treatments as most therapists only need to be trained extensively in one&#xD;
      protocol. Transdiagnostic treatments may also be easily learned by clinicians and especially&#xD;
      in generalist settings where one transdiagnostic protocol can be offered to patients with&#xD;
      various mental health problems instead of many offered to much fewer (28). Offering&#xD;
      transdiagnostic treatment approach may better serve the diagnostically heterogeneous groups&#xD;
      which seek help at general clinics instead of many different disorder-specific treatment&#xD;
      protocols (25, 29). Transdiagnostic CBT protocols have been proved to be effective among&#xD;
      adults with internalizing disorders (30-33) and also among youths (34-37) It has also been&#xD;
      showed that transdiagnostic CBT was equally effective as anxiety disorder-specific protocol&#xD;
      for adults with anxiety disorders (38)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Our treatment is a brief group-based cognitive-behavioral treatment which was&#xD;
      specifically designed for adolescents with impairing internalizing symptoms, or&#xD;
      anxiety/depressive disorders seeking help at the Primary Health Care Clinics in Iceland. The&#xD;
      treatment comprises eight weekly 110-minutes sessions were the following components are&#xD;
      applied: (1) psychoeducation, (2) cognitive restructuring, (3), behavioral activation, (4)&#xD;
      exposure, (5) problem solving, (6) social skills, and (7) mindfulness. The participants&#xD;
      receive a workbook with outline of each sessions and assignments related to components (e.g.,&#xD;
      (e.g., ABC workseets, exposure exercises). They are encouraged to practice skills learned in&#xD;
      sessions between sessions. All parents attend two sessions. They receive detailed&#xD;
      psychoeducation and are instructed in assisting their children with the homework assignments&#xD;
      (week 1), and in week 6 they are instructed how to assist their children with exposure&#xD;
      exercises. They also receive a workbook with outline of each sessions. The therapist also has&#xD;
      at least one telephone call with each family to follow-up on exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and participants The following study is a randomized controlled trial where&#xD;
      participants are allocated to either eight weekly sessions of brief transidagnostic CBT or&#xD;
      waitlist monitoring for clinical deterioration. We will randomize by using blockwise&#xD;
      procedure determined by a computer-generated algorithm. To ensure that the randomization will&#xD;
      not be predicted in advance, it will be centralized at the University of Iceland.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to study group after being deemed eligible and undergoing&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Participants will be assessed at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment (week 8), 2&#xD;
      months follow-up, 4 months follow-up, and 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
