  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryosurgical freezing (limited to 1.5 cm diameter single freeze within the cancer (up to two&#xD;
      cancer sites selected and treated)) will release intact antigens to prime the immune system.&#xD;
      The study treatment immunotherapeutic drugs (PD-1 inhibitor monoclonal antibody nivolumab or&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab, and low-dose cyclophosphamide)&#xD;
      will then be sequentially injected directly into each of the treated cancer sites immediately&#xD;
      following cryosurgical freezing. These injections will be performed in combination with&#xD;
      collagen (Helitene) to improve drug containment at the site of injection for improved local&#xD;
      effect rather than rapid disbursement and dilution throughout adjacent interstitial spaces,&#xD;
      as well as sustained drug delivery over time rather than a burst-release pattern. Prior to&#xD;
      study treatment, oral low dose cyclophosphamide will be given. Post-treatment, daily&#xD;
      subcutaneous low-dose GM-CSF injections will also be administered subsequently. It is&#xD;
      speculated that neoantigens released from the cryoablated necrotic cancer will be available&#xD;
      in the vicinity of the cryosurgical freezing field immediately following the procedure.&#xD;
      Immature dendritic cells attracted to the injection site will internalize neoantigens to&#xD;
      become activated to recognize cancer-specific antigenic proteins. The activated dendritic&#xD;
      cells will recruit killer T-cells to the injection site to attack cancer cells, and then&#xD;
      migrate through the lymphatic system to sites of metastases, targeting cancer-specific&#xD;
      neoantigens and recruiting more killer T-lymphocytes to destroy other cancer cells harboring&#xD;
      the precise antigenic epitopes (abscopal (bystander) effect). In this way, dendritic cells&#xD;
      are capable of initiating cell-mediated systemic immune response in combination with&#xD;
      cytotoxic killer T-cells. Regulatory T lymphocytes, which have been implicated in dampening&#xD;
      or halting cell-mediated, antigen-specific immune responses, will be selectively depleted by&#xD;
      anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and metronomic GM-CSF.&#xD;
      Intra-tumoral injection of the immunotherapeutic medications assists in stimulating and&#xD;
      harnessing the local and systemic immune response. GM-CSF prolongs the immune response. Using&#xD;
      this combination of therapies, referred to as AbscopalRx5001, it is thought that a clinically&#xD;
      significant systemic anti-cancer immune response might be elicited. Intra-tumoral injection&#xD;
      of drugs will likely offer fewer side effects than systemic therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be ≥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of 0-3 on the ECOG Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a life expectancy of 6 months or more as determined by treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have exhausted all other standard therapies; Have failed available therapy or are not&#xD;
             a candidate for, or refuse available therapy (i.e. concerned with high adverse events&#xD;
             rate in available therapy or outcome worse than disease); or failure of prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically-documented solid cancer. All subjects must submit their primary tumor&#xD;
             or metastatic pathology specimens and laboratory and imaging reports to Rampart Health&#xD;
             where they will be centrally reviewed. Central Rampart Health pathologic review is not&#xD;
             required for screening but rather for confirmation of diagnosis and histologic subtype&#xD;
             of cancer. Local pathologic review is sufficient for eligibility determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease as defined using iRECIST criteria and identified by radiographic&#xD;
             imaging (Imaging should be current within the past three months of subject entering&#xD;
             the study; if not repeat imaging must be done prior to enrollment.). In order to be&#xD;
             eligible, the patient must have at least one metastatic bone and/or metastatic soft&#xD;
             tissue site, lymph node site, and/or bone site with cancer mass measuring 1.0 cm or&#xD;
             more in diameter based on soft tissue, lymph node, and/or bone lesions as defined by&#xD;
             any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any soft tissue lesion defined by imaging deemed by the physician to be&#xD;
                  consistent with distant metastatic disease. For patients undergoing PSMA PET&#xD;
                  (prostate cancer patients only), only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI&#xD;
                  correlate consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metastatic lymph node disease defined by imaging. Any lymph node ≥ 1.5 cm in&#xD;
                  shortest dimension will be noted as involved with disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone metastases defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium bone scan&#xD;
                  and/or NaF PET performed, either study may be used for documenting metastases;&#xD;
                  both scans do not need to show the number of metastases required for study entry.&#xD;
                  For patients undergoing PSMA PET (prostate cancer patients only), only PSMA-avid&#xD;
                  lesions that are consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of&#xD;
                  metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the medications in this protocol on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. Any subject treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to the first dose of study therapy, for the duration of the study&#xD;
             participation, and for 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Their partners will also be encouraged to use proper method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable initial laboratory values within 14 days of treatment initiation according&#xD;
             to the following:&#xD;

        documented liver metastases Albumin &gt;2.5 mg/dL Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)&#xD;
        ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within&#xD;
        therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving&#xD;
        anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of&#xD;
        anticoagulants.&#xD;
