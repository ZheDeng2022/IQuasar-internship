      timely short-term antibiotic prophylaxis is an essential step in the management of these&#xD;
      patients . Prophylaxis must be instituted as early as variceal hemorrhage is suspected, and&#xD;
      timely administration has been associated with a reduced re-bleeding rate and lower mortality&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the&#xD;
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy&#xD;
      (ASGE) recommended antibiotic prophylaxis in all cirrhotic patients with UGIB, regardless of&#xD;
      its source (i.e. variceal or non-variceal) or the presence of ascites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      cute variceal bleeding is one of the major causes of death in cirrhotic patients . It is also&#xD;
      the major cause of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in cirrhotic patients, accounting for&#xD;
      70% of cases . Mortality during the first episode is estimated to 15-20% but is higher in&#xD;
      severe patients (Child Pugh C), at around 30%, whereas it is very low in patients with&#xD;
      compensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhage from gastro-esophageal varices is a devastating complication of portal&#xD;
      hypertension. Although the in-hospital mortality of acute variceal bleeding was up to 40%&#xD;
      about 20 years ago, it was decreased to about 15-20% in recent years.20 One of the main&#xD;
      reasons in the decrease of mortality has been ascribed to the alertness of clinicians in the&#xD;
      treatment and prophylaxis of associated bacterial infections. The prevalence of bacterial&#xD;
      infections in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been up to 52%-66%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, timely short-term antibiotic prophylaxis is an essential step in the management of&#xD;
      these patients. Prophylaxis must be instituted as early as variceal hemorrhage is suspected,&#xD;
      and timely administration has been associated with a reduced re-bleeding rate and lower&#xD;
      mortality .&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the&#xD;
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy&#xD;
      (ASGE) recommended antibiotic prophylaxis in all cirrhotic patients with UGIB, regardless of&#xD;
      its source (i.e. variceal or non-variceal) or the presence of ascites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of prophylaxis is incontrovertible in patients with advanced cirrhosis,&#xD;
      whereas in patients with less severe disease, conflicting data have been published. In a&#xD;
      retrospective study, Child A patients had a low rate of bacterial infection (2%) in the&#xD;
      absence of antibiotic prophylaxis, and there was no difference in mortality between patients&#xD;
      on and off antibiotics .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, antibiotics were associated with a marked mortality reduction in Child C&#xD;
      patients. However, more prospective studies are needed to assess whether antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis can be avoided in Child A patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study will be conducted to investigate the necessity of prophylactic antibiotic in&#xD;
      compensated cirrhotic patients with UGIB and to evaluate its influence on patient outcomes.&#xD;
