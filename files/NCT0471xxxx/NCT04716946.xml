    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with the study drug durvalumab&#xD;
      combined with a type of radiation therapy called stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) is a more&#xD;
      effective treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) than SBRT alone.&#xD;
