  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIIb, interventional, single arm, multicentre study to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      effectivenees, use of resources and patient reporting outcomes in patients with ES-SCLC&#xD;
      treated with durvalumab in combination with platinum-etoposide as first-line treatment in&#xD;
      Spain.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will provide an opportunity to further evaluate the safety profile and efficacy of&#xD;
      durvalumab + EP in patient population that is reflective of real-world clinical practice,&#xD;
      Durvalumab will be concurrently administered with first-line chemotherapy (EP) on an every 3&#xD;
      week (q3w) schedule for 4 to 6 cycles, and will continue to be administered as monotherapy&#xD;
      post-chemotherapy on an every 4 week (q4w) schedule until confirmed progressive disease (PD)&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is allowed in patients showing complete or partial&#xD;
      responses after the durvalumab + EP combination cycles, at the discretion of the investigator&#xD;
      according to their local clinical practice.&#xD;
