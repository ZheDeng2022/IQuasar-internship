  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of 4 cycles of combinatory immunotherapy&#xD;
      (ipilimumab and nivolumab), followed by monotherapy nivolumab in participants with&#xD;
      immunogenic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following molecular characterization (next-generation sequencing) a total of 75 mCRPC&#xD;
      patients with a putative immunogenic subtype will be included within the phase 2 INSPIRE&#xD;
      trial. As treatment we will be utilizing a combinatory regimen of nivolumab 3mg/kg and&#xD;
      ipilimumab 1mg/kg for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 480mg flat dose for up to one year. All&#xD;
      participants will additionally undergo an on-trial metastatic tissue biopsy. Translational&#xD;
      research will study immunological correlates and in-depth genomic/transcriptomic and&#xD;
      multispectral immunohistochemical analyses of immune infiltrate.&#xD;
