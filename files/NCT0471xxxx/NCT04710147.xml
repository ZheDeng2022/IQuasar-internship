    <textblock>
      Due to acquired brain injury (ABI), is often difficulty in gait and balance alterations, as&#xD;
      problems that patients designated as the most disabling. It is essential to an effective&#xD;
      assessment of the balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The purpose of the present project adapt and verify the validity of the scale&#xD;
      Community Balance and Mobility (CB&amp;M), in patients with ABI in subacute and chronic stage,&#xD;
      since that is postulated as a brief tool and covering the peculiarities of the specific&#xD;
      alterations of the patient after suffering brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Between February 2021 and June 2022 will be transcultural adaptation to the ABI&#xD;
      population and validation of psychometric scale CB&amp;M in three phases. 100 subjects who&#xD;
      receive treatment in centers of attention to brain injury in Spain will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: validity and reliability parameters shall be calculated by means of descriptive&#xD;
      statistics for each item of the scales and the set of scale score. Investigators will also&#xD;
      analyze the internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha, the interclass correlation&#xD;
      coefficient will be used to determine the reliability, and the items will be scanned with the&#xD;
      Pearson coefficient: &gt; 0.20, among other parameters.&#xD;

      Cristina Lirio-Romero et al., will develop a cross-cultural adaptation to the Spanish&#xD;
      population with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and psychometric validation of the Community&#xD;
      Balance and Mobility (CB&amp;M) scale. The author of the scale has consented the adaptation of&#xD;
      the scale. The study will take place at several centers of attention to brain injury in&#xD;
      Spain. After receiving the approval of the Ethics and Clinical Research Committee of the&#xD;
      University of Alcalá (Madrid), it is proposed to implement the study between February 2021&#xD;
      and June 2022. A minimum of 100 adults, aged between 18 and 65, will be recruited subacute or&#xD;
      chronic state after suffering brain injury. The sample size conforms to COSMIN&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verifying that there are no parallel studies on the subject in progress, the possible&#xD;
      participants will be informed of the development of the investigation (ANNEX 1), who must&#xD;
      sign the informed consent (ANNEX 2) before being recruited into the study. In addition, a&#xD;
      coding sheet (ANNEX 3) of the participants will be filled in so that from now on the data&#xD;
      related to the proper name does not appear but with a number that ensures the protection of&#xD;
      their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria to enter to participate in the study will be: adults who had suffered a&#xD;
      ABI at least 2 months ago, that their disability before suffering it was less than or equal&#xD;
      to three on the scale modified by Rankin, who have an absence of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      according to the Minimental State Examination scale, that is, a score in it greater than 24,&#xD;
      without previous diseases that alter the balance, that were clinically stable and without&#xD;
      fever, with the ability to walk with help technical or without it, and that they gave their&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, those people with medical contraindications for physical tests (acute&#xD;
      musculoskeletal or peripheral nervous system disorders), who did not understand the&#xD;
      instructions, severe aphasias or with subjects with acute processes of any added pathology&#xD;
      will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was developed in 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Transcultural adaptation process. Phase 2: Pre-Test: collected , as well as the ease&#xD;
      of interpretation of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Psychometric validation process.&#xD;

    <description>the overall consistency measures the homogeneity of the scale and the interdependence of the items, indicating the relationship between them.&#xD;
To determine test-retest test reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used. Derived from the test-retest reliability study, the measurement error will be calculated, using the formula standard deviation (SD) x √1-ICC.</description>
