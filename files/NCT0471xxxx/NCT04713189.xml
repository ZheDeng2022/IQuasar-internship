  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) is a common problem in patients with cancer. This is a phase&#xD;
      I/IIa, pharmacokinetic, dose-response and safety study of inhaled fentanyl aerosol&#xD;
      (25µg/dose) in Chinese patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The study will include two&#xD;
      stages.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage I: dose-response relationship and safety assessment of inhaled fentanyl aerosol in&#xD;
      patients with breakthrough cancer pain. placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind&#xD;
      randomized design is applied in this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be treated with inhaled fentanyl&#xD;
      aerosol (4 of 6 episodes BTcp) or placebo (2of 6 episodes BTcp).Subjects will inhale fentanyl&#xD;
      aerosol or placebo for each episode of BTcp with a starting dose of 25 µg every 4 minutes&#xD;
      until adequate pain alleviation. The maximum doses are 6×25 µg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II: The dosage regimen (number of puffs) will be depended on the data from Stage I.&#xD;
      Subjects will inhale fentanyl aerosol not in the episode of breakthrough cancer pain with a&#xD;
      starting dose of 25 µg every 4 minutes.&#xD;
