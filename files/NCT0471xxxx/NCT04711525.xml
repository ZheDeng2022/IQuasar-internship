    <textblock>
      Background: Strategies to treat and prevent obesity are urgently required in Malaysia, and it&#xD;
      is now considered a public health priority. Aims: The present study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the i-MaCHeL intervention for preschool's child-parent dyads. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the present study is to compare the changes in the child BMI-for-age z-score at&#xD;
      6- and 12-month after baseline measurement. The secondary objectives of the present study are&#xD;
      to compare the changes in child dietary intake, child physical activity, child health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, parental self-efficacy, parental role modeling, and parental policies at 6-&#xD;
      and 12-month after baseline measurement. Study design: The i-MaCHeL intervention is a&#xD;
      single-blind, two-group cluster-randomized controlled trial that evaluates the effectiveness&#xD;
      of a 6-month obesity prevention intervention on preschool's child-parent dyads at 6- and&#xD;
      12-month after baseline. The participating preschools (n=12) will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio. The present study will involve 460 child-parent&#xD;
      dyads of preschool children aged 5 and 6 years old and their parents in Terengganu, Malaysia.&#xD;
      Briefly, the preschool children in the experimental group will be received the i-MaCHeL&#xD;
      program delivered through interactive classroom instruction, and their parents will have&#xD;
      access to the i-MaCHeL Web-based program. In the control group, the preschool children will&#xD;
      be received a standard preschool health education curriculum, and their parents will have&#xD;
      access to the general Web-based health newsletters. Instruments: Anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      (body weight and height) will be assessed according to the WHO standard procedures. Dietary&#xD;
      intake of children will be measured using dietary records for three days. Child physical&#xD;
      activity, child health-related quality of life, parental role modeling, parental policies,&#xD;
      and parental self-efficacy will be assessed using previously validated parent-proxy&#xD;
      questionnaires. Conclusion: The strategies to promote healthy eating in reducing the&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity among Malaysian preschool children may have long-term benefits to&#xD;
      children's health. The combinations of the two modes of delivery (interactive classroom&#xD;
      instruction for preschool children and a Web-based program for parents) will have a strong&#xD;
      potential to be effective strategies to sustain child-parent engagement and participation in&#xD;
      the health-related behavior change program.&#xD;

      1. Research Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary hypothesis of the present study is that the preschool children in the&#xD;
           i-MaCHeL intervention group would achieve a significant improvement in BMI z-score&#xD;
           compared with those in the comparison group at 6- and 12-month after baseline&#xD;
           measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary hypotheses of the present study, as stated below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Preschool children in the i-MaCHeL intervention group would achieve significant&#xD;
                improvements in dietary intake, physical activity, and health-related quality of&#xD;
                life compared with those in the comparison group at 6- and 12-month after baseline&#xD;
                measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Parents of preschool children in the i-MaCHeL intervention group would achieve&#xD;
                significant improvements in parental self-efficacy, parental role modeling, and&#xD;
                parental policies compared with those in the comparison group at 6- and 12-month&#xD;
                after baseline measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Location&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two districts, which are Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus, will be included in this&#xD;
           study. These two districts are chosen based on demographic and logistic factors as it is&#xD;
           within 35 miles (56 kilometers) of the study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reference Population&#xD;
&#xD;
           The reference population will be based on a sample population drawn from the MOE public&#xD;
           preschools in the Terengganu that are registered at the Ministry of Education Malaysia&#xD;
           (MOE). There are 307 MOE public preschools with a total of 11,600 children in&#xD;
           Terengganu. All children attending MOE public preschool in the Kuala Terengganu and&#xD;
           Kuala Nerus districts will be included as the reference population in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Source Population&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary sample consists of 5- and 6-year-olds children (born in the year of 2016 and&#xD;
           2017) that attending MOE public preschools, and their parents, living in the Kuala&#xD;
           Terengganu and Kuala Nerus districts. There are 71 MOE public preschools in Kuala&#xD;
           Terengganu (n=45 preschools) and Kuala Nerus (n=26 preschools), with a total of 1,850&#xD;
           and 1,175 children, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           The preschool's child-parent dyads that fulfill the selection criteria of the present&#xD;
           study will be eligible for inclusion. In total, 12 preschools with 460 child-parent&#xD;
           dyads will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sample Size Determination&#xD;
&#xD;
           The present study is a preschool-based cluster-randomized controlled trial that&#xD;
           evaluates the effectiveness of a 6-month obesity prevention intervention in preschool's&#xD;
           child-parent dyads. Twelve preschools with approximately 38 child-parent dyads per&#xD;
           preschool, will be enrolled in the present study at baseline. With at least 90% power to&#xD;
           identify a small to medium effect size at the 5% significance level, the present study&#xD;
           needs a sample of size 460 child-parent dyads. The intervention and control group will&#xD;
           each have 230 child-parent dyads in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sampling Frame&#xD;
&#xD;
           All preschools located in the Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus districts (n=71), with a&#xD;
           total of 3,025 children, will be assessed for inclusion. The preschools with fewer than&#xD;
           38 children (minimum cluster size) or preschools with &quot;special measures&quot; (unlikely to&#xD;
           have the capacity to contribute to the study) will be excluded from the study. After the&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria screening, a list of 37 preschools (n= 1,850 children)&#xD;
           will be expected to be eligible and invited to participate in the present study. From&#xD;
           the list, only 12 preschools will be recruited in the study. The list of all children&#xD;
           attending the included preschools will be obtained from the preschool teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Sampling Method&#xD;
&#xD;
           A cluster random sampling technique (probability sampling) at the preschool level will&#xD;
           be conducted in the present study. Thirty-seven preschools (expected to be eligible)&#xD;
           will be randomly ordered using a random number generator to generate a list of random&#xD;
           numbers, and sequentially will be invited to participate. All the preschools will be&#xD;
           contacted, and 12 of them will be recruited in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           Notably, the randomization into intervention and control groups will only occur at the&#xD;
           preschool level. Thus, randomization will be carried out at the preschool level rather&#xD;
           than the child participants level to minimize the possibility of the experimental group&#xD;
           participants would influence by the participants in the control group. In total, 12&#xD;
           preschools, 6 per arm, will be randomized into either the experimental or control group&#xD;
           in a 1:1 ratio. After the baseline measures are completed, the participating preschools&#xD;
           will be randomized at the start of the preschool year using a randomization computer&#xD;
           program of Research Randomizer (version 4.0). The data analyst who randomized the&#xD;
           preschools has no contact with the principal researcher, preschool personnel, or study&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Overview of the Interactive Malaysian Childhood Healthy Lifestyle Program (i-MaCHeL)&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           The i-MaCHeL intervention is designed in an innovative approach to delivering a&#xD;
           health-related behavior change program among preschool's child-parent dyads to prevent&#xD;
           childhood obesity. The i-MaCHeL intervention encourages children to practice a healthy&#xD;
           lifestyle and educate parents to shape home lifestyles for optimal child growth and&#xD;
           development. Furthermore, the i-MaCHeL intervention is unique, given its Web-based&#xD;
           approach to enhance the tool's adoption with hard-to-reach populations, contributing to&#xD;
           the long-term goal for childhood obesity prevention. The combinations of the two modes&#xD;
           of delivery (interactive classroom instruction for preschool children and a Web-based&#xD;
           program for parents) will have a strong potential to be effective strategies to sustain&#xD;
           child-parent engagement and participation in the health-related behavior change program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In recognition of the value of multiple theoretical approaches, the strong theoretical&#xD;
           basis consists of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), Health Belief Model (HBM), and&#xD;
           Trans-Theoretical Model (TTM) principles will be underpinning the development of the&#xD;
           i-MaCHeL intervention. These theories' concepts and principles will be ensured to well&#xD;
           suited with the i-MaCHeL in supporting desired healthy lifestyle behaviors and healthier&#xD;
           weight outcomes. The main contents of the i-MaCHeL program are healthy eating, active&#xD;
           physical activity (moderate-intensity exercise), and sedentary behavior (sleep and&#xD;
           screen time), which are based on evidence-based national recommendations for a healthy&#xD;
           lifestyle targeting preschool children. Educational and behavior change materials of a&#xD;
           healthy lifestyle will be developed by following the guidelines from the Malaysian&#xD;
           Dietary Guidelines for Children and Adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Intended Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in changes over time between the intervention and comparison groups will be&#xD;
      assessed for each outcome. General linear model repeated measure analysis will be used to&#xD;
      determine differences between groups over time (baseline, 6-month, and 12-month) with&#xD;
      adjustment for potential covariates. Intention-to-treat (ITT) principles will be applied for&#xD;
      parametric data, with all participants analyzed in both intervention and control groups&#xD;
      regardless of whether they attended all data collection time points or completed the&#xD;
      intervention. Descriptive statistics will be calculated to describe participants'&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics and scores for each outcome measure by treatment and control&#xD;
      groups at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      will be conducted to identify significant differences within-group at 6- and 12-month&#xD;
      surveys. Whereas repeated measures Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed to&#xD;
      determine significant differences between-group at the 6- and 12-month surveys. The measures&#xD;
      analyses will be controlled for covariate variables known to influence the outcome measures&#xD;
      (child gender, parent education level, parent aged, and parent income). The significance&#xD;
      level will be set at &lt; 0.05. Analyses will be performed using Statistical Package for the&#xD;
      Social Science (SPSS; version 25.0).&#xD;
