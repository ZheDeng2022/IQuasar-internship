          1. Participant is ≥ 18 and ≤ 48 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent&#xD;
             form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related&#xD;
             assessments/procedures being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;

             protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is in good health, as determined by the Investigator based on a physical&#xD;
             examination at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant has a body mass index (BMI = weight [kg]/(height [m])2) between 18 and 30&#xD;
             kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening and baseline as verified by the Investigator prior to the first dose of IP.&#xD;
             She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and prior&#xD;
             to discharge from the study site. This applies even if the FCBP participant practices&#xD;
             true abstinence from heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. FCBP must either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;
             reviewed on a weekly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to use, and&#xD;
             be able to comply with, highly effective methods of contraception without&#xD;
             interruption, during the study (including any dose interruptions), and for at least 28&#xD;
             days after discontinuation of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If previously taking a hormonal OC, she must agree to continue using (or switch over&#xD;
             to, if applicable) Ortho Tri-Cyclen® or its generic equivalent, which is to be&#xD;
             provided by the study center, throughout the study.&#xD;

             bilateral oophorectomy; proper documentation is required) at least 6 months before&#xD;
             screening, or be postmenopausal (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses&#xD;
             before screening, with a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level of &gt; 40 IU/L at&#xD;
             screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participant has clinical laboratory safety test results that are within normal limits&#xD;
             or considered not clinically significant by the Investigator. In addition, ALT, AST,&#xD;
             and total bilirubin must be less than the upper limit of normal at screening and on&#xD;
             Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participant is afebrile, with supine systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 140 mmHg,&#xD;
