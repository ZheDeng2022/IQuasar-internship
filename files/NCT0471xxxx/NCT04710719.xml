  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been many modalities utilized in the treatment of keloids of the head and neck,&#xD;
      however none have been universally successful. The most widely utilized non-surgical&#xD;
      intervention is primary intralesional injection with triamcinolone (TAC) which inhibits the&#xD;
      proliferation of fibroblasts, inhibits collagen synthesis, and increases collagenase&#xD;
      production, or fluorouracil (5-FU), a potent inhibitor of fibroblast proliferation. Despite&#xD;
      the abundance of studies evaluating primary intralesional injection for keloids, there are&#xD;
      limited studies available regarding the efficacy of primary surgical excision followed by&#xD;
      adjuvant intralesional injection. The proposed study herein would serve to improve the level&#xD;
      of evidence and to establish the safety and efficacy of combined intralesional TAC+5FU for&#xD;
      keloids following surgical excision.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial of patients who elect for&#xD;
      surgical treatment of keloids at the Center for Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at&#xD;
      Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOLRMC), a tertiary referral center affiliated&#xD;
      with the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) teaching system. Power&#xD;
      analysis estimated approximately 134 patients total (67 per group) for 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      difference at the 5% confidence level. This is based off of a prior group's study comparing&#xD;
      primary intralesional injection with TAC vs TAC+5FU (no surgery). That study showed 39.2%&#xD;
      recurrence with TAC vs 17.5% with TAC+5FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to one of two arms: surgical&#xD;
      excision+TAC or surgical excision+TAC+5FU. Randomization will be performed using a permuted&#xD;
      block randomization algorithm (Ex. AABBABABABBABBAA, where A=TAC only group and B=TAC +5FU).&#xD;
      All patients will undergo surgical excision of the keloid, either under general anesthesia in&#xD;
      the operating room or local anesthesia in the clinic setting depending on patient age and&#xD;
      preference. The goal of excision will be complete extra-lesional excision with primary&#xD;
      closure. It will be noted if a patient requires intra-lesional excision or additional&#xD;
      reconstructive techniques such as advancement flap, skin grafting, or allografting (i.e.&#xD;
      Integra). Monofilament sutures will be used preferentially to prevent local inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction which can precipitate keloid formation. In group 1 (surgical excision+TAC), all&#xD;
      patients will be treated with adjuvant intralesional TAC 40mg/mL 7-10 days post-op and then&#xD;
      every 4 weeks for a total of 3 injections. The triamcinolone vial will be obtained from&#xD;
      pharmacy and drawn up by the physician prior to injection. In group 2 (surgical&#xD;
      excision+TAC+5FU), all patients will be treated with adjuvant intralesional TAC and 5FU at a&#xD;
      dose of 0.1mg TAC for every 0.9mg 5FU 7-10 days post-op then every 4 weeks for a total of 3&#xD;
      injections. The mixture of TAC+5FU will be prepared by the pharmacy and delivered to the&#xD;
      physician prior to injection. The goal volume of injection for both arms of the study will be&#xD;
      0.1cc per cm2 of scar excised, though any deviations from this and the rationale will be&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after completion of treatment. At&#xD;
      each time point, a member of the study team and patient will complete their respective&#xD;
      portion of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) which has been proven as a&#xD;
      reliable and valid method of assessing keloid scars (5). The observer portion of the survey&#xD;
      to be completed by the study team assesses vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, pliability,&#xD;
      and surface area of the lesion. The patient portion of the survey focuses on the overall&#xD;
      cosmetic and functional sequela including pain, itching, color, stiffness, thickness, and&#xD;
      irregularity. Patients will also be asked about any side effects experienced. Each portion of&#xD;
      the POSAS will be blinded from the study team member and the participant until both have&#xD;
      completed the survey at each visit, so that one set of answers will not bias the other. If a&#xD;
      patient demonstrates signs of recurrence or return of symptoms, there will be the option for&#xD;
      additional injections within the patient's originally designated study arm. However, if early&#xD;
      analysis demonstrates the alternative study arm to have superior efficacy, there will be the&#xD;
      option to continue injections with the alternative study arm injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will include demographic data such as age, gender, race, and Fitzpatrick skin&#xD;
      type, as well as location of the keloid, etiology (trauma, post-surgical, etc.), and prior&#xD;
      treatments if any. The size and thickness of each lesion, secondary defect size following&#xD;
      adjacent tissue transfer, and amount of adjuvant medication injected during each adjuvant&#xD;
      injection will be collected. Data analysis will include overall efficacy as well as&#xD;
      stratification by variables such as the location of the lesion, size of the lesion, and prior&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
