      The aim of our study is to investigate the validity and reliability of the Occupational&#xD;
      Sitting And Physical Activity Questionnaire (OSPAQ) scale in Turkish by making a cultural&#xD;
      adaptation in office workers, which was developed to evaluate work-related sitting, standing,&#xD;
      walking and doing heavy work. 100 office workers will be included in the study. Physical&#xD;
      activity level of office workers will be evaluated with Turkish OSPAQ and International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire.&#xD;

      It is reported that those who do desk work in working life act less as a result of their&#xD;
      professional requirements. Considering the benefits of physical activity, it is recommended&#xD;
      that the risks of desk workers, especially those in the risk group who produce work by&#xD;
      consuming less energy, should be reduced and encouraged to participate in physical activity&#xD;
      at a level and manner suitable for a healthier life. For this reason, it is important to&#xD;
      determine the level of physical activity according to different variables in individuals&#xD;
      working at desk jobs.The aim of our study is to evaluate the validity and reliability of the&#xD;
      &quot;Occupational Sitting And Physical Activity Questionnaire (OSPAQ)&quot; scale in Turkish, which&#xD;
      was developed to evaluate the situation of sitting, standing, walking and doing heavy work.&#xD;
      All forms will be sent through the media. 100 office workers will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Physical activity level of office workers will be evaluated by Turkish OSPAQ and&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire. For the reliability study, after 7 days, the&#xD;
      physical activity of office workers will be re-evaluated with Turkish OSPAQ. Factor analysis&#xD;
      methods will be used to examine the factor structure of the scale, correlation analysis&#xD;
      (Pearson and Spearman coefficients) in validity analysis and test-retest reliability.&#xD;
      Cronbach alpha analysis will be used in the reliability analysis.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 7 day</time_frame>
    <description>The OSPAQ is a brief instrument to record the proportion of work time spent sitting, standing, walking, and doing heavy labour, as well as the total length of time worked in the past five working days. Participants will be asked to indicate the percentage of time spent on those activities during working hours on a typical working day. The participants will be received a slightly adjusted instruction to fill in the OSPAQ compared to other studies, namely to keep in mind a typical working day instead of the last seven working days (i.e. &quot;How would you describe a typical working day in your current job? This only includes your working day. Commuting and everything outside the work setting is not included.&quot;). So when accumulating all percentages a total percentage of 100 was obtained: for example, 55% occupational sitting, 25% walking, 15% standing, and 5% performing heavy labour.</description>

    <measure>International physical activity questionnaire short form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 7 day</time_frame>
    <description>The IPAQ has since become the most widely used physical activity questionnaire, with two versions available: the 31 item long form (IPAQ-LF) and the 9 item short form (IPAQ-SF). The short form records the activity of four intensity levels: 1) vigorous-intensity activity such as aerobics, 2) moderate-intensity activity such as leisure cycling, 3) walking, and 4) sitting. The original authors recommended the &quot;last 7 day recall&quot; version of the IPAQ-SF for physical activity surveillance studies, in part because the burden on participants to report their activity is small.</description>
