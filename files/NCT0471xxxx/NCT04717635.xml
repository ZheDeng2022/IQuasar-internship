  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III study designed to provide efficacy and safety data for canakinumab&#xD;
      administered for at least 48 weeks as subcutaneous (s.c.) injection every 4 weeks (q4wk) in&#xD;
      Japanese patients with Adult Onset Still's Disease (AOSD). Interim analysis (IA) data at Week&#xD;
      28 and 48 from this study supports a registration submission of canakinumab in the indication&#xD;
      of Adult still's disease (ASD) in Japan.&#xD;

    <description>DAS28-CRP is a composite index, validated for RA patients and takes into account the following items: Tender joint count (number of tender joints; 0-28); swollen joint count (number of swollen joints; 0-28); C-reactive protein (mg/l) and Global Health (Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity; from 0=best to 100=worst). Thus, given the reliability, validity, and ability of DAS28 to discriminate the severity of joint involvement, this index has been used in other rheumatic diseases characterized by RA-like poly-articular involvement. Of note, a DAS28 score &gt; 5.1 implies active disease, ≤3.2 low disease activity, and &lt;2.6 remission. Moderate/high disease activity is defined as a DAS28 higher than 3.2.</description>
