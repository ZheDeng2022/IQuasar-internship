  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study. The main aim is to determine the expression of potential&#xD;
      biomarker genes in the cumulus cells isolated from individual oocytes in two patient cohorts:&#xD;
      recombinant human Follicle Stimulating Hormone(hFSH) and recombinant hFSH:human Luteinizing&#xD;
      Hormone(r-hLH) ratio 2:1. Algorithms from gene combinations will be identified that predict&#xD;
      embryo quality and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

        response, and need to be naïve to IVF/ ICSI or have only one prior ICSI cycle. Only&#xD;
        patients with 7-18 follicles at the end of ovarian stimulation will be allowed to enter the&#xD;
        study on the day of decision of hCG injection (or the day before). Patients with fewer than&#xD;
        7 oocytes will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
