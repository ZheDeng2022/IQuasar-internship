    <textblock>
      This study represents a prospective, non-randomized, dual-center clinical study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of the CapBuster System in crossing a de novo or restenotic&#xD;
      infrapopliteal chronic total occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of safety and efficacy will be assessed through 30 days post-intervention.&#xD;

      The diagnostic and interventional procedure can be conducted via contralateral or antegrade&#xD;
      approach and arterial access will be obtained utilizing standard percutaneous techniques and&#xD;
      devices. Baseline angiographic images will be obtained prior to the study intervention to&#xD;
      confirm the presence of a peripheral arterial occlusion. These images will include the target&#xD;
      lesion as well as inflow and outflow with ipsilateral run off to the distal foot. If&#xD;
      angiographic imaging confirms that the subject meets enrollment criteria, the enrolled&#xD;
      subject will then undergo the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigator determines that treatment is required of non-target arterial lesions, the&#xD;
      treatment may be performed during the study index procedure according to the investigator's&#xD;
      standard practices using commercially available devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to utilization of the CapBuster system, the investigator will attempt to cross the&#xD;
      target lesion CTO utilizing conventional catheters and guidewires. To minimize vessel trauma,&#xD;
      attempted guidewire crossing time will be limited to no more than 5 minutes. The crossing&#xD;
      time will begin when the guidewire reaches the lesion CTO cap and will end after occlusion is&#xD;
      successfully crossed with confirmed wire placement in the true lumen. If successful crossing&#xD;
      is achieved with a conventional guidewire, the CapBuster system will not be utilized. The&#xD;
      subject will be a screen failure and will not be considered enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If crossing attempt is not successful with a conventional guidewire, the CapBuster system&#xD;
      will be utilized. A subject is considered enrolled in the study upon introduction of the&#xD;
      CapBuster system into the subject's vasculature. The CapBuster support catheter will be&#xD;
      inserted over a conventional guidewire and advanced until the distal tip reaches the CTO cap.&#xD;
      The CapBuster 3.0 mm diameter balloon is then inflated to stabilize the system within the&#xD;
      arterial vessel. The conventional guidewire is replaced with the CapBuster penetrating wire&#xD;
      and, under fluoroscopic guidance, the penetrating wire is manually rotated to penetrate the&#xD;
      CTO cap. The balloon pressure may be increased to ensure proper apposition with the vessel&#xD;
      wall and maximize stability. Following penetration of the cap, the penetrating wire is&#xD;
      replaced with a conventional steerable guidewire. Standard wire escalation techniques will be&#xD;
      utilized for continued advancement of the conventional guidewire and complete crossing of the&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiography is performed to confirm guidewire placement. Successful crossing is defined as&#xD;
      guidewire placement within the true lumen proximal and distal to the target lesion without&#xD;
      utilization of a re-entry device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successful crossing is achieved, the target lesion may be treated per Investigator&#xD;
      discretion with commercially available devices.&#xD;
