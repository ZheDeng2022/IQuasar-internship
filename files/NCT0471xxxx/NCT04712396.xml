  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, fixed sequence study in healthy subjects (vasectomized&#xD;
      males and females of non-childbearing potential), performed at a single study centre.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 21 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fixed sequence of 3 treatment periods: Treatment Period 1: Capivasertib only,&#xD;
           Treatment Period 2: Itraconazole pre-treatment (run-in) period, and Treatment Period 3:&#xD;
           Capivasertib and itraconazole in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Visit at 7 to 14 days after the last capivasertib PK sample in Treatment&#xD;
           Period 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no washout between Treatment Period 2 and Treatment Period 3. Each subject will&#xD;
      be involved in the study for up to 7 weeks.&#xD;
