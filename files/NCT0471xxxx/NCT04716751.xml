  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety: frequency of severe adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of severe adverse events from the participants enrolling to 30 days after the last drug administration or 30 days after surgery or new anti-cancer therapy, which comes first.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Major pathologic response (MPR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>MPR is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved major pathologic response (on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, tumors with no more than 10% viable tumor cells) in all participants who have completed the neoadjuvant therapy before surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as the time from enrollment to death of participant due to any cause. In the case of a patient who still survives at the time of analysis, the date of last contact will be taken as the censoring date. In the event of a patient with the survival status unknown, the date when the patient is last known to be alive will be used for interpolation (censoring).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the enrollment of the subject to the first determination of disease progression or death of any cause according to RECISTv1.1, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of remission (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>According to the time from the first recording of objective remission to relapse or death from any cause determined by RECISTv1.1, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients whose best overall remission (BOR) is CR, PR or disease stable (SD) according to RECISTv1.1 evaluation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health related quality of life (HRQol)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment is made according to the Quality of Life Scale for Lung Cancer Patients (EORTC-QLQ-C30 &amp; LC13, Version 3). EORTC's QLQ-C30 &amp; LC13 (V3.0) is a core scale for lung cancer patients, with a total of 43 items. Among them, Item 29 and 30 are divided into seven grades, which are assigned with 1 to 7 scores according to the answer options. The other items are divided into 4 grades</description>
