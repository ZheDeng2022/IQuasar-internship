  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the most important factor in the etiology of COPD. Some of the patients with COPD&#xD;
      continue to smoke despite knowing this situation or they cannot quit even if they want.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is; To examine patients with COPD who continue to smoke in terms of&#xD;
      perception of dyspnea, exercise capacity, psychological symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed prospectively. Patients with COPD who apply to the pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation outpatient clinic will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of patients with COPD who are eligible for PR and have been pre-evaluated will be&#xD;
      scanned. Respiratory function test, arterial blood gas analysis, six-minute walking test&#xD;
      (6-MWT), mMRC Dyspnea Scale, St George Quality of Life Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety&#xD;
      Depression Scale will be used in the study. Patients with COPD who smoke will constitute the&#xD;
      study group, and those who quit smoking will constitute the control group.&#xD;

    <description>Pulmonary Function Test Pulmonary function test (PFT) which is noninvasive tests that show how well the lungs are working. The tests will measure FEV1; It is the volume of air (in liters) exhaled in the first second during forced exhalation after maximal inspiration.&#xD;
FVC: It s the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from your lungs after taking the deepest breath possible, as measured by spirometry FEV1/FVC: It represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) to the full, forced vital capacity (FVC).</description>

    <description>St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to determine disease-specific quality of life. At this scale, high scores define worsened disease and increased symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Inventory for assessment of anxiety and depression. In this scale; scores of anxiety and depression are calculated separately. The maximum score for both is 21 and high scores correspond to high degree anxiety and depression. Cut-off scores for anxiety and depression were determined as 10/11 and 7/8 respectively.</description>
