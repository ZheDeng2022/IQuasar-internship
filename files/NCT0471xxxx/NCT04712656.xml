  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the effect of continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on 24-hour mean blood pressure (BP) in patients with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) varies between symptom phenotypes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, cohort study involving patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe OSA. This study will compare OSA patients who accept and comply with CPAP&#xD;
      therapy versus those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables of Interest: 24-hour ambulatory BP, sitting BP, electrocardiogram (ECG), facial&#xD;
      photographs, psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), questionnaires, and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete questionnaires that pertain to demographics, lifestyle factors, and&#xD;
      co-morbidities associated with CVD. The blood samples will be used to look for evidence of&#xD;
      diabetes; elevated lipids; markers of heart injury, inflammation, and coagulation; and&#xD;
      genetic information. Measurements will be collected at baseline and at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients enrolled in this study will be contacted by telephone once a year over&#xD;
      a ten year period. The purpose of the telephone interview is to determine if they are using&#xD;
      any treatment for OSA, if they have developed any new health problems such as a heart attack&#xD;
      or stroke, and if they have changed any of their usual medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Approach: To correct for potential bias in the non-randomized comparison, we&#xD;
      will apply a Propensity Score (PS) Design via subclassification. Models to derive the PS&#xD;
      values used in this design will include a number of covariates relevant to CPAP adherence and&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes, including age, sex, obesity (BMI, neck circumference, waist-to-hip&#xD;
      ratio), current smoking, prevalent CVD at baseline, history of hypertension, HbA1c, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (history, medications), lipid profile, hyperlipidemia (history, medications), family&#xD;
      history of premature coronary disease, Charlson comorbidity index, physical activity (IPAQ),&#xD;
      diet, OSA severity (AHI, ODI4, T90), sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), educational&#xD;
      attainment, socioeconomic status (postcode), insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Symptom&#xD;
      Questionnaire), anxiety and depression-related symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2),&#xD;
      self-efficacy (General self-efficacy scale), and medication adherence (Medication Adherence&#xD;
      Report Scale [MARS-5]). Baseline values of outcome measures will also be included in the PS&#xD;
      model. After creating the PS design, all analyses are performed accounting for PS subclass as&#xD;
      a categorical stratification factor. Evaluations of the CPAP effect on binary outcomes are&#xD;
      performed utilizing conditional logistic regression. Similarly, CPAP effects in the context&#xD;
      of survival analyses (e.g., Cox Proportional Hazards models) or on continuous outcomes (e.g.,&#xD;
      linear regression) are assessed by including PS subclass as a categorical covariate in all&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
