  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol is a major modifiable risk factor for breast cancer in women, yet this is not widely&#xD;
      understood by health practitioners or policy makers, let alone the general population. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to test the effects of a targeted alcohol and lifestyle brief intervention&#xD;
      for women attending breast screening services, to improve knowledge of alcohol as a risk&#xD;
      factor for breast cancer and reduce harmful alcohol use.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The intervention arm will receive 4 minutes of alcohol brief intervention, and 3 minutes of lifestyle health promotion (physical activity; maintaining a healthy weight), to increase knowledge of how to improve women's health and reduce breast cancer risk. Alcohol and lifestyle information will be delivered by way of an animation on an iPad. Participant responses to questions about current alcohol use will branch to personalised feedback consistent with level of alcohol consumption (i.e. drinking within or above current Australian Alcohol Guidelines).&#xD;
Take-home pamphlets - a pamphlet summarising the alcohol information presented during the animation, and a pamphlet on nutrition to maintain a healthy weight, will be provided.</description>

    <description>Nested within the lifestyle health promotion provided in both conditions, participants randomised to the experimental condition will receive an alcohol brief intervention. The strong evidence-base for alcohol brief intervention, amplified by Co-Investigators' Smith and Bragge's (BehaviourWorks) approaches to applied behaviour change, has provided the framework for the development of the alcohol brief intervention used in this study. This intervention comprises personalised feedback on alcohol consumption levels, comparison to gender/age drinking norms, and information and behaviour-change content regarding alcohol consumption (i.e. negative-framed messaging around alcohol risks and harms, positive-framed messaging on the health benefits of reducing alcohol intake, alcohol harm reduction strategies).</description>
