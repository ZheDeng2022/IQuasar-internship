      In recent years, large interest in the conduct and focus of clinical trials has focused to&#xD;
      patient related outcomes and value-based healthcare. Patient Reported Outcome MeasureS,&#xD;
      (PROMs) has become one of the standard instruments used for measuring outcomes; multiple&#xD;
      PROMS have been extensively validated and are used in many clinical studies, but also in&#xD;
      clinical routine. Additionally, Patient Reported Experience MeasureS (PREMS) allow for&#xD;
      real-time feedback on the integration of care and can subsequently drive changes in health&#xD;
      provision systems. In the present trial, the mode of delivery of PROMS is examined in terms&#xD;
      of effectivity and patient experience (PREMS) in the setting of breast disease.&#xD;

      In recent years, large interest in the conduct and focus of clinical trials has focused to&#xD;
      patient related outcomes and value-based healthcare. Patient Reported Outcome MeasureS,&#xD;
      (PROMs) has become one of the standard instruments used for measuring outcomes; multiple&#xD;
      PROMS have been extensively validated and are used in many clinical studies, but also in&#xD;
      clinical routine. This is certainly the case for patients with breast disease, and in&#xD;
      particular, breast cancer, where therapeutic advances in systemic and locoregional treatment&#xD;
      have dramatically improved survival outcomes and shifted the interest in patient wellness,&#xD;
      quality of life and health economy. However, their introduction and implementation require&#xD;
      the development of certain logistics involving delivery to the patients, data procession and&#xD;
      finally inclusion in patient journals and/or trial case report forms (CRFs).Additionally,&#xD;
      Patient Reported Experience MeasureS (PREMS) allow for real-time feedback on the integration&#xD;
      of care and can subsequently drive changes in health provision systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the paper-version of these PROMs, pPROMs, has been the standard version. With this&#xD;
      comes some advantages, such as the ability to save and store filled PROMS, and for patients&#xD;
      to fill them out when it suits them best, not having to answer all questions at once. At the&#xD;
      same time, there are also disadvantages, such as that storing and processing the data is a&#xD;
      tedious and resource-consuming task. Additionally, patients occasionally find it inconvenient&#xD;
      to return the pPROMS by post; finally, the consumption of paper is not viewed as a&#xD;
      environmentally friendly behaviour. At the same time and in the new era of digitalization,&#xD;
      internet-based studies, such as surveys, become more popular. Most validated PROMS have been&#xD;
      utilised in several occasions, and there is an effort for their standardisation in health&#xD;
      care. These e-PROMs (electronic PROMs) seem to be more time-efficient since they do not have&#xD;
      to be processed manually, but instead can be directly connected to digital systems which&#xD;
      transform raw data (patient response) to big data and scores. It is also a more&#xD;
      environment-friendly option since there is no need to print the questionnaires on paper or&#xD;
      send them via mail to the patients and then back to the research centre. The question is how&#xD;
      patients feel about these electronic versions and if their implementation may simplify PROMS,&#xD;
      both for patients and healthcare givers and researchers alike. Even though the older&#xD;
      generation at greater length is connected to the internet than before, and are more used to&#xD;
      handling it, there are still those who are not comfortable with these new digital services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this being a reasonable hypothesis, no trials have examined this subject, that is to&#xD;
      map the patients' attitudes toward participating in studies, nor which form is the preferred&#xD;
      one, ePROMs or pPROMS. It would be reasonable to hypothesize that a more convenient mode of&#xD;
      delivery would facilitate patients and would therefore increase response rates. Additionally,&#xD;
      there is no randomized data on the optimal mode of PROMS delivery and process as far as&#xD;
      monetary, personnel and structural resources are concerned&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference population for the trial are women from the breast radiology unit, breast&#xD;
      outpatient clinic and breast cancer patients from the oncology department of the&#xD;
      participating sites. Patients will be asked to participate to this study through a letter&#xD;
      sent they receive when receiving their appointment to the respective clinic/department. All&#xD;
      patients are asked, regardless of diagnosis, sex or age; at this point, the researchers are&#xD;
      not aware of individual information. If they consent, participants are randomised to either&#xD;
      e-PROMs or pPROMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial hypothesis is that ePROMs are more convenient and time-efficient and that with these&#xD;
      investigators can increase the response rate from 65% (which was observed in a pilot study&#xD;
      previously conducted at the breast outpatient clinic at Uppsala University Hospital) to&#xD;
      80%.The trial is designed as a superiority trial to detect for a 0.15 difference between&#xD;
      arms, with a 2-sided p-value=0.05 and 80% power. Sample size calculation was performed with&#xD;
      (SampleSize4ClinicalTrials and TrialSize packages). This responds to 109 patients per arm.&#xD;
      Patient allocation (1:1) is performed through permuted block randomisation performed on the R&#xD;
      statistical software (randomizeR package) in blocks of 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that provide oral and written consent for the trial are anonymised and receive a&#xD;
      unique study number. They willingly provide contact details (address and e-mail address), in&#xD;
      order to receive PROMS after randomization. Patients may decline mode of PROMS delivery, if&#xD;
      they prefer otherwise. Patient preference is registered. In analyses, the&#xD;
      &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; principle will be followed, but per protocol analyses is intended if the&#xD;
      crossover is deemed significant (&gt;10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data process and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once filled out, the anonymised ePROMs will be automatically stored to the Uppsala University&#xD;
      servers. They are extractable as a Microsoft Excel data sheet. pPROMS will be stored in paper&#xD;
      form in a safe location at the participating site. All raw data from both arms will be&#xD;
      transferred in an Excel database. This raw data will be processed through algorithms specific&#xD;
      to each PROMS to allow for the calculation of the respective PROMS scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time required for this procedure will be registered for statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data to be utilised in the analysis is age and site of recruitment. Other data to be&#xD;
      registered are monetary costs for pPROMS postal, monetary costs for pPROMS related consumable&#xD;
      materials and hourly cost for the documentation and registration of PROMS in patient&#xD;
      electronic journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and patient safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data will be treated according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The&#xD;
      trial is not expected to affect treatment of patients or affect diagnostic work-up or&#xD;
      treatment modality. Participants will not receive monetary compensation. For participants&#xD;
      that are wishing it, PROMS scores will be included in their journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial results are expected to be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
      Positive and negative results as well as subgroup analyses for primary characteristics such&#xD;
      as patient age are expected to be reported.&#xD;
