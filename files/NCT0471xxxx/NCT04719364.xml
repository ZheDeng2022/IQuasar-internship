    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a one and one-half year mixed-methods study to evaluate&#xD;
      self-reported sexual risk, knowledge and barriers/facilitators of PrEP use, and preferences&#xD;
      of oral, injectable, and implantable PrEP treatment modalities-as a function of race and age,&#xD;
      and experience with intersectional discrimination. The first qualitative phase of our study&#xD;
      would be conducted over the first eight months, followed by a quantitative phase that will&#xD;
      collect data via online cross-sectional survey over the remaining ten months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods project will evaluate PrEP awareness and potential impact of new dosing&#xD;
      strategies/modalities on PrEP uptake among men who have sex with men (MSM)-the target group&#xD;
      at highest risk for infection and at highest priority for PrEP use based on high risk sexual&#xD;
      behaviors (condomless anal intercourse). The proposed project utilizes both qualitative&#xD;
      analysis of focus group data from MSM study participants, as well as quantitative analysis of&#xD;
      results from a survey informed by results of the qualitative phase of our project. It should&#xD;
      be noted that while the investigators will target a racially diverse MSM study population,&#xD;
      participation in our study may include MSM who also inject drugs (MSM-PWID) who express&#xD;
      interest in study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a one and one-half year mixed-methods study to evaluate&#xD;
      self-reported sexual risk, knowledge and barriers/facilitators of PrEP use, and preferences&#xD;
      of oral, injectable, and implantable PrEP treatment modalities-as a function of race and age,&#xD;
      and experience with intersectional discrimination. The first qualitative phase of our study&#xD;
      would be conducted over the first eight months, followed by a quantitative phase that will&#xD;
      collect data via online cross-sectional survey over the remaining ten months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment for both qualitative and quantitative parts of our project will occur through&#xD;
      events sponsored by the Philly Ballroom Community, freeHIVTest.Net, GALAEI and COLOURS&#xD;
      (CBOs), and Drexel's HIV Clinical Center, the Partnership Comprehensive Care Practice. For&#xD;
      our quantitative survey, the investigators plan to enhance our recruitment using online&#xD;
      social media sites that especially target BMSM and HLMSM, and Google Words-the investigators&#xD;
      will display links to our study that will enable recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For qualitative work, the investigators plan to conduct six focus groups of 5 MSM each (total&#xD;
      = 30 participants), each restricted by race and age (Black, White, or Hispanic/Latino (either&#xD;
      Black or White) and age (18-39 yrs. of age and &gt; 40 yrs. of age). Four to six focus groups&#xD;
      are usually recommended to reach saturation. Given probable cultural and age-specific&#xD;
      differences of PrEP awareness and knowledge, as well as barriers or facilitators, and&#xD;
      preference for specific treatment modalities, the investigators plan to restrict group&#xD;
      participation by race and age as outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from the 30 focus group participants will be analyzed using standard&#xD;
      qualitative analytic approaches (Months 7-8). Drexel University's Dornsife School of Public&#xD;
      Health have available a wide range of qualitative data analysis software and strategies for&#xD;
      more sophisticated coding, retrieval, and concept development of the information collected in&#xD;
      the focus groups. The investigators will utilize standard qualitative techniques, including&#xD;
      inductive code identification and development and associated documentation through marginal&#xD;
      remarks and memos. Inductive coding (&quot;open coding&quot;) involves a data-based approach to the&#xD;
      identification of key themes (codes). This approach encourages a conceptualization and&#xD;
      organizational framework of the data from a grounded perspective. NVivo, a system for the&#xD;
      management, interpretation and analysis of qualitative data, will be used in this process.&#xD;
      Results from the qualitative phase of our project will be used to inform/add to the content&#xD;
      of our study instrument to collect data during the second, quantitative phase of our project.&#xD;
      For the quantitative, cross-sectional survey, the investigators plan to enroll equal numbers&#xD;
      of White, Black, and Hispanic/Latino MSM (100 members per racial/ethnic group, for a total of&#xD;
      300 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design for this quantitative phase will be cross-sectional, with analysis conducted&#xD;
      from a sample of 300 PrEP eligible study participants. The investigators plan to enroll a&#xD;
      racially and ethnically diverse study population with 1/3 each White non-Hispanics, Black&#xD;
      non-Hispanics, and Hispanic/Latinos. Participants will be recruited in-person at our local&#xD;
      CBOs and online. Enrollment and survey conduct will occur at CBO sites and at Drexel's&#xD;
      Partnership Comprehensive Care Clinic, as described above. It should be noted that&#xD;
      participants in the qualitative phase of our study will be ineligible to participate in the&#xD;
      quantitative phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Survey Data. Study participants will use online audio-assisted Red Cap surveys&#xD;
      to provide information about demographics, recent sexual risk behaviors, awareness and&#xD;
      knowledge concerning PrEP, barriers and facilitators of PrEP use, preference for treatment&#xD;
      modalities, and experiences with discrimination. Collection of data will be facilitated by&#xD;
      staff at CBO sites, who will log participants onto our study survey data collection site, and&#xD;
      who will be available to answer questions/provide clarification as needed. Surveys will be&#xD;
      offered in both English and Spanish. The use of audio-assisted self-interviewing is&#xD;
      particularly appropriate for collecting data from participants with limited literacy and&#xD;
      provides a sense of confidentiality to decrease possibility of prevarication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey Items&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics. Survey items will include: Race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic/Latino), age&#xD;
      (continuous), education level (less than high school, high school graduate, some college&#xD;
      courses or 2 year degree, 4 year college graduate, graduate school courses or degree),&#xD;
      employment status, annual income, and self-identified sexual orientation, and perceived need&#xD;
      to not disclose/hide one's gay/bi/MSM identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual Behaviors. Behavioral data will include 60 day recall of number of men and women with&#xD;
      whom participants have had anal or vaginal sex (as appropriate for partners' gender/sex), and&#xD;
      for partners with whom participants had anal or vaginal sex: consistency of condom use with&#xD;
      partners for whom HIV status was unknown or if partners were HIV-positive; consistency of&#xD;
      condom use with partners for whom HIV status known and were HIV-negative; and whether&#xD;
      participants have been diagnosed with bacterial STIs within the recall period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awareness of PrEP. Survey items concerning awareness of PrEP will be taken from the National&#xD;
      HIV Behavioral Risk Surveillance System (NHBS). Survey items will be adapted from national&#xD;
      survey questions, and well as questions specific to Philadelphia (see draft study instrument&#xD;
      in Appendix). Essentially, participants will be asked whether they have heard of PrEP or&#xD;
      Truvada (by name), or if they have heard of medication that would prevent HIV infection if&#xD;
      taken daily, or if they have heard of medication (PEP) that is taken after high-risk sexual&#xD;
      contact (event-driven regimen). Participants will also be asked if they would reduce use of&#xD;
      condoms for anal intercourse and increase the number of sexual partners if they were to take&#xD;
      PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers and Facilitators of PrEP Use. Survey items will be adapted from the NHBS and&#xD;
      previously published work by Golub and colleagues (2013) concerning perceived barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators of PrEP. Barriers to PrEP use will include: Not being at risk for HIV, not&#xD;
      providing full protection from HIV infection, short-term side effects, long-term health&#xD;
      effects, stigma/embarrassment around using PrEP, and being too expensive for me/no insurance.&#xD;
      Facilitators of PrEP use will include: Being at risk for HIV infection, PrEP will protect&#xD;
      from HIV, PrEP will simplify having sex with no need to use condoms, PrEP will simplify&#xD;
      having sex with no need to discuss safe sex or HIV status, PrEP is available at no cost to&#xD;
      me, I could get ready access to support services (HIV/STI testing and access to sexual&#xD;
      health/care monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preference for Specific Treatment Modalities. This survey will include items concerning&#xD;
      likelihood of using PrEP based on different treatment availability: oral daily dosing,&#xD;
      monthly injectable dosing, and yearly implantable dosing of PrEP. A five-point Likert-like&#xD;
      scale will be used for each of these, ranging from 'Not at all likely' to 'Fully likely. For&#xD;
      those who respond with being 'Somewhat likely' or Fully likely' to used PrEP for each dosing&#xD;
      modality, the investigators will ask follow-up questions concerning reasons for higher&#xD;
      acceptability including convenience and discretion when non-disclosure of PrEP use is&#xD;
      desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiences with Intersectional Discrimination. The investigators will adapt a newly&#xD;
      published, intersectional discrimination scale developed by Scheim and Bauer (2019) that&#xD;
      measures experiences with and anticipation of discrimination &quot;because of who patients are&quot;,&#xD;
      capturing multiple minority identities-including being Black or Hispanic/Latino and being a&#xD;
      MSM. In our case, the investigators will use the scale to measure intersectional&#xD;
      discrimination in our study population and compare levels (continuous) between specific&#xD;
      categories-being BMSM and 18-39 yrs. of age, BMSM &gt; 40 yrs. of age, HLMSM and 18-39 yrs. of&#xD;
      age, HLMSM &gt; 40 yrs. of age, WMSM and 18-39 yrs. of age, and WMSM &gt; 40 yrs. of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Analysis. Descriptive analysis will be performed using data fields outlined and&#xD;
      listed above. For binary or categorical variables, proportion of study participants was given&#xD;
      responses will be listed for the entire sample, and proportions will be stratified by race&#xD;
      and age as described above. Thus the investigators initially plan to summarize demographics&#xD;
      of our sample, including age, race, level of education, whether or not participants are&#xD;
      employed, income levels, and self-reported sexual orientation. The investigators will then&#xD;
      measure these rates by race and age, comparing differences in proportions across&#xD;
      racial/ethnic and age groups by chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests if data are sparse.&#xD;
      For each data field, results will be presented as proportion reporting response options by&#xD;
      subgroup, with p-values associated with statistical testing. The convention of p-values &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 as criteria for statistical significance will be utilized for analysis. For variables&#xD;
      that are measured continuously, the investigators will use either Student's t-tests (for&#xD;
      normally distributed data) or nonparametric methods such as Wilcoxon rank sum tests are not&#xD;
      normally distributed data. For each data field median values will be presented along with&#xD;
      associated 25%-75% interquartile ranges. Again, p-values will be given for subgroup&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to test for differences of distributions/levels of sexual behaviors&#xD;
      including frequency of condomless anal intercourse, awareness of PrEP, barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators of PrEP use, preference for specific PrEP treatment modalities, and experiences&#xD;
      with discrimination between subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression Analysis. Subsequently, the investigators will conduct univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      regression to identify whether beliefs concerning one's HIV risk, frequencies of sexual&#xD;
      behaviors, and level of experience with discrimination (all potential explanatory variables)&#xD;
      are associated with awareness PrEP (yes/no), level of knowledge of PrEP effectiveness (high&#xD;
      vs. lower), report of specific barriers and facilitators of PrEP use (yes/no), and preference&#xD;
      for injectable or implantable PrEP treatment modalities-all dependent or outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each explanatory variable the investigators will estimate outcome variable prevalence&#xD;
      ratios using PROC GENMOD (log-linked binomial model) or PROC LOGISTIC (logistic models). The&#xD;
      investigators will report unadjusted prevalence ratios with associated 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals and p-values. Ultimately, multiple regression will be used to evaluate estimates of&#xD;
      outcome prevalence ratios for explanatory variables, adjusted for confounders that are&#xD;
      identified vis-à-vis descriptive analysis and univariate regression. Standard criteria to&#xD;
      assess confounding will be used, including a 10% change in the magnitude of association of&#xD;
      the independent variables with the various outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify potential effect modification, stratified analysis (by race/ethnicity, and age)&#xD;
      will be conducted, and Wald tests to evaluate homogeneity will be used to test for&#xD;
      differences of stratum-specific odds ratios.&#xD;
