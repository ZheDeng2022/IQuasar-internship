      An interventional hospital based study will be undertaken from February 2021 to February 2023&#xD;
      in order to determine the efficacy of platelet rich plasma as a new modality for treatment of&#xD;
      patients suffering from atrophic rhinitis in Sohag university hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Random sample will be taken from patients presenting with atrophic rhinitis to ear, nose&#xD;
           and throat outpatient clinic in Sohag University Hospital during the period extending&#xD;
           from February 2021 to October 2022 (taking in consideration the follow up time of the&#xD;
           last case which will take four months). Patients will be divided randomly into two&#xD;
           groups. The division of patients subjected to treatment will be obtained by a random&#xD;
           sequence of computer generated numbers. One group will be subjected to submucosal&#xD;
           platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection (study group) and the other group will be subjected&#xD;
           to the usual conservative lines of treatment including nasal douchings, frequent local&#xD;
           care and mucosal lubricants (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full history taking and clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptom score, sinonasal outcome test-25 (SNOT 25) will be noted at the beginning and&#xD;
           after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnostic nasal endoscopy and the results will be noted under four objective variables;&#xD;
           these will be noted and the scores at the beginning and the end of 12 weeks of therapy&#xD;
           will be statistically compared in both groups; 1. Crusting (nil = 0, minimal=1, gross =&#xD;
           2) 2. Status of nasal mucosa (normal = 0, congested = 1, Pale Atrophic which often&#xD;
           indicative of underlying squamous metaplasia =2) 3. Nature of secretions (thin = 0,&#xD;
           thick = 1) 4. Condition of nasal cavity (normal size = 0, roomy (see nasopharynx) = 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Routine Laboratory investigation: looking for iron deﬁciency anemia, thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Baseline nasal biopsy and only those with histopathological features of atrophic&#xD;
           rhinitis will be included in the study. Five subheadings for histopathology; Each&#xD;
           variable was assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2 where 0 representing normal nasal mucosal&#xD;
           features whereas 2 signifying extreme variation, the biopsy will be repeated after 12&#xD;
           weeks of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Status of epithelium: respiratory epithelium (pseudo stratified columnar ciliated&#xD;
           epithelium, squamous metaplasia (partial/total ± keratinization); Denuded or not&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Status of mucous (goblet) cells (Normal glands / ↓ number and size / Absence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Condition of blood vessels (Reduced vascularity or Dilated blood vessels /&#xD;
           Periarteritis/ Endarteritis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Tunica propria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Granulation tissue Presence of Chronic inﬂammatory cellular inﬁltrate Degree of Fibrosis&#xD;
           Chronic inﬂammatory cellular inﬁltration with ﬁbrosis Basement membrane (Normal /&#xD;
           Ill-deﬁned /Thickened) Seromucinus glands especially the serous component. 6-Assess the&#xD;
           nasal mucociliary function using saccharin test (primary outcome at beginning of study):&#xD;
           The test will be done at the commence of the study and 12 weeks later on. A score of 0-1&#xD;
           is given to time lag where (0; normal: 1; prolonged).&#xD;
&#xD;
           First group will be treated with nasal submucosal platelet rich plasma injection as&#xD;
           follows; • The selected region will be inﬁltrated with a cold saline solution with&#xD;
           addition of 1 mL of adrenaline and 25 mL of 2% lignocaine per 500 mL saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preparation of PRP:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Platelet-rich plasma is prepared by drawing 10 mL of blood sample from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The blood will be centrifuged at 1530 g for 10 min to obtain platelet-poor plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This will again centrifuged at 2720 g for 10 min to get platelet-rich plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Approximately 1 mL of platelet-rich plasma will be obtained from 10 mL blood.&#xD;
                Usually amount of about 3ml is needed to be injected in each nostril at the&#xD;
                affected sites of inferior and middle turbinates, septum and floor of the nose.&#xD;
                Platelet rich plasma injected into the affected area after degranulating the&#xD;
                platelet by adding 0.5 mL of calcium chloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Injection interval and follow-up duration o Injection interval of 2 weeks (up to&#xD;
                total 3 consecutive injections).&#xD;
&#xD;
                o Follow-up duration: 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be discharged from the hospital next day with oral antibiotics and&#xD;
                anti-inﬂammatory agents for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Second group acting as a control, will be treated over a period of 4 months only with&#xD;
           alkaline nasal douching and mucosal lubricants one -three times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Patients will be followed-up at intervals of 2-4 weeks post-therapy for a period of 4&#xD;
           months. Observation items, clinical assessment items and evaluation method will be&#xD;
           statistically compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Access the nasal mucosal status using diagnostic nasal endoscopy; monthly and at the end&#xD;
      of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Nasal mucocilirary flow rate by Saccharine test; once per month. 3. Fill in the nasal&#xD;
      symptom scores using Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Instrument, SNOT- 25&#xD;
      monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. The nasal biopsy will be repeated in all cases at the end of 12-week therapy and the&#xD;
      results will be noted under same variables and scored in the same manner. The scores at the&#xD;
      beginning of the therapy and at 12 weeks, will be statistically compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *All demographic data of the patients will be collected, analyzed and presented using SPSS&#xD;
      version 21. Appropriate statistical tests will be used for comparing the results and&#xD;
      statistical significance for each item between both groups of the study.&#xD;
