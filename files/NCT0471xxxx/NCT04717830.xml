      escalation groups&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I clinical trial was developed to study drug safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of the medicine for Ebola fever emergency prevention based on monoclonal&#xD;
      recombinant antibodies in single use in healthy volunteers with a dose escalation. A&#xD;
      consecutive recruitment of people who signed the Informed Consent Form into three groups of&#xD;
      volunteers with different drug doses is made according to the volunteers' screening results.&#xD;
      The total number of volunteers receiving the drug will be not less then 25 people.The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a medicine for Ebola&#xD;
      fever emergency prevention based on monoclonal recombinant antibodies in a single dose in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include volunteers of both sexes, aged 18 to 45 years inclusive. Only 25&#xD;
      people will take part in the study and will receive the study drug, of which 5 will receive&#xD;
      1/10 of the therapeutic dose, 5 - 1/2 of the therapeutic dose, 15 - in the full therapeutic&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation of 5 doubles is envisaged: 1 person for a group of 5 volunteers and 3 for 15.&#xD;
