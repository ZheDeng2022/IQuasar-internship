  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the eMOM GDM-project is to develop and evaluate a novel system to clinical&#xD;
      decision making and patient behavior change in treatment of GDM, combining diet, physical&#xD;
      activity, sleep, heart rate (e.g. stress), and glucose monitoring within a single system (the&#xD;
      eMOM GDM application), and linking the developed application tool for the normal health care&#xD;
      system in a new way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this second phase of the project, the effect of eMOM GDM application on maternal and&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes will be evaluated in a randomized controlled study design. The follow-up&#xD;
      study continues until 3 months postpartum.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      200 women with gestational diabetes will be randomized into the intervention and the control&#xD;
      group at gestational week (GW) 24-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will use the eMOM GDM -application one week/month&#xD;
      until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the intervention and the control group visit study nurse (measurements) 3&#xD;
      times in study period (at GW 24-28 and GW 35-37 and 3 months postpartum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups also receive regular antenatal care in maternity clinics and hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal measurements at enrollment before randomization process (at 24-28 GW), and at 35-37&#xD;
      GW (both groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests: fp-gluc, HbA1c, fp-insu, lipids, hs-CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fingertips glucose values from glucose meter (belong to normal antenatal care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood samples for future analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight, height, blood pressure (from the antenatal registry and study visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: background (only at enrollment), diet (food frequency questionnaire),&#xD;
           depression (EPDS), physical activity, motivation (TSRQ+PCS), quality of life (15D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continuous glucose measurements 1 week a month until delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity and sedentary behavior with the hip-worn triaxial accelerometer (UKK&#xD;
           RM 42)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity and heart rate with Firstbeat Bodyguard&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements at Birth:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cord blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placental weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Offspring birthweight, height, body composition (PEA POD CosmedÂ®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: maternal diet (FFQ), maternal depression (EPDS), and maternal physical&#xD;
           activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal measurements at 3 months postpartum:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests: fp-gluc, HbA1c, fp-insu, lipids, hs-CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fp-gluc, 2h postprandial value, as measured during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood samples for future analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 measurement (3 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression questionnaire (EPDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diet questionnaire (FFQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol only for the intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
      - eMOM GDM application: use: 1 application week + 3 normal care weeks repeatedly until&#xD;
      delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. continuous glucose monitor (CGM)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  fingertips glucose calibration according to CGM protocol (twice per day with&#xD;
                Medtronic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. diet (speech-enabled food tracker)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3 days during one application week&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For ensuring the quality of food record a researcher will phone interview the&#xD;
                participant based on her recordings. This is done after each recording period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. heartrate, stress and physical activity with the wrist-worn activity tracker (Vivosmart&#xD;
           3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. weight measured once a week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the sensors&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Data from users' input to the application&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study nurse calls after each week application use (simulating the normal health care&#xD;
      communication). A standardized phone call concerns the quality and amount of measurements and&#xD;
      their results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technology acceptance questionnaire (UTAUT) after every application week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usability questionnaire, after four weeks usage of the eMOM GDM application&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Semi-structured interview&#xD;

    <description>Measured with a questionnaire (food frequencey questionnaire, FFQ) concerning participant's diet during previous month. FFQ contains questions about the frequency (number of times per day, week, or month) and the amount of foods consumed in units of common serving sizes. Nutritional quality of total diet is assessed based on calculated daily consumption of foods and intake of nutrients. Better nutritional quality is related to e.g. higher intake of fruits and vegetables, wholegrain cereals, fiber and unsaturated fat, and lower intake of added sugar and saturated fat.</description>
