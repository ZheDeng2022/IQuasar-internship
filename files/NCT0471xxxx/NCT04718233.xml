  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent pregnancy loss are known to have decreased uterine artery blood flow.&#xD;
      Nitric oxide plays a major role in increasing uterine blood flow during the luteal phase.&#xD;
      This study is done to evaluate the effects of sildenafil on blood flow indices in the&#xD;
      patients with recurrent pregnancy loss due to impaired uterine artery blood flow.&#xD;

      Study Setting: The study will be conducted in recurrent pregnancy loss outpatient clinic at&#xD;
      Ain shams university maternity hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients with unexplained recurrent miscarriage attending Ain shams&#xD;
      university maternity hospital's outpatient clinic. This study will be conducted on 80 women&#xD;
      distributed into 2 groups each is 40 women in fertile age with history of two or more&#xD;
      recurrent spontaneous abortions and decreased uterine artery blood flow(PI&gt;2.02(Mansour et&#xD;
      al., 2018). First group will be placebo controlled and the second group will be given&#xD;
      sildenafil citrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be asked to attend during the 21-23 day of the cycle and will be subjected to:&#xD;
      History taking and Full clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination will be done including general, abdominal and pelvic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General examination: including general appearance, weight, height and vital signs Abdominal&#xD;
      examination: to assure freedom of any organic clinically detectable pathologic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic examination: included inspection of the external genitalia, speculum examination of&#xD;
      the vagina to rule out infection, and bimanual assessment of uterine size and position as&#xD;
      well as exclusion of adnexal masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine investigations including: CBC, fasting and postprandial blood sugar, urine analysis,&#xD;
      kidney function and liver function will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endocrine evaluation consisted in measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxin,&#xD;
      and progesterone levels on day 21 of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonography will be performed using Samsung H60 with convex probe (multi-frequency AD 2~ 8&#xD;
      MHz) to perform trans-vaginal examination. Examination will be performed in the second phase&#xD;
      of the menstrual cycle, at mid-luteal day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed wave Doppler will be used to obtain clear, consistent, flow velocity wave forms of&#xD;
      both uterine arteries. Pulsatility index (PI) will be measured bilaterally. The PI reported&#xD;
      will be the arithmetic mean for the last three cardiac cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Goswamy and Steptoe, 1988) classification will be used to determine the wave types.&#xD;
      According to this classification, the FVW of the circumflex artery can be of 3 types : Type A&#xD;
      when the diastolic component is present but not continuous with the systole, and ends before&#xD;
      the next cardiac cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type B when a diastole is present and continues with the systole, but ends before the next&#xD;
      cardiac cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type C when a diastole is present and continues with the systole and into the next cardiac&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of research has centered on an elevation in the RI or PI to detect the presence&#xD;
      of increased uterine artery blood flow resistance in non- pregnant states. Criteria for an&#xD;
      abnormal uterine artery Pulsatility index (PI) cutoff (PI&gt; 2.02) and abnormal sub-endometrial&#xD;
      blood flow Resistant Index (RI) (RI&gt;0.6) (Mansour et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be two groups of 80 patients with history of recurrent pregnancy loss,&#xD;
      each is 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be scanned transvaginally with transvaginal Doppler sonography 6 to 8 days&#xD;
      after ovulation to measure the pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI) and systolic to&#xD;
      diastolic ratio (S/D) of the right and left main uterine arteries and sub-endometrial blood&#xD;
      flow resistance index (RI). Sildenafil citrate at a dose of 25mg or placebo will be&#xD;
      administered orally in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss and the blood flow indices will&#xD;
      be measured after 3 hours. The student test will be used for analysis of the results, P&lt; 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 95% confidence interval. P values ≥5% considered to be significant.&#xD;
