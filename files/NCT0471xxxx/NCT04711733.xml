  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, there are 2100 new cases of cancer in children and adolescents/young adults (AYA)&#xD;
      in France. Due to a significant improvement in the effectiveness of therapies, the survival&#xD;
      rate of all types of cancer combined after 5 years is 80-85%. This is leading to the&#xD;
      emergence of new problems, which require an adaptation of the long-term care of these former&#xD;
      patients. Nevertheless, although some medical complications have been widely described and&#xD;
      are the subject of recommendations, many questions remain unanswered regarding the real&#xD;
      long-term needs of patients and of their main caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess not only the specific supportive care needs of&#xD;
      former onco-hematology patients treated before the age of 25 years, but also those of their&#xD;
      parents up to 6 months after the end of the oncological follow-up, i.e. 3 to 5 years after&#xD;
      the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess adherence to long-term follow-up medical consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the early complications presented by the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the quality of life and the anxiety-depression of former patients and their&#xD;
           parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe and evaluate the offer and use of the network of health professionals aware of&#xD;
           the post-treatment issues; assess the referral to the network of health professionals&#xD;
           aware of the post-treatment issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the objectives, the methodology used in this study is mixed, qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative. The study will be proposed systematically to all former patients of the&#xD;
      hospital department diagnosed before the age of 25 years and at least 6 years of age at the&#xD;
      time of inclusion as well as to their parents. A sample of 60 former pediatric patients (20&#xD;
      per age group) and 60-120 parents (ideally 40 per age group) is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the scientific level, this study will provide a better understanding of the cognitive and&#xD;
      emotional processes involved in the long-term follow-up, in particular by identifying the&#xD;
      supportive care needs of different participants (former patients and parents) and their&#xD;
      experiences and quality of life during the long-term follow-up phase. At the individual&#xD;
      level, this pilot study will enable the development of a multiprofessional structure, expert&#xD;
      in cancer after-care from the end of the oncological follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rational Each year, there are 2100 new cases of cancer in children and adolescents/young&#xD;
      adults (AYA) in France. Due to a significant improvement in the effectiveness of therapies,&#xD;
      the survival rate of all types of cancer combined after 5 years is 80-85%. This is leading to&#xD;
      the emergence of new problems, which require an adaptation of the long-term care of these&#xD;
      former patients. Many studies highlight that 60 to 65% of pediatric oncology patients will&#xD;
      present medical and/or psychosocial complications in the 20 years following their oncological&#xD;
      treatment, with a cumulative incidence of a serious adverse event of 40% 30 years after the&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis. Nevertheless, although some medical complications have been widely&#xD;
      described and are the subject of recommendations, many questions remain unanswered regarding&#xD;
      the real long-term needs of patients and of their main caregivers, in this project their&#xD;
      parents. It is therefore necessary to identify the risk factors by determining the&#xD;
      expectations and the supportive care needs of patients and their caregivers in the long-term&#xD;
      follow-up in order to intervene early and thus reduce the incidence of these later&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, only 30 to 50% of former patients in pediatric oncology-hematology and their family&#xD;
      attend a long-term follow-up medical consultation. We hypothesize that this lack of&#xD;
      commitment is multifactorial (e.g. unmet supportive care needs, geographical distance from&#xD;
      home, lack of information about the importance of long-term follow-up and follow-up&#xD;
      structures nearby) and that a precise study of the needs expressed by former patients and&#xD;
      their family should lead to an improved attendance at these consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the supportive care needs of these patients and their families, as&#xD;
      well as the brakes/obstacles or lers of their compliance with a long-term follow-up, is&#xD;
      therefore essential to improve their quality of life, prevent or detect the sequela of&#xD;
      therapies and reduce the risk of morbidity/mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The main objective of this study is to assess not only the specific supportive&#xD;
      care needs of former onco-hematology patients treated before the age of 25 years, but also&#xD;
      those of their parents up to 6 months after the end of the oncological follow-up, i.e. 3 to 5&#xD;
      years after the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess adherence to long-term follow-up medical consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the early complications presented by the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the quality of life and the anxiety-depression of former patients and their&#xD;
           parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe and evaluate the offer and use of the network of health professionals aware of&#xD;
           the post-treatment issues; assess the referral to the network of health professionals&#xD;
           aware of the post-treatment issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Depending on the objectives, the methodology used in this study is mixed,&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative. The study will be proposed systematically to all former&#xD;
      patients of the hospital department diagnosed before the age of 25 years and at least 6 years&#xD;
      of age at the time of inclusion as well as to their parents. The experiences and the specific&#xD;
      needs of each person (patients, mothers and fathers) will be assessed independently. Three&#xD;
      independent groups will be formed based on the age of the patient when included in the study.&#xD;
      For each group, the parents may or may not be paired with the patients. A sample of 60 former&#xD;
      pediatric patients (20 per age group) and 60-120 parents (ideally 40 per age group) is&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results At the scientific level, this study will provide a better understanding of&#xD;
      the cognitive and emotional processes involved in the long-term follow-up, in particular by&#xD;
      identifying the supportive care needs of different participants (former patients and parents)&#xD;
      and their experiences and quality of life during the long-term follow-up phase. This first&#xD;
      stage will be followed by more powerful studies on the modalities of following-up patients&#xD;
      after cancer, in order to add to previously published research on the long-term medical and&#xD;
      psychological side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the individual level, this pilot study will enable the development of a multiprofessional&#xD;
      structure, expert in cancer after-care from the end of the oncological follow-up. This&#xD;
      support could be initiated early and the link with the local network established quickly. It&#xD;
      should reduce the experience of being abandoned presented by former patients and their&#xD;
      families. At the family level, studying the needs expressed by parents could lead to a family&#xD;
      psychological approach in order to restore the family links impacted by the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the organizational level, this study should serve as a basis for developing a structure&#xD;
      that can carry out tertiary prevention, and thus reduce the costs attributable to long-term&#xD;
      side effects (e.g. educational and professional absenteeism, use of treatments, private&#xD;
      consultations or even hospitalization).&#xD;
