  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in Dutch women. Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET)&#xD;
      substantially improves chances for survival after primary breast cancer. In practice, many&#xD;
      women experience difficulties to adhere to treatment: besides missing single or multiple&#xD;
      doses of medication, up to 50% of patients stop treatment prematurely due to decreased&#xD;
      treatment motivation over time and burden of side effects. Together with patients and health&#xD;
      care professionals, we adapted a cost-effective behavior change intervention (AIMS) for women&#xD;
      using adjuvant endocrine therapy after breast cancer to an add-on module in regular follow up&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to pilot test the feasibility of the AIMS-AET intervention&#xD;
      versus usual treatment on medication adherence in breast cancer survivors on adjuvant&#xD;
      endocrine therapy. Intervention effects on psychosocial determinants and user experiences&#xD;
      will be evaluated. The feasibility of testing the AIMS-AET intervention in a bigger RCT will&#xD;
      be assessed. The secondary objective is to assess (preliminary) intervention effects on&#xD;
      adherence, physical activity and on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot randomised controlled trial comparing AIMS AET to usual care with an extensive&#xD;
      mixed-methods process evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female outpatients of 2 Dutch hospitals with a prescription for adjuvant endocrine therapy&#xD;
      after primary breast cancer. Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in-person delivered intervention imbedded in regular follow-up care during 9-months.&#xD;
      Patients will receive an electronic monitoring System to track medication intake and a&#xD;
      pedometer to count daily amount of steps. During the baseline visit, the health care&#xD;
      professional (HCP) will use pre-tested materials for informing and motivating patients; and&#xD;
      collaboratively set goals and plans for medication adherence and physical activity. During&#xD;
      regular follow-up consultations with the HCP, personalized visual reports of medication&#xD;
      intake and amount of steps will be evaluated to enhance patients awareness of their&#xD;
      (non-)adherence and (in)activity and identify any problems and solutions to reduce undesired&#xD;
      behaviour. The control group will receive usual treatment only.&#xD;
