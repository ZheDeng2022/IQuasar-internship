  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate pain control after cesarean delivery is a major concern for both parturients and&#xD;
      obstetrician, and it usually comprise a combination of systemic and regional techniques. The&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, affecting the nerves supplying the anterior&#xD;
      abdominal wall, is a recently introduced, promising regional analgesic technique for a&#xD;
      variety of abdominal and pelvic surgeries including cesarean delivery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infiltration of local anesthetic into the surgical wound (either as a single shot or using&#xD;
      indwelling catheters) has long been used for postoperative analgesia, Both the TAP block and&#xD;
      wound infiltration, are superior to placebo, however, it is unknown which of them provides&#xD;
      better analgesia after cesarean delivery because of a scarcity of randomized clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to compare bilateral US guidedTAP block with single-shot local anesthetic&#xD;
      wound infiltration for analgesia after cesarean delivery performed under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the TAP block would decrease postoperative cumulative&#xD;
      opioid consumption at 24 hours.&#xD;

      The Anaesthesilogist is Senior staff trained on such procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative settings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study subjects will randomly assigned to 3 equal groups (TAP group, infiltration&#xD;
           group and narcotics only group ) using a computer-generated table of random numbers. A&#xD;
           single investigator will assess the patients for eligibility, obtained written informed&#xD;
           consent, and record the baseline data for each participant before delivery. Sequentially&#xD;
           numbered, sealed opaque envelopes containing group allocation will be opened by the&#xD;
           primary investigator after administration of general anesthesia . Neither the study&#xD;
           subjects nor the outcome assessors knew the study group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine preoperative investigations will be done to all patients including laboratory&#xD;
           investigations as (complete blood picture, liver function tests, prothrombin time and&#xD;
           partial thromboplastin time).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data as age, weight, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All mothers who scheduled for elective cesarean delivery who fulfilled inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      volunteer are assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain by Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score (range, 0-10; 0, no pain; 10,&#xD;
      worst pain) on arrival in the post-labor ward (time 0) and at 2,4,6, 8, 12,18 and 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of block (defined as the interval between performing the block and the time of&#xD;
      the first request for analgesia) and total pethidine consumption were recorded in the 24&#xD;
      hours after surgery The level of patient satisfaction was measured numerically by a Likert&#xD;
      scale ranging from one to five, 1: &quot;not satisfied at all,&quot; 2: &quot;slightly satisfied,&quot; 3:&#xD;
      &quot;moderately satisfied,&quot; 4: &quot;very satisfied,&quot; and 5: &quot;highly satisfied&quot;. Any adverse effects&#xD;
      or complications will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wide bore venous access will be secured by 18 G intravenous canula&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The procedure is done in the operating rooms (OR) under complete aseptic technique with&#xD;
           prophylactic antibiotics (e.g. 2 gm ceftriaxone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be monitored during the procedure using pulse oximetry, non-invasive&#xD;
           blood pressure &amp; ECG and capnography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receive General anesthesia induction by propofol (2mg/kg),Rocuronium(0.5mg /kg)&#xD;
           for rapid sequence intubation&amp; Fentanyl (1 mcg /kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance with rocuronium &amp; isoflurane 1.2%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Equipment's that will be used for each patient are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sterile towels, sponges, 4-inch gauze packs and povidone iodine 10% for sterilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sterile gloves, marking pen, 18-gauge cannula and 10-ml syringes containing drugs for&#xD;
           administration of the procedure.Ultrasound device with Linear probe with high frequency&#xD;
           (6 -13 MHz) will be used in imaging of patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  drugs that will be used In our study are: A 20 ml vial of 0.5% Bupivacaine HCl ,&#xD;
           pethidine IV (50-150 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower segment cesarean section will be performed using the Pfannenstiel incision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An anesthesiology resident will administer the general anesthesia, will record the&#xD;
           intraoperative data (the duration of surgery), and prepared, as instructed by the&#xD;
           primary investigator , the local anesthetic solution for the TAP block and wound&#xD;
           infiltration. The outcome data (pethidine consumption, time to the first pethidine dose,&#xD;
           pain scores level , side effects, and patient satisfaction) will be recorded by a blind&#xD;
           investigator who will visite the patient in the ward at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours&#xD;
           postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: TAB group formed of 65 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completion of LSCS and skin closure and while the patient is still on the&#xD;
           operating table U/S guided TAP block will be done using the following procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After preparing the skin with antiseptic solution, a linear high frequency ultrasound&#xD;
           probe (Superficial probe of mindray DP-20) will be placed transversely on the&#xD;
           anterolateral abdominal wall between the iliac crest and the costal margin. Under US&#xD;
           guidance, the three layers of muscles -external oblique, the internal oblique, and the&#xD;
           transversus abdominis will be identified. A Spinal needle 22g attached with flexible&#xD;
           tubing to a syringe filled with saline will be used to perform the block. The needle&#xD;
           will be then introduced through the skin anteriorly in the plane of the ultrasound beam&#xD;
           and advanced into the fascial plane between the internal oblique and transversus&#xD;
           abdominis muscles with its tip lying in the mid axillary line. To assist with&#xD;
           identifying these structures, the probe will be moved anteriorly to the rectus sheath&#xD;
           and the fascial planes followed laterally. The final position of the probe will to be no&#xD;
           further anterior than the anterior axillary line. If satisfactory views are not&#xD;
           obtained, the TAP block will not be performed. Hydro dissection with saline (2-5 ml)&#xD;
           will be used to separate the fascial layers. After aspiration to exclude inadvertent&#xD;
           vascular puncture, a test dose of 1-2 ml of the drug will be injected to confirm needle&#xD;
           placement. After a negative test dose, 20 ml of the 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected&#xD;
           while closely observing for signs of toxicity e.g CVS toxicity which may be in form of&#xD;
           early features e.g hypertension, tachycardia and ventricular arrhythmia or may be in&#xD;
           form of late features e.g hypotension, bradycardia, heart block and decreased&#xD;
           contractility and other toxic signs e.g tinnitus, perioral numbness, metallic taste in&#xD;
           mouth, slurring of speech and mental status changes). TAP block will be performed in a&#xD;
           similar fashion on the opposite side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B : The Infiltration Group formed of 65 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • This group will B wills provided with single-shot local anesthetic wound infiltration with&#xD;
      20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine injected subcutaneously above and below skin incision before&#xD;
      closure of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C : Narcotics only group formed of 20 patients • routine analgesic was taken only&#xD;
      without any intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the surgery and complete recovery from anesthesia, the patient will be&#xD;
           kept under observation postoperatively for 4 hours to monitor vital signs (conscious&#xD;
           level, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and pattern &amp; any possible limb&#xD;
           weakness or abnormal sensation) then discharged to ward &amp; observed to be followed for&#xD;
           returning of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of surgery (time from the start of skin incision to the end of skin closure)&#xD;
           will be recorded. All the study subjects will receive postoperative standard analgesia&#xD;
           (30 mg of IV ketorolac every 8 hours starting immediately after surgery and 1 gm of oral&#xD;
           paracetamol every 6 hours starting 4 hours after surgery with caution to toxic dose) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be observed for the occurrence of any adverse effect and/or&#xD;
           complication related to the procedure (e.g. hematoma), or to the study drugs (e.g.&#xD;
           hypotension/hypertension (i.e. 20% decrease or increase from the baseline value),&#xD;
           bradycardia (HR &lt;50 beats/min) or tachycardia (HR &gt; 120 beats/min), nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
           and hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;90%)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of pain involves asking a patient to rate her pain from 0 to 10 (11 point&#xD;
           scale) with the understanding that 0 is equal to no pain and 10 equal to the worst&#xD;
           possible pain after first hour, 2nd hour,4th hour, 6th hour, 12th hour and 24th hour at&#xD;
           wards after end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is usually managed by pethidine IV based on patient complain. the analgesic dose of&#xD;
      pethidine will be 50 mg to be repeated on demand (NRS &gt;4) provided that the total 24 hour&#xD;
      dosage will not exceed 150 mg . At recovery room mothers asked to report their pain based on&#xD;
      11 point NRS score during first 24 hour. Patient satisfaction from postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      will be assessed at 24 hours postoperatively using a 5-point scale (1 = very unsatisfied, 2 =&#xD;
      unsatisfied, 3 = fair, 4 = satisfied,and 5 = very satisfied) after first hour, 2nd hour,4th&#xD;
      hour, 6th hour, 12th hour and 24th hour at wards after end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • A time in minutes from end of surgery to first analgesia request were documented together&#xD;
      with total analgesia consumed in the first 24 h. In addition, incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting will be documented within 24 h.&#xD;
