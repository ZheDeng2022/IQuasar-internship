  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      University students ages 18-45, with no recent history of back injury and no history of back&#xD;
      surgery, were recruited. Participants completed proprioception testing consisting of a&#xD;
      standing side bending and seated spinal flexion test. Participants performed each test once,&#xD;
      then were blindfolded and asked to replicate the tests 10 times. After the initial&#xD;
      proprioceptive testing, the participants were randomly split into four groups and performed a&#xD;
      10-minute intervention exercise, before repeating the proprioceptive tests for final&#xD;
      measurements. The four groups included: graded motor imagery, mirror visual feedback,&#xD;
      augmented biofeedback, and diaphragmatic breathing. Participants also completed a Physical&#xD;
      Activity Enjoyment Scale to rate their enjoyment of their intervention task&#xD;
&#xD;
      -For the seated forward flexion test, the participants' C7 and S2 vertebrae were identified&#xD;
      and used as markers. The participants were asked to bend forward until the tape measure&#xD;
      increased 5 cm from the original distance between the C7 and S2 vertebrae. Similar to the&#xD;
      seated flexion test, during the side-bending task, the participants were asked to side bend&#xD;
      until the tip of their middle finger was 10 cm closer to the floor. The participants were&#xD;
      asked to memorize that point in their mind; they were then blindfolded and asked to repeat&#xD;
      the movement 10 times, trying to recreate the original position to the best of their ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between initial and final measurements of proprioception, the participants were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the following four groups for interventions for a 10-minute training&#xD;
      session:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graded Motor Imagery Group: Participants were shown several flashcards with pictures of&#xD;
           individuals' back oriented to either the flexed or side bent position. The participants&#xD;
           stated which direction the image depicted and visualized themselves making the movement&#xD;
           identified in the picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mirror Visual Feedback Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants viewed themselves in a mirror while performing flexion and side bending&#xD;
      movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Augmented Biofeedback Group: Participants used an augmented musculoskeletal feedback system&#xD;
      smartphone application app and small sensors with Bluetooth technology to translate the&#xD;
      movement of the participant into an avatar on the game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Diaphragmatic Breathing Group: Participants were told to sit on a chair with their back&#xD;
      straight and feet flat on the floor with one hand on their chest and one hand on their&#xD;
      stomach. They performed diaphragmatic breathing in a slow 4 second box method: breathing in&#xD;
      for 4 seconds, holding for 4 seconds, breathing out for 4 seconds, and then hold for 4&#xD;
      seconds&#xD;
