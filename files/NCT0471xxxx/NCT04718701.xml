    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm phase Ⅱ study aiming to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety profile of above-mentioned combination strategy in first-line&#xD;
      therapy-failed advanced pancreatic cancer. Totally 53 patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer are to be enrolled and receive anlotinib plus toripalimab and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules (12 mg orally, once daily before breakfast; CTTQ,&#xD;
      Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China), Toripalimab (240 mg intravenously, once every 3 weeks; Shanghai&#xD;
      Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and Nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 intravenously,&#xD;
      twice every 3 weeks; CSPC, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China) are to be administered as a&#xD;
      second-line therapy at most 6 cycles. Patients assessing as CR/PR/SD continue to receive a&#xD;
      maintenance treatment including anlotinib and toripalimab until disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity, patient request for discontinuation for up to two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations and assessments will be conducted before treatment, on day 7, 21 of cycle 1, on&#xD;
      day 21 of cycle 2, every 2 cycles (42 days) during following cycles and after treatment.&#xD;
      Follow-up for survival status and subsequent antineoplastic therapy data collecting will be&#xD;
      performed by telephone interview or face-to-face every 6 weeks after treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression, death or end of the study (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using 2.9 months served as a control, the expected median PFS of patients treated with&#xD;
      anlotinib plus toripalimab and nab-paclitaxel in this study is prespecified as 4.5 months.&#xD;
      Significance level α=0.05 (two-tailed) and test power (1-β)=0.80 are used for sample size&#xD;
      calculation by PASS (Power Analysis and Sample Size) software. Taking a 20% drop-out rate&#xD;
      into consideration, the sample size is approximately 53 patients. An interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using a Lan-DeMets Pocock type boundary to assess the futility and efficacy when&#xD;
      approximately half of the predetermined sample size is allocated. If the interim analysis&#xD;
      results indicate that the study is of futility and the benefit/risk ratio is significantly&#xD;
      worse, the trial will be terminated by the investigators. Otherwise, the trial will continue&#xD;
      until the full sample size of 53 has been accumulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy is to be analyzed in the full analysis set (FAS), the response evaluable set (RES)&#xD;
      and per-protocol set (PPS). Safety is to be analyzed in safety set (SS) including all&#xD;
      assigned patients who receive at least one dose of study combined therapy and have safety&#xD;
      records of medication. Statistical descriptions of subject distribution, demographic data and&#xD;
      baseline characteristics will be performed. For study endpoints, the Kaplan-Meier method is&#xD;
      to be applied for the PFS and OS curve with estimation for median PFS, median OS and 95% CI.&#xD;
      ORR= (CR+PR) / sample size×100%; DCR= (CR+PR+SD) / sample size×100%. The 95% CI of the ORR&#xD;
      and DCR are to be calculated by exact binomial method based on the F distribution. ECOG PS&#xD;
      scores and QoL scores will be described at each visit time. For safety analysis, only&#xD;
      treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) will be included and analyzed in this experiment,&#xD;
      which is defined as AEs that are post-dose or heavier than the baseline. Medical Dictionary&#xD;
      for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), system organ class (SOC), preferred terms (PT) and NCI&#xD;
      CTCAE 5.0 will be used to standardize and classify all adverse events and summarize the&#xD;
      incidence of AEs and association with treatments. Vital signs, ECG, and laboratory evaluation&#xD;
      results will be compared and analyzed before and after treatment.&#xD;
