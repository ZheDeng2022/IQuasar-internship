    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Multimedia Symptom Management&#xD;
      Program on increasing coping strategies, reducing symptom distress and depression, and&#xD;
      improving HRQoL in patients with HF.&#xD;

      Design A single-blind two-group longitudinal experimental study will be conducted to compare&#xD;
      a Multimedia Symptom Management Program with a usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving informed consents, participants will be randomly assigned to intervention and&#xD;
      control groups at a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will receive a Multimedia Symptom&#xD;
      Management Program; the control group will receive usual care. Outcomes from four self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires at 1 month and 3 months after initiating the intervention will be compared to&#xD;
      baseline assessments. Outcome measurements include the following parameters: 28-item Brief&#xD;
      COPE, Cardiac Symptom Survey (CSS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Minnesota&#xD;
      Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria The inclusion criteria are: (1) those who are ≥20 years old&#xD;
      and HF diagnosed by a cardiology specialist, (2) have clear consciousness, (3) are fluent in&#xD;
      Mandarin/Taiwanese. The exclusion criteria are: (1) diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder,&#xD;
      (2) are addicting to drugs or alcohol at the time of the study, (3) are undergoing other&#xD;
      psychotherapy during the study and (4) are refusing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants will be recruited from a cardiology outpatient clinic of a medical&#xD;
      center in northern Taiwan. The study design and protocols had been reviewed and approved by&#xD;
      the institutional review board of the participating hospital. At the content session, all&#xD;
      assessments and procedures will be fully explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of eligibility and randomisation Participants will be considered eligible if they&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria. All participants will be informed that they are able to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study at any time. Before randomisation, participants will be asked to answer five&#xD;
      questionnaires. The questionnaires include demographic characteristics, 28-item Brief COPE,&#xD;
      Cardiac Symptom Survey (CSS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Minnesota Living&#xD;
      with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Participants will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the intervention group or the control group at a 1:1 ratio; randomization will be performed&#xD;
      with the use of a computer-generated randomization scheme (SPSS software Version 23.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Multimedia Symptom Management&#xD;
      Program or medical consultation and usual care. Random assignment will be performed by a&#xD;
      person who are not involved in the study. The outcome evaluator will be blinded to the&#xD;
      assigned condition of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Participants will be randomly assigned to the Multimedia Symptom Management&#xD;
      Program Intervention group or the control group using SPSS software (Version 23.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multimedia Symptom Management Program Intervention The program is composed of two parts:&#xD;
      1) a face-to-face presentation about the contents of the program, and 2) structured telephone&#xD;
      support. The first part of the program will be conducted in the cardiology outpatient&#xD;
      department. Participants will be instructed to read a HF handbook. In addition, they will&#xD;
      also be provided with multimedia symptom management instruction through a live-action feature&#xD;
      film on a DVD, which will be designed and produced by the researchers to help familiarize&#xD;
      patients with the symptoms and characteristics of HF, how to perform self-evaluations, and&#xD;
      ways to manage symptoms of HF. After the conclusion of the face-to-face presentation, we will&#xD;
      ensure that participants have fully comprehended all instructions with the return&#xD;
      demonstration method, in which participants had reviewed the HF handbook and multimedia&#xD;
      symptom management DVD at home and will be encouraged to review management of their symptoms&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the program, structured telephone support, allowed the nurses to maintain&#xD;
      contact with the participants in order to follow their progress. The participants will be&#xD;
      scheduled to receive eight telephone coaching calls over a 3-month period. In the first&#xD;
      month, participants will receive telephone coaching calls every week. Through the phone&#xD;
      calls, the nurse clinician will try to sustain the participants' symptom management knowledge&#xD;
      and skills by encouraging them to discuss what they had learned from the DVD to discuss how&#xD;
      they had managed their symptoms. Subsequent telephone counselling calls will be conducted&#xD;
      every 2 weeks in the second and third months to follow their situations and assist them in&#xD;
      dealing with any health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Participants in the control group will be provided with the HF handbook at the&#xD;
      beginning of the 3-month period, and also will be received usual care, which included medical&#xD;
      consultations, and two telephone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes measurements Primary outcome Health-related quality of life (HRQoL): The 21-item&#xD;
      Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) is used to measure HRQoL in adult&#xD;
      patients with HF. A 6-point Likert scale is used to score the impact on HRQoL from 0 = &quot;No&#xD;
      effect&quot; to 5 = &quot;Severe effect&quot;. Total scores range from 0 to 105, with higher scores&#xD;
      indicating a worse HRQoL. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of MLHFQ was 0.92.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome Brief COPE: The 28-item Brief COPE self-report questionnaire measure&#xD;
      strategies participants use for coping. The Brief-COPE is divided into approach coping, in&#xD;
      which individuals actively seek resources to deal with their health problems; and avoidance&#xD;
      coping, in which individuals attempt to divert attention away from events. Higher scores&#xD;
      indicate greater use of the specific coping strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac Symptom Survey (CSS): CSS is originally used as a tool to assess symptoms of patients&#xD;
      undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, assessed symptom distress. In this study, we only&#xD;
      assessed only the 20 items for frequency and severity of symptoms. We obtained permission&#xD;
      from Dr. L. J. Nieveen to change the wording of one item, &quot;surgery pain&quot;, to &quot;activity&#xD;
      intolerance&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II): BDI-II is used to measure the depressive status of&#xD;
      participants. The self-report questionnaire asks about symptoms of depression over a 2-week&#xD;
      period. Higher total scores indicating a more severe of depressive status: 0-13 = normal;&#xD;
      14-29 = mild; 28-28 = moderate; and 29-63 = severe depressive status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis We will use descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency&#xD;
      and percentage) to analyse participant characteristics and primary outcomes. The initial&#xD;
      differences between groups for demographic characteristics, symptom distress, coping&#xD;
      strategies, depressive status, and HRQoL will be examined with independent t-tests and&#xD;
      Chi-square analysis. Effects of the Multimedia Symptom Management Program on symptom&#xD;
      distress, coping strategies, depressive status and HRQoL in patients with HF will be analysed&#xD;
      using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The significance will be defined as a&#xD;
      two-tailed P-value of &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
