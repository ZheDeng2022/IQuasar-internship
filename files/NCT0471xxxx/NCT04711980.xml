    <textblock>
      Background: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common and disabling chronic&#xD;
      microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetic Mellitus (T2DM) that is&#xD;
      characterized by nerve damage, affecting at least half of patients diagnosed with diabetes.&#xD;
      It has been reported that DPN significantly contributes to the increased morbidity with&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers by 60% and amputation by 85% that seriously threaten the quality of&#xD;
      life. Mudan granule, a traditional Chinese medicinal preparation, is widely used in clinical&#xD;
      practice for DPN in China. Evidence from clinical and preclinical studies have shown that&#xD;
      Mudan granule could relieve symptoms and reduce the incidence of DPN exacerbations. However,&#xD;
      the previous studies are of variable quality and poorly standardized,which limits the&#xD;
      clinical application of Mudan granule. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of Mudan&#xD;
      granule combined with methylcobalamin in the treatment of type 2 diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, providing the highest level of evidence of Mudan granule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,parallel-arm, and&#xD;
      multi-centric clinical trial design was used based on a co-regimen of methylcobalamin.&#xD;
      Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups. The patients&#xD;
      in the study group were treated with Mudan granule combined with methylcobalamin, and the&#xD;
      patients in the control group were treated with placebo combined with methylcobalamin. The&#xD;
      total intervention period is 24 weeks. The sample size was 402 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major evaluation indicators: Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score (MDNS) changes, the changes&#xD;
      of MDNS were compared between the two groups before and after medication, adopting the&#xD;
      evaluation method of difference values. Secondary Evaluation Indicators:(1) nerve conduction&#xD;
      velocity changes, the changes in nerve conduction velocity of each nerve were compared&#xD;
      between the two groups before and after taking medicine, adopting the evaluation method of&#xD;
      difference values. (2)corneal nerve fiber density changes, the changes in corneal nerve fiber&#xD;
      density of each mm2 were compared between the two groups before and after taking medicine,&#xD;
      adopting the evaluation method of difference values. (3)corneal nerve branch density changes,&#xD;
      the changes in corneal nerve branch density of each mm2 were compared between the two groups&#xD;
      before and after taking medicine, adopting the evaluation method of difference values.&#xD;
      (4)corneal nerve fiber length changes, the changes in corneal nerve fiber length of each mm2&#xD;
      were compared between the two groups before and after taking medicine, adopting the&#xD;
      evaluation method of difference values. (5)Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS) changes,&#xD;
      the changes of toronto clinical score were compared between the two groups before and after&#xD;
      taking medicine, adopting the evaluation method of difference values. (6)Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine(TCM) syndromes efficacy score changes, the changes in TCM syndromes efficacy score&#xD;
      were compared between the two groups before and after taking medicine, adopting the&#xD;
      evaluation method of difference values. (7) Clinical symptoms score changes, the changes of&#xD;
      each of clinical symptoms score were compared between the two groups before and after&#xD;
      medication, adopting the evaluation method of difference values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: We postulate that patients with type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy will&#xD;
      benefit from therapy with Mudan granule.&#xD;

      1. Research objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mudan granule combined with&#xD;
           methylcobalamin in the treatment of type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy, providing the&#xD;
           highest level of evidence of Mudan granule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experimental Measures and contrast: A randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
           placebo-controlled,parallel- arm,and multi-centric clinical trial design was used on the&#xD;
           basis of a co-regimen of methylcobalamin.The patients in the study group were treated&#xD;
           with Mudan granule (7g 3 times/day for 24 weeks)and patients were treated with placebo&#xD;
           (7g 3 times/day for 24 weeks) in the control group.The sample size was determined to 402&#xD;
           cases through statistics calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation basis: According to the previous study of Mudan granule combined&#xD;
           with methylcobalamin in the treatment of DPN with 12 weeks intervention, the results of&#xD;
           the MDNS indicated that the study group (Mudan granule + methylcobalamin) scale score&#xD;
           was 5.48±1.19, and the control group (placebo + methylcobalamin) scale score was 8.21&#xD;
           ±1.24, and the mean difference between the two groups was 2.73;Assuming that Mudan&#xD;
           granule combined with methylcobalamin in the treatment of DPN can reduce the MDNS by&#xD;
           0.58 after 12 weeks of intervention, it is considered better than the control&#xD;
           group.Taking α=0.05, β=0.10, the study group and the control group with 24 weeks&#xD;
           intervention were allocated at a ratio of 1:1. The sample size calculated by the Power&#xD;
           Analysis and Sample Size (PASS) 11 software was not less than 167 cases in each group.&#xD;
           Considering no more than 20% withdrawal rate, the total number of cases is 402, 201cases&#xD;
           in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research design 3.1 This trial was designed as a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;

           group were treated with Mudan granule combined with methylcobalamin , and the patients&#xD;
           in the control group were treated with placebo combined with methylcobalamin. The sample&#xD;
           size was 402 cases.&#xD;

                     agents or insulin injections to keep all patients' blood glucose stable in the&#xD;
                     study. In principle, the type and dose of hypoglycemic agents should maintain&#xD;
                     unchanged. If fasting blood glucose fluctuates more than 20%,diabetes experts&#xD;
                     need to find and eliminate the predisposing factors as soon as possible,&#xD;
                     adjust the dose and monitor the blood glucose changes, so as to keep the blood&#xD;
                     glucose stable within 4 weeks.Adjusted dose of the drug needs to be detailed&#xD;
                     recorded in the combined medication table.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Taking methylcobalamin tablets (0.5mg,3 times/d). (Eisai (China)&#xD;

           Chinese herbal medicines with similar therapeutic indications and Chinese herbal&#xD;
           medicines with similar efficacy) were banned during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ②Besides methylcobalamin, drugs such as alpha lipoic acid, epalrestat, and VitB12 for&#xD;
           the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy are prohibited.&#xD;
