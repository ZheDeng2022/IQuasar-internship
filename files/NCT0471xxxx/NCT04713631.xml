      This is a single center phase 2a, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial&#xD;
      design, proof of concept trial. Patients with Crohn's disease who are on an adequate dose of&#xD;
      azathioprine and still continue to active disease (CDAI &gt; 150 and c-reactive protein &gt; 6)&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Forty patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into 4 groups in a 2x2&#xD;
      factorial design to receive artesunate 200 mg PO daily for 2 weeks and / or Curcumin 2 gm PO&#xD;
      daily for 3 months or placebo. Treatment Curcumin x 13 weeks Placebo C x 13 weeks Artesunate&#xD;
      x 2 weeks Group 1 Group 2 Placebo A x 2 weeks Group 3 Group 4 During the treatment period and&#xD;
      follow up period patients will be continued on their regular dose of azathioprine and&#xD;
      5-aminosalicylic acid with no change allowed during the study period. Patients will maintain&#xD;
      a daily diary of symptoms and adverse events. Scheduled hospital visits with blood and stool&#xD;
      tests will be at baseline, week 1, month 1, month 3 and month 6. Primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      remission (defined as CDAI &lt; 150) at 3 months&#xD;

      Primary objective: To study the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Artesunate and Curcumin&#xD;
      in patients with Crohn's disease, who have ongoing clinical and biochemical evidence of&#xD;
      disease activity despite treatment with azathioprine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effect of artesunate and curcumin on azathioprine metabolites&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the mechanistic pathways through which artesunate and curcumin act&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Remission of disease as defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI &lt; 150) at 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adverse events Secondary end points&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Remission (CDAI &lt; 150) after 1 week, 1 month and 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Remission or response (reduction in CDAI of &gt;100) after 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6&#xD;
           months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in CDAI score after 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time to remission by patient symptom diary, Harvey Bradshaw score &lt; 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number of days when the Harvey-Bradshaw index score was less than 5 after 1 week, 1&#xD;
           month, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Change in c-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin after 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and&#xD;
           six months&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Change from baseline, in levels of thiopurine metabolites 6-Thioguanine and&#xD;
           6-methylmercaptopurine after 1 week Exploratory endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Change from baseline of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, oxidative stress markers after 1&#xD;
      week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months DISEASE CONDITION: Crohn's disease in a chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory disease of the intestine that is treated with lifelong immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medication. After an initial course of steroids to induce control of the disease, maintenance&#xD;
      of remission is achieved through long term use of azathioprine. The long term efficacy of&#xD;
      azathioprine for maintenance of remission is around 45%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for Alternative Drugs: In the western countries anti-tumor necrosis factor (infliximab&#xD;
      and adalimumab) therapy is increasingly being used for disease that does not respond to&#xD;
      azathioprine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such treatment is very expensive (2.7 lakhs Indian rupee per year for an adalimumab biomimic)&#xD;
      and has the potential to reactivate latent tuberculosis (~10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Recently, several workers have turned their attention to the powerful&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties of naturally occuring substances such as artemisinins and&#xD;
      curcumin. They both have shown promising anti-inflammatory properties in small numbers of&#xD;
      patients as well as in animal models. Artesunate has been shown to suppress tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-Î± expression and T-helper (Th)1/Th17 responses in a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid&#xD;
      colitis model. Curcumin too, has been shown to have a protective effect in a murine model of&#xD;
      dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis, through modulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha&#xD;
      release. It has been studied in patients with active and quiescent ulcerative colitis, and&#xD;
      shown to be beneficial when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARTESUNATE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artesunate is approved for the treatment of malaria and is on the World Health Organization&#xD;
      list of Essential Medicines. Artesunate has a hemisuccinate group which confers substantial&#xD;
      water-solubility and high oral bioavailability and therefore a convenient oral route of&#xD;
      administration. Artesunate has a good safety and tolerability profile, having been used to&#xD;
      treat millions of adults and children globally. It has a renal mode of excretion and is&#xD;
      rapidly eliminated with a half life of 0.5 to 1.5 hours. The recommended treatment of severe&#xD;
      malaria is intravenous artesunate 2.4 mg/kg/dose stat, followed by 2.4 mg/kg/dose at 12&#xD;
      hours, 24 hours and 48 hours. This is followed by an oral regime containing artesunate 200 mg&#xD;
      a day (for body wt &gt; 36 kg) for 3 days. Artesunate has been used orally at a dose of 200 mg a&#xD;
      day as a neoadjuvant therapy in colorectal cancer for a duration of 2 weeks7&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Artesunate has been used as a daily oral dose of 100 mg for a duration of 1 month in a 12&#xD;
      yr old child with Cytomegalovirus infection. Artesunate has been administered as a daily&#xD;
      intravenous dose, initiated at 180 mg and escalated to 240 mg, in a post renal transplant&#xD;
      patient for 20 days. Hemolysis may occur 1 to 3 weeks after artesunate administration, and is&#xD;
      thought to be caused due to synchronous clearance of once infected erythrocytes. This problem&#xD;
      is not anticipated in our study population. Hypersensitivity reactions have been described&#xD;
      with oral artesunate (frequency not defined). QT prolongation has been reported with other&#xD;
      artemisinin derivatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CURCUMIN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin has been used in Indian cuisine and traditional medicine for centuries. It has low&#xD;
      solubility in aqueous solution and yields low serum levels following oral administration. In&#xD;
      the setting of inflammatory bowel disease where the required site of action is the bowel,&#xD;
      systemic absorption may be less relevant. Curcumin and its reduced metabolites undergo&#xD;
      conjugation in the liver. Curcumin has a half life of 6-7 hours. It has been found to be safe&#xD;
      at oral doses of 2 gm and 3 gm a day in patients with ulcerative colitis, for up to 1 year.&#xD;
      In a dose titration study conducted in children with inflammatory bowel disease 2 gm twice&#xD;
      daily of curcumin was well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artesunate 4 mg/kg/dose to a maximum of 200 mg PO daily x 2 weeks. If the patient is less&#xD;
      than 50 kg, the dose will be reduced to 150 or 100 mg, ensuring that it does not exceed 4&#xD;
      mg/kg/dose. Curcumin will be started concommitantly at a dose of 2 gm daily and continued for&#xD;
      13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSTRUMENTS TO MEASURE DISEASE ACTIVITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several disease activity indices aimed at measuring severity of disease have been developed.&#xD;
      We will use Crohn's DIsease Activity index (CDAI) and Harvey Bradshaw index (HBI) to assess&#xD;
      the severity of disease in our study population. The CDAI score which needs a hospital visit&#xD;
      will be recorded during each patient visit. The HBI can be calculated from the patient's&#xD;
      daily symptom diary which the patients will maintain at home. Patients who discontinue study&#xD;
      drugs will also be asked to maintain the symptom diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDAI is a disease specific index which considers the activity of Crohns disease in 8 domains,&#xD;
      each of which evaluates a specific aspect of CD. The overall score, which ranges from 0 to&#xD;
      600 is the sum of weighted scores of each item, and provides a numerical value of disease&#xD;
      activity. It has been in use for over 30 years in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the parameters used in CDAI are recognized clinical features of CD and were selected by&#xD;
      an expert group of Gastroenterologists and as such can be considered to possess content&#xD;
      validity. In the majority of circumstances, CDAI reflects disease severity and so can be&#xD;
      considered to have content validity. CDAI rise has been noted before exacerbations. It can be&#xD;
      considered to possess criterion validity as there is no gold standard to measure against and&#xD;
      over the years has become the gold standard in itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDAI has limitations in the paediatric population, patients with stoma and those with&#xD;
      strictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Components of Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 1. No of liquid/soft stools (each day for&#xD;
      7 days) x2 2. Abdominal pain, sum of 7 daily ratings (0 none, 1 mild, 2 moderate, 3 severe)&#xD;
      X5 3. General well-being, sum of 7 daily ratings (0 generally well, 1 slightly under par, 2&#xD;
      poor, 3 very poor, 4 terrible) x7 4. Number of listed complications (arthritis or arthralgia,&#xD;
      iritis or uveitis, erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum or aphthous stomatitis, anal&#xD;
      fissure or fistula or abscess, other fistula, fever over 37.8Â°C/100Â°F) x20 5. Use of&#xD;
      diphenoxylate or loperamide for diarrhoea (0 no, 1 yes) X30 6. Abdominal mass (0 no, 2&#xD;
      questionable, 5 definite) X10 7. Haematocrit X6 8. Body weight (1-wt/std wt) [times]100 (add&#xD;
      or subtract according to sign) X1 Total score The index score is calculated by adding all the&#xD;
      scores. A score &lt;150 is considered as inactive disease; 150-219 mild disease, 220-450&#xD;
      moderately active disease, whilst &gt;450 is considered severe disease. An increase of over 100&#xD;
      from baseline will be considered as relapse for this study. Harvey Bradshaw index (HBI) /&#xD;
      modified CDAI The CDAI requires a patient to maintain a 7 day diary which can prove&#xD;
      difficult. Mayo Clinic Disease Activity Index looks only at symptoms and signs over the last&#xD;
      24 hours. It also reduces the original 8 components to 5; removing anti-diarrhoeal use,&#xD;
      hematocrit level and body weight. The Mayo Clinic Disease Activity Index had a 93%&#xD;
      correlation to CDAI in original prospective study of 112 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General well-being (0 = very well, 1 = slightly below average, 2 = poor, 3 = very poor,&#xD;
           4&#xD;
&#xD;
           = terrible)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Abdominal pain (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of liquid stools per day&#xD;

                follow up period patients will be continued on their regular dose of azathioprine&#xD;
                and 5-aminosalicylic acid with no change allowed during the study period. Patients&#xD;
