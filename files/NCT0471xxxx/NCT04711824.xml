  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I/II study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of focused radiation&#xD;
      therapy (radiosurgery) together with olaparib, followed by immunotherapy, for patients with&#xD;
      brain metastases from triple negative or BRCA-mutated breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have a Phase I portion in which subjects will be enrolled based on 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation rules. Three dose levels of olaparib will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1 of study treatment will consist of Olaparib given twice daily concurrently with&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Olaparib will start one week prior to SRS and continue&#xD;
      during and following SRS (1-5 fractions) for up to 28 days total. The number of doses of&#xD;
      Olaparib will be dependent on how long it takes a subject to recover from SRS (ideally the&#xD;
      subject will be off steroids, if they are required, at the start of Cycle 2, with exceptions&#xD;
      outlined later in this section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject has recovered from SRS, Cycle 2 will be initiated with physician's choice&#xD;
      systemic therapy and durvalumab. Cycle 2+ will equal 21 days. During Cycles 2 and 3,&#xD;
      physician's choice systemic monotherapy will be given along with durvalumab per section 5.3.&#xD;
      Each cycle will last 21 days. Imaging to evaluate intracranial and extracranial disease will&#xD;
      be performed after Cycle 3, and subjects with response will continue with the systemic&#xD;
      therapy and durvalumab until progression (intracranial or extracranial), unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or death.&#xD;

             uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena&#xD;
             cava syndrome or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the&#xD;
             ability of the patient to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         31. History of another primary malignancy except for:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication).&#xD;
&#xD;
         33. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note:&#xD;
             Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to&#xD;
             30 days after the last dose of IP.&#xD;

                  prior immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All AEs while receiving prior immunotherapy must have completely resolved or&#xD;
                  resolved to baseline prior to screening for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must not have experienced a ≥ Grade 3 immune related AE or an immune related&#xD;
                  neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while receiving prior immunotherapy. NOTE:&#xD;
                  Patients with endocrine AE of ≤ Grade 2 are permitted to enroll if they are&#xD;
                  stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression other than&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for the management of an AE, not have experienced recurrence of&#xD;
                  an AE if re-challenged, and not currently require maintenance doses of &gt; 10 mg&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinically significant acute infection requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal, or&#xD;
        antiviral therapy including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with local practice),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hepatitis C, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis&#xD;
        B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for&#xD;
        hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for&#xD;
        HCV RNA. Subjects with HIV/AIDS with adequate antiviral therapy to control viral load would&#xD;
        be allowed if they are stable and have been on treatment for ≥ 4 weeks prior to first dose&#xD;
        of study drug(s). Subjects with viral hepatitis with controlled viral load would be allowed&#xD;
        while on suppressive antiviral therapy. Testing not required.&#xD;
