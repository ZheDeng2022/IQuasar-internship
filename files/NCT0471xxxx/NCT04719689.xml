  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was a Randomized clinical trial conducted to Compare the effects of dry needling&#xD;
      and dry cupping in Positional fault of pelvis due to Myofascial trigger points in Quadratus&#xD;
      Lumborum so that we can have best treatment option for patients with myofascial trigger&#xD;
      points.&#xD;

      Non Probability Convenient sampling was done. Patients following eligibility criteria from&#xD;
      Physiotherapy department of Islam Central hospital, Sialkot were considered. Sample size was&#xD;
      calculated with Epitool calculator. 26 Participants were randomly allocated in two groups&#xD;
      equally via convenient sampling method. Baseline assessment was done initially. Group A was&#xD;
      given Dry needling technique and Group B was given Dry Cupping along with conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment (hot pack and stretching). Duration of research was almost 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants were treated 6 times over a 3 week period with 2 treatment sessions per week per&#xD;
      patient. Pre and Post treatment readings were taken in 1st and 6th session over a 3 week&#xD;
      period respectively. A follow up reading was also taken after 1 month for checking prolonged&#xD;
      post treatment effects. Assessment was done via Pressure pain threshold Scale, Pelvic&#xD;
      goniometer and Measuring tape for assessing functional positional fault of pelvis and muscle&#xD;
      length of Quadratus Lumborum. All participants were provided written informed consent prior&#xD;
      to commencement of the procedures. They were free to quit the treatment at any stage of&#xD;
      research. Data was analyzed by using SPSS version 23.&#xD;
