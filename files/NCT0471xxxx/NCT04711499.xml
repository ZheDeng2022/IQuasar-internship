  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adverse effects of sleep related fatigue are significant, impacting on doctors' health,&#xD;
      wellbeing, performance and ultimately their safety and that of their patients'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trainees are at an increased risk of fatigue because they routinely, and are increasingly,&#xD;
      working long hours, and exposed to excessive and high intensity workloads. With increasing&#xD;
      numbers of patient consultations, there is a higher risk of making poorer quality clinical&#xD;
      decisions (i.e. decision fatigue). The excessive workloads experienced by doctors can cause&#xD;
      fatigue through the requirement for sustained attention over long periods of time,&#xD;
      particularly when performing complex and mentally demanding tasks. Our main objective is to&#xD;
      study the difference between the fatigued and non-fatigued state of anaesthetists and on&#xD;
      their ability to perform an ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blockade task. We hypothesise&#xD;
      that fatigue will result in a clinically significant reduction in the objective structured&#xD;
      assessment scores of anaesthetists who are performing an ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve&#xD;
      blockade task compared to their scores when they are non-fatigued.&#xD;

    <description>establish a comparison of mean composite error scores (CES) between participants in group F (fatigued state) and Group A (non-fatigued state) when performing a standardised ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia task. CES can range from 0 to 100. the higher the score the more negative the performance of the candidate.</description>

    <description>establish a comparison of mean Global rating scale (GRS) between participants in group F (fatigued state) and Group A (non-fatigued state) when performing a standardised ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia task. The GRS ranges from a score of 7 to a score of 35. The higher the score the better the performance.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>All eye tracking-derived secondary outcome measures listed below will be calculated (and summed to create a total) for each UGRA assessment using the following pre-defined areas of interest: the ultrasound machine screen ('US screen'); their hands, the needle, the US transducer or the cadaveric model ('tools'); and any other area outside the US screen or tools ('other'). This is measures on a numerical scale on the number of times there is deviation and gaze away from the screen. The lower the number the better the performance by the candidate.</description>

    <description>The trial will recruit trainee anaesthetists of ST3 grade or higher who take part in a resident night-shift rota at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. Participants will undergo baseline psychometric testing to measure baseline mood. There will be a series of questions to ascertain levels of fatigue. All participants will then be asked to perform a standardised ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blockade task using a high fidelity bench-top phantom model. Performance in this task will be independently assessed using a previously-validated scoring tool by two raters blinded to participant group allocation.</description>
