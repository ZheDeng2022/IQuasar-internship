  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been several reports on the feasibility of a no-drain policy after pneumonectomy,&#xD;
      but the policy is not widely accepted because silent massive hemorrhage, delayed air leaks,&#xD;
      and chylothorax would always be major worries for thoracic surgeons, and all of the&#xD;
      researches were retrospective case studies with small sample size and insufficient evidence.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to to evaluate safety and feasibility of an improved&#xD;
      policy, the application of a small thoracic puncture tube after pulmonary lobectomy.&#xD;

      This study will be accepted in patients with uniportal VATS(Video-assisted Thoracoscopic&#xD;
      Surgeryï¼‰lobetomy. A randomized controlled study protocol will be used, and The patients will&#xD;
      be devided into two groups: experimental group for the application of a small thoracic&#xD;
      puncture tube and control group for the application of Combination of the puncture tube and&#xD;
      traditional silicone tube. The intraoperative conditions, postoperative recovery and the&#xD;
      incidence of perioperative complications will be compared. The safety and feasibility of the&#xD;
      application of the small thoracic puncture tube after pulmonary lobectomy will be evaluated.&#xD;
