      This single-arm pilot study (Phase 1) will test the preliminary efficacy of a virtually&#xD;
      delivered, live-online 16-week group model of Internal Family Systems (IFS) for individuals&#xD;
      with PTSD, called the PARTS program, on PTSD symptoms measured by Clinician-Administered PTSD&#xD;
      Scale (CAPS-5). In addition, feasibility, acceptability, and effects on self-report PTSD and&#xD;
      disturbances of self-organization (DSO) will be secondary outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a single-arm pilot study to test the preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      virtually delivered, live-online 16-week group model of Internal Family Systems (IFS) for&#xD;
      individuals with PTSD, called the PARTS program, on PTSD symptoms measured by&#xD;
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include feasibility and acceptability of the PARTS program measured by a&#xD;
      Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire.&#xD;
      Secondary clinical outcomes include the effects of the PARTS program on self-report PTSD and&#xD;
      disturbances of self-organization (DSO). Exploratory aims of the study are to investigate the&#xD;
      effects on emotion regulation (DERS), self-trauma fusion (iPRISM-trauma), disassociation&#xD;
      (MDI), depression (CAT-DI), self-compassion (SCS-SF), perceived stress (PSS), mindfulness&#xD;
      (TMS), and interception (MAIA-2). Additional exploratory outcomes include changes in outcome&#xD;
      variables among PTSD subjects with baseline DSO and those without DSO as defined by the&#xD;
      International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ).&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline CAPS-5 at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of this study is to examine the preliminary efficacy of a live-online version of the PARTS program on PTSD symptoms measured by reduction in CAPS-5 over 24 weeks. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item questionnaire administered by a trained interviewer and is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; assessment for PTSD diagnosis and symptoms as defined by the DSM-5. This measure also assesses the duration of symptoms, impact of symptoms on aspects of the participant's life, and if the participant meets criteria for the dissociative subtype of PTSD.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Disturbances of Self Organization -- International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ-DSO-9) at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) is the first instrument designed to capture the ICD-11 PTSD and Complex PTSD (CPTSD) diagnoses. The last 6 items measure DSO symptoms characteristic of ICD-11 CPTSD. Each set of items have 3 severity of impact on functioning questions. The ITQ-DSO-9 includes just the 6 DSO items with 3 severity questions. The ITQ-DSO-9 will be used monthly for self-report of changes in DSO symptoms.</description>

    <description>The DERS is a 36-item self-report scale designed to assess emotional dysregulation. The scale assess 6 aspects of emotional dysregulation: non-acceptance of emotional responses (&quot;When I'm upset, I become embarrassed for feeling that way&quot;), difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior (&quot;When I'm upset, I have difficulty thinking about anything else&quot;), impulse control difficulties (&quot;When I'm upset, I lose control over my behaviors&quot;), lack of emotional awareness (&quot;When I'm upset, I take time to figure out what I'm really feeling (reverse-scored)&quot;, limited access to emotion regulation strategies (&quot;When I'm upset, it takes me a long time to feel better&quot;), and lack of emotional clarity (&quot;I have no idea how I am feeling&quot;).</description>
