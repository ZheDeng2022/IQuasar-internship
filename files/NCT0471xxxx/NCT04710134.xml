      Dose escalation of reslizumab can ameliorate sputum eosinophilia in severe asthmatics who&#xD;
      have persistent sputum eosinophilia despite treatment with reslizumab at the standard dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibody therapies targeting the interleukin-5 (IL-5) pathway, critical for&#xD;
      maintaining eosinophil homeostasis, have been developed as adjunct therapy for severe asthma&#xD;
      with an eosinophilic phenotype. Reslizumab/Cinqair is an approved/marketed product&#xD;
      administered monthly by intravenous to severe eosinophilic asthmatics at 3mg/kg. However some&#xD;
      patients do exhibit sputum eosinophilia at this dosage. We are investigating whether those&#xD;
      that receive 3mg/kg that have persistent sputum eosinophils would benefit at a higher dose of&#xD;
      4mg/kg and those that still exhibit sputum eosinophils at this elevated dose would show&#xD;
      improvement at 5mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to determine whether dose escalation of reslizumab can&#xD;
      ameliorate sputum eosinophilia in severe asthmatics who have persistent sputum eosinophilia&#xD;
      despite treatment with reslizumab at the standard dose.&#xD;
