  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 6-cohort single ascending dose (SAD) study will be conducted in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      utilizing a slow-infusion intravenous (IV) route of administration. Standard safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and qEEG monitoring will be evaluated at all dose levels. Subsequently,&#xD;
      a 3-cohort multiple ascending dose (MAD) study will be conducted. Doses will be administered&#xD;
      on days 1, 4, 7, and 10. Standard safety parameters will be monitored, and PK will be&#xD;
      evaluated at all dose levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 48 Subjects are planned to be enrolled in a 6-cohort SAD study (36 in the&#xD;
      treatment groups and 12 in the control groups). All SAD cohorts will have 6 Subjects in the&#xD;
      treatment group and 2 Subjects in placebo group. All cohorts in the SAD study will&#xD;
      incorporate sentinel dosing which will include 1 active and 1 placebo Subject. All remaining&#xD;
      Subjects will be dosed at least 24 hours after the sentinel cohort participants. A total of&#xD;
      24 Subjects are planned to be enrolled in a 3 cohort MAD study (18 in the treatment groups&#xD;
      and 6 in the control groups). All MAD cohorts will have 6 Subjects in the treatment group and&#xD;
      2 Subjects in placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine hydrochloride will be administered intravenously over a 40-minute&#xD;
      period as a solution in a 25 mM sodium phosphate 0.9% w/v saline solution. The SAD doses will&#xD;
      range from 0.1 mg/kg to 4.0 mg/kg and the investigational drug product will be diluted into a&#xD;
      53 mL total volume of formulant. Placebo will be made up of a 0.9% w/v saline solution (53 mL&#xD;
      total volume) also administered via slow IV infusion over a 40-minute period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial PK blood samples will be collected during the SAD portion for each Subject receiving&#xD;
      drug and placebo at 9 timepoints (preinfusion, end-of-infusion [approximately 40 minutes], 1,&#xD;
      2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and approximately 48 hr after the start of the infusion). Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected during the SAD study for each Subject receiving drug and&#xD;
      placebo at set intervals following the initiation-of-infusion (0-4, &gt;4-8, &gt;8-12, &gt;12-24 hr).&#xD;
      Serial PK blood and urine samples will be collected for the first and fourth (last) dosing in&#xD;
      the MAD study for each Subject receiving drug and placebo. Blood PK samples will be obtained&#xD;
      at 9 timepoints (preinfusion, end-of-infusion [approximately 40 minutes], 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24,&#xD;
      and approximately 48 hr after the start of the infusion). A single PK blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected for the second and third dosing in the MAD study for each Subject receiving drug&#xD;
      and placebo at approximately 10 minutes predose. Pharmacokinetic urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected during the MAD study for each Subject receiving drug and placebo at set intervals&#xD;
      following the initiation-of-infusion (0-4, &gt;4-8, &gt;8-12, &gt;12-24 hr) after the first and last&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study. Baseline and follow-up safety assessments will&#xD;
      include height, body mass index (BMI), weight, temperature, medical, visual and ocular&#xD;
      history, physical examinations, ocular examinations, visual acuity, color vision tests,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs (VS), clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum&#xD;
      chemistry, and urinalysis), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Columbia-Suicide Severity&#xD;
      Rating Scale (C-SSRS), the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS), and&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs). Safety assessments will include AEs, ECGs, VS, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      results, and physical observations. Assessment of each Subject's level of alertness/sedation&#xD;
      will be accomplished using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S).&#xD;
      Evaluation of safety in the MAD study will utilize the same safety assessments used in the&#xD;
      SAD study. Monitoring of AEs will be governed by change from baselines established during&#xD;
      prescreening and Day -1 examinations and clinical laboratory tests. Dose escalation in the&#xD;
      SAD study or continued dosing in the MAD study may be stopped according to the predefined&#xD;
      halting rules or if a Subject's scores demonstrate acute suicidality on the C-SSRS assessment&#xD;
      or at the discretion of the study Principal Investigator and/or sponsor. Determination of&#xD;
      whether to escalate to the next dose level in the SAD study or continue dosing in the MAD&#xD;
      will be made by the Principal Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor and Study&#xD;
      Sponsor.&#xD;
