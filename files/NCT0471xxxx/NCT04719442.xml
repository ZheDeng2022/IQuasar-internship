  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a large body of literature regarding efficacious intervention strategies for&#xD;
      treating childhood obesity. Unfortunately, the degree to which efficacious programs have been&#xD;
      packaged for translation in micropolitan and surrounding rural areas is unclear-an important&#xD;
      issue when considering the prevalence of obesity is higher in rural areas when compared to&#xD;
      urban areas. Epstein's Traffic Light Diet (TLD) is likely the most studied pediatric weight&#xD;
      management intervention (PWMI) and has demonstrated efficacy across a wide range of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials in children 6-12 years of age. Building Healthy Families (BHF)&#xD;
      is an adaptation of the TLD and has been implemented in a micropolitan city and achieved&#xD;
      clinically and statistically significant reductions in child BMI z-score (-0.27±0.22)-a&#xD;
      similar magnitude of effect relative to previous efficacy trials. The investigators have&#xD;
      created online resources for organizations interested in delivering PWMIs, training modules&#xD;
      for related interventions, and participant-facing program materials that could be combined&#xD;
      into a 'turn-key' approach for communities interested in reducing childhood obesity to adopt,&#xD;
      adapt and sustain it in other micropolitan/rural communities. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      collaboratively refine and develop an intervention package for the BHF that includes&#xD;
      materials necessary for others to implement the intervention in new metropolitan/rural&#xD;
      locations. The second aim is to perform a rigorous, mixed-methods pilot implementation study&#xD;
      using an innovative community application process to identify 4 to 8 new communities to pilot&#xD;
      test the utility of the packaged PWMI and training materials while determining factors that&#xD;
      predict adoption, implementation and sustainability. The investigators will also use a&#xD;
      learning collaborative implementation strategy to improve implementation fidelity and local&#xD;
      context and facilitation capacity in communities interested in delivering BHF. The third aim&#xD;
      is to use the pilot evaluation data and results of the sustainability action plan to refine&#xD;
      program and training materials and develop a dissemination plan to move the program to other&#xD;
      communities. The approach will use an implementation research explanatory process and outcome&#xD;
      model to test hypotheses related to implementation and sustainability, engaging community/&#xD;
      clinical partners in the implementation and sustainability process, and evaluate outcomes at&#xD;
      both the individual and organizational level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the early 1980s, a number of efficacious pediatric weight management interventions&#xD;
      (PWMI) have been developed to reduce child weight status. Epstein's Traffic Light Diet (TLD)&#xD;
      is likely the most studied PWMI and has demonstrated efficacy across a wide range of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials in children up to and older than 12 years of age. This work and&#xD;
      the majority of efficacious PWMI have been based in large urban areas delivered through a&#xD;
      hospital or medical center and the most recent childhood obesity treatment recommendations do&#xD;
      not address geographically underserved audiences or settings where all members of an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team may not exist. As a result, there is no information on the degree to&#xD;
      which evidence-based PWMIs have been translated into micropolitan (cities&lt;50,000) and rural&#xD;
      settings. This is an important issue when considering the prevalence of obesity is higher,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status and access to preventive healthcare is lower, and 20% of the nation's&#xD;
      populations reside in rural areas based on the most recent census data. A related issue is&#xD;
      the potential mismatch between the resources and expertise used to deliver research and&#xD;
      hospital-based PWMIs in urban, when compared to micropolitan and rural, areas. Thus,&#xD;
      adoption, implementation, and sustainability may be limited in micropolitan and surrounding&#xD;
      rural areas unless adaptations are made that leverage multiple systems within the community&#xD;
      that interact with families and children and strategies include a balanced focus on reach and&#xD;
      effectiveness to increase the likelihood of having a public health impact. To address these&#xD;
      issues the research team has implemented an adapted version of the TLD in Kearney, Nebraska,&#xD;
      developed and used training approaches for PWMI for underserved micropolitan settings, and&#xD;
      conducted a number of implementation trials focused on planning for, and evaluating, PWMI&#xD;
      reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance (RE-AIM). This includes&#xD;
      research examining models of participant identification and engagement within settings where&#xD;
      a large proportion of children are screened for obesity-schools and primary care pediatric&#xD;
      clinics. Building Healthy Families (BHF), the investigators' TLD adaptation, includes the&#xD;
      required or more contact hours through regular and frequent in-person contact with families&#xD;
      and leverages the expertise and time of health professionals from a variety of local&#xD;
      organizations. BHF has been implemented locally and successfully achieved clinically and&#xD;
      statistically significant reductions in child BMI z-score (-0.27±0.22). Through collaborative&#xD;
      efforts the research team has developed online resources for organizations interested in&#xD;
      delivering PWMIs, training modules for related interventions, and participant-facing program&#xD;
      materials that could be combined into a 'turn-key' approach for communities interested in&#xD;
      reducing childhood obesity. The investigators preliminary work demonstrates that the adapted&#xD;
      TLD intervention can achieve a similar magnitude of effect relative to previous efficacy&#xD;
      trials, that the associated training materials and approaches can result in a high level of&#xD;
      implementation fidelity, and that ongoing program adaptations to address local needs can be&#xD;
      made. To date, the research team has not combined all of these approaches and materials as a&#xD;
      turn-key package that could be adopted, adapted, and sustained in other micropolitan/rural&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim is to collaboratively refine and develop an intervention package for the TLD&#xD;
      that includes all of the materials necessary for others to implement the intervention in new&#xD;
      micropolitan and rural locations. The second aim is to perform a rigorous, mixed-methods&#xD;
      pilot implementation research study using an innovative community application process to&#xD;
      identify 4 to 8 new communities to pilot test the utility of the packaged PWMI and training&#xD;
      materials when coupled with a learning collaborative facilitation strategy and sustainability&#xD;
      action planning process in supporting PWMI adoption, implementation, and sustainability when&#xD;
      compared to receiving access to the packaged program and training materials alone. Additional&#xD;
      outcomes will include start-up and ongoing costs while tracking intervention reach,&#xD;
      representativeness, and effectiveness in reducing and maintaining child weight status&#xD;
      relative to a matched cohort. The third aim is to use the pilot evaluation data and results&#xD;
      of the sustainability action plan to refine program and training materials and develop a&#xD;
      dissemination plan to move the program to other communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To complete these aims the investigators will engage an existing partnerships that includes&#xD;
      local schools and pediatricians in Kearney, NE and the Great Plains IDeA Clinical and&#xD;
      Translational Research Network Community Advisory Board who has identified childhood obesity&#xD;
      treatment, particularly in rural areas, across North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska as a&#xD;
      priority. As is recommended, the approach will use an implementation research explanatory&#xD;
      process, and outcome model to test hypotheses related to implementation and sustainability,&#xD;
      engaging community/clinical partners in the implementation and sustainability process, and&#xD;
      evaluate outcomes at both the individual and organizational level. Specifically, the&#xD;
      Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) Framework will be&#xD;
      used as the explanatory model and the RE-AIM framework to track individual reach,&#xD;
      representativeness, effectiveness and organizational cost, adoption, implementation, and&#xD;
      sustainability.&#xD;

    <description>Building Healthy Families (BHF) is a family based obesity treatment program which includes key behavior change strategies including goal setting for both behavior change and weight loss, self-monitoring, rewards/contingency management, role modeling, and stimulus control/ modifying the environment. BHF includes a minimum of 32 contact hours consisting of three main program components: nutrition education, behavior modification, and physical activity. Participants and parents are expected to attend 12 continuous weeks of education (2 hours/session) followed by 12 weeks of relapse prevention refresher courses. Relapse prevention refresher sessions are every three weeks for one hour to re-evaluate goals, discuss rewards/contingency management and changes in stimulus control with seasonal changes and holidays. A final follow-up check-in session is conducted at 12 months for approximately 1 hour.</description>
