      This is a single-arm,open, multicenter, phase II clinical study of the efficacy and safety of&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a single arm, open, multicenter, Ⅱ period clinical research. Three cohorts were&#xD;
      included, 127 subjects were enrolled (Cohort 1: about 60 subjects with surgically suitable&#xD;
      muscular-invasive bladder cancer; Cohort 2: about 40 subjects with advanced Non-clear Cell&#xD;
      Renal Carcinoma; Cohort 3: about 27 subjects with advanced penile carcinoma. After&#xD;
      confirmation of inclusion, intravenous infusion of 10mg/kg human anti-PD-L1 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody injection (LDP) was given. The initial efficacy and safety of drugs in different&#xD;
      tumor species in the cohort above will be observed.&#xD;
