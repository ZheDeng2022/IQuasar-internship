      The study will investigate the pain control effects of a rectus sheath block after&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery to remove the appendix. A rectus sheath block is the injection of local&#xD;
      anesthetic (numbing agent) into the space between the muscles of the belly wall. Children&#xD;
      having surgery for appendicitis age 8-17 at the Stollery Children's Hospital will be eligible&#xD;
      to participate. Patients with complicated appendicitis (perforation or abscess), chronic&#xD;
      pain, bleeding disorders, or inability to document pain scores will be excluded from this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either rectus sheath block or standard local&#xD;
      anesthetic. The standard local anesthetic group will have local anesthetic (numbing agent)&#xD;
      injected around their surgery cut sites. The rectus sheath block group will have this&#xD;
      standard plus the rectus sheath block with local anesthetic. Participants, parents,&#xD;
      anesthesiologists and nursing staff will not know which group the participant has been&#xD;
      assigned to. The surgeon will know the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same pain and nausea medications will be ordered for all participants after the surgery.&#xD;
      Pain scores will be measured using the Faces Pain Scale - Revised tool. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to rate their pain in the recovery room, in their hospital room at 3 and 6 hours after&#xD;
      the surgery and again before going home. This tool has been shown to be useful for rating&#xD;
      children's pain levels. The study will also measure the amount of pain and nausea medications&#xD;
      that participants are given during their surgery and recovery. Participants will see their&#xD;
      surgeon at 6 weeks after their surgery where they will be asked about any problems after&#xD;
      being discharged home. Data will be analyzed with a linear mixed model.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if a bilateral laparoscopically guided rectus sheath block improves pain control&#xD;
      over conventional local anesthetic infiltration around port site incisions following&#xD;
      laparoscopic appendectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral rectus sheath block will improve post-operative pain scores following laparoscopic&#xD;
      appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children have significant pain after laparoscopic appendectomy and many receive&#xD;
      post-operative opioids for analgesia. The Faces pain scale - revised (FPS-R) is a simple&#xD;
      validated method of measuring post-operative pain in children. Ultrasound-guided bilateral&#xD;
      rectus sheath block (RSB) has been shown to decrease pain scores in the early post-operative&#xD;
      period following pediatric laparoscopic appendectomy and elective umbilical hernia repair.2,4&#xD;
      The use of image-guidance for needle placement has improved both achievement of appropriate&#xD;
      anatomic location of the block as well as analgesia associated with the block. Under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance, this extra step requires additional equipment, time, and sometimes&#xD;
      dedicated personnel to complete. The investigators propose a bilateral RSB performed&#xD;
      intra-operatively under laparoscopic guidance may alleviate the need for these extra&#xD;
      resources while achieving the desired analgesic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analgesic effect of the standard of care injection of local anesthesia is limited to the&#xD;
      superficial layers of the abdominal wall. The rectus sheath block targets the nerves running&#xD;
      within the fascia and provides a more complete block to the deep and superficial layers of&#xD;
      the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Determine if intra-operative laparoscopic guided bilateral RSB improves&#xD;
      self-reported post-operative pain scores at 3 hours post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if intra-operative laparoscopic guided bilateral RSB improves self-reported&#xD;
      post-operative pain scores in the PACU, at 6 hours post-operatively, and prior to discharge&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if intra-operative bilateral laparoscopic guided bilateral RSB decreases&#xD;
      intra-operative narcotic use, post-operative opioid use, and post-operative antiemetic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods/Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Simple&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Single-blind. Surgeon cannot be blinded to the intervention. Anesthesiologist,&#xD;
      participants, parents, and nursing staff in the OR, recovery room, and ward will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: Standard of care infiltration of local anesthetic at incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and standard care arms will run in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Care: Intra-operative infiltration of 2ml of 0.25% Bupivacaine with 1:200 000&#xD;
      epinephrine at each port site incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Treatment: Bilateral RSB with up to 7ml of 0.25% Bupivacaine with 1:200 000&#xD;
      epinephrine plus 2ml infiltrated around each port site incision as in the standard care&#xD;
      group. The total volume used will not exceed 20ml or 2mg/kg, whichever is lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be followed in the recovery room and surgical ward and asked to report&#xD;
      their pain level immediately after surgery, at 3 and 6 hours after surgery, and prior to&#xD;
      discharge home. Each participant will have a scheduled follow up visit at 6 weeks with their&#xD;
      operating surgeon where they will be asked about any complications experienced since&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will be voluntary. Participants will receive standard of care if they choose&#xD;
      not to participate in the study. Informed consent will be obtained from the participant's&#xD;
      parent or legal guardian by the operating surgeon or delegate pre-operatively. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to provide assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 participants will be required with a target of 50 in each group. Sample size calculations&#xD;
      were completed based on an estimated 20% effect size with consideration for a potential&#xD;
      10-15% dropout rate to achieve a power of 80% and alpha 5%. Effect size is estimated&#xD;
      conservatively from data in previous studies showing an average 30% decrease in early&#xD;
      post-operative pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed in an intent to treat manner using a linear mixed model. We have&#xD;
      undertaken an initial consultation with a WCHRI biostatistician.&#xD;
