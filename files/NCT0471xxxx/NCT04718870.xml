      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluate changes in skin barrier function with transepidermal water loss (TEWL) assessed&#xD;
      after skin tape stripping (STS) in predefined lesional skin in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) treated with dupilumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate changes in skin barrier function with TEWL assessed after STS in predefined&#xD;
           lesional and non lesional skin in pediatric patients with moderate to severe AD treated&#xD;
           with dupilumab in reference to normal skin of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate time course of change in skin barrier function with TEWL assessed before and&#xD;
           after STS in predefined lesional and non-lesional skin in pediatric patients with&#xD;
           moderate to severe AD during dupilumab treatment phase and follow-up period in reference&#xD;
           to normal skin of healthy volunteers&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be between ≥6 to &lt;12 years of age (inclusive), at the time of signing&#xD;
             the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  15 kg ≤ body weight &lt;60 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Atopic dermatitis patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with AD diagnosis according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria at least 1 year&#xD;
             before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of ≥3 (for US patients) or IGA ≥4 (for EU&#xD;
             patients) at screening (on the 0-4 scale) depending on approved label indication in&#xD;
             the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with moderate to severe AD those are eligible to be treated with dupilumab&#xD;
             according to product label.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with AD must have active lesions on the upper limbs or lower limbs (including&#xD;
             trunk, if needed), with severity for lesion erythema or edema/papulation ≥2 at&#xD;
             screening on the 0-3 scale of the Individual Signs Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants should have a non-lesional (normal looking) skin area 4 cm from the edge&#xD;
             of the lesional area. If unable to identify non-lesional skin 4 cm from the lesional&#xD;
             area, it is acceptable to identify normal looking skin as close to the lesion as&#xD;
             possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age and gender matched (match on age ±2 years) to a selected AD patient by study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with dupilumab within 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skin conditions other than AD that can confound assessments in the area of TEWL&#xD;
             assessments in the opinion of the Investigator (ie, skin atrophy, ichthyosis, tinea&#xD;
             infection, contact dermatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cracked, crusted, oozing, or bleeding AD lesions in the designated lesional assessment&#xD;
             area leaving insufficient skin that is adequate for TEWL assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of dupilumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular disorder that in the opinion of the Investigator could adversely affect the&#xD;
             individual's risk for study participation. Examples include -but are not limited to-&#xD;
             individuals with a history of active cases of herpes keratitis; Sjogren's syndrome,&#xD;
             keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or individuals with ocular conditions that require the use&#xD;
             of ocular corticosteroids or cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers with a personal history of an atopic condition.&#xD;
