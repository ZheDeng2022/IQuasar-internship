      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), listed among lung and breast cancers as the top-ten cancer in&#xD;
      2016 Taiwan, is the second most prevalent cancer, just one place below colon cancer. Due to&#xD;
      mass hepatitis B vaccination and the screening and therapeutic plan against hepatitis B and C&#xD;
      viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively), the incidence of liver cancer drops significantly,&#xD;
      however, still around twenty out of per hundred thousand population die from liver cancer&#xD;
      each year. For patients suffering HBV and HCV, the prevention of HCC is a crucial health&#xD;
      issue.&#xD;

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), listed among lung and breast cancers as the top-ten cancer in&#xD;
      2016 Taiwan, is the second most prevalent cancer, just one place below colon cancer. Due to&#xD;
      mass hepatitis B vaccination and the screening and therapeutic plan against hepatitis B and C&#xD;
      viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively), the incidence of liver cancer drops significantly,&#xD;
      however, still around twenty out of per hundred thousand population die from liver cancer&#xD;
      each year. For patients suffering HBV and HCV, the prevention of HCC is a crucial health&#xD;
      issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of HCC is mainly related to the hepatitis of HBV or HCV infection and subsequent&#xD;
      cirrhosis. The population of HBV carrier is over 350 million in the world, three-fourths of&#xD;
      them live in Asia-Pacific area. Therefore, hepatitis B may be the leading cause of HCC. For&#xD;
      Taiwanese people born before 1986, the prevalence rate of hepatitis B is extremely high as&#xD;
      15-20%, and around 80% of HCC patients are also HBV carriers. In the past 20 years, for&#xD;
      patients suffering with high level of HBV during immune clearance phase, immune residual&#xD;
      inactive phase, reactivation phase and cirrhosis, our national health insurance cover the&#xD;
      cost of interferon or other oral anti-virus medicine with defined criteria, dramatically&#xD;
      lowering the risk of HCC developed from hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous clinical trial, some carriers showed high incidence of HCC when their&#xD;
      quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg) is high, especially when it is higher than&#xD;
      2000 IU/ml. The risk of HCC is still five-fold higher when the serum qHBsAg is above 1000&#xD;
      IU/ml. Therefore, it's important to explore novel intervention lowering qHBsAg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirulina, as demonstrated in previous researches in vitro and in animals, can regulate&#xD;
      immunity, enhance anti-virus activity, lower inflammation response and slower tumor&#xD;
      progression. Liver function and liver fibrosis is improved by Spirulina as well. In our&#xD;
      recent clinical trial, hepatitis B patients that received anti-virus medicine orally and was&#xD;
      supplemented with Spirulina FEM-102 showed lower qHBsAg, reflecting the clearance of cccDNA.&#xD;
      It might be related to immune modulation against HBV, which is induced by Spirulina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most chronic hepatitis patients do not meet most criteria of intervention according to our&#xD;
      current guidelines. Since we already confirmed that Spirulina supplement can lower qHBsAg in&#xD;
      treated patients, in this study we aim to understand whether Spirulina FEM-102, which&#xD;
      regulate immunity against HBV as shown by the lowered qHBsAg, can lower the risk of HCC&#xD;
      development of untreated patients.&#xD;
