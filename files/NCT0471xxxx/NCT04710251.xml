      PURPOSE OF PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if the speedometer based on the real-time image analysis can help endoscopists&#xD;
      increase their withdrawal time, which is defined as time spent examining the colon during&#xD;
      withdrawal of the colonoscope, during colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial hypothesis is that use of the speedometer during colonoscopy will increase the&#xD;
      average withdrawal time, which is defined as time spent examining the colon during withdrawal&#xD;
      of the colonoscope, by 1.6 minutes, possibly increasing the performance of the participating&#xD;
      endoscopists. Our objective is to clarify the clinical benefits of this digital tool in&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: Withdrawal time difference between colonoscopies done without the speedometer&#xD;
      (control period) and colonoscopies done with the speedometer (intervention period).&#xD;
