  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcomes of patients who undergo radical surgery for locally advanced and recurrent&#xD;
      rectal cancer have improved vastly, but there is a lack of emphasis on the quality-of-life&#xD;
      outcomes of these patients. This study will assess the patient experience of having a stoma&#xD;
      for urinary diversion as part of surgery for advanced pelvic malignancy. This will be&#xD;
      assessed at regular intervals both before and after surgery with the goal of increasing&#xD;
      awareness of patient beliefs and concerns with regards to their stomas and to devise&#xD;
      interventions that will improve their quality-of-life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considerable progress has been made in the management of advanced and recurrent pelvic cancer&#xD;
      over the last few decades. However, much emphasis has been placed on surgical and&#xD;
      hospital-related outcomes. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on patient&#xD;
      quality-of-life following major abdominopelvic surgery. However, there is a lack of updated&#xD;
      evidence on how patients manage and perceive their stomas. Managing a stoma is a difficult&#xD;
      task for patients and can adversely effect their quality-of-life. This study will investigate&#xD;
      specifically the impact of managing a urostomy or ileal conduit. Patients will be contacted&#xD;
      via an anonymized, opt-in SMS or email to answer a questionnaire, having previously been&#xD;
      provided with a patient information leaflet. This will take approximately 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete and will be carried out just prior to and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
      post-operatively. All of this data will be collated and published as part of a wider&#xD;
      investigation in to patient quality-of-life following major abdominal and pelvic surgery.&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in 35 countries.&#xD;
