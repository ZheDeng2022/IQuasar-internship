      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pemetrexed+platinum&#xD;
      chemotherapy+pembrolizumab (MK-3475) with or without lenvatinib (MK-7902/E7080) as first-line&#xD;
      intervention in adults from mainland China with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypotheses state that: 1) the combination of lenvatinib+platinum doublet&#xD;
      chemotherapy+pembrolizumab prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded&#xD;
      independent central review (BICR) per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      version 1.1 (RESIST 1.1) compared to matching placebo+platinum doublet&#xD;
      chemotherapy+pembrolizumab, and 2) the combination of lenvatinib+platinum doublet&#xD;
      chemotherapy+pembrolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) compared to matching&#xD;
      placebo+platinum doublet chemotherapy + pembrolizumab.&#xD;
