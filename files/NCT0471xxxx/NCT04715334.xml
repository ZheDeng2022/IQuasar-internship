    <textblock>
      Living with cerebral palsy is challenging for the child as well as the family charged with&#xD;
      their care and support needs. Many families seek effective and sustainable interventions to&#xD;
      improve gait of their children with cerebral palsy. The Mollii suit is a non-invasive&#xD;
      therapeutic technology using electrical stimulation in the form of whole-body garment with&#xD;
      multiple electrodes individually programmed to stimulate selected muscles. This study aims to&#xD;
      examine if the Mollii suit improve gait in ambulant children with cerebral palsy and if the&#xD;
      Mollii suit is acceptable and tolerable to children with cerebral palsy. We will recruit up&#xD;
      to 20 children with cerebral palsy. This study will evaluate change in gait and function&#xD;
      following a four-week intervention period using a protocol of wearing the Mollii suit at home&#xD;
      for one hour every day for four weeks using instrumented 3-dimensional gait analysis and&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Living with cerebral palsy is challenging for the child as well as the family charged with&#xD;
      their care and support needs. Many families seek effective and sustainable interventions to&#xD;
      improve gait of their children with cerebral palsy. An intervention that could be used in the&#xD;
      home setting, assessed periodically by health care professionals of a tertiary pediatric&#xD;
      centre, that has a benefit on gait and motor function in children with cerebral palsy might&#xD;
      be feasible to families in the local Singapore healthcare setting. The Mollii suit is a&#xD;
      non-invasive therapeutic technology using electrical stimulation in the form of whole-body&#xD;
      garment with multiple electrodes individually programmed to stimulate selected muscles. Based&#xD;
      on small preliminary studies, it is suggested that the Mollii suit improves mobility, gait,&#xD;
      function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine the effectiveness of the Mollii suit in improving gait in children&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy. It also aims to determine the value of the Mollii suit by evaluating the&#xD;
      acceptability, tolerance and compliance of the Mollii suit in children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre study that will recruit up to 20 children with cerebral palsy, GMFCS&#xD;
      I-III. This study will evaluate change in gait and function following a four-week&#xD;
      intervention period using a protocol of wearing the Mollii suit at home for one hour every&#xD;
      day for four weeks using instrumented 3-dimensional gait analysis and objective standardised&#xD;
      assessment tools. Primary outcome is improvement in gait, measured using the Gait Profile&#xD;
      Score, Gait Deviation index, gait speed and cadence. Secondary outcomes include changes in&#xD;
      functional assessments such as Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), Gross Motor&#xD;
      Function Measure (GMFM), 10 metre walk test, Goal attainment Scale (GAS) and quality of life&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

    <description>The Mollii suit is a new technology of electrical stimulation in the form of whole-body garment with multiple electrodes individually programmed to stimulate the selected muscles. Based on preliminary studies, it is suggested that the Mollii suit improves spasticity. Recent studies also proposed that it improves mobility, gait, function and quality of life. However, these studies are based on qualitative and subjective measures.</description>
