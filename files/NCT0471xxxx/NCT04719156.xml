  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor margin confirmation is important to confirming appropriate disease excision. Current&#xD;
      standard of care is to take select margin samples to pathology for intra-operative readings.&#xD;
      However, this is expensive, time consuming, and only assesses the margin contained within the&#xD;
      specific sample. In prior work the investigators have determined that indocyanine green (ICG)&#xD;
      is highly specific to the tumor bed when injected shortly before surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that ICG will be able to accurately identify residual positive tumor margins&#xD;
      during sarcoma excision procedures.&#xD;

      Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A physician investigator will obtain consent during the pre-operative appointment. Study&#xD;
           team members may assist with the discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Upon arrival to the pre-operative area 2 hours prior to surgery, the participant will be&#xD;
           injected with 2.5 mg/kg ICG (Indocyanine Green Dye) as per standard protocol: during&#xD;
           regular pre-operative work-up, during which a standard of care IV is inserted. The PI or&#xD;
           resident physician will administer the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participant will undergo the tumor removal surgery as planned pre-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess the accuracy and precision of ICG dye localization within tumor, not&#xD;
           non-tumor, a small sample of tumor and a small sample of native tissue will be obtained&#xD;
           for microscopy analysis (ICG fluorescence is possible on slides following frozen&#xD;
           sectioning) 30 seconds, no intra-operative delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Once the tumor is removed to the satisfaction of the surgeon, ICG Angiography (SPY PHI)&#xD;
           will be performed to detect any residual signal, 2-3 minutes, no re-draping required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The surgeon will complete a &quot;feedback sheet&quot; that assesses if the tumor was completely&#xD;
           excised (or an intentional positive margin was left).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The operative surgeon will be blinded to the angiography result. ICG Angiography will be&#xD;
           performed by the resident or surgical staff, without surgeon involvement. No study team&#xD;
           members are blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The dose that will be administered 2.5 mg/Kg IC. Doses are being based on measurements&#xD;
           on post-washout signal (or the remaining signal after the dye is metabolized). Weight&#xD;
           based dosing is therefore far more important. The proposed dosing is not close to the&#xD;
           LD50 (median lethal dose) of ICG and no side effects are anticipated with the increased&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The Stryker team will be perform an in-service for SPY PHI ( SPY portable hand held&#xD;
           imaging device) for all OR staff members, and individual demonstrations for each service&#xD;
           resident will be performed. The device is very simple to use and no active measurements&#xD;
           need to be made. No extended anesthesia will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The participant will be monitored for recurrence, which will be compared with ICG&#xD;
           angiography findings intra-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Study efficacy will be evaluated every 6 months, as early-termination and clinical&#xD;
           translation will be indicated should accuracy be proven in compliance with IRB&#xD;
           (Institutional Review Board) &quot;do no harm&quot; rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Radiographs, that are completed post operatively during the standard of care visit, will&#xD;
           be reviewed for this research.&#xD;
