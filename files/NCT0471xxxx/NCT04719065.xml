      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase Ib study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      efficacy and pharmacokinetic characteristics of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumor. 90 subjects will be recruited. The first 60 subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned into 2 groups, group A and group B. The 30 subjects in group A will&#xD;
      receive the Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m2 by an intravenous infusion (IV),&#xD;
      every 28 days (q4w, 1 cycle). The 30 subjects in group B will receive Mitoxantrone&#xD;
      Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m2, IV, every 21 days (q3w, 1 cycle). After this, the last 30&#xD;
      subjects will be assigned into group B. All subjects will receive the treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression, intolerable toxic reaction, death, or withdrawal by investigator or subject&#xD;
      decision (a maximum of 8 cycles). Delays in drug administration is allowed from cycle 2,&#xD;
      however, the delays should be no more than 3 weeks. Dose adjustments after cycle 2 is&#xD;
      permitted, and the minimum dose is 12 mg/m2.&#xD;
