  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zoonosis including brucellosis and rickettsial infections are a major contributor to&#xD;
      infectious morbidity in southern Israel. The Bedouins, a nomadic tribal population residing&#xD;
      in the Negev area are notably exposed to domesticated animals including livestock, camels and&#xD;
      companion animals, and their living conditions, especially with respect to poor sanitation in&#xD;
      different Bedouin communities also expose them to rodents and disease vectors such as insects&#xD;
      and arthropods. In this study, we aim to identify Bedouin patients arriving at the Soroka&#xD;
      University Medical Center, a tertiary hospital un the Negev, with undifferentiated fever,&#xD;
      suspected as a zoonosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to use molecular methods to better diagnose the infectious agent using whole blood&#xD;
      and serum samples, and when available other tissues or body fluid, and use next generation&#xD;
      sequencing technology to deeply examine bacterial features such as virulence factors, and&#xD;
      host pathogen interactions.&#xD;

      This study aims to apply advanced technologies for the investigation of febrile illness in&#xD;
      the Bedouin population, in order to improve laboratory diagnosis in terms of rapidity and&#xD;
      sensitivity and to better our understanding of the pathophysiology of infectious diseases in&#xD;
      the Bedouin population including various environmental exposures such as animal, water and&#xD;
      waste and antibiotic exposure, as well as host-pathogen interactions associated with pathogen&#xD;
      virulence, factors associated with chronicity and relapse, and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After screening, patients will be approached and offered the opportunity to participate&#xD;
           in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After signing of an informed consent patient will be interviewed and an enrollment&#xD;
           questionnaire will be filled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the patient is enrolled in the ED, blood, saliva, and stool samples will be&#xD;
           collected. In case the patient presented with a rash or a skin lesion, a swab from an&#xD;
           open lesion will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If patient was enrolled after receiving antibiotics, we will also attempt to locate&#xD;
           leftover blood samples that were drawn in the ED prior to receiving antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During hospitalization:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Seven days after hospitalization or on day of discharge (whichever comes first), an&#xD;
                attempt will be made to obtain a second set of samples (blood, saliva, and stool),&#xD;
                and clinical data will be drawn from the medical records regarding resolution of&#xD;
                symptoms, antibiotic treatment, complications etc. In case of any surgical&#xD;
                procedures done during the hospitalization period for diagnostic or therapeutic&#xD;
                purposes (e.g. skin biopsy, bone biopsy, arthrocentesis, lumbar puncture), any&#xD;
                leftover material deemed unnecessary for clinical purposes will be utilized for&#xD;
                analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the hospitalization, the patients will be interviewed and a WASH (Water,&#xD;
                Sanitation and Hygiene) questionnaire will be filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-discharge ambulatory follow- up:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the case of a scheduled follow up visit in the infectious disease clinic (or any&#xD;
                other planned visit in the ambulatory service of SUMC), if blood sampling is&#xD;
                performed, an attempt will be made to obtain whole blood and serum samples for&#xD;
                research purposes. If study-designated blood sampling is not feasible, leftover&#xD;
                material will be utilized for research purposes. If deemed clinically relevant, a&#xD;
                follow up questionnaire will be filled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrent hospitalizations within the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
           o In case of recurrent admission during the year after enrolment, the hospitalization&#xD;
           will be assessed by the research team as &quot;related&quot; or &quot;non-related&quot; to the original&#xD;
           diagnosis. If considered related to the studied disease or its complications, an attempt&#xD;
           will be made to perform another blood sampling, and any leftover material from clinical&#xD;
           sampling of other body sites (biopsies, surgical intervention or drainage) will be&#xD;
           utilized for analysis. If deemed clinically relevant, a follow up questionnaire will be&#xD;
           filled out. As recurrent hospitalization are analyzed as part of the study, they will&#xD;
           not be considered serious adverse events (SAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six months after enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Telephone interview for establishing clinical outcomes (protocol attached in&#xD;
           appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One year post enrollment, data regarding antibiotic use, recurrent&#xD;
                hospitalizations, and long term complications will be collected from the patient's'&#xD;
                medical files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient enrolled in this study will undergo the following workup:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood and serum samples will be obtained at enrollment, and if possible, upon discharge&#xD;
      and every planned ambulatory outpatient clinic visit or recurrent hospitalization. In case&#xD;
      that the patient was enrolled during hospital stay due to a positive test result, any&#xD;
      remaining leftovers from clinical non-research samples obtained prior to antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment, will potentially be used for research purposes, as long as they are not needed for&#xD;
      clinical use, and within the usual time frame of their storage in the relevant hospital lab.&#xD;
      Maximum blood volume obtained for analysis at each time point will be 10 ml for adults, and 5&#xD;
      ml for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other clinical sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrolment, saliva and stool samples will be obtained for microbiological analysis&#xD;
      including microbiome profiling, and any rash or wound sampling will also be analyzed by&#xD;
      molecular and metagenomic methods for the diagnosis of the culprit pathogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample processing and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be stored at the Moran-Gilad lab, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion&#xD;
      University of the Negev, for five years after enrolment. Processing of the samples will be&#xD;
      done in batches, and not in real time therefore, will not produce any real-time data that&#xD;
      could affect clinical decisions. The results of the analysis will not be available for the&#xD;
      treating physician. For the purpose of bacterial genomic/metagenomic sequencing, DNA will be&#xD;
      extracted from whole blood samples, and only microbial DNA will be identified and analyzed&#xD;
      from the extracted material. No research on human DNA will be performed in this study.&#xD;
      Bacterial isolates grown in standard cultures will be analyzed for further characterization&#xD;
      (e.g. virulence). Brucella or other bacterial isolates identified through standard cultures&#xD;
      will be further analyzed using in-vitro models including tissue culture for the analysis of&#xD;
      host-pathogen interactions. Immune response in clinical samples will be analyzed for host&#xD;
      inflammatory signals (e.g. gene expression, measurement of proteins). For the purpose of&#xD;
      improving diagnostic capability, specific PCR testing for zoonoses (such as Brucella,&#xD;
      Rickettsia, and Q fever, or others as needed) will be done on whole blood samples, attempting&#xD;
      to examine their utility and concordance with other means of diagnosis, and compared to&#xD;
      serological workup that will be performed using serum samples. All samples will be analyzed&#xD;
      according to proper biosafety level and good laboratory practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-data collection and patient information All patients will be asked to fill a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding the details of their current illness (attached in Hebrew and Arabic),&#xD;
      and their living conditions and exposure to animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metadata including demographic data, health status, including chronic medical illnesses, and&#xD;
      prior hospitalizations, past history of zoonotic illnesses, will be collected from the&#xD;
      medical records. During hospitalization the following parameters will be collected: vital&#xD;
      signs including time till resolution of fever, lab testing and imaging results, and any&#xD;
      surgical procedure or intensive care unit stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will also be collected from the patient's medical records during the year following&#xD;
      enrollment to the study regarding factors associated with clinical outcomes including:&#xD;
      recurrent hospitalizations, antibiotic consumption, follow up blood test results such as&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, blood count, liver enzymes, and follow up serologic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period and size This study aims to include a total of 500 patients, over three years,&#xD;
      starting September 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations and data security All patients enrolled in the study will be assigned&#xD;
      a serial study number. All samples collected during this study will be labeled with the study&#xD;
      number, and no other identifying information will be present on the collected samples. Files&#xD;
      containing meta-data and questionnaires will also be labeled using study number. Informed&#xD;
      consent forms containing identifying data will be kept in a locked office accessed only by&#xD;
      the study team and a coding file matching identifying material with study numbers will be&#xD;
      saved on a password-protected server on hospital computers. Identifying data will be used for&#xD;
      the purpose of the follow-up phone interview at the end of the study period, and all&#xD;
      information obtained will then be de-identified and stored using the study code. All data&#xD;
      will be stored using REDCap secured web application.&#xD;
