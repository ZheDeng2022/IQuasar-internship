  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise is associated with many benefits in patients with cancer treatments. Among&#xD;
      these, the reduction of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the best demonstrated.&#xD;
      Besides, several animal models have shown a marked reduction in tumor growth with aerobic&#xD;
      exercise, sometimes by more than 60%. As the level of physical activity is convincingly&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in the risk of cancer or recurrences, this suggests that aerobic&#xD;
      exercise may represent a central therapeutic approach during treatment, both against CRF and&#xD;
      for its potential anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both benefits have been suggested to be based on the immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects of exercise. Indeed, systemic inflammatory activity seems to play a central role in&#xD;
      the etiology of CRF during cancer treatments, among other things by stimulating the&#xD;
      neuro-inflammatory activity of the central nervous system. Also, regarding the anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect of exercise, animal models show that this benefit is partly explained by an increase&#xD;
      in the activity of immune cells called natural killers (Natural Killer; NK) in tumor tissue&#xD;
      and a reduction in the activity of regulatory T cells, the latter having an immunosuppressive&#xD;
      effect. However, in humans, the results vary. While some improvement in NK cell activity has&#xD;
      been reported in response to aerobic training in breast cancer survivors, others have seen no&#xD;
      effect on the immune profile of patients and survivors. On the other hand, some authors&#xD;
      report an improvement in the inflammatory profile with training, while others report little&#xD;
      or no effect, as well as weak associations with the perception of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these results seem to discredit the hypothesis of immune and inflammatory regulation&#xD;
      of exercise in humans, these studies have all looked at the effect of several weeks of&#xD;
      training on the inflammatory and immune profile on an empty stomach and rest. However,&#xD;
      several results from the field of exercise immunology convincingly show that the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect, as well as the immunostimulating effect of aerobic exercise&#xD;
      (including the anti-tumor activity of NK cells) are mainly acute and transient, ie. in the&#xD;
      hours following the end of the effort. Furthermore, certain results suggest that in the&#xD;
      context of chemotherapy treatments, cyclical treatment by nature, the peaks of fatigue are&#xD;
      also acute (i.e. in the days following the treatment) and parallel to peaks of inflammatory&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering these results, it is therefore plausible to assume that the effect of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise on suppressing tumor growth and reducing CRF results rather than the repetition of&#xD;
      this acute response at each exercise session. In this case, the prescription of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise preceding a session of chemotherapy could potentially represent an interesting&#xD;
      therapeutic modality, allowing both the reduction of the CRF associated with this treatment,&#xD;
      as well as a better response to the treatment. Besides, as this acute response seems to be&#xD;
      highly dependent on the intensity of the effort, high-intensity interval training (HIIT)&#xD;
      could be a particularly interesting approach in this context, because it does not require&#xD;
      that the high intensity or long-lasting exercise. However, considering the immunosuppressive&#xD;
      and pro-inflammatory effects of chemotherapy, the extent of the acute response to exercise&#xD;
      may not allow this type of therapeutic use to be considered in this population. To date, no&#xD;
      study has attempted to characterize the acute immune and inflammatory response following&#xD;
      aerobic exercise in patients currently undergoing chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;
