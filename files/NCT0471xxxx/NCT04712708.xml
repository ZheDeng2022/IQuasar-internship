  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders of movement and posture, causing several body&#xD;
      impairments. CP is caused by non-progressive disturbance that occurred in the fetal or&#xD;
      immature brain. CP symptoms include several motor disorders such as disturbances in&#xD;
      sensation, coordination, cognition, communication and behavior in addition to disturbances in&#xD;
      postural stability, balance and coordination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance is the ability to maintain the center of body mass over the base of support. CP&#xD;
      causes balance impairment which results in decrease in the child's mobility functions and&#xD;
      causing activity limitation and participations restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor coordination is the registration of two or more things such as body movements , timing&#xD;
      or sensory feedback into a harmonious relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CP causes disturbances in motor coordination such as difficulties in the routine gross&#xD;
      movements as running and jumping, and disturbances in common fine movements like buttoning,&#xD;
      clothing or brushing hair Rebound therapy is an exercise therapy which uses mini trampolines,&#xD;
      rebounders , Springfree Trampoline and Swiss balls, to provide opportunity to perform&#xD;
      recreational movements for individuals with different body structural and functional&#xD;
      impairments.&#xD;

    <description>Rebound therapy is the therapeutic use of full sized trampoline or mini sized trampoline. It provides opportunities for exercise recreation and therapy; and it is distinct from gymnastic trampolining. It is used for facilitating movements, improving balance, enhancing coordination and promoting motor performances in children with different disorders includes learning disabilities, communication disorders and motor dysfunction (Rebound Therapy South Africa, 2020; The Chartered society of Physiotherapists, 2016).</description>
