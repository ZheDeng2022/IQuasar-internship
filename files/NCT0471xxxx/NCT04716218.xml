  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with limited neck extension and mouth opening due to reasons including previous&#xD;
      radiation therapy in the head and neck area or cervical spine pathology, tracheal intubation&#xD;
      with direct laryngoscopy (DL) are challenging because of the difficulty in aligning the oral,&#xD;
      pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes in order to visualize the cords. In contrast,&#xD;
      video-laryngoscopes (VL) only require alignment of the pharyngeal and laryngeal axes, which&#xD;
      lie along much more similar angles when compared with the oral axis. Thus, VL make tracheal&#xD;
      intubation easier to accomplish in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good patient positioning also maximizes the chance of successful laryngoscopy and tracheal&#xD;
      intubation. In difficult airway society 2015 guidelines, advantages of head-up positioning&#xD;
      and ramping, which brings the patient's sternum onto the horizontal plane of the external&#xD;
      auditory meatus (EAM), are highlighted. In the obese patient, the 'ramped' position should be&#xD;
      used routinely because this improves the view during DL. This position is usually achieved by&#xD;
      placing blankets or other devices under the patient's head and shoulders, but can also be&#xD;
      achieved simply by configuring the operation room (OR) table into a back-up head elevated&#xD;
      (BUHE) position. Significantly improved glottic views on DL have been reported with both&#xD;
      obese and non-obese adult patients in BUHE position. However, the effect of this simple&#xD;
      maneuver on laryngeal visualization with the VL in patients with limited neck extension and&#xD;
      mouth opening has not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that BUHE position might improve laryngeal views and make&#xD;
      intubation easier compared to the supine position with the VL in patients with simulated&#xD;
      difficult airway (application of a cervical collar to limit mouth opening and neck&#xD;
      movement).The investigator investigated primarily the improvement in visualization of the&#xD;
      glottis and, secondarily, the ease of tracheal intubation after alignment of the EAM and&#xD;
      sternal notch.&#xD;
