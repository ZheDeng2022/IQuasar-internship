  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of neuromodulation for treatment of&#xD;
      chronic constipation in pediatric patients and evaluate the differences between the invasive&#xD;
      and non-invasive approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are selected according to the eligibility requirements. After being informed about&#xD;
      the study and potential risks of neuromodulation, all included patients and next of kin give&#xD;
      written informed consent to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, patients are randomized to one of the two predefined subgroups: either invasive&#xD;
      sacral nerve stimulation or non-invasive sacral nerve stimulation. Clinical symptoms and&#xD;
      outcome variables are compared with beginning of non-invasive sacral nerve stimulation or&#xD;
      starting from implantation of tined lead. Patients are closely monitored within 6 months.&#xD;
      Treatment success is evaluated in routine clinical check-ups (week 4/8/12 and 24) and via&#xD;
      specialized questionnaires and bowel movement diaries. Quality of life is evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 and 24 weeks after start of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life is classified via the 'Revised Children's Quality of Life Questionnaire' (KINDLR). It consists of 24 5-point Likert-scale items, covering 6 quality of life dimensions: physical well-being, emotional well-being, self-esteem, family, friends and daily functioning (school or nursery school/kindergarten). Items are partially reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale according to the manual. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Sacral nerve stimulation is surgically implanted within three surgeries:&#xD;
Implantation of a test stimulation system for 3 weeks: A trail electrode is implanted to neuronal fibers of S3/4 on both sides as a confirmatory diagnostical step. Stimulation is conducted via an external pulse generator.&#xD;
Implantation of the final electrode (tined-lead electrode). The stimulation remains to be generated externally by an external pacemaker.&#xD;
Implantation of the internal pacemaker system 4 weeks after the electrode's implantation.&#xD;
Stimulation parameters: Single current, frequency 15Hz, duration 210μs. Stimulation intensity is individually determined beyond the pain threshold (adjustable amplitude between 0-10mA, depending on the intraoperative response).&#xD;
Start point of clinical evaluation is time of implantation of tined lead electrode.&#xD;
Medical and behavioral therapy is to be continued as started before intervention and can be adjusted under neuromodulation.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Non-invasive Sacral Nerve Stimulation</arm_group_label>

    <description>Two adhesive electrodes are placed paravertebrally between L1 and L4 and periumbilically, generating an electrical field by single current with a 15 Hz frequency for a duration of 210μs. Stimulation intensity is individually determined to achieve an effective and comfortable stimulation beyond the pain threshold (adjustable amplitude between 0-10mA).&#xD;
Start point of clinical evaluation is start of external stimulation.&#xD;
Medical and behavioral therapy is to be continued as started before intervention and can be adjusted under neuromodulation.</description>
