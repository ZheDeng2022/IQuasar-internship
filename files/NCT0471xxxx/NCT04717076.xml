      The PrevA study is designed to evaluate our developed nutritional concept to implement a&#xD;
      heart healthy diet. The nutritional concept based on nutrient-optimized daily menu plans for&#xD;
      each study day. The plans are personalized according to participants age, gender, and level&#xD;
      of physical activity. The PrevA study consists of four periods differing in the energy intake&#xD;
      specified by the menu plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is carried out in a 4-armed parallel design. In group 1, the participants receive&#xD;
      the individualized daily plans via the app coupled with the smartwatch to record participants&#xD;
      physical activity and heart rate. Groups 2 and 3 receive a printed version of the daily plans&#xD;
      with or without personal nutritional advice. The fourth group serves as a control group,&#xD;
      which receives general nutritional recommendations but no daily menu plans. During this time,&#xD;
      blood samples and urine are collected every four weeks to analyze the study parameters.&#xD;

      Smartphone-based communication technologies are developing rapidly, and the number of&#xD;
      so-called mobile health applications is rising. The number of validated and scientifically&#xD;
      tested offers is comparatively small. To address this weak point, we developed a personalized&#xD;
      nutritional concept to implement a heart-healthy diet. In cooperation with the Preventicus&#xD;
      GmbH, Jena, the concept was integrated in an App-based tool. In addition, the app relates to&#xD;
      a smartwatch to encourage and track physical activity. The PrevA study will be conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the overall concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional concept based on nutrient-optimized daily menu plans for each study day. The&#xD;
      plans are personalized according to participants age, gender, and level of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is carried out in a 4-armed parallel design. In group 1, the participants receive&#xD;
      the individualized daily plans via the app coupled with the smartwatch to record participants&#xD;
      physical activity and heart rate. Groups 2 and 3 receive a printed version of the daily plans&#xD;
      with or without personal nutritional advice. The fourth group serves as a control group,&#xD;
      which receives general nutritional recommendations but no daily menu plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In groups 1 to 3, the daily plans are issued in 4 energy levels. At the beginning, the test&#xD;
      subjects receive daily plans according to the recommendations for energy intake of the German&#xD;
      Nutrition Society (DGE), adapted to their age, gender, and activity level (level 1). After&#xD;
      four study weeks, the energy content of the plans is reduced to 85% of the energy intake&#xD;
      recommended by the DGE (level 2) and after further four weeks of the PrevA study the energy&#xD;
      level is reduced to 70% of the energy intake recommended by the DGE (level 3). Level 4 serves&#xD;
      as a stabilization phase and provides the energy content of level 1. The study period extends&#xD;
      over a total of 16 study weeks. During this time, blood samples and urine are collected every&#xD;
      four weeks to analyze the study parameters. In addition, anthropometric data, data on&#xD;
      personal health status and cardiovascular risk profile are assessed.&#xD;
