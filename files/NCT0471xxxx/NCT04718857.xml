    <textblock>
      Based on the combination of domestic and foreign experience and the needs of patients as the&#xD;
      orientation, this research gives full play to the hospital's advantages in chronic disease&#xD;
      management, and uses network information technology to develop a systematic and intelligent&#xD;
      system that integrates prevention, diagnosis and treatment, follow-up, and education.&#xD;

      Patients with hypertension are showing a trend of getting younger and younger, and&#xD;
      high-normal blood pressure is increasing rapidly among the young and middle-aged people aged&#xD;
      less than 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young and middle-aged patients with hypertension have a lower absolute short-term&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk, but their lifetime risk is higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the awareness rate, treatment rate and control rate (&quot;three rates&quot;)&#xD;
      of young and middle-aged hypertensive patients in my country need to be improved urgently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the knowledge and behavior of young and middle-aged hypertensive patients with&#xD;
      disease, treatment compliance and self-health management has become the focus of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Internet + medical&quot; through information network technology, innovative service models have&#xD;
      become a trend.&#xD;

    <description>The self-management behavior assessment scale for hypertensive patients includes six dimensions of medication management, condition monitoring, diet management, exercise management, rest and work management, and emotional management, as well as the assessment of the total level of self-management. There are 33 items in total, the sum of the scores of each item For the final total score of the scale, the items use Likert 5-level scoring method, which is always (5 points), often (4 points), sometimes (3 points), rarely (2 points), never (1 point).</description>

    <description>The &quot;Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension in China (2018 Revised Edition)&quot; recommends that blood pressure be reduced to &lt;140/90 mmHg. In this study, the blood pressure compliance rate means that the patient's blood pressure measurement value is less than 140/90mmHg and stable for more than one month. Blood pressure compliance rate = number of people meeting blood pressure/total number of people receiving chronic disease management in outpatient clinics * 100%.</description>
