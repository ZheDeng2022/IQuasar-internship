&#xD;
          2. Patients must have a diagnosis of advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM) or smoldering&#xD;
             systemic mastocytosis (SSM). AdvSM includes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological neoplasm of non-mast-cell&#xD;
                  lineage (SM-AHN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mast cell leukemia (MCL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient or legal guardian, if permitted by local regulatory authorities, provides&#xD;
             written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is not eligible for an ongoing study of avapritinib or cannot access an&#xD;
             ongoing study of avapritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient meets any of the following laboratory criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3.0 × upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal (ULN); no restriction if due to suspected liver infiltration by&#xD;
                  mast cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN (&gt;3 x ULN in the case of Gilbert's disease); no restriction&#xD;
                  if due to suspected liver infiltration by mast cells or Gilbert's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or creatinine&gt;&#xD;
                  1.5 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count &lt; 50,000/μL (within 4 weeks of the first dose of avapritinib) or&#xD;
                  receiving platelet transfusion(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has a history of a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attacks&#xD;
             within 1 year before the first dose of avapritinib or any other known risks of&#xD;
             intracranial bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has a known risk or recent history (12 months before the first dose of&#xD;
             avapritinib) of intracranial bleeding (e.g., brain aneurysm, concomitant vitamin K&#xD;
             antagonist use).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has a primary brain malignancy or metastases to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has clinically significant, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, including&#xD;
             Grade III or IV congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association&#xD;
             classification; myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the previous 6 months;&#xD;
             clinically significant, uncontrolled arrhythmias; or uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female patients who are unwilling, if not postmenopausal or surgically sterile, to&#xD;
             abstain from sexual intercourse or employ highly effective contraception during the&#xD;
             avapritinib administration period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             avapritinib. Men who are unwilling, if not surgically sterile, to abstain from sexual&#xD;
             intercourse or employ highly effective contraception during the avapritinib&#xD;
             administration period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of avapritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has had a major surgical procedure (minor surgical procedures such as central&#xD;
             venous catheter placement, tumor needle biopsy, and feeding tube placement are not&#xD;
             considered major surgical procedures) within 14 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             avapritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Hypersensitivity to avapritinib or to any of the excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient is participating in another interventional study.&#xD;
