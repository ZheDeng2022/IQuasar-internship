    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-center, single arm, open-label study, to establish the PK&#xD;
      parameters of Vivitrol 380 mg IM injection (IP), a US FDA approved medication. Participants&#xD;
      will be healthy volunteers with no significant medical or mental health disorders, who have&#xD;
      completed participation in clinical trial GM 0017 (i.e. have received the OLANI treatment and&#xD;
      have subsequently provided two consecutive plasma levels of naltrexone (NTX) &lt;0.1ng/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the PK profile of Vivitrol IM 380 mg over 6 doses for a treatment&#xD;
      period of 196 days. Intense sampling will occur after the 1st and 6th dose of Vivitrol.&#xD;
      Participants will be without a DSM 5 - Substance Related Disorders classification.&#xD;
      Participants will be required to undergo a Naloxone Challenge Test (NCT) to confirm opiate&#xD;
      naivety before administration of the IP. No randomization will occur.&#xD;
