      Importance and Purpose of the Study: Proper management of the difficult airway is an&#xD;
      important part of preventing anesthesia-related mortality and morbidity. Difficult airways,&#xD;
      characterized by both difficult mask ventilation and difficult intubation, are common in&#xD;
      obese patients. Many studies have shown an association between obesity or morbid obesity and&#xD;
      difficult intubation. We thought that in obese patients, increased subcutaneous fat tissue in&#xD;
      the nape of the neck may restrict the head extension and cause difficult intubation and&#xD;
      difficult mask ventilation, and the increase in the chin-nape circumference may predict&#xD;
      difficult intubation and difficult mask ventilation. We also predicted that the ratio of neck&#xD;
      circumference to chin-nape circumference might predict difficult intubation and difficult&#xD;
      mask ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: After the approval of the ethics committee, obese patients who require&#xD;
      tracheal intubation, undergo elective surgery, over the age of 18, with a body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) of more than 30 were evaluated. Patients with cervical spine anomaly, emergency&#xD;
      procedures, known history of difficult intubation or upper respiratory tract disease, and&#xD;
      planned awake intubation were excluded from the study. Mallampati score, mouth opening, upper&#xD;
      lip bite test, distance between incisors, thyromental distance, sternomental distance and&#xD;
      thyromental height were recorded. Using a tape measure, the neck circumference from the&#xD;
      thyroid cartilage level and the chin-neck circumference from the mentum level were measured&#xD;
      with the patient in a neutral position. The ratio of neck circumference to thyromental&#xD;
      distance and the ratio of neck circumference to chin-nape circumference were calculated from&#xD;
      these measurements. Mask ventilation was graded according to the method described by Han et&#xD;
      al. After adequate muscle relaxation was achieved, tracheal intubation was performed with an&#xD;
      appropriately sized Macintosh blade using direct laryngoscopy. Difficult intubation&#xD;
      evaluation was performed using the Difficult Intubation Scale (IDS) based on seven variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: A statistically significant relationship was found between difficult intubation and&#xD;
      the distance between incisors, neck circumference, neck circumference / thyromental distance,&#xD;
      neck circumference / sternomental distance, and chin-nape circumference. In the multivariate&#xD;
      regression analysis performed with these parameters, the distance between the incisors was&#xD;
      &lt;4.85 cm and the neck circumference&gt; 41.5 cm was found to be independent risk factors for&#xD;
      difficult intubation. A statistically significant relationship was found between difficult&#xD;
      mask ventilation and age, male gender, OSAS, neck circumference, neck circumference /&#xD;
      thyromental distance, neck circumference / sternomental distance, neck circumference /&#xD;
      chin-nape circumference and chin-nape circumference. In the multivariate regression analysis&#xD;
      performed with these parameters, it was determined that male gender and neck circumference&#xD;
      thicker than 45.5 cm were independent risk factors for difficult mask ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The ratio of neck circumference to chin-nape circumference and chin-nape&#xD;
      circumference are successful in predicting difficult mask ventilation in obese patients.&#xD;
      While chin-nape circumference is successful in predicting difficult intubation in obese&#xD;
      patients, neck circumference / chin-nape circumference is unsuccessful.&#xD;
