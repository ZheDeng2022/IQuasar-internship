    <description>Pain will be assessed at rest and on coughing using the VAS on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain) before the block, 30 minutes, 60 minutes after the block, and then every six hours for 4 days. But in order not to interrupt the sleeping pattern of patients, patients will be considered pain free (VAS= 0) if they will be at sleep with no tachypnea, tachycardia, or hypertension.</description>

    <intervention_name>Thoracic paravertebral block</intervention_name>
    <description>A bolus dose of 0.25% bupivacaine (0.3 ml/kg) will be injected slowly over 3-5 minutes. At 30 minutes after injection of the loading dose, the dermatomal loss of sensation to pinprick was tested. Patients who reported pain to pinprick will be considered to have a failed block and were excluded from the study. The block will be maintained by continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% at a rate of 0.1 ml/kg/h via a syringe pump. The infusion will be continued for 4 days.</description>

    <intervention_name>Serratus anterior plane block</intervention_name>
    <description>A bolus of 30 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected slowly over 3-5 minutes between latissmus dorsi muscle and serratus anterior muscle (Figure 15). Then a catheter was inserted through the Tuohy needle and advanced 3cm into the space and secured in place. At 30 minutes after injection of a loading dose, the dermatomal loss of sensation to pinprick will be tested. Patients who reported pain to pinprick will be considered to have a failed block and were excluded from the study. The block will be maintained by continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% at a rate of 0.1 ml/kg/h via a syringe pump. The infusion was continued for 4 days.</description>
