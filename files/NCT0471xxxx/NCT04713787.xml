    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy of different doses of oxfendazole versus a&#xD;
      single dose of albendazole in curing or reducing the egg burden in subjects with T. trichiura&#xD;
      infections. 249 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dose-groups to&#xD;
      receive a single dose of oxfendazole 400 mg or 800 mg, or a single dose of albendazole 400&#xD;
      mg. The study team members and study subjects will not be blinded to the dose group. However,&#xD;
      the laboratory assessors evaluating the stool samples will be blinded. Subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited in Iquitos, Peru, and surrounding villages where there is a high prevalence of T.&#xD;
      trichiura infection. Subjects will be solicited through town hall meetings and local clinics&#xD;
      and through recommendations from local care providers. A two-stage screening process will be&#xD;
      utilized. If subjects are found on the screening stool exam to have only a stool parasite&#xD;
      other than T. trichuria or if the subject chooses not to participate in the study, the&#xD;
      subject will be referred to a local health provider. If stool analysis performed at the end&#xD;
      of the study period demonstrates stool parasites, the subjects will be contacted and referred&#xD;
      to their local health provider where they will receive standard of care treatment. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to assess the cure rate of different dose regimens of oxfendazole vs.&#xD;
      albendazole in the treatment of T. trichiura infections using the Kato-Katz stool examination&#xD;
      method.&#xD;

      are to: 1) assess the cure rate of different dose regimens of oxfendazole vs albendazole in&#xD;
      the treatment of T. trichiura infections using the stool concentration examination method, 2)&#xD;
      assess the clinical response compared to baseline, as shown by reduction in T. trichiura egg&#xD;
      counts using the Kato-Katz stool examination method, 3) assess the clinical response compared&#xD;
      to baseline, as shown by reduction in T. trichiura egg counts using the stool concentration&#xD;
      method, 4) assess the proportion of subjects with moderate or heavy infection before&#xD;
      treatment who had no infection or only light infection after treatment using the Kato-Katz&#xD;
      stool examination method, 5) assess the proportion of subjects with moderate or heavy&#xD;
      infection before treatment who had no infection or only light infection after treatment using&#xD;
      the stool concentration examination method, 6) establish the spectrum of activity of&#xD;
      oxfendazole against other intestinal helminths using the Kato-Katz stool examination method,&#xD;
      7) establish the spectrum of activity of oxfendazole against other intestinal helminths using&#xD;
      the stool concentration examination method, 8) assess the tolerability of each oxfendazole&#xD;
      dose group compared to the albendazole dose group, and 9) assess the safety in subjects&#xD;
      treated with oxfendazole.&#xD;

             limit of normal (ULN) for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has a known history of hepatic dysfunction or AST, ALT, total bilirubin &gt;/=1.5 times&#xD;
