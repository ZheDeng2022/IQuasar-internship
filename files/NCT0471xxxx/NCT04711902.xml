      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in Chinese&#xD;
      participants with active PsA compared to placebo&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. A&#xD;
      screening period running up to 10 weeks before randomization will be used to assess&#xD;
      participant eligibility followed by 52 weeks of treatment. At baseline, approximately 40&#xD;
      Chinese patients will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit will be done 12 weeks after last study treatment administration for all&#xD;
      participants, regardless of whether they complete the entire study as planned or discontinue&#xD;
      prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total combined duration of treatment for this Phase III study is 52 weeks. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to demonstrate the treatment effect of secukinumab in Chinese subjects with&#xD;
      active PsA by assessing ACR20 response rates at Week 16&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>At Baseline, the patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of the following two groups.&#xD;
Group 1 : Secukinumab Dose level 1 s.c. at BSL, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 Group 2 : Secukinumab Placebo s.c. at BSL, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12.&#xD;
At Week 16, the participants in Group 1 and Group 2 will be re-randomized:&#xD;
Group 1: Secukinumab dose level 2 s.c. regimen and placebo OR secukinumab dose level 2 every 4 weeks from Week 16 to Week 48.&#xD;
Group 2: Secukinumab dose level 2 s.c. regimen and placebo OR secukinumab dose level 2 every 4 weeks from Week 16 to Week 48.</intervention_model_description>
