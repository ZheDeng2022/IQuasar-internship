  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FIREFLI is a large, pragmatic, individually randomised, controlled trial with embedded&#xD;
      economic and qualitative evaluations. The aim of the research is to see whether Safe and Well&#xD;
      Visits delivered by the Fire and Rescue Service will lead to a reduction in the number of&#xD;
      falls and an improvement in health-related quality of life in older people. It will also look&#xD;
      at the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and explore the acceptability of the Safe and&#xD;
      Well Visits to older people and the Fire and Rescue Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 1156 participants, randomly divided into two equal groups. One&#xD;
      group (the intervention group) will receive the Safe and Well Visit at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study and the other group (the control group) will receive the visit at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect the number of falls people have using monthly falls calendars&#xD;
      and follow up other outcomes by questionnaires at four, eight and 12 months&#xD;
      post-randomisation. The investigators will also undertake interviews with some participants&#xD;
      and with Fire and Rescue Service staff to explore experiences around the Safe and Well&#xD;
      Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two Studies within a Trial (SWAT) will be carried out to investigate more efficient ways of&#xD;
      running trials. The first will test if using a recruitment invitation letter informed by&#xD;
      Self-Determination Theory will increase the number of participants who take part in the&#xD;
      study. The second will test if including a pen with the reminder four-month questionnaire&#xD;
      will increase the number of postal questionnaires returned to the study team.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Fire and Rescue Services routinely carry out around 670,000 fire safety check visits in&#xD;
      England each year in people's homes. The aim of these 'Safe and Well Visits' is to reduce&#xD;
      fire risks, support independent living, improve quality of life, and help prevent avoidable&#xD;
      hospital admissions and excess winter deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One part of the Safe and Well Visit is looking at ways to prevent falls. For some people,&#xD;
      falling can cause serious health issues and in some cases may be fatal. About a third of&#xD;
      people over the age of 65, and half of those over 80, will fall each year. Many of these&#xD;
      falls happen at home. Falling may cause people to lose confidence, feel as if they have lost&#xD;
      their independence and become withdrawn. About a fifth of all of the falls people have need&#xD;
      medical attention. There were around 210,000 people admitted to hospital, as an emergency, in&#xD;
      England in 2016 due to having had a fall. It costs the National Health Service (NHS) about&#xD;
      Â£2.3 billion a year to treat patients who fall. The problem is likely to get worse as people&#xD;
      are living longer. What investigators do not know is whether Safe and Well Visits undertaken&#xD;
      by members of the Fire and Rescue Service reduce falls and can improve health-related quality&#xD;
      of life and if they are good value for money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if Safe and Well Visits reduce the number of falls older people have and improve&#xD;
      their quality of life, investigators will conduct a trial. The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      1156 people aged 70 years and over from lists of people held on Fire and Rescue Service&#xD;
      databases and allocate half of the people to receive a Safe and Well Visit at the start of&#xD;
      the study. The visit will last about an hour and will be tailored to the risks of the people&#xD;
      living in the household. The other half of the people will receive the Safe and Well Visit&#xD;
      after 12 months (when they have finished the study). Everyone will receive a falls prevention&#xD;
      leaflet from Age United Kingdom and their usual care from their General Practitioner and&#xD;
      other health care professionals. Participants will be asked to fill in monthly falls&#xD;
      calendars and three postal questionnaires over 12 months to collect information about falls,&#xD;
      their quality of life, how often they have used NHS services, and whether they are doing any&#xD;
      activities that make them more likely to have a fire in their home. This information may be&#xD;
      collected over the phone or investigators may send questionnaires in the post. Researchers&#xD;
      will analyse the data to find out if the Safe and Well Visits reduce falls and if they are&#xD;
      good value for money. The investigators also want to find out if the Safe and Well Visits are&#xD;
      acceptable to older people and to the Fire and Rescue Service. This will be explored through&#xD;
      a series of in-depth interviews. The investigators will assess treatment fidelity using the&#xD;
      following strategies: observations of those delivering the Safe and Well Visits; delivery&#xD;
      inventory will be completed for each participant; participant outcome questionnaires will&#xD;
      include information on adherence with the intervention; and interviews with trial&#xD;
      participants and members of the Fire and Rescue Service who delivered the Safe and Well&#xD;
      Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the main FIREFLI study investigators will undertake two additional trial&#xD;
      methodological Studies within a Trial (SWAT) to evaluate one recruitment and one retention&#xD;
      strategy. The first will test if using a recruitment invitation letter informed by&#xD;
      Self-Determination Theory will increase the number of participants who take part in the&#xD;
      study. The second will test if including a pen with the reminder four-month questionnaire&#xD;
      will increase the number of postal questionnaires returned to the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the trial is completed, the investigators will make sure the results can be used by as&#xD;
      many people as possible. They will send the people who took part in the study a summary of&#xD;
      the findings, and the results will be presented at relevant conferences and published in&#xD;
      scientific journals. Investigators will share these findings with other Fire and Rescue&#xD;
      Services.&#xD;
