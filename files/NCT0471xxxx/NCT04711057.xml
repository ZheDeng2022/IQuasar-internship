  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRDs) are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      ranking as the third leading cause of death worldwide. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a&#xD;
      fundamental evidence-based intervention for the management of a variety of CRDs, such as&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs). However,&#xD;
      the benefits of PR tend to decline over time and there is currently no strong evidence that&#xD;
      patients translate those benefits into a more active lifestyle. There is an urgent need for&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions to promote physical activity (PA) participation, whilst&#xD;
      maintaining PR positive effects in the long-term. Community-based PA interventions adjusted&#xD;
      to the local context, as well as patients' needs and preferences, might be a key strategy to&#xD;
      meet this target. CENTR(AR) will be a sustainable response to support healthy lifestyles and&#xD;
      enhance long-term PR benefits, by providing access to PR within Primary Healthcare Centres&#xD;
      (PHC), followed by the inclusion in a community-based PA program, which embraces urban&#xD;
      facilities and available resources.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Global Burden Disease Study 2017 estimated that 544.9 million people worldwide had a&#xD;
      chronic respiratory disease (CRD). Globally, it is estimated that 3.914.196 deaths were due&#xD;
      to CRDs in 2017, accounting for 7% of total all-cause deaths, ranking CRDs as the third&#xD;
      leading cause of death worldwide. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a well-established,&#xD;
      cost-effective intervention for the management of CRDs (e.g., COPD, ILD), which has been&#xD;
      found to improve exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life. Unfortunately, PR remains&#xD;
      an underutilized resource in the community. Despite substantial improvement following PR,&#xD;
      benefits tend to decline over time (approximately, within a 12-month period) and there is&#xD;
      currently no strong evidence that patients translate those benefits into a more active&#xD;
      lifestyle. This is of utmost importance since physical activity (PA) levels predict important&#xD;
      outcomes in COPD, for example, with low PA levels being associated with a higher risk of&#xD;
      exacerbation-related hospitalization and mortality. That said, it is still unknown how best&#xD;
      to maintain long-term effects of PR, whilst promoting patients' adherence to a physically&#xD;
      active lifestyle. Most studies reporting on interventions to improve PA among patients with&#xD;
      CRDs (e.g., COPD) focus exclusively on patients' individual factors, disregarding&#xD;
      interpersonal/social and environmental factors associated with PA. Community-based PA&#xD;
      interventions adjusted to the local context, which leverage existing social support and&#xD;
      community (infra)structures, may be key elements for success. Indeed, the community offers a&#xD;
      variety of physical activity modalities (e.g., urban trails, physical activity/exercise&#xD;
      classes at the municipality level), which can be explored and further personalized to meet&#xD;
      patients' needs and preferences. By targeting the community, as opposed to the &quot;individual&#xD;
      per se&quot;, the possibility of promoting a behavioral change towards a more physically active&#xD;
      lifestyle becomes more likely. Building on existing knowledge, CENTR(AR) primary aim is to&#xD;
      implement and assess the effectiveness of a personalised community-based PA program to&#xD;
      increase PA levels, as well as prevent/stop the decline and consolidate PR benefits (in&#xD;
      several health-related domains) in people with CRDs, following PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, CENTR(AR) will also aim at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Improving access to and delivery of community-based PR for people with CRDs in Primary&#xD;
      Healthcare Centres (PHC) within the Centre Region of Portugal; 2) Identifying barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators, as well as preferences and motivations of adherence to PA; 3)&#xD;
      Educating/Empowering/Capacitating non-health professionals delivering municipal physical&#xD;
      activity/exercise classes, to ensure patients' safety and quality care; 4) Designing and&#xD;
      validating urban walking and/or cycling trails by a) measuring the physiological response and&#xD;
      energy expenditure associated with the use of those trails; b) assessing the&#xD;
      environmental/physical features of the urban trails; 5) Validating the available municipal&#xD;
      physical activity/exercise classes (as described in 3); 6) Promoting intersectoral&#xD;
      collaboration at the municipality level, leveraging partnerships between PHC and existing&#xD;
      community physical activities, thereby filling in the gaps in the continuity of care after&#xD;
      PR; 7) Increasing health literacy amongst municipal professionals in regard to CRDs, as well&#xD;
      as health promotion and community empowerment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims &amp; Outcomes Primary aim: Assess the effectiveness of a community-based PA program,&#xD;
      tailored to patient's needs and preferences, to increase PA levels in people with CRDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim(s): Determine the short-, mid- and long-term effects of CENTR(AR) on exercise&#xD;
      capacity, functional status, HRQoL, symptoms, AECOPD and healthcare utilisation, peripheral&#xD;
      muscle strength, motivation for exercise, and emotional status; Establish the influence of&#xD;
      patients' motivations and preferences in adhering to the CENTRAR program and engaging in a&#xD;
      physically active lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each time-point, the following data will be collected: Socio-demographic and&#xD;
      anthropometric data; Lung function; Healthcare utilization; Health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQoL); Impact of disease; Fatigue; Dyspnoea; Cough and sputum; Social support and social&#xD;
      network; Anxiety and depression; Motivation to exercise; Perception of change; Exercise&#xD;
      capacity; Peripheral muscle strength; Functional status; Balance; Physical activity levels;&#xD;
      Adverse events; Adherence; Qualitative data (individual and focus groups interviews)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of PR, participants will be randomised to an experimental group (EG) or a&#xD;
      control group (CG). The EG will enrol in a 6-month personalised community-based PA program,&#xD;
      which will/should be attended twice-weekly, minimum. During the first month the&#xD;
      physiotherapist will guide patients through all available physical activities; afterwards,&#xD;
      patients will be asked to choose one or two activities, according to their preferences, which&#xD;
      they will attend for five more months. Physiotherapists' support will gradually decrease over&#xD;
      time. The CG will receive a leaflet with PA recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated using G*Power 3.1.9.6, with an effect size specification &quot;as in&#xD;
      G*Power 3.0&quot;, for the within-between interaction of a repeated measures ANOVA with two groups&#xD;
      (control and experimental) and 3 measurements (immediately after, and 6 to 12 months post-PR)&#xD;
      of the defined primary outcome (MVPA). The investigators considered an α of 0.05, a power of&#xD;
      0.80, a repeated measures correlation of 0.5, a nonsphericity correction of 1 and an expected&#xD;
      effect size f of 0.30. The effect size f was derived from the partial η2 of 0.21 (f=0.516)&#xD;
      obtained from a study which aimed to assess the impact of a PA-focused behavioural&#xD;
      intervention during and after PR on PA levels in patients with COPD. A smaller f value of&#xD;
      0.30 was chosen to account for a longer follow-up period (up to 12 months) and differences in&#xD;
      selected time-points. The calculated sample size was 20 (i.e., 10 in each group) COPD&#xD;
      patients and considering a possible 50% dropout rate, the final sample size was determined to&#xD;
      be 40. Since no significant differences are expected in the primary outcome between COPD and&#xD;
      ILD patients, a sample size of 40 was also determined for the latter. In summary, a total&#xD;
      sample size of 80 was found to be required to detect significant within-between group&#xD;
      differences in MVPA.&#xD;
