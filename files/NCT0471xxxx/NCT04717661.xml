    <textblock>
      Pulse diagnosis is an important method to judge the status of patients in the process of&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of traditional Chinese medicine. At present, the commonly used site&#xD;
      of pulse diagnosis is the radial artery, which is divided into &quot;cun&quot;&quot;guan&quot;&quot;chi&quot;. Whether the&#xD;
      diagnosis of pregnancy can be diagnosed by pulse diagnosis has been perplexing clinicians. In&#xD;
      long-term clinical practice, it is found that slippery pulse often occurs in the radial&#xD;
      artery of pregnant women. Before the 13th week of pregnancy, it is called early pregnancy.&#xD;
      During pregnancy, chorionic gonadotropin gradually increases, progesterone increases, humoral&#xD;
      metabolism changes, blood volume increases, hemodilution and cardiac output increase. Other&#xD;
      studies have shown that due to the effect of estrogen, the number of active levels of renin&#xD;
      in plasma increase several times, and will increase with the progression of pregnancy. This&#xD;
      series of changes in pregnant women may be reflected in the pulse. During the clinical pulse&#xD;
      examination, our team has found that some pregnant women had no abnormality in pre-pregnancy&#xD;
      examination such as B-ultrasound, and abnormal unsmooth pulse in the ulna could be felt&#xD;
      during pulse examination. Through follow-up, it is found that this kind of pregnant women may&#xD;
      have miscarriage or stillbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team found that there are low-frequency sound waves in the radial artery, which carry the&#xD;
      physiological and pathological information of the organs in the body, and developed a &quot;Pulse&#xD;
      Detection System of Sound Waves&quot;. Previous projects have explored the abnormal sound waves of&#xD;
      radial artery in patients with sequelae of cerebral infarction, stable coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, chronic gastritis, neck-shoulder syndrome, liver cirrhosis and other diseases and&#xD;
      achieved certain results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the &quot;Pulse Detection System of Sound Waves&quot; will be used to collect&#xD;
      the sound waves in the radial artery of 76 healthy early pregnant women and 76 relatively&#xD;
      healthy non-pregnant women. Fourier transform, wavelet analysis, Hilbert yellow transform and&#xD;
      other methods will be used to identify the different characteristics of the pulse acoustic&#xD;
      signals, and observe the time-frequency domain characteristics of the trial group and the&#xD;
      control group.And researchers will carry on the diagnostic test, calculate the sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity of the &quot;Pulse Detection System of Sound Waves&quot; in the diagnosis of pregnancy.&#xD;
      This study will verify the efficacy of pulse diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of pregnancy and lay a foundation for the diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy.&#xD;
