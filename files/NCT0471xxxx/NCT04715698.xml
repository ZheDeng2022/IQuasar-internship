      A single-center, single-blind, randomized study to investigate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      hemodynamic-guided treatment strategy to improve blood pressure control&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a hemodynamic-related disorder characterized by abnormalities of the cardiac&#xD;
      output (CO) and/or systemic vascular resistance (SVR). It is hypothesized that selecting&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy based on patients' hemodynamic profile could lead to more effective&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) control than standard care in a real-world population of hypertensive&#xD;
      patients in outpatient setting. A single-center, randomized trial was conducted to include&#xD;
      adults with uncontrolled hypertension who seek outpatient care at Peking University People's&#xD;
      Hospital between December 2018 and December 2019 in Beijing, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned to the standard care group or the hemodynamic group in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. Impedance cardiography (ICG) was performed with all participants to measure&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters. Only physicians in the hemodynamic group were provided with patients'&#xD;
      ICG findings and a computerized clinical decision support of recommended treatment choices&#xD;
      based on patients' hemodynamic profiles. The primary outcomes were the reductions in systolic&#xD;
      BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) levels at the follow-up visit 8(Â±4) weeks after baseline.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included achievement of BP goal of &lt;140/ 90 mmHg and the reductions in BP&#xD;
      by baseline BP, age, sex, and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICG device used (HDproTM CHM T3002/P3005, designed by Beijing Li-Heng Medical&#xD;
      Technologies, Ltd, manufactured by Shandong Baolihao Medical Appliances, Ltd.) was developed&#xD;
      based on improved hardware and advanced digital filtering algorithms, and has been validated&#xD;
      versus both invasive thermodilution and non-invasive echocardiography in different settings.&#xD;
