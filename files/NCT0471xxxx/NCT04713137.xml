  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of erythritol (given as pre-load),&#xD;
      compared to sucrose, sucralose, and water on energy intake during a subsequent ad libitum&#xD;
      test meal in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the release of GI hormones, glycemic control, appetite-related sensations, GI&#xD;
      tolerance, sweetness and liking in response to the pre-loads will be investigated.&#xD;

      The subjects will participate in four study days. The screening will last 60 minutes, the&#xD;
      study days about 4.5 hours each. After a simple-carbohydrate standard dinner, the subjects&#xD;
      have to do an overnight fast until the next morning. Subjects will receive fixed equisweet&#xD;
      doses of sucrose (33.5g), erythritol (50g), sucralose (0.0558g), or water as oral pre-loads&#xD;
      in a blinded, randomized (counterbalanced) fashion (t = -15 min). Fifteen minutes after the&#xD;
      administration (t = 0 min), a standard solid test meal will be presented and ad libitum&#xD;
      calorie intake will be measured. The end of the test meal will be after 20 minutes or as soon&#xD;
      as the subject stops eating for more than 5 minutes. Blood samples (to measure: glycemic&#xD;
      control and GI hormones) will be collected at t = -16, t = -1, t = 15, t = 30, t = 60, t =&#xD;
      90, t = 120, t = 150, t = 180 min and appetite-related sensation rating will be collected at&#xD;
      t = -16, t = -1, t = 15, t = 30, t = 60, t = 90, t = 120, t = 150, t = 180 min. GI symptoms&#xD;
      and nausea are assessed at t = -16, -1, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min. At t = -10 min subjects are&#xD;
      asked to rate the perceived sweetness and liking of the pre-load and at t = 180 min the&#xD;
      perceived liking of the test meal.&#xD;
