  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of Tacrolimus gel&#xD;
      versus an anti-inflammatory mouthwash in an oral solution for the management of patients&#xD;
      suffering from symptomatic OLP. The secondary objective was to analyze which one of the two&#xD;
      treatments induced a greater risk of developing side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty nine patients were assigned, through a randomized design, to receive tacrolimus&#xD;
      ointment 0.1% or a mouthwash composed of calcium hydroxide 10%, hyaluronic acid 0,3%,&#xD;
      umbelliferone and oligomeric proanthocyanidins, or an anti-inflammatory mouthwash (mouthwash&#xD;
      which contains calcium hydroxide, hyaluronic acid, Umbelliferone and Oligomeric&#xD;
      Proanthocyanidins) for 3-months. At baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1), patients were&#xD;
      subjected to clinical and oral assessments and were evaluated for the symptoms (Numerical&#xD;
      Pain Scale, NRS score) and signs (Thongprasom's score) of OLP. Data were calculated using&#xD;
      T-test for the dependent variable, Wilcoxon test and Mann-Witney u test.&#xD;

    <description>Patients clinically were evaluated using the scale used by Thongprasom et al. as reference. This gives a score that varies from 0 to 5, using a millimetre reference: 0, in the absence of lesions; 1, in the presence of hyperkeratosis streaks; 2, in the presence of an atrophic area less than 1 mm2; 3, in the presence of an atrophic area greater than&#xD;
1 mm2; 4, in the presence of an erosive area less than 1 mm2; 5, in the presence of an erosive area greater than 1 mm2. In the presence of multiple injuries, the value has been calculated by summing the values of each injury.</description>

    <description>Anti-inflammatory mouthwash In patients of the anti-inflammatory group, the mouthwash was used pure and without dilution at a dosage of 20 ml 3 times a day, immediately after normal daily oral hygiene was prescribed. It contains calcium hydroxide, hyaluronic acid, Umbelliferone and Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins. Patients were instructed to rinse for at least 5 minutes over the entire oral mucosa, with particular emphasis on the regions where the lesions are located.</description>
