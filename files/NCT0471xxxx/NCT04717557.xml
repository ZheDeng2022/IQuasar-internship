  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the utility of hyperbaric oxygen as an adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment to reduce postoperative complications. It is hypothesized that HBO2 given in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period will reduce postoperative complications in patients undergoing&#xD;
      below-the-knee amputations. The objective of this study will be to compare treatment and&#xD;
      standard care groups, randomly created of eligible patients, to compare their postoperative&#xD;
      complications and to assess their postoperative hospital length of stay, 90-day mortality,&#xD;
      failure to heal at 4 and 8 week follow-up visits and ability to ambulate with a prosthesis at&#xD;
      6 months post amputation.&#xD;

      This is a clinical study to test the hypothesis that Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO2) given in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period for a total of 10 treatments after Below-the-Knee Amputation&#xD;
      (BKA) for vascular disease will reduce postoperative complications. Patients scheduled for&#xD;
      BKA at Duke University Medical Center will be reviewed for contraindications to HBO2.&#xD;
      Patients for whom HBO2 is not contraindicated may choose to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled will be randomly assigned to receive treatment or standard postoperative&#xD;
      care. Each patient receiving treatment will receive twice daily HBO2 for 2 hours at 2 ATA.&#xD;
      Patients receiving HBO2 will breathe 100% oxygen via head tent while inside a hyperbaric&#xD;
      chamber at Duke University Hospital. The statistical plan for this study will test&#xD;
      non-directional hypotheses (two-sided tests). Bonferroni correction will be used to adjust&#xD;
      for multiple tests. The main analysis of the primary efficacy hypotheses will include data&#xD;
      from all randomized patients in the group to which random assignment is made. Hence, the&#xD;
      analysis will be intention to treat. This study will primarily aim to assess whether patients&#xD;
      receiving treatment suffer fewer complications, as defined by the Vascular Quality&#xD;
      Initiative, vs. patients who receive standard care. The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) is&#xD;
      a multicenter voluntary reporting system for outcomes related to vascular surgery. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of this study, postoperative complications, will be those outcomes meeting&#xD;
      the definition set out in the VQI data dictionary, the set of definitions for inclusion in&#xD;
      the VQI database. This allows for a standard definition of complications recognized by a&#xD;
      majority of US academic medical centers. Secondary outcomes include hospital length of stay,&#xD;
      90-day mortality, failure to heal at 4 and 8 week follow-up visits and ability to ambulate&#xD;
      with a prosthesis at 6 months post amputation.&#xD;
