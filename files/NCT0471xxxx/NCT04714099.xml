      Since the initial description, the therapeutic efficacy of CsA for human KCS has been well&#xD;
      documented, with evidence ranging from several small single center randomized double-masked&#xD;
      clinical trials to several large multicenter randomized, double-masked clinical&#xD;
      trials.(10-12) Therefore, the aim of the work is to evaluate the effect of using topical CsA&#xD;
      in treatment of moderate to severe dry eye.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is known to be among the most frequently occuring ocular morbidities.&#xD;
      It is a growing public health concern affecting 25% of patients who visit ophthalmic&#xD;
      clinics.For many years, DED was considered to be limited to dryness of the eyes due to&#xD;
      decrease in the aqueous phase in the tear film. In 2007, the International Dry Eye Workshop&#xD;
      discussed the definition and classification of DED and developed a new vision for the&#xD;
      definition and the three-part classification of DED on the basis of etiology, mechanism, and&#xD;
      severity of DED. Moreover, DED can be episodic or chronic. Episodic DED occurs when&#xD;
      environmental or visual tasks with reduced blinking overwhelm the stability of the tear and&#xD;
      produce symptomatic DED. Chronic DED, although aggravated by the same environmental&#xD;
      conditions, persists continuously with symptoms and possible damage to the ocular surface.&#xD;
      Because the tear film in DED patients is not stable and incapable to maintain the protective&#xD;
      qualities that are important for its structure and function, patients usually experience the&#xD;
      discomfort manifestations associated with DED such as burning, stinging, foreign body&#xD;
      sensation, ocular fatigue, grittiness, tearing, and dryness. Patients may complain of&#xD;
      symptoms of DED in the presence or absence of the known signs and DED may be diagnosed based&#xD;
      only on the signs observed by a healthcare professional in the absence of symptoms reported&#xD;
      by the patients.Since the initial description, the therapeutic efficacy of CsA for human KCS&#xD;
      has been well documented, with evidence ranging from several small single center randomized&#xD;
      double-masked clinical trials to several large multicenter randomized, double-masked clinical&#xD;
      trials.Therefore, the aim of the work is to evaluate the effect of using topical CsA in&#xD;
      treatment of moderate to severe dry eye.&#xD;
