  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized，multicenter, open-label Phase III, clinical study to confirm the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of SKLB1028 in patients with relapsed or refractory(R/R) FLT3-Mutated&#xD;
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia（AML）compared to salvage chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SKLB1028 or salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Subjects will enter the screening period up to 14 days before the start of&#xD;
      treatment. Prior to randomization, a salvage chemotherapy regimen will be pre-selected for&#xD;
      each subject. Options will include low-dose cytarabine (LoDAC), azacitidine,&#xD;
      homoharringtonine (HHT), cytarabine and aclarubicin (HAA) or fludarabine, cytarabine and&#xD;
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG). The randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
      indications and intensity of pre-selected salvage chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be orally administrated SKLB1028 twice daily over continuous 28-day cycles .&#xD;
      Subjects in the salvage chemotherapy group will receive chemotherapy as required by the&#xD;
      guidelines. Subjects receiving SKLB1028, LoDAC, or azacytidine will continue to receive the&#xD;
      treatment until a treatment discontinuation criterion is met. Subjects receiving HAA or FLAG&#xD;
      will take 1 cycle of therapy and will be assessed for response after the 1st cycle. After the&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation, the subject may receive a second cycle of chemotherapy at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion. will receive the second cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have a donor identified and with complete remission after treatment may undergo&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) without leaving the study. Subjects in the salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy group who withdrew due to non-response to treatment or disease progression,&#xD;
      could switch to SKLB1028 if SKLB1028 will likely benefit the patient at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
