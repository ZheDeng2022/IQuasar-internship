  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, it is well documented that the gut microbiota (GM) influences numerous physiological&#xD;
      processes in the healthy &quot;host&quot;. The alteration of the composition and function of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota, commonly referred to as &quot;dysbiosis&quot;, is associated with many&#xD;
      pathological conditions. The high co-morbidity between inflammatory bowel diseases and&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and stress and the frequent presence of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      dysfunctions in autistic patients have highlighted a possible implication of GM in&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders. The ability of GM to communicate with the central nervous system and&#xD;
      the possible influence on behavior led to the discovery of the existence of a&#xD;
      microbiota-gut-brain axis. Clinical and experimental data suggest a possible role of&#xD;
      modifications in the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota (impaired&#xD;
      production of short-chain fatty acids, SCFAs) in major psychiatric disorders such as autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD is a severe neurological condition characterized by severe&#xD;
      stereotypical behaviors and deficits in linguistic and social interaction. The prevalence of&#xD;
      ASD in children is continuously increasing in Western countries. The pathogenesis of ASD is&#xD;
      still poorly defined. The clinical manifestations of ASD are the result of complex&#xD;
      interactions between genetic, epigenetic, environmental and microbiological factors. The&#xD;
      improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms of autistic patients after short-term oral treatment&#xD;
      with antibiotics and probiotics clearly indicated a role of the metabolites of MI in ASD. In&#xD;
      particular, an alteration in the phyla of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in fecal samples from&#xD;
      autistic children has been described with conflicting results. Williams and colleagues (2011)&#xD;
      evaluated a significant increase in the Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio in intestinal&#xD;
      biopsies of autistic children with gastrointestinal disorders. It has also been shown in&#xD;
      animal models of ASD that dysbiosis is positively associated with an increase in butyrate&#xD;
      levels and inversely associated with the &quot;score&quot; of the severity of ASD symptoms. Alterations&#xD;
      in nutritional status, eating habits and adverse reactions to food appear to be more frequent&#xD;
      in children with ASD. Several studies support the hypothesis that children with ASD have a&#xD;
      greater refusal of food, requiring specific food presentations or eating a reduced variety of&#xD;
      foods compared to children without ASD. These conditions are associated with dysbiosis.&#xD;
      Preliminary data suggest that particular elimination diets and / or modifications of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota can determine a positive effect on the symptoms of ASD. A better&#xD;
      knowledge of the composition and functions of the intestinal microbiota also in relation to&#xD;
      eating habits and the presence of adverse reactions to food in the child with ASD could&#xD;
      facilitate new effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of these conditions.&#xD;
