      Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) is affecting up to 70% of pregnant women. Studies have&#xD;
      also shown that NVP may have a profound impact on pregnant women's wellbeing and that even&#xD;
      mild NVP symptoms have been shown to significantly reduce pregnant women's quality of life.&#xD;
      However, NVP symptoms often occur during the first period of pregnancy where antenatal care&#xD;
      not yet have been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to evaluate whether the &quot;MinSafeStart&quot; mobile application&#xD;
      (app) can empower pregnant women to better self-manage NVP and hence improve their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) is one of the most common pregnancy-related ailments,&#xD;
      affecting up to 70% of pregnant women. The causes of NVP are unclear but it has been&#xD;
      described as multifactorial and complex. Studies investigating NVP and the use of antiemetics&#xD;
      states that early recognition and treatment of the condition is important in order to prevent&#xD;
      further deterioration. In contrary to this recommendation, many healthcare providers and&#xD;
      pregnant women themselves are reluctant to use antiemetics due to the fear of teratogenicity.&#xD;
      Studies have also shown that NVP may have a profound impact on pregnant women's wellbeing and&#xD;
      that even mild NVP symptoms have been shown to significantly reduce pregnant women's quality&#xD;
      of life. As NVP symptoms often occur during the first period of pregnancy where antenatal&#xD;
      care not yet have been established, it is important to empower women to optimally self-manage&#xD;
      their care to ensure maternal and fetal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to evaluate whether the &quot;MinSafeStart&quot; mobile application&#xD;
      (app) can empower pregnant women to better self-manage NVP and hence improve their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;MinSafeStart&quot; app is a patient-centered app for women with NVP. The app was developed by&#xD;
      us, in corporation with a team consisting of interaction designers, programmers, and&#xD;
      researchers from the University Center for Information Technology (USIT) at the University of&#xD;
      Oslo. The app utilizes the Pregnancy-Unique-Quantification-of-Emesis-24 (PUQE-24) scale to&#xD;
      categorize the women's NVP severity (e.g. mild, moderate, or severe) on a daily basis, and&#xD;
      visualizes the fluctuations over time in a graph. Each woman will have their own personal&#xD;
      graph based on the information they put in. They will also be able to see how their symptoms&#xD;
      are compared to an average graph. The women will get treatment advice based on their PUQE-24&#xD;
      scale, e.g. dietary and lifestyle advice for mild symptoms and referral to see the doctor for&#xD;
      moderate and severe symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pregnant women over 18 years experiencing NVP, and owners of a smartphone (iOS or&#xD;
      Android) are eligible for inclusion. Participants will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      intervention group (opportunity to use the app) or the control group (standard care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by four questionnaires (from both groups) and through the MinSafeStart&#xD;
      app (intervention group only). All questionnaires will be distributed to the participants by&#xD;
      email. The first questionnaire (Q1) at enrollment (baseline) and questionnaire Q2, Q3, and Q4&#xD;
      at follow up, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after randomization respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about the participants will, in addition, be collected from four national registries;&#xD;
      The Norwegian Patient Registry, The Norwegian Prescription Database, The Medical Birth&#xD;
      Registry of Norway, and the Municipality Patient and User Registry. These data will be linked&#xD;
      to the self-reported data (by the unique identification number of every citizen in Norway)&#xD;
      collected during the intervention study.&#xD;
