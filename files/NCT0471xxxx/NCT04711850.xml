  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to collect data and provide a better understanding of the long-term&#xD;
      outcome of imlifidase treatment on active or chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)&#xD;
      in kidney transplant recipients. This is done by collecting data during an extended follow-up&#xD;
      period of 3 years of clinical study trial 16-HMedIdeS-12, in which patients received either&#xD;
      imlifidase or plasma exchange (PE) as AMR treatment. Data for parameters such as kidney graft&#xD;
      survival, patient survival, kidney function, treatment of rebound of donor specific&#xD;
      antibodies (DSA) and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) are collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMR is one of the most challenging adverse events following kidney transplantation and a&#xD;
      major cause of graft dysfunction and graft loss. AMR is triggered by donor-specific&#xD;
      antibodies (DSA).Transplant glomerulopathy is a known consequence of persistent DSA&#xD;
      positivity which results in graft failure and return to dialysis with attendant consequences&#xD;
      for the patient and financial costs for the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time from transplantation to onset of clinical symptoms of AMR varies largely between&#xD;
      individuals. An early AMR (&lt;30 days post-transplant) is commonly classified as active AMR and&#xD;
      most often triggered by an immunological recall response with pre-existing DSA. A late AMR&#xD;
      (&gt;30 days post-transplant) is classified as either active or chronic active AMR and is caused&#xD;
      by either a recall DSA response or newly developing naïve immune response associated with de&#xD;
      novo DSA production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no currently approved therapy for AMR and patients are often treated with a&#xD;
      combination of therapies i.e., high dose IVIg +/- rituximab, PE with low dose IVIg +/-&#xD;
      rituximab, and eculizumab which makes analysis of efficacy of any single agent difficult.&#xD;
      Hence, there is a large unmet clinical need for new therapies to treat AMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imlifidase is an IgG-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes that cleaves all four human&#xD;
      subclasses of IgG with high efficacy and specificity. The rapidity of the IgG cleavage by&#xD;
      imlifidase is considered a major advantage as compared with PE, which often requires several&#xD;
      rounds over several days to achieve a sufficient DSA reduction. Within a few hours after&#xD;
      imlifidase dosing, the entire pool of IgG is completely cleaved and thereby a window where&#xD;
      IgG levels are kept very low for approximately one week is created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-term efficacy and safety of imlifidase in active and chronic active AMR is being&#xD;
      investigated in a randomized, open-label, multi-centre trial, using PE as an active control&#xD;
      (i.e. the feeder study: 16-HMedIdeS-12). A total of 30 subjects will be included in this&#xD;
      study (20 in the imlifidase arm and 10 in the plasma exchange arm). The primary objective is&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy of imlifidase in removing DSA in patients who are experiencing an&#xD;
      AMR episode after kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a rapid removal of DSA by imlifidase might be expected, DSA is likely to rebound unless&#xD;
      well-controlled by concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, there is also a need to&#xD;
      address the long-term outcome of imlifidase as an AMR therapy. This will be studied during an&#xD;
      extended follow-up period of 3 years in this study. Data for parameters such as kidney graft&#xD;
      survival, patient survival, kidney function, treatment of rebound of donor specific&#xD;
      antibodies (DSA) and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) will be collected.&#xD;
