    <textblock>
      This multicenter study aims to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)&#xD;
      in diagnosing abdominal solid organ injuries in pediatric patients. Up to 130 subjects will&#xD;
      complete the study across approximately 5-10 sites in the US, with up to 30 patients in the&#xD;
      training phase (3 per site) and 100 patients in the treatment phase of the study. All&#xD;
      subjects will have had a CT scan as part of standard of care, confirming at least one solid&#xD;
      organ abdominal injury. The study procedure will occur within 48 hours from time of injury.&#xD;
      All subjects will have an abdominal ultrasound without contrast, followed by a&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound using the contrast agent Lumason. Ultrasound and&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound results will be compared to the CT scan results. The CT and&#xD;
      ultrasound scans will be read locally and will undergo central review.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study which proposes to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound (CEUS) in diagnosing abdominal solid organ injuries in pediatric trauma patients.&#xD;
      Up to 130 subjects will be enrolled across approximately 5 to 10 sites in the US. Each site,&#xD;
      including the coordinating center, will undergo the training phase; each site will enroll 3&#xD;
      participants in this phase successfully prior to entering the treatment phase. All subjects&#xD;
      will have had a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan as part of standard of care, confirming at&#xD;
      least one solid organ abdominal injury. All subjects will have an abdominal ultrasound&#xD;
      without contrast, followed by a contrast-enhanced ultrasound using the contrast agent&#xD;
      Lumason. Ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound results will be compared to the CT scan&#xD;
      results. The study procedures will take place within 48 hours of injury. At conclusion of&#xD;
      enrollment of all subjects a centralized review of CT vs. CEUS will occur to compare to&#xD;
      real-time readings.&#xD;
