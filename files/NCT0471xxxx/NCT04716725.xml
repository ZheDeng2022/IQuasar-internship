    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography (PET) in&#xD;
      diagnosing patients with prostate cancer that continues to grow despite the surgical removal&#xD;
      of the testes or medical intervention to block androgen production (castration resistant),&#xD;
      and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). 68Ga- PSMA-11 is a new imaging agent&#xD;
      that may help get more detailed pictures of the tumor. This trial aims to see whether using&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scans may help doctors learn more about where disease is located in the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether the percent change from baseline to 16 weeks (+/- 8 weeks) in maximum&#xD;
      standard uptake value (SUVmax) averaged across up to 20 lesions per patient (SUVmax-average&#xD;
      [ave]) is associated with &gt;= 50% decline from baseline in serum prostate specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA50) response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether the percent change from baseline in SUVmax-ave on PSMA PET is&#xD;
      associated with time-to-event endpoints including PSA progression-free survival by Prostate&#xD;
      Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria, radiographic progression-free&#xD;
      survival by PCWG3 criteria, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether the percent change from baseline in SUVmax on PSMA PET is associated&#xD;
      with objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1&#xD;
      on a per-lesion basis among measurable soft tissue lesions present at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY (CORRELATIVE) OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To descriptively characterize the histologic, transcriptional, and genomic features of&#xD;
      PSMA low/negative lesions among patients who undergo paired optional metastatic tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To descriptively characterize the relationship between SUVmax-ave on baseline Ga-PSMA PET&#xD;
      with optional baseline fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether heterogeneity of PSMA expression on baseline Ga-PSMA PET is&#xD;
      associated with overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To descriptively characterize the patterns of PSMA expression at the time of disease&#xD;
      progression among patients who undergo optional PSMA PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine whether the percent change from baseline in PSMA PET is associated with PSA50&#xD;
      response among subgroups of patients defined by treatment modality received, including&#xD;
      androgen receptor (AR) targeting treatment, PSMA-targeting radioligand therapy, cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET at baseline, 16&#xD;
      weeks after initiating therapy, and at time of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After progression or study completion, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 24&#xD;
      months&#xD;

    <description>The study cohort will be divided into subgroups based on whether or not patient experienced a &gt;= 50% decline from baseline in serum PSA (PSA50 responder) or not (PSA50 non-responder). The mean percent change from baseline in SUVmax (SUVmax-ave) on PSMA PET between PSA50 responders vs. non-responders will be compared using the Mann-Whitney test.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Change in SUVmax-ave Group on Overall Survival (OS)</measure>

    <description>The study cohort will be dichotomized by the median with respect to percent change from baseline in SUVmax-ave on PSMA PET on overall survival defined as time from imaging until death or censored at study completion. OS will be compared between dichotomized subgroups using the log-rank test. Kaplan-Meier product limit method will be used to estimate median survival in each subgroup.</description>

    <description>Amongst the subset of measurable soft tissue lesions by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, on a per-lesion basis, the mean percent change from baseline in SUVmax on PSMA PET will be compared between responding lesions defined as a complete response or partial response by RECIST 1.1 criteria vs. those without response, using Mann-Whitney test.</description>
