  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the current organ shortage, improving the quality/efficacy of harvested grafts from&#xD;
      expanded criteria donors is essential to substantially increase the number of potential&#xD;
      donors. Preclinical studies have shown that blocking the vascular mineralocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      (MR) mitigates ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) and prevents renal dysfunction following&#xD;
      acute kidney injury. Potassium canrenoate is an intravenous MR antagonist. Blocking the MR&#xD;
      upstream from aortic cross clamping is likely the most effective strategy to limit I/R&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, brain-dead donors are prone to severe hemodynamic instability and polyuria.&#xD;
      Consequently, this study seeks to assess the hemodynamic tolerance of the use of potassium&#xD;
      canrenoate in this context, as a first step to a large-scale clinical trial testing the&#xD;
      impact of this therapeutic intervention on the survival of kidney grafts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we seek to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of the administration of 200 mg of IV potassium canrenoate vs placebo in&#xD;
      brain-dead donors aged 18 years or more - at 3-6 hours after the diagnosis of brain death is&#xD;
      made and before the departure to operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the impact of potassium canrenoate administration vs.&#xD;
      placebo on the hemodynamics of brain-dead subjects who are candidates for kidney or multiple&#xD;
      organ harvesting (including renal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vital status and renal function of kidney recipients will be followed at 3 months, 1&#xD;
      year, 3 years and 10 years from transplant (main secondary objectives)&#xD;
