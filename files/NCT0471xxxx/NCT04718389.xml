  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether switching participants who have benefitted from mepolizumab or&#xD;
      benralizumab to GSK3511294 (Depemokimab) is non-inferior to maintaining current treatment on&#xD;
      the annualized rate of clinically significant exacerbations in participants with severe&#xD;
      asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype. Throughout the study, all participants will continue&#xD;
      their non-biologic Baseline standard of care (SoC) asthma treatment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized rate of clinically significant exacerbations over 52 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically significant exacerbations of asthma are defined by worsening of asthma which requires use of systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalization and/or Emergency Department (ED) visit. Annualized rate of exacerbations will be calculated as number of exacerbations experienced by the participant divided by the length of time the participant is measured on.</description>

    <measure>Weighted mean change from Baseline in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a well-established instrument, comprising 51 questions designed to measure Quality of Life in participants with diseases of airway obstruction. Higher score indicates worse quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weighted mean change from Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item questionnaire, which has been developed as a measure of participants' asthma control that can be quickly and easily completed. The five questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening on waking in the morning, activity limitation, and shortness of breath, wheeze) over the previous week. The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. Higher score indicates more limitations.</description>

    <measure>Weighted mean change from Baseline in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of pulmonary function and is the maximum amount of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath. FEV1 will be measured using spirometry.</description>

             investigator, or QTcF &gt;=450 msec or QTcF &gt;=480 msec for participants with Bundle&#xD;
             Branch Block, at randomization Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a clinically significant asthma exacerbation in the 7 days prior to&#xD;
             randomization should have their randomization visit delayed until the investigator&#xD;
             considers the participant's asthma to be stable. If the 8-week screening period has&#xD;
             elapsed, then the participant should be considered a run-in failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any changes in the dose or regimen of Baseline ICS and/or additional controller&#xD;
             medication (except for treatment of an exacerbation) during the run-in period.&#xD;
