  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute phase response (APR) is one of the most common adverse events in osteoporosis with&#xD;
      zoledronic acid treatment. It's reported that this reaction is related to the blockade of the&#xD;
      mevalonate pathway, leading to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) accumulation. And the latter&#xD;
      can active γδT cells in the circulation, resulting in inflammatory cytokine release. Statins&#xD;
      can inhibit the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate that may reduce the accumulation of IPP.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is possible that statins can be taken in advance to reduce APR caused by&#xD;
      zoledronic acid infusion.&#xD;
