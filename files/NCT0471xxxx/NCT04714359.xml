  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-site open-label study assesses the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in participants who were&#xD;
      enrolled in a parent study for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study&#xD;
      will be conducted in up to N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will receive a flexible dose of&#xD;
      MDMA, followed by a supplemental dose, unless contraindicated, during the Treatment Period&#xD;
      with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This ~12-week Treatment&#xD;
      Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each&#xD;
      Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non-drug psychotherapy. The&#xD;
      Primary Outcome measure is the change in PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) for the Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) from Visit 3 is assessed at Visit&#xD;
      16. This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of&#xD;
      psychotherapy assisted by flexible doses of MDMA. Initial doses per Experimental Session&#xD;
      include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate alone&#xD;
      (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental dose (40&#xD;
      or 60 mg). Total amounts of MDMA to be administered per Experimental Session range from 80 mg&#xD;
      to 180 mg.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD&#xD;
      is a stress-related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as&#xD;
      war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a&#xD;
      person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and&#xD;
      maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high-cost&#xD;
      healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments,&#xD;
      including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them&#xD;
      for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into&#xD;
      medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine&#xD;
      and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin,&#xD;
      arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase&#xD;
      compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and&#xD;
      introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and&#xD;
      hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be&#xD;
      especially useful for treating PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-site, open-label safety extension study assesses the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy in participants diagnosed with PTSD. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants who were randomized to the&#xD;
      placebo arm in the two parent Phase 3 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and who meet all&#xD;
      other entry criteria will be eligible and invited to participate in this open-label safety&#xD;
      extension study. In addition, participants in the parent Phase 3 trials whose study&#xD;
      participation was affected by COVID-19 pandemic or other unforeseen circumstances, and were&#xD;
      unable to complete the study may participate in this open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment consists of a flexible dose of MDMA (80 or 120 mg), followed by a supplemental&#xD;
      dose (40 or 60 mg) unless contraindicated, administered with manualized psychotherapy in&#xD;
      three open-label approximately monthly Experimental Sessions. During Experimental Session 1,&#xD;
      participants will receive an initial dose of 80 mg of MDMA, followed by a supplemental dose&#xD;
      of 40 mg. During Experimental Sessions 2 and 3, participants will receive an initial dose of&#xD;
      80 or 120 mg of MDMA, followed by a supplemental dose of 40 or 60 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period,&#xD;
      each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non-drug&#xD;
      psychotherapy. Experimental Sessions are followed by an overnight stay. The Primary Outcome&#xD;
      measure, the change in PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5) from Visit 3 is assessed at Visit 16.&#xD;

    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report questionnaire in which respondents indicate the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms, derived from the symptoms of PTSD per DSM-5. Participants indicate how much distress they have experienced in the last 2 weeks due to symptoms such as &quot;Repeated, disturbing memories, thoughts, or images of a stressful experience from the past,&quot; &quot;Trouble remembering important parts of a stressful experience from the past,&quot; and &quot;Feeling irritable or having angry outbursts&quot; on a five-point Likert-type scale (1=Not at all to 5=Extremely), with lower scores indicating less PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <description>The SDS is a self-report assessment of functional impairment. The reporting period for the SDS refers to the past month. The items indicate degree of impairment in the domains of work/school, social life, and home life, with response options based on an eleven-point scale (0=not at all to 10=extremely), with higher scores indicating greater functional impairment.</description>
