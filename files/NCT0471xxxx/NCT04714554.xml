    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period crossover drug interaction study&#xD;
      to assess the potential effects of erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of relugolix,&#xD;
      estradiol (E2), and norethindrone (NET) in healthy postmenopausal women (Part 1) and the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of relugolix in healthy adult men (Part 2).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each study part consists of two sequential treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 and&#xD;
      Treatment Period 2) in which study participants will receive study treatments in a fixed&#xD;
      (single)-sequence, crossover manner. In Part 1 of the study, a single&#xD;
      relugolix/E2/norethindrone acetate (NETA) (40 milligrams [mg]/1 mg/0.5 mg) fixed-dose&#xD;
      combination (FDC) tablet will be administered alone on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1; in&#xD;
      Treatment Period 2, erythromycin will be administered on Day 1 to Day 12 (500 mg, four times&#xD;
      daily [QID]) with co-administration of a single FDC tablet with the morning dose of&#xD;
      erythromycin on Day 8. In Part 2 of the study, a single 120-mg dose of relugolix will be&#xD;
      administered alone on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1; in Treatment Period 2, erythromycin will&#xD;
      be administered on Day 1 to Day 12 (500 mg QID) with co-administration of a single 120-mg&#xD;
      dose of relugolix with the morning dose of erythromycin on Day 8. There will be a nine-day&#xD;
      washout interval between administration of study drug (the FDC tablet [Part 1] or relugolix&#xD;
      120 mg [Part 2]) on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2.&#xD;

             evaluation including medical history, physical examinations, clinical laboratory&#xD;
             tests, vital sign measurements, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram performed at the&#xD;
             screening visit. Specifically, study participants should meet the following&#xD;
             requirements at the screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart/pulse rate of 50 to 90 beats per minute, inclusive;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure of 90 to 139 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and a diastolic&#xD;
             blood pressure of 60 to 89 mmHg, inclusive;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A QT interval with Fridericia's correction (QTcF, QTcF = QT/RR(0.33)) ≤ 470&#xD;
             milliseconds;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal renal function at the screening visit, defined as an estimated creatinine&#xD;
             clearance ≥ 90 milliliters (mL)/minute by the Cockcroft-Gault equation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase or bilirubin value within&#xD;
             normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part 1 only: Study participant is a female between 40 and 65 years of age, inclusive,&#xD;
             at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part 2 only: Study participant is a male between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive, at&#xD;
             the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has a body mass index from ≥ 18.5 to ≤ 32.0 (Part 1) or from ≥ 18.5&#xD;
             to ≤ 30.0 (Part 2) (kilograms/square meter), at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part 1 only: Study participant is a postmenopausal female defined as 12 months of&#xD;
             spontaneous amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause or six weeks status post&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy). A serum follicle-stimulating&#xD;
             hormone (FSH) ≥ 40 milli-international units/mL is required to confirm postmenopausal&#xD;
             status. Note: women who are amenorrheic due to a surgical procedure (hysterectomy&#xD;
             without oophorectomy) and are considered physiologically postmenopausal based on FSH&#xD;
             values may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has a clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition or&#xD;
             disease (acute or chronic) that, as judged by the investigator, would make the study&#xD;
             participant ineligible for participation in the study (for example, compromise the&#xD;
             study data, limit the study participant's ability to complete and/or participate in&#xD;
             the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has a current condition or history of significant endocrine,&#xD;
             hepatic, renal, hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urologic,&#xD;
             immunologic, or neurologic disorders that, as judged by the investigator, would make&#xD;

          -  Study participants with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal&#xD;
             gastrointestinal anatomy (with the exception of an uncomplicated appendectomy) or&#xD;
             motility, hepatic and/or renal function that could interfere with the absorption,&#xD;
             metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has unconjugated bilirubin values consistent with Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;
             or a history of or current gall bladder or bile-duct disease.&#xD;
