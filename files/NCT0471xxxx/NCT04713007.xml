  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By joining this study, participants, including patients and their caregivers, will be&#xD;
      provided useful information about colon cancer that may help alleviate anxiety surrounding&#xD;
      treatment, improve communications with the medical team, and identify practical ways to&#xD;
      support each other. Participating in this study will have no impact on your cancer care that&#xD;
      participants receive from your provider. It is expected that the resources provided to&#xD;
      participants and participants caregiver will help improve participants overall care. The&#xD;
      study team will provide computer tablets for patients and their caregivers to use as part of&#xD;
      the study to access information about colon cancer and how to help manage participants&#xD;
      therapeutic care. The study team will check-in each week to provide assistance with the use&#xD;
      of the tablets and ask the patient and their caregiver, to complete an assessment survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the surveys the study team will collect participants full name, address and phone&#xD;
      number and some basic information about participants (e.g., age, gender and race). The study&#xD;
      team will also collect some personal or medical information, including the stage of colon&#xD;
      cancer and treatment received (if the participant) or your relationship to the patient if&#xD;
      participants caregiver. The study team will also collect some information on your emotional&#xD;
      health and views about the medical care that has been provided to date from the&#xD;
      questionnaire. All this information will be held confidential and not forwarded to anyone&#xD;
      outside of the study personnel. There are no activities required, except that the study team&#xD;
      will encourage caregivers and patients to discuss and use the information provided in&#xD;
      computer tablets to enhance their cancer care. Whether or not the participants use this&#xD;
      information will not affect their ability to receive high-quality care from their providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a slight burden of responding to the survey questions used to help us understand the&#xD;
      useful features of this program. For this reason, the investigator has included small&#xD;
      incentives to support the time and effort needed to complete these survey assessments. The&#xD;
      study team hopes that this study, one of the first of its kind, will help identify the&#xD;
      resources and methods that can be used to help patients and caregivers have a better&#xD;
      understanding of their cancer care and provide resources that they can use to enhance the&#xD;
      effectiveness of their therapy.&#xD;
