    <textblock>
      Thirty patients were enrolled in this study, mainly patients with first recurrence of&#xD;
      glioblastoma, and the requirement is that they can receive secondary radiotherapy. Regardless&#xD;
      of whether the patient has received a second operation or the MGMT promoter is methylated,&#xD;
      they can be included in this study. After enrollment, patients were given niraparib 300mg/day&#xD;
      (body weight ≥77Kg and baseline platelet count ≥150,000/µL) or 200mg/day (body weight &lt;77Kg&#xD;
      or baseline platelet count &lt;150,000/µL), combined with radiotherapy (total dose 55Gy),&#xD;
      follow-up Time 1 year. Until the patient has disease progression or intolerance or&#xD;
      voluntarily withdraw from the study.&#xD;
