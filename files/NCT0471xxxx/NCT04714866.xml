  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug treatment is often the first and only line of treatment available for ADHD. However,&#xD;
      some do not benefit from medication. The importance of psychotherapy is becoming more widely&#xD;
      accepted. In this study a group of university students diagnosed with ADHD will be offered&#xD;
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in groups. The treatment will be provided by a Clinical&#xD;
      Nurse Specialist in psychiatric nursing (CNS), in cooperation with school counsellors at the&#xD;
      University of Iceland and the Reykjavík University. Brief CBT treatment will be offered, i.e.&#xD;
      six group sessions, once a week over a period of six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the effects of CBT for adults diagnosed with ADHD. The study could&#xD;
      provide knowledge about the effects of CBT on depression, anxiety and ADHD, and on attitudes,&#xD;
      for individuals with ADHD. The resulting knowledge might lead to improved well-being and&#xD;
      increased quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A treatment manual for adults with ADHD was written based on the CBT model described in Young&#xD;
      and Bramham's Handbook on ADHD in Adults (2007), Greenberger and Padesky's Mind Over Mood&#xD;
      (2016) and Honos-Webb's The Gift of Adult ADD (2008). Emphasis will be on collaboration,&#xD;
      incentive, group interaction and therapy rather than didactic instruction. The manual-based&#xD;
      group treatment will be conducted in six sessions. An web page was developed in collaboration&#xD;
      with the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Iceland&#xD;
      containing homework and coping skills assignments to support the participants during therapy.&#xD;
      A pilot study has been conducted where adults (n= 5) previously diagnosed with ADHD was&#xD;
      offered group CBT in six sessions. The usefulness and benefits of the manual and the App will&#xD;
      be evaluated by using questionnaires. Participants was also asked about the group format. The&#xD;
      manual and the App will be further developed in light of the pilot study's results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      University students with ADHD (n= ........) previously diagnosed by a psychiatrist or a&#xD;
      psychologist, will be offered group CBT in six sessions. The study will be introduced to the&#xD;
      university students by the school counsellors at the University of Iceland and Reykjavik&#xD;
      University. The school counsellors will contact the students and offer them to take part in&#xD;
      the therapy. Participants will be randomized into two groups: a waiting list group and a&#xD;
      therapy group. The waiting list group will subsequently be offered treatment after a wait of&#xD;
      approximately six months. The therapy will be provided by a CNS. CBT sessions will take place&#xD;
      once a week over a period of six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted before the intervention (baseline), at end of treatment, and at&#xD;
      six-month follow-up. In addition, half of the participants will be placed on a waiting list,&#xD;
      and will be assessed at the same time as the intervention group (baseline) and again six&#xD;
      weeks later, and again six month after that, and will serve as a waiting list comparison&#xD;
      group. They will subsequently be offered the treatment intervention and will be included in&#xD;
      the intervention group.&#xD;
