  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluating newborn positioning and attachment is a key skill for maternal-child healthcare&#xD;
      providers. Trainees have limited opportunities to practice this skill in their clinical&#xD;
      rotations due to a lack of access to lactating patients. Thus, positioning and attachment&#xD;
      training is traditionally conducted through passive modalities, primarily videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to evaluate the impact of an interactive breastfeeding skills workshop&#xD;
      using a baby doll on health professional learners' ability to identify effective and&#xD;
      ineffective positioning and attachment at the breast.&#xD;

      Faculty at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (UM-SPH), Johns Hopkins School&#xD;
      of Nursing (JHUSON), and Michigan State University (MSU) are collaborating with&#xD;
      LiquidGoldConcept (LGC), a company focusing on simulation-based training in maternal-child&#xD;
      care, to evaluate the impact of high-fidelity simulation on health professional learner&#xD;
      outcomes. For the Phase I SBIR, LGC is developing a high-fidelity newborn simulator for&#xD;
      healthcare professional education in clinical lactation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>(Pre-Intervention) Competence in Evaluating Newborn Positioning and Attachment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Pre-Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a pre-intervention knowledge check on newborn positioning and attachment prior to and immediately following the Breastfeeding Skills Workshop. The knowledge check will consist of 5 true-false questions. For each question, the participant will watch a 3-second clip of positioning and attachment and respond to the question &quot;True or False, I would recommend adjustments to this dyad's positioning and attachment.&quot; For each true/false question, participants will respond to a multiple-choice question with 4 options on why they would or would not make adjustments to the dyad.</description>

    <measure>Performance of Clinical Lactation Skills related to positioning and attachment in a Video-based Simulation (Telesimulation)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Standardized Patient in that telesimulation will rate their performance of clinical and communication skills using a 10-item Formative Assessment Rubric (FAR). The FAR includes four &quot;I know&quot; statements rating clinical skills specific to the case scenario (e.g. I know why my nipples have been hurting when I breastfeed my baby).</description>

    <measure>Performance of Clinical Lactation Skills related to positioning and attachment in a Video-based Simulation (Telesimulation)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An independent rater will watch audio-video recordings of the telesimulation and grade learner's completion of technical skills relevant to positioning and attachment according to a 14-point checklist (Point values: 0=did not complete, 1=did complete)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the Breastfeeding Skills Workshop</measure>
    <time_frame>1-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a 6-item satisfaction survey immediately following completion of the second telesimulation with the following items. Participants will rate their agreement on a 6-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 6=strongly agree)&#xD;
The skills workshop helped me prepare for the positioning and attachment telesimulation.&#xD;
The multiple-choice questions helped me prepare for the positioning and attachment telesimulation.&#xD;
What was expected of me as a health professional during the telesimulation was appropriate for my level of training.&#xD;
The amount of time allotted for the telesimulation was adequate.&#xD;
The standardized patient in the telesimulation was a realistic breastfeeding mother.&#xD;
The newborn simulator distracted from the realism of the telesimulation.</description>
