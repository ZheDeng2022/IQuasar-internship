    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most limiting side effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and often leads to adaptations in the protocol of the chemotherapy including&#xD;
      dose reduction or even discontinuation of treatment. In general, the symptoms of CIPN are&#xD;
      sensory, often distributed in a &quot;stocking and glove&quot; manner, and include pain, tingling, and&#xD;
      numbness. CIPN has a marked negative influence on quality of life of patients and their&#xD;
      families. It may result in serious limitations in daily functioning and affect the enjoyment,&#xD;
      social relationships, and ability to perform work. Current management of CIPN (i.e.&#xD;
      prevention and treatment) includes dose reduction or delay of chemotherapy cycles and&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation. Unfortunately, this reduces the chance of an effective cancer&#xD;
      treatment. Current guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) on the&#xD;
      Prevention and Management of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy do not conclusively&#xD;
      recommend any agent for the prevention of CIPN. Due to the scarcity of drugs that are&#xD;
      effective for preventing and treating CIPN, the distress of patients who suffer from CIPN,&#xD;
      and the major societal and economic costs, new approaches and effective treatment strategies&#xD;
      are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational study which started in January 2017 in the outpatient clinic of the&#xD;
      Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine at the University of Bern showed&#xD;
      promising results regarding the medical treatment of CIPN with Stibium metallicum praeparatum&#xD;
      6x. Patients received Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x for prevention or treatment of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral sensory neuropathy, respectively. The study included 91&#xD;
      patients, and patients indeed showed lower incidence rates of (20%, 2 months after they&#xD;
      started with Stibium), as compared to the incidence of 57-83% reported by the NCCN task&#xD;
      force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on this observational study, the current study investigates the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerance of Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x (Weleda) to prevent paclitaxel- or&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy as reported by patients. As secondary outcomes,&#xD;
      the influence on quality of life and chemotherapy treatment adherence of patients is&#xD;
      assessed. As the clinical experience with Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x suggests&#xD;
      promising results for CIPN prevention, a double blind, bicentric, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      will be conducted to address the efficacy of Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x with a sound&#xD;
      scientific approach. Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x has been used in adults and children&#xD;
      for several decades and has demonstrated no harm. Consequently, no adverse events are&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;

      Epidemiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most limiting side effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and often leads to adaptations in the protocol of the chemotherapy including&#xD;
      dose reduction or even discontinuation of treatment. In addition, patients treated with&#xD;
      taxanes also may experience motor symptoms, which often present as distal or general&#xD;
      weakness, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction (e.g. constipation or diarrhea,&#xD;
      abnormalities of sweating, and lightheadedness and/or dizziness with positional changes).&#xD;
      CIPN has a marked negative influence on quality of life of patients and their families. It&#xD;
      may result in serious limitations in daily functioning and affect the enjoyment, social&#xD;
      relationships, and ability to perform work. Because of the growing prevalence of cancer and&#xD;
      of cancer survivors, the lack of adequate treatment or preventive strategies against CIPN, as&#xD;
      well as the major societal and economic costs, CIPN is becoming a major societal issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) task force report, the overall&#xD;
      incidence of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy ranges from 57 up to 83% of patients&#xD;
      treated with paclitaxel. The nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) form of paclitaxel was&#xD;
      formulated to enable lower doses and reduce toxicity, but neuropathy rates with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel are similar (not significantly lower) to those with standard paclitaxel when&#xD;
      the same cumulative dosage is administrated. The incidence and prevalence of CIPN vary among&#xD;
      neurotoxic agents, dosing regimens, and preexisting neuropathy. Severe symptoms are likely to&#xD;
      persist longer. In patients treated with paclitaxel, symptoms of peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      persisted in 41% of patient at 3 years, while 50% of patients recovered within 9 months.&#xD;
      Persistent numbness one year after treatment with paclitaxel were reported in approximately&#xD;
      67% to 80% of early-stage breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taxanes bind to the beta-tubulin in the microtubules of the mitotic spindle, and thus inhibit&#xD;
      the disassembly of microtubules. This results in the apoptosis of the cell. The most widely&#xD;
      accepted theory on the mode of action of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy states that the&#xD;
      disruption of the microtubulin structure interferes with axonal transport resulting in a&#xD;
      &quot;dying back&quot; process starting from distal nerve endings and disturbed Schwann cells and&#xD;
      neuronal bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the scarcity of drugs that are effective for preventing and treating CIPN, the&#xD;
      distress of patients who suffer from CIPN, and the major societal and economic costs, new&#xD;
      approaches and effective treatment strategies are required. This study investigates the&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerance of Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x (Weleda) to prevent paclitaxel-&#xD;
      or nab-paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy as reported by patients. As secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, the influence on quality of life and chemotherapy treatment adherence of patients&#xD;
      is assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product and Indication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x is authorized in Switzerland and is listed by Swissmedic as&#xD;
      an authorized anthroposophic medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x contains the agent Stibium metallicum praeparatum D6, which&#xD;
      is a liquid dilution (6x) in 1 ml ampoules for subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Other&#xD;
      components are sodium chloride and lactose. It is used to stimulate the healing process in&#xD;
      inflammation. According to the concept of anthroposophically extended medicine, the fields of&#xD;
      application include the stimulation of the form processes in processes with strong metabolic&#xD;
      activity, e.g. with inflammatory processes in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and on&#xD;
      the skin as well as with bleeding, allergic and catarrhal conditions of the upper airways, as&#xD;
      additional treatment for bronchial asthma, cardiac arrhythmias, as well as memory disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a parallel, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised, phase III superiority&#xD;
      trial, aiming to determine whether treatment with Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x reduces&#xD;
      the severity of manifestation of paclitaxel- or nab-paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
      as compared to placebo. The study is restricted to paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel in order to&#xD;
      limit variability in CIPN characteristics and severity and thus improve assay sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of 166 (83 per treatment arm) male and female cancer patients,&#xD;
      aged 18 years or older, starting a 12-week paclitaxel- or nab-paclitaxel-based adjuvant,&#xD;
      neoadjuvant, or palliative chemotherapy. Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x will be&#xD;
      administrated via 3 subcutaneous injections at 1 ampoule at 1 mL 3 times per week during&#xD;
      chemotherapy and will be continued for 18 weeks after end of chemotherapy. Placebo (saline&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection) is chosen as comparator, as it is state of the art to compare against&#xD;
      placebo when no &quot;gold standard&quot; treatment option is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first injection of study medication or placebo will be administered on the day of the&#xD;
      first dose of chemotherapy, Assessments during the intervention period will be done before&#xD;
      each administration of the chemotherapy (i.e. every 3 weeks) at at the end of treatment with&#xD;
      Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x (at 18 weeks). Follow-up assessments will be done at&#xD;
      patients' regular oncological control visits, which take place every 3 months after the end&#xD;
      of therapy, during 1 year. To accommodate standard scheduling practices for clinic visits and&#xD;
      outpatient appointments, a 1-week margin for assessments during the intervention period and a&#xD;
      4-week margin for assessments during the follow-up period will be allowed. The total duration&#xD;
      of subject participation will be 16.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of choice of study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the lower incidence of peripheral neuropathy in patients treated with docetaxel as&#xD;
      compared to those treated with paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, the study population is&#xD;
      restricted to patients with cancer starting a 12-week paclitaxel-based or&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel-based adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative chemotherapy. Paclitaxel and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel are used for the treatment of breast, ovarian, cervical, endometrial, lung,&#xD;
      esophageal, gastric cancer, as well as germ cell tumor. Patients with gastric cancer are&#xD;
      excluded because this cancer type may lead to relatively high withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known or potential problems and limitations of the design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering feasibility and generalizability challenges, multiple cancer types are included,&#xD;
      which can decrease the homogeneity of the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A challenging aspect is that if the patients in the control group should receive less&#xD;
      chemotherapy due to early development of neuropathy than the patients in the group with&#xD;
      Stibium metallicum praeparatum 6x, the overall neuropathy severity measured at the end of the&#xD;
      trial may be lower in the control group than in the experimental group. In such a case, the&#xD;
      trial may fail to demonstrate a true treatment effect that allows more cancer patients to&#xD;
      receive a full course of chemotherapy and possibly obtain better outcomes. For this reason,&#xD;
      secondary endpoints were sepcified to investigate this situation. Moreover, per-protocol and&#xD;
      sensitivity analyses will be conducted, excluding patients who require dose&#xD;
      reduction/treatment interruption due to early development of neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent process&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oncologist will explain to each participant the nature of the study, its purpose, the&#xD;
      procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential benefits and risks, as well as any&#xD;
      discomfort it may entail. Each participant will be informed that the participation in the&#xD;
      study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical assistance and treatment.&#xD;
      The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by authorized&#xD;
      individuals other than their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants for the study will be provided a participant information sheet and a consent&#xD;
      form describing the study and providing sufficient information for participant to make an&#xD;
      informed decision about their participation in the study. At the chemotherapy planning visit&#xD;
      the patient is informed about the study and is given time to consider participation until the&#xD;
      baseline assessment when chemotherapy starts (generally about 7 days, at least 24 hours). The&#xD;
      formal consent of a participant, using the approved consent form, must be obtained before the&#xD;
      participant is submitted to any study procedure. The consent form must also be signed and&#xD;
      dated by the investigator (or designee), and it will be archived as part of the study&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant privacy and confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator affirms and upholds the principle of the participant's right to privacy and&#xD;
      their compliance with applicable privacy laws. Importantly, anonymity of the participants&#xD;
      shall be guaranteed when presenting the data at scientific meetings or publishing in&#xD;
      scientific journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual subject medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered&#xD;
      confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited. Subject confidentiality will be&#xD;
      further ensured by utilising subject identification code numbers to correspond to treatment&#xD;
      data in the computer files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data verification purposes, authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a competent&#xD;
      authority (e.g. Swissmedic), or an ethics committee may require direct access to parts of the&#xD;
      medical records relevant to the study, including participants' medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early termination of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor may terminate the study prematurely according to certain circumstances, for&#xD;
      example:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ethical concerns,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  insufficient participant recruitment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  when the safety of the participants is doubtful or at risk, respectively,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  alterations in accepted clinical practice that make the continuation of a clinical trial&#xD;
           unwise,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  early evidence of benefit or harm of the experimental intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened and recruited consecutively. Screening will be conducted by the&#xD;
      Department of Oncology at the University Hospital Bern, as well as the Department of Oncology&#xD;
      at the Hospital of Thun, ensuring that all eligible cancer patients who are going to start a&#xD;
      paclitaxel- or nab-paclitaxel-based adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      offered participation in the study at the chemotherapy planning visit. If interested,&#xD;
      patients will be fully informed about the trial using the patient information and informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation / payments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating patients receive no financial, or any other form of compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment to study groups Allocation of patients will be carried out by the study nurse via&#xD;
      a dedicated website within the clinical trial management system REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to either the experimental or control group of the&#xD;
      study with a 1:1 allocation using permuted blocks with random block sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be implemented at the Clinical Trial Unit of the University of Bern (CTU&#xD;
      Bern), according to dedicated standard operating procedures (SOP). Allocation will be done&#xD;
      via a dedicated website within the clinical trial management system REDCap&#xD;
      (https://www.project-redcap.org/), also containing the electronic case report forms. Only&#xD;
      system administrators who are otherwise not involved in the trial will have access to the&#xD;
      algorithm and stored lists during the recruitment period. The underlying randomization lists&#xD;
      and details of the algorithm will not be disclosed but kept securely at CTU Bern. All these&#xD;
      measures will help to ensure concealment of allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance with study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to monitor adherence, the patients are requested to return used or unused ampoules&#xD;
      at each visit. Returned ampoules will be stored for adherence monitoring purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Accountability&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator or designee must maintain an inventory record of IMP at the site level&#xD;
      (received from the sponsor, returned to the sponsor) and at the patient level (dispensed to&#xD;
      the patient, returned by the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Return or Destruction of Study Drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion or termination of the trial, all unused study drugs/ placebos must be&#xD;
      destructed on site following the site's standard procedures for medication destruction and&#xD;
      the destruction documented. Documentation on study drug destruction must be provided to the&#xD;
      sponsor-investigator for filing in the trial master file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of serious adverse events (SAE) and other safety related events Reporting of SAEs:&#xD;
      all SAEs must be reported immediately and within a maximum of 24 hours to the&#xD;
      Sponsor-Investigator of the study. The Sponsor-Investigator will re-evaluate the SAE and&#xD;
      return the form to the site. SAEs resulting in death are reported to the Ethics Committee via&#xD;
      BASEC within 7 days. The SAEs that are a clear result of the underlying disease (e.g., events&#xD;
      occurring due to breast cancer or metastasis) are events that will not be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of SUSARs: a SUSAR needs to be reported to the Ethics Committee (local event via&#xD;
      local Investigator) via BASEC and to Swissmedic for category B and C studies (via&#xD;
      Sponsor-Investigator) within 7 days, if the event is fatal, or within 15 days (all other&#xD;
      events).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Safety Signals: all suspected new risks and relevant new aspects of known&#xD;
      adverse reactions that require safety-related measures, i.e. so called safety signals, must&#xD;
      be reported to the Sponsor-Investigator within 24 hours. The Sponsor-Investigator must report&#xD;
      the safety signals within 7 days to the Ethics Committee (local event via local Investigator)&#xD;
      via BASEC and to Swissmedic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting and Handling of Pregnancies: pregnant participants must immediately be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the clinical study. Any pregnancy during the treatment phase of the study and within 30&#xD;
      days after discontinuation of study medication will be reported to the Sponsor-Investigator&#xD;
      within 24 hours. The course and outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, and&#xD;
      any abnormal outcome regarding the mother or the child should be documented and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic reporting of safety: an annual safety report is submitted once a year to the local&#xD;
      Ethics Committee via local Investigator and to Swissmedic via Sponsor-Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of (Serious) Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs that are ongoing at study end are followed up until resolution or stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following null hypothesis is tested: The treatment arm does not result in a change in the&#xD;
      NTX-subscale from baseline to week 12 against a two-sided alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on current recommendations that the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for&#xD;
      FACIT cancer-specific subscales is 0.3 to 0.4 point change per item, MCID for the 11-item&#xD;
      NTX-subscale is defined as a change in score of 3.3-4.4 points. In this study, we defined the&#xD;
      MCID as a change in the score of 3 points. Assuming a standard deviation of 7, a correlation&#xD;
      between baseline and follow-up measurement of 0.5 and type I error rate (alpha) of 5%, we&#xD;
      will need 132 patients (66 per arm) to detect a MCID of 3 with a power of 80% based on a&#xD;
      linear regression with the baseline as covariate (ANCOVA). To account for a dropout rate of&#xD;
      20%, 166 patients (83 per group) are recruited. This equals approx. 5000 ampoules of study&#xD;
      medication, as well as 5000 ampoules of placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the start of the trial but before the recruitment ends, a statistical analysis plan&#xD;
      (SAP) will be written. The SAP will determine all necessary data preparation steps (e.g.&#xD;
      additional validations, generation of new variables), definitions (e.g. analysis sets), and&#xD;
      statistical analyses (e.g. models, outputs such as tables and graphs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will follow an intention-to-treat approach, i.e. all patients will be&#xD;
      analysed according to the group they were randomized to. Baseline characteristics of patients&#xD;
      in the two treatment arms will be reported using frequency distribution and descriptive&#xD;
      statistics. The primary endpoint will be analysed using a linear regression with the score in&#xD;
      the NTX-subscale at week 12 as outcome and the treatment arm and the NTX-subscale at baseline&#xD;
      as covariates. The treatment effect will be presented as mean difference with 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI) and a p-value. Continuous secondary outcomes measured at baseline and one time&#xD;
      point during chemotherapy (i.e. PHQ-9 and GAD-7at week 12) will be analysed in the same way.&#xD;
      Continuous secondary outcomes measured at several time points (the change in the&#xD;
      NTX-subscale, FACT-G total score, BPI, NCCN distress thermometer, PHQ-9, and GAD-7) will be&#xD;
      analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression models with time point as a factor variable,&#xD;
      treatment group, the interaction of time point and treatment group, and baseline value as&#xD;
      fixed covariates and a random intercept and/or slope for the patient. At each time point the&#xD;
      treatment effect will be presented with a mean difference and a 95% CI. A joint p-value over&#xD;
      all time points will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Binary secondary outcomes measured over several time points (neuropathy) will be analyzed&#xD;
      with logistic-mixed effects regression model with time point, treatment group, and the&#xD;
      interaction of time point and treatment group as fixed covariates and a random intercept&#xD;
      and/or slope for the patient. Binary and binomial secondary outcomes measured once (number of&#xD;
      patients with full course of chemotherapy, number of unused drug packs) will be analyzed&#xD;
      using logistic regression. Treatment effects will be presented as odds ratios with 95% CIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Count data (number of planned chemotherapy dosages that a participant received before&#xD;
      presenting with an increase ≥ 10% in the neurotoxicity subscale score) will be analyzed using&#xD;
      Poisson or negative binomial regression. The treatment effect will be presented as incidence&#xD;
      rate ratio with 95% confidence interval. The time to modification to the planned chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen because of CIPN will be presented using Kaplan-Meier curves. The treatment effect is&#xD;
      estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for the stratification factors from&#xD;
      randomization and presented as hazard ratio with 95% CI. Exploratory/ secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be analysed descriptively using frequency distribution and descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      A per-protocol analysis will be conducted to examine the robustness of our primary estimates.&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria will be excluded from the per-protocol&#xD;
      analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any major protocol deviations (e.g. intake of a concomitant medication affecting the&#xD;
           primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non-availability of measurements of the primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non-sufficient exposure to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients who did not receive a full course of chemotherapy at week 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size re-estimation will be performed based on examination of data after inclusion of&#xD;
      83 patients (i.e. half of the initial sample size estimation). Only nuisance parameters of&#xD;
      blinded data will be assessed, which includes the assessment of standard deviation over both&#xD;
      treatment arms and of correlation between baseline and week 12. The sample size will be&#xD;
      increased if required, with an upper limit of 200 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety outcomes will be reported using frequency distribution and descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviation(s) from the original statistical plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any deviation from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the final&#xD;
      trial report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of missing data and drop-outs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data will be reported for all outcomes. The reason for drop-outs will be listed.&#xD;
      Drop-outs are not replaced. The total sample size accounts for a dropout rate of 20% which is&#xD;
      appropriate and a general thumb rule in oncological trials. Participants who prematurely&#xD;
      discontinue chemotherapy for reasons unrelated to neuropathy (e.g. nausea) present a missing&#xD;
      data challenge. These participants may or may not have developed neuropathy if they had&#xD;
      continued their chemotherapy treatment. If a large number of participants prematurely&#xD;
      discontinue or decrease planned dosages of chemotherapy before developing neuropathy, the&#xD;
      ability of the study to detect a treatment effect (i.e. assay sensitivity) could decrease.&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses that make various assumptions regarding whether the participants who&#xD;
      prematurely terminated chemotherapy would have developed neuropathy if the planned&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen had been completed, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the number of missing data is larger than 10%, we will carry out multiple imputations&#xD;
      based on baseline values, treatment groups and the outcome at other time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling and record keeping / archiving&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Report Forms&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRFs in this trial are implemented electronically using a dedicated electronic data&#xD;
      capturing (EDC) system (REDCap, https://www.project-redcap.org/). The eligibility form will&#xD;
      be prepared in paper format for the investigators. The study nurse will complete the Study&#xD;
      Nurse Questionnaires directly in REDCap. Questionnaires for patients during the chemotherapy&#xD;
      period (i.e. Baseline questionnaire, FACT/GOG-NTX, BPI, NCCN Thermometer distress, PHQ-9,&#xD;
      GAD-7) will be prepared in paper format and handed out by the study nurse before the&#xD;
      administration of the chemotherapy. The questionnaires for patients will not contain any&#xD;
      patient-identifying information. Data entry into REDCap from the paper questionnaires will be&#xD;
      done by the study nurse. Questionnaires for patients during the follow-up period will be&#xD;
      prepared in electronic format and will be accessible through a personal link. The personal&#xD;
      link will be sent to the patient's email address. Patients' email address will be therefore&#xD;
      collected into REDCap but this field will be tagged as &quot;Identifier field&quot; and thus will be&#xD;
      automatically removed from data exports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specification of source documents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source documents must be available at the site to document the existence of the study&#xD;
      participant and must include the original documents relating to the study, as well as the&#xD;
      medical treatment and medical history of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As source documents are considered (list not conclusive):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient information and informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electronic / Paper version of completed eligibility form, patient questionnaires, and&#xD;
           study nurse questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record keeping / archiving&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will keep the Trial Master File, the extracted data, the meta data and interim/&#xD;
      final reports for at least 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management System&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRFs in this trial are implemented electronically using a dedicated electronic data&#xD;
      capturing (EDC) system (REDCap, https://www.project-redcap.org/). The EDC system is activated&#xD;
      for the trial only after successfully passing a formal test procedure. All data entered in&#xD;
      the CRFs are stored on a Linux server in a dedicated mySQL database. Responsibility for&#xD;
      hosting the EDC system and the database lies with CTU Bern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data security, access and back-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial and participant data will be handled with utmost discretion and are only accessible to&#xD;
      authorized personnel who require the data to fulfill their duties within the scope of the&#xD;
      study. On the CRFs and other study specific documents, participants are only identified by a&#xD;
      unique participant number. The participant number (unique and consecutively numbered) will be&#xD;
      attributed to each patient registered. The code list will be stored at the Institute of&#xD;
      Complementary and Integrative Medicine, in a secure compartment lockable with a key.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The server hosting the EDC system and the database is kept in a locked server-room. Only the&#xD;
      system administrators have direct access to the server and back-up tapes. A role concept with&#xD;
      personal passwords (site investigator, statistician, monitor, administrator etc.) regulates&#xD;
      permission for each user to use the system and database as he/she requires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data entered into the CRFs are transferred to the database using Transport Layer Security&#xD;
      (TLS) encryption. Each data point has attributes attached to it identifying the user who&#xD;
      entered it with the exact time and date. Retrospective alterations of data in the database&#xD;
      are recorded in an audit table. Time, table, data field and altered value, and the person are&#xD;
      recorded (audit trail).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-level back-up system is implemented. Back-ups of the whole system including the&#xD;
      database are run internally several times per day and on external tapes once a day. The&#xD;
      back-up tapes are stored in a secure place in a different building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and archiving&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the final analyses, data files will be extracted from the database to be analysed with&#xD;
      statistical packages. After database lock, the status of the database is recorded in special&#xD;
      archive tables. The sponsor will keep the Trial Master File, the extracted data, the meta&#xD;
      data and interim, final reports for at least 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic and central data validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is checked by the EDC system for completeness and plausibility. Furthermore, selected&#xD;
      data points are cross-checked for plausibility with previously entered data for that&#xD;
      participant. In addition, central data reviews will be performed on a regular basis to ensure&#xD;
      completeness of the data collected and accuracy of the primary outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before database lock, the principal investigator will validate the collected data with her&#xD;
      signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quality control of the study and data retrieval, an on-site visit will be done by&#xD;
      appropriately trained and qualified monitors. Any findings and comments will be documented in&#xD;
      site visit reports and communicated to the local investigator and the sponsor as applicable.&#xD;
      Prior to study start (first participant enrolled) a plan detailing all monitoring-related&#xD;
      procedures will be developed. All source data and relevant documents will be accessible to&#xD;
      monitors and questions of monitors are answered during site visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audits and Inspections&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study documentation and the source data/documents will be accessible to&#xD;
      auditors/inspectors (also CEC and CA) and questions will be answered during inspections. All&#xD;
      involved parties must keep the participant data strictly confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality, Data Protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct access to source documents will be permitted for purposes of monitoring, audits and&#xD;
      inspections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Conduct of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in accordance to the protocol and with principles enunciated in&#xD;
      the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      (GCP) issued by ICH, in case of medical device: the European Regulation on medical devices&#xD;
      2017/745 and the ISO Norm 14155 and ISO 14971, the Swiss Law and Swiss regulatory authority's&#xD;
      requirements. The CEC and regulatory authorities will receive annual safety and interim&#xD;
      reports and be informed about study stop/end in agreement with local requirements.&#xD;
