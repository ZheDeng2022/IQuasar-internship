  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the outcome of a muscle sparing, minimally invasive&#xD;
      open surgical technique for unstable ribcage injuries after trauma. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare the results from the study participants to a historical cohort who were operated with&#xD;
      a different surgical technique with large incisions and simultaneous thoracotomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective follow-up study where the investigators aim to study patients who have&#xD;
      undergone surgery with a muscle sparing, minimally invasive technique for unstable ribcage&#xD;
      after trauma. The investigators plan on seeing the participants as out patients 6 months and&#xD;
      1 year after surgery. The results will be compared to results from a historical cohort with&#xD;
      patients who participated in earlier studies with a different surgical method with large&#xD;
      incisions and simultaneous thoracotomy. The investigators plan on including 50 patients since&#xD;
      a preliminary analysis has suggested this should be enough to notice statistically&#xD;
      significant differences between the groups.&#xD;
