  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteroviruses (EV) are the most frequent cause of acute meningitis in the paediatric&#xD;
      population. Detection of enterovirus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens by Polymerase&#xD;
      Chain Reaction (PCR) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Recently, our laboratory published&#xD;
      the BLEDI study which highlighted the interest of detecting EV in the blood of the paediatric&#xD;
      population : (i) EV was found in more than a quarter of cases in the blood of infants&#xD;
      admitted to hospital with isolated fever and (ii) detection of EV was more frequent in the&#xD;
      blood than in CSF in neonates and infants with isolated fever, sepsis or meningitis. However,&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of EV infections is poorly understood and little work has been done on&#xD;
      the inflammatory response to these infections. In EV meningitis, the inflammatory response&#xD;
      has been studied primarily in children infected with enterovirus A71 (EV-A71). Indeed, in&#xD;
      these children, inappropriate cytokine secretion (cytokine storm) leads to severe&#xD;
      neurological and cardiopulmonary damage, which can progress to death. The study of the&#xD;
      inflammatory response during meningitis due to other types of EV remains poorly&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of BLEDI-CYTOKINES (ancillary study of the BLEDI study) is to study the&#xD;
      inflammatory response during EV meningitis in neonates, infants and children, as assessed by&#xD;
      cytokine levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, by comparing case-controls from an existing&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EVs are characterized by their high genetic variability, with more than 120 types described&#xD;
      to date. They are involved in mild infections, such as febrile syndromes that may be&#xD;
      associated with respiratory and cutaneous manifestations. However, these viruses are also&#xD;
      involved in more severe infections of the nervous system. In children infected with EV-A71,&#xD;
      which causes mild epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease, inappropriate cytokine secretion&#xD;
      (cytokine storm) leads to severe neurological and cardiopulmonary complications that can&#xD;
      progress to death in children (&lt;5 years of age) in Asia. Many studies have focused on the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to EV-A71 infections: some cytokines (Tumor Necrose Factor (TNF),&#xD;
      INterFeron (INF), InterLeukine (IL)1, IL6, IL10, eotaxin,...) dosed in CSF have been&#xD;
      associated with severe EV-A71 infections (2,5,6). Recently, a Japanese study showed an&#xD;
      overexpression of IL-6 in the blood of children with EV-A71 foot-hand-mouth syndrome. The&#xD;
      authors defined that a level of IL-6 â‰¥ 66 pg/mL could be a prognostic marker of progression&#xD;
      to aseptic meningitis (6). In EV (other than EV-A71) meningitis, pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      such as IL6, IL8, and INF are produced in the acute phase in CSF to control the infection,&#xD;
      and then they decline and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL10 are synthesized (7). In&#xD;
      addition, studies have shown that the production of some cytokines is greater in severe EV&#xD;
      infections: for example, the production of IL4 and IL5 is greater in EV encephalitis than in&#xD;
      EV skin infections (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are very few comparative studies of cytokine expression in blood and CSF. In&#xD;
      addition, little work has been done to study cytokine expression in meningitis due to EV&#xD;
      other than EV-A71. In young children, these meningitis may also be complicated by&#xD;
      encephalitis, myelitis, and even flaccid paralysis (including poliomyelitis) (2-4). The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of these severe EV infections is currently unknown. In addition, no&#xD;
      preventive vaccine is available against these infections (other than polio vaccine), nor are&#xD;
      there effective curative antivirals for severe EV infections.&#xD;
