  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is difficult to establish the standard of return to sports post anterior cruciate ligament&#xD;
      (ACL) reconstruction. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional&#xD;
      connectivity (FC) of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can explore&#xD;
      the differences in neural function of different populations, but have not been applied in the&#xD;
      study of ACL postoperative return to sports.This project intends to use ALFF algorithm to&#xD;
      calculate the changes of BLOD signals of coppers and non- coppers after ACL surgery in the&#xD;
      subfrequency band and the functional network in the subfrequency band, explore the&#xD;
      relationship between the default network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network (SMN), and use&#xD;
      three-dimensional gait analysis to carry out accurate functional test..This project will&#xD;
      explore the central strategy of ACL postoperative functional recovery from a new perspective,&#xD;
      to provide a more reasonable high-level evaluation index for the timing of return to sports,&#xD;
      and to reduce the incidence of postoperative re-tearing.&#xD;
