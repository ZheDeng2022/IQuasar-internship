  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the pilot study, 30 patients with metastatic lung cancer (stage IV) will be recruited at&#xD;
      the start of their stage IV treatment from February 2019. The study period per patient will&#xD;
      last six months, from the start of the stage IV treatment. Patients are eligible if they are&#xD;
      diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, speak sufficient Dutch, and are willing to participate.&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned to two arms by simple randomization. In the intervention arm,&#xD;
      15 patients will receive a weekly questionnaire. Alerts will be sent to the multidisciplinary&#xD;
      care team, who will undertake follow-up actions. In the control arm, 15 patients will receive&#xD;
      the standard care pathway without weekly questionnaire and without automatic alerts to the&#xD;
      care team. The standard care pathways and the care team are the same in both groups. In this&#xD;
      pilot study, the weekly follow-up will be evaluated by a validation questionnaire,&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with patients (n=5) and the care team (n=5), and workload&#xD;
      registration of the care team during a six-month period for all included patients in the&#xD;
      pilot.&#xD;

    <description>Questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 30 items (i.e. single questions), 24 of which are aggregated into nine multi-item scales, that is, five functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting) and one global health status scale. The remaining six single-item (dyspnoea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, diarrhoea and the financial impact) scales assess symptoms.
