  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical practice is an integral part of dental and dental hygiene students' education. The&#xD;
      curriculum for a degree is guided by best academic practices for European undergraduate&#xD;
      dental education, published by the Association for Dental Education in Europ√© (ADEE), and the&#xD;
      dental hygienist education is based on a European qualifications framework. Interprofessional&#xD;
      education has been recognized as a means to improve oral health professional training due to&#xD;
      the linked form of education with improved health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interprofessional mentoring education is needed for the clinical practice, which has to&#xD;
      be implemented in interprofessional teams. Clinical practice mentors need to have completed&#xD;
      an interprofessional mentoring education. Different types of educational approaches have been&#xD;
      previously affecting mentors' competence development in mentoring. Dental and dental hygiene&#xD;
      students can experience team-based, interprofessional education by participating in clinical&#xD;
      practice sessions offered in a communal learning environment. Traditional lectures can be&#xD;
      transformed into modern, enhanced learning experiences that correspond to the new generation&#xD;
      of students. Online learning methods are increasingly being incorporated into dental health&#xD;
      care education. Online learning is designed to be able to support learners with technology&#xD;
      supporting and facilitating student learning. Those methods can be used in dental health care&#xD;
      continuous education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate educational intervention's effectiveness of&#xD;
      inter-professional mentoring education on mentors' competence development of dentists and&#xD;
      dental hygienists mentors.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interprofessional intervention applying blended learning will be conducted at the higher&#xD;
      education institution's interactive learning facilities, while the online interprofessional&#xD;
      intervention will be conducted in an online learning environment in collaboration with the&#xD;
      teaching-learning company of the Finnish Dental Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a nonrandomized pre-post quasi-experimental study. The participants in this study&#xD;
      will participate in interprofessional mentoring education. Participants will self-assess&#xD;
      their level of Competence in mentoring, which includes seven dimensions; mentor&#xD;
      characteristics, mentor motivation, mentoring practices in the workplace, reflection during&#xD;
      mentoring, goal-oriented mentoring, student-centered evaluation and constructive feedback.&#xD;
      There will be three assessment time points: at baseline (before education, T0), immediately&#xD;
      after the education (T1), and 3 months after the education (T2). The control group will not&#xD;
      receive any educational intervention. The interventions and control group will be used the&#xD;
      same self-assessment instrument and assessment time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention and control groups will include 60 participants per group. The 60&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group will be further divided into two groups: one group (30&#xD;
      participants) completing the blended learning module and the other group (30 participants)&#xD;
      completing an online learning module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be conducted for a duration of 6 months. More precisely, the blended&#xD;
      learning module will be offered twice, in spring 2019 and spring 2020. The online learning&#xD;
      module will be conducted during spring 2020 and autumn 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An announcement about both interventions will be published in Finnish journals of dental&#xD;
      health care and the official journal of the Finnish Dental Association. The mentors can then&#xD;
      choose which form of education was more convenient in terms of time and location. The blended&#xD;
      learning approach will be offered once per year in the springtime, while the online mentoring&#xD;
      education is available throughout the year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blended learning approach to mentoring education for dental health care professionals for&#xD;
      participants (dentists and dental hygienists) in the intervention group comprises completion&#xD;
      of specialist lectures, discussions, interprofessional group work and self-reflection. The&#xD;
      mentoring education will last five weeks, include four face-to-face seminars (2+2 days) and&#xD;
      self-reflection assignments lasting an estimated two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online mentoring education for participants (dentists and dental hygienists) in the&#xD;
      intervention group comprises of completion of represents a collaboration between members of&#xD;
      the dental association, specialist lectures and the coordinator of the dental association.&#xD;
      The online mentoring education environment, Priima, includes videos of specialist lectures,&#xD;
      e-learning materials, along with assignments concerning reflection skills and&#xD;
      participant-based evaluation. In addition, the learners will be informed that they could get&#xD;
      in touch with the coordinator of the association if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the control group are dentists and dental hygienists who are listed as&#xD;
      working at health care centers on the Finnish Dental Association site&#xD;
      (tkharjoittelu.hammaslaakariliitto.fi) and participate in student mentoring. Data concerning&#xD;
      the control group, which did not receive any educational intervention. The control group&#xD;
      represents dentists or dental hygienists from randomly selected organizations, while all of&#xD;
      the participants will be selected from subdivisions of the 2007 NUTS (Nomenclature of&#xD;
      Territorial Units for Statistics). Control group randomization will be performed via Research&#xD;
      Randomizer (https://www.randomizer.org/#randomize) and ensured that participants in the&#xD;
      intervention groups are similar with respect to both known and unknown prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target of participant selection is to obtain a sufficiently large sample size that&#xD;
      represents a highly heterogeneous study group so that concrete conclusions about the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the educational interventions can be drawn. A power analysis applying&#xD;
      settings outlined in the latest study was used to calculate the appropriate sample size, with&#xD;
      the results indicating that 60 participants per group (intervention and control group) would&#xD;
      provide a sufficiently large Cohen's d effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
