  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who lose function of the lower limb due to spinal cord injury (SCI) need to use their&#xD;
      arms for activities of daily life especially during weight-bearing tasks, such as transfers,&#xD;
      and manual wheelchair (MWC) propulsion in order to maintain mobility. Persistent use of the&#xD;
      upper limbs constitutes biomechanical difficulties, especially in the shoulder joint. The&#xD;
      most commonly affected area in the shoulder is supraspinatus and biceps tendon. Four&#xD;
      different stoke patterns have been classified in MWC users. Distinct amounts of force may be&#xD;
      applied to the shoulder joint during propulsion with different stroke patterns and this can&#xD;
      affect the shoulder tendons in different rates. In this study, investigators aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate and compare the acute sonographic changes in supraspinatus and biceps tendons after&#xD;
      a wheelchair propelling test in MWC users with SCI with different stroke patterns. Also, it&#xD;
      is intended to determine the risk factors related to the stroke patterns that may be&#xD;
      associated with these sonographic changes.&#xD;

      Fourty male MWC users with SCI were will be divided into 4 groups according to their stroke&#xD;
      patterns (arcing, semicirculer, single loop, and double loop). Participants will use their&#xD;
      own wheelchairs with their preferred stroke pattern for 20 minutes at a speed of 1 m / s on a&#xD;
      motorized treadmill for a wheelchair propelling test. Wheelchair propelling videos will be&#xD;
      recorded during the test. Shoulder kinematics will be analyzed using Kinovea motion analysis&#xD;
      software and stoke pattern will be confirmed. Ultrasonographic assesment of participants'&#xD;
      nondominant shoulder will be performed before and after testing procedure.&#xD;
