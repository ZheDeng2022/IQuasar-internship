  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Active Surveillance Culture programs (ASC) have been initiated in health-care systems in&#xD;
      recent years as a mechanism for tracking multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO), with a goal&#xD;
      to reduce the transfer of those organisms to other patients. Consequently, the Center for&#xD;
      Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) charged infection control personnel to develop&#xD;
      institutional guidelines for the prevention of transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms,&#xD;
      within health care settings. The CDC guidelines include performance of active surveillance&#xD;
      cultures for patients after admission to health care facilities or to high-risk-patient care&#xD;
      units, to detect colonization with target multidrug-resistant organisms. The most commonly&#xD;
      tracked antimicrobial resistance organisms in hospital surveillance programs are methicillin&#xD;
      resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE), Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacilli (e.g.&#xD;
      Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).&#xD;
      Patients who are colonized with these potential pathogens are placed under contact&#xD;
      precautions to prevent transmission to other patients. While clinical outcomes studies exist&#xD;
      for MDR gram-positive organisms [particularly methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
      (MRSA)] ASC, data is limited for MDR gram-negative organisms. The study is retrospective&#xD;
      cohort study to evaluate if isolation of an MDR gram-negative pathogen on ASC predicts&#xD;
      subsequent infection with the same pathogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &gt;18 years of age, admitted to MHS with ASC for MDR gram-negative pathogens, will be&#xD;
      included if criteria met. Outcomes of interest will be evaluated with appropriate statistical&#xD;
      tests, and multivariate analyses will be used to control for predictors of interest. All&#xD;
      analysis will be considered significant at an alpha of &lt;0.05. The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that increased screening with isolation will result in decreased subsequent MDRO&#xD;
      gram-negative infection. Furthermore, the investigators hope that this will also result in&#xD;
      improved patient's outcomes, mortality, and decreased cost, including excessive use of&#xD;
      anti-infectives and its unintended consequences such as microbial resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients with ASC at MHS. Patients &gt;18 years&#xD;
      of age, admitted to MHS during the study specified period, will be included if there is&#xD;
      documented ASC. Patients will be identified through the clinical microbiology laboratory&#xD;
      records. Figure 1 is a flow diagram of ASC stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study populations All patients with documented laboratory surveillance culture from January&#xD;
      1, 2006 to December 31, 2012 will be included. Eligible cultures (see definitions below) will&#xD;
      be identified based on positive surveillance cultures from MHS. Patients identified with&#xD;
      select criteria per objective will be further analyzed in subsequent phases to complete all&#xD;
      outcomes of interest. Patients will be excluded if they are â‰¤18 years, expired before initial&#xD;
      surveillance culture is positive, were not admitted, or were transferred to another&#xD;
      institution. Patients will be excluded if they underwent amputation or surgical revision for&#xD;
      wound infections. Patients with polymicrobial MDR gram-negative pathogen on ASC will be&#xD;
      included; however, the main focus of this study is the subset of patients with monomicrobial&#xD;
      ASC. Lastly, only the index culture will be considered, for patients with multiple wounds&#xD;
      ASC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Initial phase will focus on review of surveillance cultures within the past&#xD;
      year (calendar year 2012) to determine objective number one. Prior years are included to&#xD;
      evaluate earlier documentation of colonization and whether number of patients/cultures per&#xD;
      year has significant variation. Subsequent phases will collect specific data identified as&#xD;
      significant or varied based on previous analysis. Data will be collected via extraction and&#xD;
      chart review from MHS's electronic medical record (EMR) on identified patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics (weight, sex, race, age, allergy), co-morbid conditions (diabetes,&#xD;
      immunosuppressed, HIV/AIDS, organ transplant, malignancy, chronic lung disease, chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease, liver disease, surgery in past 30 days), location in the hospital, type of&#xD;
      residence (i.e., home, long-term care facility, etc), source of infection, treatment data&#xD;
      (antibiotics administered and duration), length of stay in survivors, hospital cost,&#xD;
      antibiotic cost, severity of illness by mean Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPS) II&#xD;
      score (based on clinical data present during the 24 hours preceding the index blood culture),&#xD;
      hospital mortality, and DRG. Previous hospitalizations, antimicrobial usage and surveillance&#xD;
      culture results will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance cultures from nares, rectum, endotracheal aspirates, urine, and wound swab will&#xD;
      be included. Microbiology data (organism, culture source, and number of classes of&#xD;
      antibiotics with resistance) will be documented. Patients with positive ASC for MDR&#xD;
      gram-negative pathogens will be evaluated for antimicrobial use for 1) ASC only and 2)&#xD;
      Subsequent positive cultures due to suspected or proven active infection. Cost for each of&#xD;
      the following classifications will be determined and compared: microbiological cultures&#xD;
      including antimicrobial susceptibility test, length of stay, cost of antimicrobial and&#xD;
      associated diagnosis related groups (DRG) per infection type.&#xD;
