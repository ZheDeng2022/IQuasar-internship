    <textblock>
      Development and validation of questionnaire/scale to assess online dating addiction in a&#xD;
      sub-cohort of the SwissPrEPared cohort study (validation sample: n=300). Longitudinal design&#xD;
      to assess the association of online dating addiction and sexual/mental health. No randomised&#xD;
      trial, only 1 cohort which will be stratified according to severity/risk of online dating&#xD;
      addiction.&#xD;

      This project may fill an important gap of knowledge in a research area that has taken on&#xD;
      major importance over the past few years, and has thus the potential to impact several major&#xD;
      public health recommendations. First, considering the high penetrance of dating apps in the&#xD;
      men who have sex with men (MSM) population (reaching 78.2% in a recent report), more than&#xD;
      62,000 MSM in Switzerland are estimated to use such applications. How many of them suffer&#xD;
      from addiction remains unclear and our project will be the first to provide estimates of the&#xD;
      prevalence of online dating addiction in this particular population. Second, our project will&#xD;
      help to clarify the impact of online dating app usage on health outcomes. By identifying&#xD;
      drivers of the current HIV/(sexual transmitted infections (STI) epidemic in Switzerland, our&#xD;
      project might thus provide critical information to shape future prevention measures aiming at&#xD;
      further reducing HIV/STI incidence rates. Third, because sexual risk-taking increases with&#xD;
      substance use and depression, it remains crucial to detect mental health outcomes early and&#xD;
      provide adequate care to populations at high risk of HIV, or other STI, transmission. Fourth,&#xD;
      our study might identify a new phenomenon related to high-risk sexual behaviour that may not&#xD;
      be limited to the MSM group, but could also affect other, larger populations interacting and&#xD;
      meeting through online communication channels. Considering that more than 41 million people&#xD;
      are currently using dating apps in Europe, our findings might have a substantial impact on&#xD;
      the general population. Finally, this project might provide the very first insights on the&#xD;
      interplay between online dating, mental health and sexual risk taking. This new understanding&#xD;
      could then help Switzerland create additional measures for preventing HIV transmission and&#xD;
      reach the UNAIDS targets for HIV elimination by 2030.&#xD;
