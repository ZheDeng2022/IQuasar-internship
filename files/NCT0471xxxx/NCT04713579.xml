    <textblock>
      Some babies require emergency surgery on their tummy in the first few months of life. This is&#xD;
      most commonly because they were born prematurely and developed a bowel problem (called NEC)&#xD;
      or a blockage of the bowel. As part of this surgery, the ends of the bowel may be brought to&#xD;
      the skin surface (called a stoma) to divert stool into a bag. The stoma allows time for the&#xD;
      bowel to rest and recover and is intended to be temporary with reversal later on. The best&#xD;
      time to reverse or &quot;close&quot; the stoma is unknown. Stomas may cause dehydration, poor growth&#xD;
      and skin problems so earlier closure may be betterÍ¾ however surgery is safer when babies are&#xD;
      older and bigger so later closure may be better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to answer the question, 'is it feasible to conduct a clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      'early' vs. 'late' stoma closure in neonates?' It has a series of specific objectives which&#xD;
      incorporate: (i) describing current UK practice; (ii) establishing whether or not a clinical&#xD;
      trial (and exactly what form of trial) is acceptable to parents and clinicians; and (iii)&#xD;
      establishing the design of a potential trial, including defining the intervention ('early vs.&#xD;
      late') and the population of infants to be included, how infants should be recruited and what&#xD;
      information should be collected (outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will ask parents and health professionals for their views and whether they&#xD;
      would take part in a future trial and information about babies who have recently had a stoma&#xD;
      to find out which factors influence the timing of closure. They will also analyse 6 years of&#xD;
      data from an existing database, the National Neonatal Research Database to estimate the&#xD;
      numbers of babies affected, understand current practice and outcomes for these babies to help&#xD;
      decide whether a clinical trial is possible.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neonates undergoing emergency abdominal surgery frequently require stoma formation. Reversing&#xD;
      (closing) these stomas with a second operation is an essential part of the infant's recovery.&#xD;
      The timing of this closure is highly variable around the United Kingdom (UK) and the best&#xD;
      time remains unclear. Current evidence is of low methodological quality and presents mixed&#xD;
      conclusions: determining the best time has significant potential benefits for: (i) infant&#xD;
      health outcomes (short-term e.g. avoiding complications and long-term e.g. growth and&#xD;
      neurodevelopment); ii) families (e.g. reduced Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay); and&#xD;
      iii) healthcare providers (e.g. reduced costs). Ideally, a clinical trial to compare early&#xD;
      and late closure would be conducted but this is likely to be challenging and may not be&#xD;
      feasible or acceptable to parents and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to answer the question, 'is it feasible to conduct a clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      'early' vs. 'late' stoma closure in neonates?' It has a series of specific objectives which&#xD;
      incorporate: (i) describing current UK practice; (ii) establishing whether or not a clinical&#xD;
      trial (and exactly what form of trial) is acceptable to parents and clinicians; and (iii)&#xD;
      establishing the design of a potential trial, including defining the intervention ('early vs.&#xD;
      late') and the population of infants to be included, how infants should be recruited and what&#xD;
      information should be collected (outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a mixed-methods approach comprising three parallel workstreams (WS). WS 1&#xD;
      will be a national survey of clinician perspectives of neonatal stoma closure. WS 2 will use&#xD;
      an observational cohort study, interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. WS 3 will analyse&#xD;
      three existing large databases (National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD), Health Episode&#xD;
      Statistics (HES) and British Association of Paediatric Surgeons Congenital Anomalies&#xD;
      Surveillance System (BAPS-CASS)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of these WS will be combined and presented at a final, trial design meeting&#xD;
      where conclusions about trial feasibility will be reached and if appropriate, an outline of a&#xD;
      trial protocol agreed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated impact and dissemination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal impact will be determining whether or not a definitive trial can go ahead: if&#xD;
      the study demonstrates that a trial is feasible then the investigators will use their&#xD;
      findings to design a trial that is acceptable to parents and clinicians; that includes the&#xD;
      most appropriate infants; that measures outcomes important to parents and clinicians and&#xD;
      ultimately, answers the question: when is the best time to close an infant's stoma? Findings&#xD;
      will be disseminated at national meetings of relevant professionals, through social media&#xD;
      (including patient groups), to funding bodies and in open access publications.&#xD;
