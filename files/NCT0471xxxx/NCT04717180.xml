  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is a disorder of language processing caused by a lesion in particular brain regions.&#xD;
      Treatment aims at improving or restoring impaired function or at compensating for deficits.&#xD;
      More recently, computer technology has been integrated into treatment options. In this study,&#xD;
      a detailed and comprehensive computerized software program for aphasia rehabilitation is&#xD;
      designed for the treatment of Arabic speaking Egyptian aphasic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: design a computerized software program for the rehabilitation of Arabic&#xD;
      speaking Egyptian aphasic patients.&#xD;

      Aphasia is a disorder of language processing caused by a lesion in particular brain regions.&#xD;
      Treatment aims at improving or restoring impaired function or at compensating for deficits.&#xD;
      More recently, computer technology has been integrated into treatment options. In this study,&#xD;
      a detailed and comprehensive computerized software program for aphasia rehabilitation is&#xD;
      designed for the treatment of Arabic speaking Egyptian aphasic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: design a computerized software program for the rehabilitation of Arabic&#xD;
      speaking Egyptian aphasic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: The study was conducted on 50 patients with aphasia who attend the unit of&#xD;
      Phoniatrics during the period of one year, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Alexandria Main&#xD;
      University Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The training materials were designed as a software program. Each patient was&#xD;
      subjected to assessment before and after the application of the rehabilitation program.&#xD;
      Patients were randomized into two groups: group I who received therapy using the software&#xD;
      aphasia rehabilitation program and group II who received conventional (traditional) language&#xD;
      therapy. Therapy continued for 48 sessions over six months.&#xD;
