  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the feasibility and safety of administering a single&#xD;
      dose of psilocybin to patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD). In addition the&#xD;
      investigators will establish the pharmacokinetic properties of the active metabolite&#xD;
      psilocin. This is the first step in a research project that has the overall aim to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of a single administration of psilocybin as an intervention for treatment of&#xD;
      AUD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the feasibility and safety of administering psilocybin to 10&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with AUD. Following informed consent, patients will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility as per in- and exclusion criteria and baseline values will be recorded as per&#xD;
      outcome measures. All patients will receive a single administration of 25 mg of psilocybin.&#xD;
      As per safety guidelines patients will be monitored the entire dosing session by study staff&#xD;
      familiar with the psychedelic effects of psilocybin. In addition, the patients will meet&#xD;
      before and after the dosing session with a psychologist connected to the study for&#xD;
      preparation and post-session debriefing, respectively. During dosing session, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect blood plasma psilocin levels in order to establish&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and an estimated brain 5-HT2AR occupancy. When the effects of psilocybin&#xD;
      subside, the investigators will ask the patients to fill out questionnaires encapsulating the&#xD;
      psychedelic experience. One week after drug administration the patients are required to meet&#xD;
      for an end-of-study assessment of outcome measures including adverse events.&#xD;
