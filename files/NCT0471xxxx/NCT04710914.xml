      This monocentric, prospective, controlled, randomized, single-blind study will be conducted&#xD;
      in surgical resuscitation at the Rouen University Hospital. The aim of our research project&#xD;
      is to evaluate the extubation time after sedation with inhaled isoflurane compared to&#xD;
      conventional intravenous sedation with midazolam, in patients who require prolonged sedation&#xD;
      (3 to 28 days) in a context of septic shock. This population is particularly at risk of&#xD;
      hypnotic accumulation due to the prolonged duration of use and the increased risk of&#xD;
      developing renal or hepatic impairment in connection with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data from the literature on shorter durations of up to 96 hours of sedation, the&#xD;
      investigators expect a decrease in the time to extubation in patients sedated with isoflurane&#xD;
      as well as a better quality of awakening with a decrease in resuscitation delirium. This&#xD;
      shortened duration of mechanical ventilation could have beneficial effects on the morbidity&#xD;
      associated with prolonged sedation and ventilation: reduction of pneumopathies acquired under&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, reduction of the length of stay in resuscitation and hospitalization.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In intensive care, sedation of patients is frequently used for their management. Combined&#xD;
      with analgesia, it provides the comfort essential for the implementation of certain therapies&#xD;
      such as mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically, sedation is based on the combination of a hypnotic and an injectable morphine,&#xD;
      most often midazolam and sufentanil. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine with many advantages: few&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects, no limited duration of use and good workability. However, its use&#xD;
      presents several difficulties in resuscitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Some patients have accelerated metabolism and resistance to benzodiazepines, either&#xD;
           through chronic use of psychotropic or narcotic drugs. These patients develop tolerance&#xD;
           phenomena due to enzyme induction. This tachyphylaxis leads to an increased need for&#xD;
           midazolam to achieve the therapeutic goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Some pathologies, such as ARDS, require deep sedation in the initial phase, which may&#xD;
           last several days. After this phase, prolonged sedation may be necessary before&#xD;
           achieving sufficient improvement to allow sedation to be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The metabolism of midazolam is dependent on liver function and its elimination from&#xD;
           renal function. Alteration of these functions, common in resuscitation, results in&#xD;
           impaired elimination with accumulation of midazolam and 2 active metabolites,&#xD;
           1-hydroxy-midazolam and 1-hydroxy-midazolam-glucuronide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These three difficulties may lead to an undesirable prolongation of the sedation period&#xD;
      beyond the cessation of midazolam infusion, which is associated with an increase in morbidity&#xD;
      such as neuromyopathies, ventilator-associated pneumopathies (VAPP), deliriums and withdrawal&#xD;
      syndromes. These complications increase the length of stay and mortality in intensive care&#xD;
      units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 30 years there has been a growing interest in the use of sedation in resuscitation with&#xD;
      volatile halogenated agents (VHAs). These agents, administered by inhalation, have many&#xD;
      advantages: short onset of action, good workability, effect not dependent on renal or hepatic&#xD;
      function, almost exclusive and predictable respiratory elimination, absence of tachyphylaxis&#xD;
      and metabolism not sensitive to enzyme induction. For these reasons, AVHs are widely used in&#xD;
      anesthesia in the operating room. The hypnotic action of HVAs is closely correlated with the&#xD;
      expired fraction of HVAs. Measured by gas analysers, it allows precise monitoring of the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect. In contrast to resuscitation ventilators, all anesthesia ventilators are&#xD;
      equipped with evaporation tanks and administration circuits, gas analyzers and associated&#xD;
      facilities for their disposal. These technical constraints mean that, despite their many&#xD;
      theoretical advantages, AVHs have not been used in resuscitation area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early 2000s, a new device made it possible to use AVH in intensive care: the AnaConDa®&#xD;
      system. It made it possible to administer AVH using an evaporator inserted into the patient&#xD;
      circuit at the intubation catheter, completely independent of the ventilator. However, this&#xD;
      device had several shortcomings in terms of user safety and cost due to the short service&#xD;
      life of the consumables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2016, a new device is available in France: the MIRUS® (Pall Medical, Dreieich,&#xD;
      Germany). It has several advantages over AnaConDa® :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is equipped with an integrated gas analyzer that allows the automatic adjustment of&#xD;
           the AVH flow rate for a concentration target (FeAVH target). This results in greater&#xD;
           safety and AVH savings,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each AVH with an MA (isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane), there is a MIRUS&#xD;
           controller with a tank model with a coding and color-coding system to avoid medication&#xD;
           errors,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Filters and reflectors can be used for several days, thus reducing the cost of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the recent AVHs and as for its use in anesthesia, isoflurane has shown a safety of use&#xD;
      in resuscitation on longer uses up to 96 hours without side effects. A recent retrospective&#xD;
      study showed no excess mortality after prolonged use of isoflurane (minimum 96 hours, average&#xD;
      506 hours) in post-operative, mainly digestive surgery in patients with sepsis with an&#xD;
      average age of 71 years. After medium-length sedation (average duration 52 hours, maximum 96&#xD;
      hours), the recovery and extubation times are shorter than with intravenous sedation with&#xD;
      midazolam: 10 minutes versus 250 minutes for the extubation time, but with significant&#xD;
      differences in sedation and analgesia protocol compared to our practices. The AVHs have&#xD;
      moreover been included in the German recommendations on sedation in resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This monocentric, prospective, controlled, randomized, single-blind study will be conducted&#xD;
      in surgical resuscitation at the Rouen University Hospital. The aim of our research project&#xD;
      is to evaluate the time to extubation after sedation with inhaled isoflurane compared to&#xD;
      conventional intravenous sedation with midazolam, in patients requiring prolonged sedation (3&#xD;
      to 28 days) in a context of septic shock. This population is particularly at risk of hypnotic&#xD;
      accumulation due to the prolonged duration of use and the increased risk of developing renal&#xD;
      or hepatic impairment in connection with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data from the literature on shorter durations of up to 96 hours of sedation, the&#xD;
      investigators expect a decrease in the time to extubation in patients sedated with isoflurane&#xD;
      as well as a better quality of awakening with a decrease in resuscitation delirium. This&#xD;
      shortened duration of mechanical ventilation could have beneficial effects on the morbidity&#xD;
      associated with prolonged sedation and ventilation: reduction of pneumopathies acquired under&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, reduction of the length of stay in resuscitation and hospitalization.&#xD;
