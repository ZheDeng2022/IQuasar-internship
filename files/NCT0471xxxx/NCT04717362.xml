    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, the investigators plan is to confirm the role of Natesto&#xD;
      (intranasal testosterone) to combat hypogonadal symptoms in men trying to recover&#xD;
      spermatogenesis following the withdrawal of conventional Testosterone replacement therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Testosterone replacement therapy (TTh) is becoming increasingly common among men of&#xD;
      reproductive age in the United States. An estimated 3 million men are on TTh; however&#xD;
      exogenous testosterone use can disrupt the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, leading&#xD;
      to reduced spermatogenesis and possible infertility. In normal physiology, the hypothalamus&#xD;
      releases Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary to&#xD;
      release Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH). FSH then stimulates&#xD;
      the Sertoli cells in the testis to support spermatogonial differentiation and maturation. LH&#xD;
      stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce endogenous testosterone. Regulation of&#xD;
      this HPG axis occurs via negative feedback where testosterone directly inhibits the release&#xD;
      of GnRH and LH from the hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively. The use of exogenous&#xD;
      testosterone thus leads to reduced Sertoli function causing diminished spermatogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spontaneous recovery of spermatogenesis after cessation of TTh is possible but may take&#xD;
      months to years and cause the patient to experience new onset of severe hypothalamic&#xD;
      hypogonadal symptoms. Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is a naturally occurring protein&#xD;
      that mimics LH and may be used as a therapy to support the return of spermatogenesis quickly&#xD;
      with minimal side effects and resolve hypogonadal symptoms. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      testosterone-induced infertile patients can recover sperm in the ejaculate in 4.6 months when&#xD;
      treated with HCG supplemented with clomiphene citrate, tamoxifen, anastrozole, or recombinant&#xD;
      FSH. With the cessation of TTh, despite the use of LH stimulatory protocols, these patients&#xD;
      still experience hypogonadal symptoms. Recent preliminary results show the potential to&#xD;
      offset hypogonadism symptoms that accompany exogenous testosterone cessation through&#xD;
      administration of 4.5% intranasal testosterone gel. Natesto is a nasally administered&#xD;
      exogenous 4.5% testosterone gel, administered from a non-pressurized, manual pump dispenser&#xD;
      equipped with a specialized nasal applicator which administers 125uL (5.5mg of testosterone).&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that a single nasal dose has a rapid absorption with a Tmax at 60&#xD;
      mins and a half-life that ranged between 10-100 minutes. Three to four daily doses achieve&#xD;
      eugonadal levels of circulating testosterone comparable to normal pulsatile-regulated release&#xD;
      of testosterone. It has also been shown that men on Natesto maintain FSH and LH levels as&#xD;
      well as total motile sperm count within the normal range. In this prospective study, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to confirm the role of Natesto to combat hypogonadal symptoms in men&#xD;
      trying to recover spermatogenesis following the withdrawal of conventional TTh.&#xD;
