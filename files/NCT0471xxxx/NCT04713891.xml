    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, Multi-Center, Open-Label Study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of KF-0210 in&#xD;
      participants with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in two parts: phase Ia,&#xD;
      and phase Ib.&#xD;

      Phase 1a:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the phase 1a part of the study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic and anti-tumor activity of oral KF-0210 as a&#xD;
      single agent in participants with advanced solid tumors, to identify the dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity and establish the maximum tolerated dose, or maximum administered dose and/or the&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose of KF-0210 in participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the phase 1b part of the study is to assess the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic and anti-tumor activity of KF-0210 in combination with&#xD;
      Atezolizumab in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) (MSS), lung cancer (LC), squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the esophagus (SCCE), gastric cancer (GC), and bladder cancer (BC).&#xD;
