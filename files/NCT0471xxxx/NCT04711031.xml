  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study that describes focused lung ultrasound (FLUS) findings in&#xD;
      patients presenting with symptoms of an acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in&#xD;
      general practice in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten general practitioners (GPs) will perform FLUS in addition to their usual care of adults&#xD;
      presenting with symptoms of an acute LRTI where the GP suspects a community-acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia (CAP). Eligible patients will consecutively be invited to participate during a two&#xD;
      months' study period until each GP has included a total of ten patients. The GPs will&#xD;
      register information about patients including age, gender, symptoms, clinical findings,&#xD;
      results of any point-of-care test performed, if antibiotic treatment was prescribed and they&#xD;
      will register information on FLUS performance and findings.&#xD;

    <description>The participating GPs use ultrasonography on a weekly basis and will use the ultrasonography device already available to them; however, the ultrasound machine system and type of transducer will be reported. The GPs will use a 14-zone FLUS scanning protocol that has previously been validated in a general practice setting. Each of the scanning zones on the patient's left side can be denoted from 1L to 7L and from 1R to 7R on the right side. Each scanning zone should be assessed using FLUS. The transducer is placed in the middle of a scanning zone making a cross sectional image of an intercostal space and the underlying pleura blades. The patients will be examined in an upright position. The GPs will be trained in the 14-zone scanning protocol during a FLUS training program prior to recruitment of patients. FLUS pathological findings are predefined, and the variables will be dichotomized into present or not present for each scanning zone.</description>

        GPs: Eligible GPs who are interested in participating will be identified through our GP&#xD;
        network, the Facebook page for Center for General Practice at Aalborg University, the&#xD;
        Facebook group Ultralyd i almen praksis I Danmark [Ultrasound in general practice in&#xD;
        Denmark] and via our collaboration with the Danish Society for Ultrasound in General&#xD;
        Practice (DAUS). Ten GPs will be selected based on demographics, experience with PoCUS,&#xD;
        experience with FLUS, organisational aspects of the clinic and number of years as a general&#xD;
        practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients: Eligible patients will be identified when they present to general practice.&#xD;
        Written and oral information about the study will be provided by the GP to all potential&#xD;
        participants and if they consent to participate, they will be included.&#xD;
