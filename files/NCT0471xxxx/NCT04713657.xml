  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common long-term complication in patients with congenital heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD). Medical treatments to promote regeneration of new healthy heart muscle cells have the&#xD;
      potential to provide new heart failure treatments for these patients. The development of such&#xD;
      therapies is limited by the poor understanding of the ways in which heart muscles grow after&#xD;
      birth. Investigators have learned that humans without heart disease generate new heart&#xD;
      muscles cells up to the age of 20 years old and that this is decreased in patients with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease like Tetralogy of Fallot. Investigators are trying to determine if&#xD;
      treatment with a medicine called Propranolol can increase heart muscle cell proliferation&#xD;
      and, with that, normalize heart growth. Investigators will examine discarded heart muscle&#xD;
      tissue that is obtained during surgery for the presence of new heart muscle cells.&#xD;
      Propranolol is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a certain kind of&#xD;
      benign tumor in infants (hemangioma), but it is not currently approved by the FDA to increase&#xD;
      heart muscle growth.&#xD;

    <measure>Cardiomyocyte Division</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of complete surgical repair, at approximately 3-9 months old, it is expected that a piece of RV myocardium will be resected. This tissue will be collected and analyzed using a multiple isotope mass spectrometer.</time_frame>
    <description>To quantify cardiomyocyte division, investigators will utilize previously established MIMS (membrane introduction mass spectrometry) approach. Briefly, investigators will administer 5 enteral doses of 15N-thymidine to all patients at 1 month after birth. Cardiomyocytes that have undergone DNA replication after the intake of 15N-thymidine will incorporate the stable isotope into their DNA.</description>

    <description>The target dose of Propranolol hydrochloride for this study target dose for this study will be 4 mg/kg/day divided in 4 doses. The concentration of propranolol solution is 20 mg/5 mL. Additionally, labeled syringes will be provided to families for accurate weight-based dosing. Treatment with propranolol will begin at 1 month of age and continue until surgical repair, which happens usually at 3 - 9 months of age.</description>

    <description>Placebo will be given in a volume that corresponds to the patient's weight. Additionally, labeled syringes will be provided to families for accurate weight-based dosing. Treatment with placebo will begin at 1 month of age and continue until surgical repair, which happens usually at 3 - 9 months of age. There is no current standard of care for pharmacologic therapy for infants with ToF. As such, there are no alternative treatments, and the placebo group is standard of care.</description>

    <description>15N-thymidine will be administered to patients in order to quantify cardiomyocyte proliferation. 15N-thymidine will be administered as 5 separate syringes. Each syringe will contain the recommended daily dose based on participants weight. Subjects will be given the labeled thymidine by mouth once a day for 5 consecutive days. The dosing will begin one week after starting the study drug.The caregiver (parent or nurse) will administer the labeled thymidine by mouth via a syringe once a day for 5 consecutive days. They will be provided with a diary to keep track of study drug dosing.</description>

    <description>Parents will be asked to keep a diary of the child's feeding and diaper changes during the administration of thymidine. To monitor how the labeled thymidine is processed in the body, investigators will analyze urine from the child's diapers. Each time a diaper is changed, a cotton ball will be placed in the diaper. At the next diaper change, this cotton ball will be removed from the diaper, placed in a Ziploc bag, and stored in the freezer. They will be collected and stored cotton balls starting with the first administration of thymidine until 24 hours after the last administration. The frozen cotton balls may be collected from the home by a nurse or brought by parent to the next clinic visit.</description>

    <description>On Study Day 1 to obtain baseline assessment of cardiac size. A second research dedicated echocardiogram will be done after being anesthetized for surgery. Echocardiography is routinely performed to determine right ventricle (RV) structure of the heart and function in ToF/PS and is non-invasive.</description>

    <description>A limited study protocol will be performed using the feed-and-bundle technique at the time of study enrollment, The feed and bundle technique is utilized so that the infant will be as comfortable as possible and asleep during the procedure. This is done to prevent the risk of sedation and allow for a more natural sleep. The baby is undressed, prepared with ECG-leads and an oxygen saturation probe, and fed. With this &quot;feed, swaddle, and sleep&quot; technique, scanning times of 30-60 minutes can be achieved, which provides the stillness needed for accurate visualization of the heart. A second CMR, with the same limited study protocol, will be performed under general anesthesia prior to surgical repair. It does not pose any risk of radiation exposure and will not require IV placement or contrast administration for a limited assessement of the right ventricle.</description>

The first dose will be given in the Pediatric Clinical and Translational Research Center (PCTRC) at 1mg/kg. Parents will administer propranolol (1 mg/kg po x 4 doses per day). Parents will be instructed to administer propranolol with feeding or soon after feeding, but not before feeding. families will also be given instructions for regarding 15N-thymidine dosing frequency and interval and provided with a log sheet to record administered and missed doses of propranolol and 15N-thymidine.</description>
