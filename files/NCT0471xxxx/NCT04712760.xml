  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism has increased significantly since the&#xD;
      newborn screening program was introduced in 1978. The largest increase is seen in children&#xD;
      with eutopic thyroid gland. More than one-third of children with eutopic gland have transient&#xD;
      hypothyroidism. Clinical practice guidelines recommend to re-evaluate thyroid function in&#xD;
      children with eutopic gland around the age of 3 years to determine whether hypothyroidism is&#xD;
      transient or permanent. Up until today it is still difficult to determine early on whether&#xD;
      hypothyroidism is transient or permanent in children with eutopic gland. Our aim is to&#xD;
      identify one or more predictive factors for transient congenital hypothyroidism in children&#xD;
      with eutopic gland or thyroid hemiagenesis.&#xD;

        Children with congenital hypothyroidism either detected by newborn screening or by a blood&#xD;
        test done because of clinical suspicion of hypothyroidism, in Lorraine, between 1996 and&#xD;
        2017. All the patients with confirmed hypothyroidism underwent thyroid imaging. The&#xD;
        children with eutopic gland and hemiagenesis are included in this study.&#xD;
