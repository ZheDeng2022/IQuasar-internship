      1. Study the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in male patients on hemodialysis aged 18-60&#xD;
           years (sexually active male) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study the effect of hemodialysis on the male patients sexual functions by measurement of&#xD;
           serum prolactin and free testosterone levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      : Gonadal dysfunction is a frequent finding in men with ESRD on chronic hemodialysis&#xD;
      ,erectile dysfunction is one of the most common manifestation of sexual dysfuncion whitch has&#xD;
      been reported to be as high as 70 -80 %of hemodialysis patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testosterone deficiency and insufficiency are frequent findings in hemodialysis male patients&#xD;
      that were found to be 66% and 24% respectively The Probleme is multifactorial , the most&#xD;
      important factor is due to testesterone deficiency. total and free testosterone levels are&#xD;
      typically reduced , that is usually accompanied by elevation of serum Gonadotropins&#xD;
      concentrations due to hypothalamic -pituitary-gonadal -axis disturbance(uremic hypogonadism)&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in the pulsatile release of GnRH, which leads to a hypogondal state due to&#xD;
      uremia, which occurs due to inadequate nutrient intake, stress, and systemic illness . Excess&#xD;
      LH secretion is thought to result from the diminished release of testosterone from the Leydig&#xD;
      cells, because testosterone normally provides a feedback inhibition of LH release. The&#xD;
      metabolic clearance rate of LH is reduced due to reduction of kidney clearance ,Follicle&#xD;
      stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is also increased in men with chronic kidney failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated plasma prolactin levels are commonly found in dialyzed men, it is thought to be due&#xD;
      to increased its production , extreme hyperprolactinemia has been associated with&#xD;
      infertility, loss of libido, low circulating testosterone levels, So,due to testosterone&#xD;
      deficiency and hyperprolactinemia in ESRD as one of most important factors and exclusion of&#xD;
      other factors , men on chronic hemodialysis shows different degrees of subfertility or&#xD;
      infertility due to Erectile dysfunction , testicular damage and impaired spermatogenesis.&#xD;
