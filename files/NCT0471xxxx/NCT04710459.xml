  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In end-stage patients when all management options have been used, will often&#xD;
      develop compromise of their airways as the cancer continues to progress. Endobronchial&#xD;
      therapy options may help to relieve some of their symptoms, allowing improvement in their&#xD;
      shortness of breath as they go home in combination with other palliative therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to compare the safety ; efficacy; and clinical outcome of endobronchial&#xD;
      cryotherapy combined with chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy versus chemo-radiotherapy alone&#xD;
      on patients with Non small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and method(s): A prospective randomized clinical trial was carried out on 60&#xD;
      patients with different ages of both sexes, diagnosed as bronchogenic carcinoma non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer type (NSCLC) . The patients attended the hospital in the chest department,&#xD;
      Qena Faculty of Medicine, South Valley University. Assessment of the patients was done and&#xD;
      randomly assigned into two groups. Group1 ,Include 30 patients subjected to chemotherapy ,&#xD;
      radiotherapy and endobronchial cryotherapy.Group 2 , Include include 30 patients subjected to&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy alone.&#xD;
