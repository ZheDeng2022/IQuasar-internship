  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SIJD) can be cured with medical and physical therapy&#xD;
      interventions. Standard physical therapy techniques include manual joint mobilization,&#xD;
      manipulation, bracing, massage, patient education, aerobic training, general exercise, and&#xD;
      electrotherapies such as heat, ultrasound, and transcutaneous electric nerve&#xD;
      stimulation(TENS). In the physiotherapy context, an effective treatment strategy for&#xD;
      unappreciated SIJD is needed. Currently, there are no guidelines or appropriate management&#xD;
      plans for this dysfunction, physicians usually refer to it as low back pain alone, and&#xD;
      physiotherapists treat the pain as low back pain (LBP). However, appropriate medical&#xD;
      intervention or physical therapy may be carried out if the diagnosis is accurate.&#xD;
      Furthermore, only a few studies tried to compare the effects of the various treatment&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strain-counterstain (SCS) consider an excellent choice for building patient thrust as the&#xD;
      patient is held passively in a pain-free position. SCS can facilitate treatment for the&#xD;
      patient who has experienced pain during a treatment session by using other manual therapy&#xD;
      techniques such as manipulation and MET or specific core stability exercises to enhance force&#xD;
      closure of SIJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCS allows normalization of the tone of tight muscles involved in SIJ dysfunction which&#xD;
      allows a significant improvement in recruitment of weak muscles, especially the gluteal&#xD;
      group. SCS has shown its effectiveness in reducing pain or palpation tenderness over&#xD;
      different musculoskeletal disorders such as acute/ chronic LBP, mechanical neck pain, and&#xD;
      masseter trigger points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCS affects local circulations which lead to more nutrient supply, metabolic waste removal,&#xD;
      and reverse ischemia that can manifest as painful tender points (TPs) or sustain dysfunction.&#xD;
      Current literature lacks consensus on mechanisms, contributing factors, and treatment of SIJ&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MET was advocated for the treatment of muscle imbalances in the lumbopelvic region, such as&#xD;
      pelvic asymmetry. The theory behind MET assumes that the technique is used to correct&#xD;
      asymmetry by targeting hamstring or hip flexor contractions on the painful side of the lower&#xD;
      back and move the innominate in the proper direction. It is important to note, however, that&#xD;
      evidence indicates that non-symptomatic individuals have also been shown to have pelvic&#xD;
      asymmetries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While manual therapy is a helpful tool for LBP care, few studies have focused on the efficacy&#xD;
      of SIJD. There is limited evidence concerning the efficacy of SCS and MET in SIJ dysfunction.&#xD;
      According to investigators' knowledge, there is no study to investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      SCS on SIJ dysfunction patients in comparison to muscle energy technique.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The patients will be assigned randomly to the 2 groups by using opaque, sealed envelopes, containing the name of one of each groups (SCS or MET). A colleague who will be not participating in recruiting, treating or evaluating participants will select the envelopes. After the initial assessment but before the first therapy session, group allocation will be carried out.</masking_description>

    <measure>Pain Pressure Threshold(PPT) via Digital Pressure Algometer (Wagner Model FDIX)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The algometry (Wagner model FDIX) is an analogue mechanical pressure dynamometer with half circular compression rubber tip (1 cmÂ²). The dial ranges from 2.0 to 20.0 kg (kilogram-force). The value of the kilogram-force is equal to a kilogram per square centimeter. PPT will be considered abnormal when it is equal to 3.0 kg or less Two measure points will be marked 2 cm cranially (first point) and 2 cm laterally (second point) from reference point located 1 cm medially and caudally from the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) which shows the most painful points in SIJ patients. Anatomically, the first point is related to the attachment of gluteus maximus to the iliac crest while the second point is related to the erector spinae muscle and posterior sacroiliac ligament.</description>

    <measure>Pelvic tilting via Palpation Meter (PALM)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Palpation Meter (PALM) was developed to measure pelvic torsion, pelvic tilting and leg length discrepancy (LLD). The body of the PALM contains a bubble level in a semi-circular arc with one-degree gradations that range from zero degree to thirty degrees on either side of the midline. The caliper arms are placed in bony landmarks and the degree of deviation from horizontal is read from the inclinometer</description>

    <measure>Functional disability via the Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI):</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) ODI is a validated and well-accepted measure of disability due to lower back pain without distinguishing between different causes of back pain. ODI focused on details of LBP concerning standing, walking, sitting, lifting, daily activity and socially. It is consists of ten questions, each question has a score between 0 and 5.&#xD;
The scoring is calculated by dividing total score by the maximum score and multiplied by 100 to give a percentage which indicates the level of disability related to spinal disorder ( 0-20% minimal, 20%-40% moderate, 40%-60% severe, 60%-80% crippled and 80%-100% patient are confined to bed)</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>MET is a gentle manual therapy for the restricted mobility of the spine and extremities and is an active procedure in which the corrective force is regulated by the patient, not the clinician. This technique requires the patient to perform voluntary muscle contractions of varying intensity, in a specific direction, while the clinician uses a counter-force that does not allow movement to occur The physiological mechanism underlying SCS is unknown though. It has hypothesized that muscle tone inhibition occurs by stimulation of the target muscle's Golgi tendon organ by physical approximation of muscle origin and insertion.</description>
