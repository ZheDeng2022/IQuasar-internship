  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to determine the effect of psychological resilience on&#xD;
      practicing oral habits among a group of 5- to 7-year-old children.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychological pressure has been thought to be a predisposing factor that might result in&#xD;
      deleterious oral habits practicing. Shahraki et al. stated that increased stress levels are&#xD;
      associated with oral habits as thumb sucking and nail biting. Leme et al. concluded that&#xD;
      children and adolescents with DOH presented more symptoms of depression than their&#xD;
      counterparts. Moreover, they were more likely to report symptoms of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ability to cope (or resilience) includes a person's sense of agency and their ability to&#xD;
      think and behave, to make positive decisions, and to apply skills and knowledge to life&#xD;
      challenges. The term resilience has come to mean an individual's ability to overcome&#xD;
      adversity and continue his or her normal development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between psychological resilience and practicing oral habits in children&#xD;
      remains unclear, this study aims to reveal that association, if present.&#xD;
