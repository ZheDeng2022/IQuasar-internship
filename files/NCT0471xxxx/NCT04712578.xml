  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial examining the&#xD;
      effects of caffeinated and non-caffeinated pre-workout supplements on resistance exercise&#xD;
      performance. Resistance-trained adults will be randomly assigned to complete three study&#xD;
      conditions (caffeinated pre-workout, non-caffeinated pre-workout, and placebo) in one of the&#xD;
      six possible condition orders. During each condition, participants will report to the&#xD;
      laboratory for ingestion of the assigned beverage and subsequent muscular performance&#xD;
      testing. Major performance outcomes will be force production variables from a mechanized&#xD;
      squat device and maximal strength and muscular endurance on the bench press and leg press&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;

    <masking_description>All investigators will be blinded to the caffeinated vs. non-caffeinated supplement (i.e., these were provided by the manufacturer in a blinded manner). Select study investigators who will not be involved in assessing outcomes will formulate the placebo supplement and be responsible for dispensing all supplements to participants. Supplements will be provided to participants in opaque containers to maintain blinding. All investigators involved in assessing outcomes will also remain blinded and will not be involved in handling or dispensing the supplements.</masking_description>

          -  An inability to complete resistance exercise due to injury or medical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported caffeine sensitivity, as indicated by unwanted side effects when&#xD;
             caffeine is consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to any of the ingredients in the test beverages or standardized breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of anabolic steroids&#xD;
