  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The participants are asked to take part in this clinical trial, a type of research study. The&#xD;
      participants are SJLIFE study participants and may have a hard time exercising (exercise&#xD;
      intolerance) due to side effects of cancer treatment received as a child.This study is being&#xD;
      done to determine if a personalized exercise plan will help childhood cancer survivors who&#xD;
      have exercise intolerance become more active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the goal of this study, we propose the following three Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of an individually tailored, home-delivered aerobic and&#xD;
      strengthening intervention to improve exercise capacity in survivors of childhood cancer with&#xD;
      exercise intolerance (peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) &lt;85% of age and sex predicted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of an individually tailored, home-delivered aerobic and&#xD;
      strengthening intervention on measures of cardiac, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and&#xD;
      neurosensory function in survivors of childhood cancer with exercise intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of an individually tailored, home-delivered aerobic and&#xD;
      strengthening intervention on emotional health, participation in family and community&#xD;
      activities, quality of life, and cognitive function in survivors of childhood cancer with&#xD;
      exercise intolerance.&#xD;

      The design for this study will be a single-blind two-arm, prospective, randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial. Performance testing results: Both groups of participants will be provided with the&#xD;
      results of their performance testing. Individually tailored exercise program: Individuals&#xD;
      randomized to receive an individually tailored exercise program will meet with an exercise&#xD;
      specialist.Generalized exercise recommendations: Individuals randomized to receive the&#xD;
      generalized exercise recommendations will receive a copy of the Physical Activity Guidelines&#xD;
      for Americans.&#xD;

    <description>Individuals randomized to receive an individually tailored exercise program will meet with an exercise specialist. Written instructions, videos of each strengthening exercise, a blue tooth enable heart rate monitor, all necessary exercise equipment, and an iPad pre-loaded with heart rate monitor software, exercise videos and ZOOM app (for video conferencing) will be provided. After returning home, the exercise specialist will supervise and provide guidance to the individual via the ZOOM app during the first 2 weeks (3 sessions per week). Supervision will slowly decrease to twice a week in weeks 3-4, once a week in weeks 5-8, every other week in weeks 9-16, and to one time midway between weeks 17-20. The exercise program will be adjusted depending on the individuals progress.</description>
