      The research study will experimentally evaluate the impact of PBS on early adolescent&#xD;
      development through a randomized control trial involving 36 middle schools. The impact of PBS&#xD;
      on school staff discipline practices and student behavior will be evaluated. The study will&#xD;
      examine whether the likely reductions in negative behavior in school are accompanied by&#xD;
      reductions in peer harassment and victimization, peer rejection, deviant peer formation, and&#xD;
      the development of antisocial behavior, substance use, high risk sexual behavior, and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims for the project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effects of the PBS intervention in a group-randomized trial in which middle&#xD;
           schools are assigned to receive systematic training and consultation in the&#xD;
           implementation of PBS or a one-day workshop on PBS (the control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The PBS intervention group is expected to improve school behavior management&#xD;
                practices compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. School climate is expected to improve in the PBS intervention group compared to the&#xD;
                control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Problem behaviors and deviant peer group formation are expected to decrease for&#xD;
                students in the PBS intervention group compared to those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The development of problem behavior in later adolescence is expected to be lessened&#xD;
                for the PBS intervention students compared to those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The effects of the intervention will be assessed through staff, student, and observer&#xD;
           reports of discipline practices in schools. The investigators will assess changes in the&#xD;
           frequency of in-school problem behaviors as measured by student reports, office&#xD;
           discipline referrals, and out-of-school suspensions. Measures of student and teacher&#xD;
           perception of the quality of school climate will include student reports of harassment&#xD;
           and teacher reports of burnout. Formation of deviant peer groups will be assessed&#xD;
           through student reports of their peer affiliation. Finally, adolescents' development of&#xD;
           problems will be assessed over as many as five years through annual surveys of&#xD;
           antisocial behavior, substance use, high risk sexual behavior, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the differential impact of intervention fidelity on targeted outcomes. No&#xD;
           real-world implementation of a preventive intervention can be expected to be implemented&#xD;
           with perfect fidelity in every school. The study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Assess the degree of fidelity of implementation of all PBS intervention aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Examine the relationship of fidelity to changes in each of the targeted outcomes:&#xD;
                discipline practices, in-school problem behavior, peer relations, deviant peer&#xD;
                group formation, and adolescent problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Provide further information about the specific facets of PBS associated with&#xD;
                particular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To the extent that fidelity is related to outcome, above the simple relationship&#xD;
                between condition assignment and outcome, it will strengthen the investigators&#xD;
                confidence in the efficacy of PBS practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test a model of the influence of middle school discipline practices on the development&#xD;
           of adolescent problems. The model, which is specified in Figure 1 and the following&#xD;
           pages, posits that:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Inadequate behavior management practices in middle schools contribute to aggressive&#xD;
                and disruptive behavior among students in those schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Schools with high levels of aggression and harassment make the formation of deviant&#xD;
                peer groups more likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Escalating aggressive behavior, harassment, and deviant peer group formation then&#xD;
                contribute to the development of a range of problems in both school and non-school&#xD;
                settings including antisocial behavior, substance use, depression, and high risk&#xD;
                sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The model will be tested using state of the art hierarchical linear modeling (e.g.,&#xD;
           Singer &amp; Willett, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the maintenance of the PBS intervention after termination of training and&#xD;
           technical assistance. It is unlikely that effective behavior management will be&#xD;
           implemented and maintained, unless the school-as an organization-has adopted a system&#xD;
           that is supported by all staff and used in every setting (Gottfredson, Gottfredson &amp;&#xD;
           Czeh, 2000; Sprague, Walker, Golly et al., 2001). Research is needed, however, on the&#xD;
           extent to which the PBS system, once implemented is maintained. The present project will&#xD;
           provide evidence about the degree to which PBS is maintained and identify the school&#xD;
           characteristics that are associated with its maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the relationship of Office Discipline Referral data to adolescents' reports of&#xD;
           their engagement in diverse problems. Office Discipline Referrals (ODR) have been widely&#xD;
           used to evaluate PBS interventions. PBS typically produces substantial reductions in&#xD;
           ODR's (e.g., Metzler, Biglan, et al. 2001; Taylor-Green et al., 1997; Sprague, Walker,&#xD;
           Golly, White &amp; Myers, 2001). However, little is known about the relationship between the&#xD;
           ODR measure and other measures of adolescent problems (Irvin, Tobin, Sprague, Sugai, &amp;&#xD;
           Vincent, 2004). The proposed project will:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Assess the validity of the ODR by examining both the concurrent and longitudinal&#xD;
                relationships of the ODR with student self-report measures of problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Examine the significance of reductions in ODR's for PBS intervention schools and&#xD;
                students.&#xD;
