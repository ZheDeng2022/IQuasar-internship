  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to develop and test the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of&#xD;
      uTECH, a novel social media &quot;big data&quot; machine learning intervention for HIV-negative&#xD;
      substance using GBMSM that aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and&#xD;
      behavioral risk reduction strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV&#xD;
      prevention and medication assisted treatment (MAT) for substance use harm reduction&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project will occur in two phases. In Phase 1, we will conduct qualitative interviews with&#xD;
      gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (GBMSM) using an iterative user-centered design&#xD;
      process, which will result in a refined version of the uTECH intervention. In Phase 2, we&#xD;
      will conduct a comparative acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility trial with 330&#xD;
      individuals, who will be randomized to receive the uTECH intervention or an existing,&#xD;
      evidence-based motivational enhancement intervention for HIV risk and substance use&#xD;
      prevention (Young Men's Health Project). uTECH is innovative in that it includes both core&#xD;
      intervention modules and highly personalized intervention content based on participants'&#xD;
      social media use. The tailored intervention content can be delivered via text message or&#xD;
      Facebook messenger. This content relies on our previously developed machine learning&#xD;
      algorithm, which helps participants understand their technology-use behavior in relation to&#xD;
      HIV-risk and substance use.&#xD;

    <description>Drawing from work of Weiner et al (2017), we will rely on a psychometrically validated implementation science measure called &quot;Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)&quot; that will measure the perception among implementation stakeholders that a given treatment, service, practice, or innovation is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory. This measure is a 5-item scale with 5-point ordinal response that ranges from &quot;completely disagree&quot; to &quot;completely agree.&quot;</description>

    <description>Drawing from work of Weiner et al (2017), we will rely on a psychometrically validated implementation science measure called &quot;Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)&quot; that will measure the perceived fit, relevance, or compatibility of the innovation for a given consumer. This measure is a 4-item scale with 5-point ordinal response that ranges from &quot;completely disagree&quot; to &quot;completely agree.&quot;</description>

    <description>Drawing from work of Weiner et al (2017), we will rely on a psychometrically validated implementation science measure called &quot;Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM)&quot; that will measure the extent to which the intervention or innovation can be successfully used or carried out within this setting. This measure is a 4-item scale with 5-point ordinal response that ranges from &quot;completely disagree&quot; to &quot;completely agree.&quot;</description>
