  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Australia has one of the highest rates of methamphetamine use in the world; however, uptake&#xD;
      of face-to-face psychological treatment remains extremely low due to numerous individual&#xD;
      (e.g. stigma, shame) and structural (e.g. service availability, geography) barriers to&#xD;
      accessing care. Addressing these barriers through the provision of alternative treatment&#xD;
      delivery models is imperative, particularly as effective and earlier intervention is likely&#xD;
      to reduce the need for more costly and intensive treatment resulting from escalating&#xD;
      methamphetamine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators will conduct the first double-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining the effectiveness of the structured&#xD;
      telephone-delivered intervention, Ready2Change (R2C), among participants with methamphetamine&#xD;
      use problems (R2C-M). Cost effectiveness of R2C-M will also be investigated. Factors&#xD;
      influencing program implementation will be evaluated to inform the scalability of this&#xD;
      intervention for practice nationally, and for replication internationally.&#xD;

    <description>R2C-M telephone intervention - Six approximately weekly sessions of R2C-M telephone-delivered intervention (50 minutes in duration), delivered by the same R2C-M Counsellor each session (a qualified clinical psychologist trained in the R2C protocol by the developer, Dr Kate Hall). Call duration will be recorded. Sessions will be digitally recorded, and an independent researcher will randomly select and rate fidelity of intervention sessions for 20% of participants.&#xD;
R2C-M workbooks - Two workbooks to facilitate counsellor-delivered exercises within sessions, and between-session practice, will be mailed/emailed to participants.&#xD;
Self-help booklet - (as in control group) R2C-M participants will also receive a booklet of information and self-help strategies for methamphetamine use problems.</description>

    <description>Self-help booklet - Control participants will receive (by mail/email) a booklet of information and self-help strategies for methamphetamine use problems.&#xD;
Telephone check-ins + information on further support - (to control for frequency of contact across treatment arms) Participants in this group will receive 6 telephone calls from the research team (lasting maximum 5 minutes, call duration will be recorded). During these calls, participants will be asked about their use of the booklet. Whenever required, the researcher will provide participants with information on further support (e.g. DirectLine or other state/territory AOD helpline for advice or referral).</description>
