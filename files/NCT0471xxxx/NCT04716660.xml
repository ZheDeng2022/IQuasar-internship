  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is widely used for managing pain during labor. The programmed intermittent&#xD;
      epidural bolus (PIEB) technique has been shown to produce less consumption of local&#xD;
      anesthetics, better sensory block, less motor block, and increased maternal satisfaction than&#xD;
      other epidural analgesia techniques. Despite all benefits from PIEB, such practice has been&#xD;
      associated with high sensory block levels. Therefore, assessment of the sensory block level&#xD;
      is an essential component of clinical safety. The lack of a standardized technique and timing&#xD;
      to assess the sensory block level can lead to inappropriate management. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the changes in block level over time, during cycles of a PIEB&#xD;
      regimen. The investigators hypothesize that these levels will be highest soon after the PIEB&#xD;
      bolus and lowest preceding the subsequent PIEB bolus. The investigators also want to&#xD;
      investigate a possible correlation between these changes in sensory block levels and motor&#xD;
      block, pain scores, and rescue bolus of local anesthetics.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Lower sensory block level over time</measure>
    <time_frame>20 to 160 minutes post-loading dose</time_frame>
    <description>The lower sensory block level to ice, defined as the dermatome at which there is a complete loss of cold perception. This will be measured at 20, 60, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, and 160 minutes post-loading dose of epidural medication.</description>

    <measure>Change in Upper sensory block level over time</measure>
    <time_frame>20 to 160 minutes post-loading dose</time_frame>
    <description>The upper sensory block level to ice is defined as the dermatome at which there is an altered cold perception without complete sensitivity loss. This will be measured at 20, 60, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, and 160 minutes post-loading dose of epidural medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor block score using Bromage score</measure>
    <time_frame>20 to 160 minutes post-loading dose</time_frame>
    <description>Motor block will be assessed with the Bromage score: 0 = able to raise the extended leg; 1 = unable to raise the extended leg but able to flex knees; 2 = unable to flex knees, but able to flex ankle; 3 = unable to flex ankle. This will be measured at 20, 60, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, and 160 minutes post-loading dose of epidural medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>20 to 160 minutes post-loading dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain score using verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) (0-10, where 0=no pain and 10=worst pain ever). This will be measured at 20, 60, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, and 160 minutes post-loading dose of epidural medication.</description>
