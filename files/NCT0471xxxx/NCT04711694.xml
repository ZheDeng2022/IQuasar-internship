      The Mindfulteen Study is a 3-year long longitudinal cohort study with a nested randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, integrating neuroimaging, biological and clinical outcomes, and designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on young adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young adolescents between 13 and 15 years with no history of current mental health disorder&#xD;
      (with the exception for anxiety symptoms) or of psychotherapy are included and randomized to&#xD;
      either early or late intervention (i.e. waiting list or control group), after being&#xD;
      stratified between low or high anxiety group based on State and Trait Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      (STAI-T) score. Participants on the control group participate on MBI after completing the&#xD;
      second assessment. The intervention is an 8-week long MBI adapted to adolescents. Primary&#xD;
      outcomes are based on neuroimaging (structural and functional MRI) and secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      clinical (self-reported questionnaires covering mostly emotion and stress reactivity and&#xD;
      trait mindfulness) and biological (cortisol, inflammation markers and redox markers).&#xD;
      Assessments are performed at baseline, immediately after intervention or waiting time and&#xD;
      after 18 months of intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Promotion of mental health is a major concern worldwide, particularly among young population&#xD;
      as major psychiatric diseases can have their onset during adolescence and young adulthood.&#xD;
      During adolescence, there is growing evidence that &quot;at-risk&quot; states for mental disorders, as&#xD;
      high stress reactivity for example, can be identified prior to clinical symptoms, and that&#xD;
      early interventions can have a major impact preventing the further development of full-blown&#xD;
      mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last two decades, given a growing interest for non-pharmacological approaches to&#xD;
      improve mental and physical health, mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have received&#xD;
      serious attention. After the initial applications on chronic pain, stress reduction and&#xD;
      prevention of depressive relapses, MBIs are now widely implemented among clinical and&#xD;
      non-clinical populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, investigators aim to better understand the modifications of brain circuits&#xD;
      involved in the emergence of stress related disorders and the impact of a MBI on those&#xD;
      circuits. Hence, a translational project was designed, integrating neuroimaging, biological&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes of stress reactivity to evaluate the impact of a MBI on adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mindfulteen Study is a 3-year longitudinal cohort study with a nested randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. The randomized controlled trial part of the study was designed to assess&#xD;
      the clinical effect of MBI on adolescents, comparing to a control group. Therefore, after&#xD;
      inclusion participants are electronically randomized between either early intervention group&#xD;
      or late intervention group (i.e., waiting list or control group). Participants allocated in&#xD;
      the late intervention group engage in MBI after the waiting period, providing data also for&#xD;
      the longitudinal cohort part of the study and therefore increasing the data available for&#xD;
      before and after comparison. The long-term effect of MBI will be assessed after 18 months of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomization, participants are stratified according to their score on the trait&#xD;
      questionnaire of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) as low anxiety group (â‰¤ 31) or high&#xD;
      anxiety group (&gt;31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments are performed before intervention, immediately after intervention or waiting&#xD;
      period and in 18 months. For the late intervention group, an additional assessment is&#xD;
      performed immediately after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the Mindfulteen Study is to assess the immediate and long-term&#xD;
      effect of an MBI on reactivity to stress and anxiety, in a non-clinical sample of young&#xD;
      adolescents from the general population. Underlying psychological and biological changes are&#xD;
      assessed using a multimodal brain MRI protocol, blood and hair sampling, as well as&#xD;
      physiological measurements of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to characterize brain functional modifications in cortico-limbic and&#xD;
      cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits (functional MRI data) and their underlying neuroanatomical&#xD;
      changes (analysis of structural, spectroscopy and diffusion MRI data) in adolescents exposed&#xD;
      to MBI, comparing adolescents with high anxiety and low anxiety levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include the effects of MBI on self-reported levels of anxiety, emotion&#xD;
      regulation strategies (clinical scores) and physiological markers of&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (hair cortisol), as well as biological markers of&#xD;
      oxidative stress and inflammation (blood sampling).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants cannot be blinded to MBI time (early vs late). Outcome assessors are blind to intervention group. One of the two mindfulness instructors is not blind, as she works as clinical research coordinator. However, MBI are always held by both instructors together and the groups are mixed between early and late intervention allocated participants, diminishing the impact of the lack of blinding of one instructor.</masking_description>

    <description>The proposed MBI is an adaptation from the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) programs to youth. This MBI consists of a total of twelve 90 minutes long sessions, the first 8 being the intervention per se and the last 4 a proposition to the transition to regular practice and a chance to better integrate mindfulness in daily life.&#xD;
A theme regarding mindfulness is addressed in each session, through meditation practices and exercises. Between sessions, participants are invited to practice at home, using an application designed for this study (the MindApp), where participants can find the recorded practices. Investigators have access to participants' use of the meditation recordings and expect that these data will provide a more objective measure of the amount of home practice.</description>
