  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery is an alternative to open surgical techniques for reasons such as less&#xD;
      blood loss,less need for transfusion, shorter discharge time. In laparoscopic cases, various&#xD;
      positions are given to patients, especially trendelenburg, in order to remove organs and see&#xD;
      the area of the operation more easily. The Trendelenburg position causes cerebrovascular&#xD;
      changes.Several studies have reported an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP)at the&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position. There are also studies that show brain tissue oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SctO2) decreases in this position. Research has reported that cerebral perfusion pressure&#xD;
      decreases if the position lasts longer.When pneumoperitonium is administered during&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery, cerebral blood flow may increase as a result of the increase in&#xD;
      PaCO2.Brain tissue oxygen saturation depends on blood flow.There is also an inverse ratio&#xD;
      between end tidal CO2. To prevent deterioration of cerebral function, methods are needed that&#xD;
      determine the onset of desaturation and make early intervention possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method,known as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), offers a fixed non-invasive and safe&#xD;
      method of determining cerebral desaturation.In addition, NIRS has the potential to improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes, reduce postoperative complications and duration of post-anesthesia&#xD;
      care.Changes in NIRS measurement values associated with position, especially today, are seen&#xD;
      in cerebral perfusion in patients undergoing major surgery, oxygenation and postop have been&#xD;
      associated with cognitive dysfunction in the process.Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is&#xD;
      associated with increased mortality and therefore it is very important to identify factors&#xD;
      that increase risk in order to take appropriate protective measures.Intracerebral ischemia&#xD;
      and desaturation may be responsible for the development of POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to observe NIRS changes due to Trendelenburg position and&#xD;
      pneumoperitonium in patients undergoing laparoscopic major abdominal oncological surgery and&#xD;
      to examine the effect of POCD on early stage.&#xD;

      In Saglık Bilimleri University, Ankara A.Y. Oncology Research and Trainnee Hospital,&#xD;
      Anesthesiology and reanimation clinic,patients who are scheduled for elective laparoscopic&#xD;
      major abdominal surgery after the approval of the Ethics Committee will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. From the beginning of the study, successive patients were included in the study.&#xD;
      Measurement values were taken and recorded using the NIRS device in our clinic throughout the&#xD;
      case in patients 18 years of age and older. All patients were evaluated with MMSE in&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative period. According to power analysis using mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation to determine the sample size of the patients to be taken in this process, at least&#xD;
      52 patients were planned to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoperative MMSE testing, ASA scores, comorbidities,demographic data, drugs used in&#xD;
      anesthesia, vasopressor use, pneumoperitonium pressures and duration, angle and duration of&#xD;
      trendelenburg position, and vital parameters were recorded with NIRS device in our clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMSE test was re-administered to all patients in the first week of postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with preoperative MMSE score (M0) 24/30 points and above; postoperative 7th day (M1)&#xD;
      was re-evaluated and those with a fall of 4 points and more in M1 score than M0 score were&#xD;
      assessed as POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS measurements were taken perioperative and their correlation with POCD was looked at.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 years and older,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preoperative 24 points and above on MMSE test(M0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparoscopic major abdominal oncological surgery planned patients who will receive&#xD;
           general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with a history of cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage,&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Those with a score of 23 and below on the MMSE test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those with a history of Carotid Endarterectomy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have undergone aneurysm surgery,&#xD;
&#xD;
