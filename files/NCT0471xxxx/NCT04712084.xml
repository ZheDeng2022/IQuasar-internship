  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anaesthesia is known to promote lung collapse (atelectasis) which will persist in the&#xD;
      postoperative period. Inflating the lung to a pressure of 40 cmH2O, called a vital capacity&#xD;
      manoeuvre (VCM), performed a few minutes before extubation followed by the use of 40% of O2&#xD;
      will prevent postoperative atelectasis formation. This is not the case if VCM is followed by&#xD;
      application of 100% of O2. However the use of 100% of O2 before tracheal extubation is still&#xD;
      recommended for safety reason. Application of PEEP associated with pressure controlled&#xD;
      ventilation before intubation prevents atelectasis formation despite the use of 100% of O2.&#xD;
      The goal of our study was to show that performing a VCM 15 minutes before arousal followed by&#xD;
      application of PEEP and pressure support ventilation (PSV) before and after tracheal&#xD;
      extubation will prevent the recurrence of atelectasis despite the use of 100% of O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods With the ethic committee for research on human beings approval, the&#xD;
      investigators randomly assigned 16 non-obese patients scheduled for a gynaecological&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery in two groups. At the end of the surgery the investigators performed a&#xD;
      VCM (40cmH2O applied for 12 seconds), then O2 was increased to 100% in both groups. In the&#xD;
      patients of the study group, a PEEP of 6 cmH2O was applied associated with a PSV of 8 cmH2O.&#xD;
      This was continued after the extubation for 3 minutes. The O2 was then decreased to 40% and,&#xD;
      when the expired oxygen saturation was &lt; 50%, PEEP and PSV were removed. For the patients in&#xD;
      the control group, no positive pressure was applied during spontaneous ventilation (PEEP = 0&#xD;
      and no PSV). The atelectasis were then measured by computed tomographic scanning.&#xD;

      This is a prospective double-blinded study with prior informed written consent obtained from&#xD;
      all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Patients aged 18 to 65 years, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA)&#xD;
      physical status classification I to III, undergoing gynaecological laparoscopic surgery under&#xD;
      general anaesthesia were included in this prospective, randomised, double-blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were severe pulmonary disease, body mass index (BMI) more than 30 kg /m2&#xD;
      or less than 17, pregnancy or any other disease for which hypoxemia could be harmful. If the&#xD;
      delay between extubation and the computed tomography (CT) scan was over 20 minutes, patients&#xD;
      were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatments No premedication was given. General anaesthesia was standardized for all&#xD;
      patients. Standard monitoring was applied. General anaesthesia was induced intravenously with&#xD;
      fentanyl 1 to 2 μg/kg, propofol 2 to 3 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. The airways were&#xD;
      secured by endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desflurane was used for maintenance at 1 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) in 40% oxygen&#xD;
      and air. Additional rocuronium was injected in order to maintain a train-of-four ratio (TOF&#xD;
      ratio) between 0 and 1/4. Supplemental fentanyl was administered in order to maintain blood&#xD;
      pressure and/or heart rate values within a range of 20% compared to baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ventilation, the investigators used pressure controlled mode with tidal volume guaranteed&#xD;
      (pressure controlled - guaranteed volume, General Electrics Datex-Ohmeda Aisys®). The&#xD;
      settings of ventilation were, tidal volume 6-8 ml/kg (ideal body weight), frequency 10 - 20&#xD;
      per min. (expired CO2 5.3 - 5.8 kPa), PEEP of 6 cmH2O and I:E ratio 1:2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen minutes before the end of the surgery, a VCM (40cmH2O applied for 12 seconds) was&#xD;
      performed, then O2 was increased to 100% in both groups. Sugamadex (4 mg/kg if TOF &lt;2/4, 2&#xD;
      mg/kg if TOF &gt;2/4) was administered in order to reverse neuromuscular block. General&#xD;
      anaesthesia was continued until TOF ratio &gt; 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed when spontaneous ventilation resumed. In the study group,&#xD;
      inspiratory support of 8 cmH2O was applied associated with PEEP at 6 cmH2O. After extubation,&#xD;
      same support was applied by facemask for 3 minutes. O2 was then decreased to 40% and, when&#xD;
      the expired oxygen fraction was &lt; 50%, PEEP and PSV were switched off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, no positive pressure and no PEEP were applied during spontaneous&#xD;
      ventilation and 100% of O2 was applied for 3 minutes after extubation with a facemask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were then transported to the CT scan breathing 40% of O2 via a facemask. The&#xD;
      peripheral oxygen saturation was continuously monitored by pulse oximetry. Postoperative pain&#xD;
      management consisted of the residual effect of intraoperative fentanyl and paracetamol if&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Whole lung CT scan with a special low doses protocol was obtained at&#xD;
      end-expiratory position (at functional residual capacity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement was performed for all the lung and the lungs were also divided in 3 zones (upper,&#xD;
      middle and lower). Each right and left lung surfaces were extracted and a window setting of&#xD;
      -1000 to +100 Hounsfield Units (HU) was selected to assess the total lung surface. A&#xD;
      threshold of -1000 to -500 HU was applied to quantify the amount of normally ventilated lung,&#xD;
      a second threshold of -500 to -100 HU was chosen to establish the surface of poorly&#xD;
      ventilated lung, and a third threshold of -100 to +100 HU was set to measure the surface of&#xD;
      atelectatic lung area. The right and left lungs surface were summed and reported to the total&#xD;
      lung surface(18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcome The primary outcome was diminution of atelectatic and poorly ventilated lung&#xD;
      volume in the study group compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Values are expressed as mean +/- SD. Baseline results and atelectatic&#xD;
      surface were compared by a one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables and with X2&#xD;
      for discrete variables. P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
