  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study extends the study team's earlier efforts described in ClinicalTrail ID#:&#xD;
      NCT04070287 and NCT03874663. The I-TEST (Innovative Tools to Expand Youth-friendly HIV&#xD;
      Self-Testing) study known locally as the 4 Youth by Youth project, sought to develop and&#xD;
      evaluate novel youth-friendly HIVST services in Nigeria using open challenges and&#xD;
      apprenticeship training informed by a participatory learning collaborative model. The study&#xD;
      thus aims to reach young Nigerians that remain undiagnosed for HIV and to facilitate linkage&#xD;
      and retention in preventive services (includes STI testing/treatment, PrEP referral, condom&#xD;
      use).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the completion of the open contests and apprenticeship training, four youth teams&#xD;
      (with four distinct interventions) were selected to undergo a one-year pilot assessment in&#xD;
      the community. Preliminary findings from the feasibility study suggest that the&#xD;
      youth-developed interventions have the potential to impact HIV testing as well as uptake of&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing among young people in Nigeria. As a result, the&#xD;
      investigators identified key components from the four interventions to form a single&#xD;
      intervention that will be evaluated in the next phase of the research. Thus, the current&#xD;
      protocol is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of a combined, youth-developed&#xD;
      intervention on HIV testing and other HIV prevention outcomes (i.e. condom use, PrEP&#xD;
      referral, STI testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design, the I-TEST intervention&#xD;
      package will be implemented sequentially across 30 local government areas (LGA) whereby each&#xD;
      LGA will be exposed to a pre-intervention (control), intervention (implementing the&#xD;
      intervention), and post-intervention condition, according to a randomized schedule. Young&#xD;
      people between the ages of 14-24 years will be recruited from the selected 30 local&#xD;
      government areas through in-person events, social media platforms, and online advertisements,&#xD;
      clinics, and community centers that cater to young people. Upon enrollment, the study team&#xD;
      will collect baseline data on HIV testing history, sexual behavior history, youth&#xD;
      participation experience, and other related outcomes from the study participants. Two trained&#xD;
      youth alongside one trained supervisor will implement the I-TEST intervention at the LGAs.&#xD;

    <description>A 12-item scale on youth engagement will be used to assess the HIV prevention services proposed by the youth teams. The scale was adapted from the 20-item Tiffany-Eckenrode Program Participation Scale (TEPPS). Responses to the participation items were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from &quot;strongly disagree (0)&quot; to &quot;Strongly agree (4)&quot;. Higher TEPPS scores indicate higher levels of program participation. The item is only included in the follow-up survey.</description>
