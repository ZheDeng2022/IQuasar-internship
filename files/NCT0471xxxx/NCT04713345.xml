  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After hospitalization in Intensive Care (Intensive Care Unit or Continuing Care Unit),&#xD;
      approximately 50% of patients usually present with intensive ICU-weakness, i.e. damage to the&#xD;
      nerves and muscles secondary to immobilization and to the treatments that must have been&#xD;
      used. This condition will delay the resumption of walking in these patients, their discharge&#xD;
      from hospital and impair their autonomy in the daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent international literature is in favor of early rehabilitative management of these&#xD;
      patients, which should ideally be started in the intensive care unit. However, this is not&#xD;
      always possible, due to the possible lack of physiotherapists in the services on the one&#xD;
      hand, due to the fatigue of the population concerned and the existence of unstable medical&#xD;
      conditions which do not always allow the use of recommended rehabilitation techniques on the&#xD;
      other hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Reality (VR) environments are widely used for the assessment and rehabilitation of&#xD;
      patients with neurological pathology. VR allows the user to be active in simulated activities&#xD;
      and offers many advantages for the rehabilitation of motor functions in patients with&#xD;
      neurological diseases. VR tools used to create action observation, motor imagery and&#xD;
      sensations or even the illusion of movement in particular, have already shown their&#xD;
      effectiveness in recovering and improving walking in different populations, especially after&#xD;
      a stroke, in patients with Parkinson's Disease or Multiple Sclerosis. The role of the&#xD;
      embodiment in VR appears promising in immersing participants in a controlled environment and&#xD;
      creating movement's illusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Virtual Reality tool designed consists of virtual environments presented using a Virtual&#xD;
      Reality headset where an avatar (double) of the hospitalized patient will be represented, who&#xD;
      will perform a walking motor task (involving his lower limbs ) in several different virtual&#xD;
      environments (sets). In the present study named VERARE_2, the patient will be asked to&#xD;
      observe walking actions and imagine performing them as they will be performed by the avatar&#xD;
      in the virtual environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This VERARE_2 protocol aims to assess the effectiveness of the Observation of Virtual Motor&#xD;
      Actions on the speed of gait recovery in hospitalized patients with IUC-weakness and in the&#xD;
      intensive care units and continuing care units of the Rennes University Hospital.&#xD;

    <description>Balance assessment before the start of the first session, the day after the last session and 1 month from inclusion: Berg Balance Scale Berg's Balance Rating Scale consists of 14 tests that assess static and dynamic balance.&#xD;
Static balance (standing without movement of the feet) is measured by the following tasks:&#xD;
Feet glued together Unipodal support Tandem (one foot in front of the other) Eyes closed Trunk rotation&#xD;
Dynamic balance is measured by the following tasks:&#xD;
360ยบ swivel Pick up an object Get up and sit down Seated transfer from one chair to another&#xD;
All items except one are performed standing. They are rated on a 5-point ordinal scale (0-4) based on the ability to perform the movement or task independently, and criteria of time and distance. The total score varies between 0 and 56 points; a high score corresponds to a better balance [3, 4]. A score of 0 to 20 is associated with disturbed balance, 21 to 40 for acceptable balance and 41 to 56 for good balance.</description>
