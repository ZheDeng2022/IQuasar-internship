      Introduction: Regular practice of exercise or physical activity (PA) is a recognized&#xD;
      intervention as a determinant of good health acquisition, maintenance, or recovery for a&#xD;
      large number of chronic pathologies. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated adherence to an&#xD;
      initial health-adapted PA (APA) program, and persistence of active behavior over the time in&#xD;
      individuals with a chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the brakes and levers associated with motivation and&#xD;
      long-term compliance. In addition, the investigators aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of such program in term of care consumption. Finally, the investigators complete their&#xD;
      interest for APA prescription from practitioners agreeing to enroll their patients in the&#xD;
      present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The investigators perform a prospective monocentric cohort, of 2024 patients affected&#xD;
      of a chronic disease or long-term illness (LTI), enrolled from 2021 to 2024 (4 years, 506 per&#xD;
      year), for a 16-week APA program, and followed 5 years with an annual fitness and habits of&#xD;
      life and care consumption evaluation.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While physical inactivity is the first modifiable risk factor (2nd is tobacco consumption)&#xD;
      for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and cancer in the World, regular physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) is a recognized intervention with a high level of evidence, as a key determinant of good&#xD;
      health acquisition, maintenance, or recovery for a large number of chronic pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following 3 points caught the investigators' interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point n°1: The 2019 collective expertise of the French National Institute of Health and&#xD;
      Medical Research (INSERM) &quot;Physical Activity: Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases&quot;&#xD;
      reported following findings on the motivational aspects of regular or non-regular PA practice&#xD;
      by people suffering from a chronic disease: 1) people with chronic disease practice less than&#xD;
      the general population of the same age; 2) a significant number of patients do not&#xD;
      participate in the proposed PA programs, and high drop-out rates are reported during these&#xD;
      programs; 3) only a small percentage of patients maintain PA after completion of these&#xD;
      programs. However, there is a lack of evidence and inconsistent quality studies regarding&#xD;
      changes in duration of behavior following PA intervention programs. Follow-up of behavioral&#xD;
      changes beyond 2 years is extremely rare in the literature. Thus, the problem is of a&#xD;
      behavioral nature: on one hand, whether or not a person with a chronic disease adheres to an&#xD;
      initial health-adapted PA program (APA), and on the other hand, whether or not a PA practice&#xD;
      persists or is maintained over time. The identification of barriers and levers is key to help&#xD;
      define actionable means to support adherence and enhance the sustainability of the virtuous&#xD;
      behavior change induced by an initial program. This need for studies is underlined by &quot;The&#xD;
      group of experts [from INSERM, which] recommends: 1) long-term intervention studies with&#xD;
      supervised exercises and 2) long-term post-intervention follow-up in order to better evaluate&#xD;
      the continuation of program practice in autonomy&quot;, but also &quot;to promote research on&#xD;
      motivation and long-term compliance&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point n°2: In relation to the benefit of PA programs on the physical and psycho-social&#xD;
      fitness of individuals, the effects on health are demonstrated. As a result, a decrease in&#xD;
      the prevalence of health events and their complications can be observed, as well as a more&#xD;
      detailed use of care (drug treatment, consultations, and hospitalizations) depending on&#xD;
      whether or not the participant benefits from an APA intervention. The medico-economic impact&#xD;
      of such APA intervention has been little studied. Thus, the problem is of a medico-economic&#xD;
      nature: the interest will initially focus on the evolution of care pathways over time, and&#xD;
      the differences observed according to pathologies, but also according to the participants'&#xD;
      behavior, in terms of compliance, or persistence or not in the duration of the favorable&#xD;
      change in behavior initially acquired. An evaluation of care consumption and care pathways&#xD;
      according to whether individuals have benefited from an APA program as proposed (SESAME&#xD;
      cohort) or not (controls) also appears justified and will come later. This need for studies&#xD;
      is emphasized by the INSERM expert group, which recommends &quot;evaluating the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of interventions according to the technique(s) used&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point n°3: While the attending physician can prescribe an APA program to his patients with a&#xD;
      chronic disease through a list of 30 long-term illness (LTI), (Article L. 1172-1 of the&#xD;
      French Public Health Code and Decree N° 2016-1990 of December 30, 2016), the practitioner is&#xD;
      confronted on the one hand with chronic pathologies outside of LTI list for which APA&#xD;
      provides a demonstrated benefit (arterial hypertension (HTN), obesity, chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD)), and on the other hand with a lack of experience in this&#xD;
      non-medicinal prescription. Thus, the problem is of an operational practical nature in the&#xD;
      prescription of APA, with a need for collection and analysis of the brakes and levers that&#xD;
      can be applied to the prescription of APA, and for training and coordination of medical&#xD;
      actors with APA professional. This need is underlined by the INSERM expert group, which&#xD;
      recommends &quot;the development of exchanges and joint reflection between the different&#xD;
      professions involved in favor of the practice of APA.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of all these elements, the SESAME project consists in the prospective constitution of&#xD;
      a cohort of people affected by a chronic pathology and enrolled in a 16-week individualized,&#xD;
      educational and structured APA program, with a 5-year follow-up, providing support for an&#xD;
      observational study whose main objective is the behavioral analysis of the brakes and levers&#xD;
      associated with the persistence over time of a favorable change in behavior induced by an&#xD;
      initial APA program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are: 1) an analysis of the effects of the program on the physical and&#xD;
      psychological fitness parameters; 2) a behavioral analysis of the brakes and levers&#xD;
      associated with good adherence to the initial APA program; 3) a medico-economic analysis: a)&#xD;
      volume-based care consumption analysis: monitoring the evolution of the participants' care&#xD;
      pathway and care consumption over time; b) cost analysis: expressing care consumption in&#xD;
      monetary units; c) budget impact analysis: estimating the difference in costs between the&#xD;
      &quot;APA strategy&quot; for SESAME participants and the &quot;usual care strategy&quot; of members of the French&#xD;
      health insurance &quot;Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale&quot; (MGEN) with comparable&#xD;
      characteristics in terms of age and gender and belonging to the following subgroups; 4) an&#xD;
      analysis of the practice of prescribing APA among physicians, and their brakes and levers for&#xD;
      such a prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective and consecutive constitution of a monocentric cohort, for the behavioral and&#xD;
      medico-economic analysis of the effects of a non-medicinal intervention by the APA (qualified&#xD;
      as a research involving the human person type 2 &quot;RIPH 2&quot; within the meaning of article L.&#xD;
      1121-1 of the French Public Health Code).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the inclusion period: 4 years Duration of follow-up for the participant: 5 years&#xD;
      Number of visits for participant: 7 (Inclusion; end of 48 sessions of APA program over 16&#xD;
      weeks (maximum 9 months from start); at 1 year; 2 years; 3 years; 4 years and 5 years) Number&#xD;
      of participants: 2024 (506 per year) Due to the lack of behavioral studies in population of&#xD;
      individuals with a chronic condition for which the benefit of APA has been demonstrated, the&#xD;
      number of subjects required cannot be calculated. Given the experience of a 1st pilot cohort&#xD;
      of 600 people with chronic pathologies (including obesity) treated with support from the&#xD;
      Regional Health Agency (ARS) Île-de-France in 2014-2016, a number of 2024 people for the&#xD;
      constitution of the SESAME cohort is feasible, with a recruitment of 506 participants per&#xD;
      year for 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be recruited consecutively according to the terms of the French Law&#xD;
      (Decree n°2016-19990 of 30 Dec 2016, entered into application on 01 March 2017) relating to&#xD;
      the conditions of dispensation of APA prescribed by the attending physician to patients&#xD;
      suffering from LTI. For the study, the pathology criteria are extended to chronic pathologies&#xD;
      outside 30-LTI list for which the benefit of APA has been demonstrated with a high level of&#xD;
      evidence (grade A) including, among others, obesity, HTN, COPD, as well as to the sequelae of&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the context of&#xD;
      coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). According to the prescription of his doctor, the patient&#xD;
      will go to &quot;Mon Stade&quot; Sport Medicine Center, and will benefit from inclusion in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements, collections, health examinations and follow-up of the participants will be&#xD;
      carried out by the personnel of &quot;Mon Stade&quot; (doctors and physical preparers/teachers in APA,&#xD;
      APA master trainees and doctoral students, administrative or paramedical agents) according to&#xD;
      their fields of competence and prerogatives. They will receive a specific training on how to&#xD;
      pass questionnaires and tests in order to standardize data collection and to know the course&#xD;
      of care for these evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The APA program has been established according to a standardized, homogenous, shared and&#xD;
      coordinated practice protocol by all the operators, for each stage of the course: inclusion&#xD;
      of the participant, initial evaluation, design, supervision and monitoring of the training&#xD;
      plan, and final evaluation. The 16-week program consists of 3 sessions per week, including 2&#xD;
      supervised sessions with individualized educational follow-up by a physical trainer (MSc&#xD;
      Sport Sciences, specialized in APA) at &quot;Mon Stade&quot;, and 1 session in autonomy (can be done at&#xD;
      home). Each session includes: a warm-up phase with articular and muscular awakening carried&#xD;
      out autonomously; a 1-hour session bodywork combining 25 minutes of interval aerobic&#xD;
      exercises (split type) and 25 minutes of neuromuscular reinforcement in circuit. The&#xD;
      intensities and modalities of the exercises will have been personalized according to the&#xD;
      results of the initial fitness assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the behavioral analysis, the characteristics of physical and mental condition,&#xD;
      quality of life and behavior will be observed as a function of time, and compared according&#xD;
      to the following subgroups: 1) General characteristics: gender, age group, body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), socioeconomic category, childhood lifestyle habits, history of participation in an APA&#xD;
      program; 2) Chronic disease groups for inclusion: metabolic (obesity, diabetes);&#xD;
      cardiovascular-renal (HTN, coronary artery disease, heart failure, arteritis, stroke, kidney&#xD;
      disease); respiratory (COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis); oncological (solid and non-solid&#xD;
      neoplasia); neurological (epilepsy, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's); psychiatric (depressive&#xD;
      syndrome, bipolarity, schizophrenia); osteoarticular (chronic low back pain, chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory rheumatism, arthritis, osteoporosis); infectious (human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV), viral hepatitis C, SARS-CoV-2); 3) Observer&quot; vs. &quot;non-observer&quot; status in the initial&#xD;
      APA program, with collection of data on program attendance, the number of sessions carried&#xD;
      out in a supervised manner at &quot;Mon Stade&quot; or independently (declarative), the actual duration&#xD;
      of the program, and the reasons for its possible interruption (&quot;Observers&quot; = ≥90% completion&#xD;
      of the 2 weekly supervised sessions of the initial APA program over a period of 4 to 9&#xD;
      months); 4) &quot;Persistent&quot; vs. &quot;Non-persistent&quot; status at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years regarding the&#xD;
      favorable behavior change initially acquired (&quot;Persistent&quot; = participants with a positive&#xD;
      trajectory of the percentages of &quot;moderate to vigorous&quot; PA collected each year by wearing an&#xD;
      accelerometer over 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medico-economic analysis includes: 1) an analysis of care consumption by volume (consumption&#xD;
      and care pathway over time); comparison by subgroups of participants; 2) a cost analysis;&#xD;
      average cost by subgroups of participants compared to overall cost; 3) a budget impact&#xD;
      analysis by estimating the difference in costs between SESAME participants and MGEN members&#xD;
      with comparable age and gender characteristics who follow the usual care strategy among LTI,&#xD;
      hypertensive, and obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of APA prescribing practice includes: 1) a phase of identification of potential&#xD;
      prescribing practitioners from Parisian centers likely to refer patients; 2) an analysis of&#xD;
      the general characteristics of practitioners, as well as their PA level by questionnaire; 3)&#xD;
      an analysis of their barriers and levers to the practice of PA; 4) an analysis of their&#xD;
      barriers and levers to the prescription of APA with a questionnaire dedicated to this&#xD;
      objective; 5) the participatory development of the prescription and patient follow-up tools.&#xD;
