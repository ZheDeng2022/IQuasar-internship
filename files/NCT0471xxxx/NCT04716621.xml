  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is highly prevalent, compromises quality of life, and increases care&#xD;
      utilization. Primary care providers are challenged to provide effective treatments, use&#xD;
      opioid therapy appropriately, and address the adverse consequences of pain.&#xD;
      Technology-enabled decision support tools may provide a means to improve pain management in&#xD;
      primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to evaluate a novel electronic health record (EHR)-based&#xD;
      decision support tool-plus-education intervention for pain management in primary care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, wait-list controlled trial evaluated a novel EHR-based system for pain&#xD;
      management among patients with chronic pain in six practices of a Federally Qualified Health&#xD;
      Center network in New York.&#xD;

    <description>The Pain Management Support System for Primary Care (PMSS-PC) generated &quot;best practice alerts&quot; and gave clinicians access to a pain assessment template, measures of psychological distress and substance use, guidelines for drug and non-drug therapies, and facilitated referrals. At implementation, clinicians at the practices were offered in-person and virtual education through six webinars on best practices for pain.</description>
