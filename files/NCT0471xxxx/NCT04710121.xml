    <textblock>
      The study was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study to determine the effect&#xD;
      of virtual reality glasses used during a colonoscopy on vital signs, pain, and anxiety level.&#xD;
      After the approval of the ethics committee and institutional permission, 60 patients who&#xD;
      applied to the endoscopy unit for colonoscopy procedure between 1 October 2020 and 1 October&#xD;
      2021 and met the inclusion criteria will be included in the study. Within the scope of the&#xD;
      planned study, the sample size in the light of the reported academic studies was determined&#xD;
      as effect size d = 0,665 (effect size), α = 0.05 (margin of error), 1-β = 0.80 (Power) and by&#xD;
      using the G-Power package program with the specified criteria. It was decided to recruit 58&#xD;
      people (29 people per group). The block randomization method will be used to determine the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups. In order for the groups to be distributed homogeneously, the&#xD;
      order produced by a computer program (https://www.randomizer.org/) will be used.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by a biostatistician outside the researcher. Patients who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study will be assigned to the experimental&#xD;
      and control groups according to the randomization list. Before the colonoscopy, the patient&#xD;
      will be visited and information will be given about the purpose, content, and intervention to&#xD;
      be applied. After obtaining verbal and written consent from the patients who accepted to&#xD;
      participate in the study, the &quot;Individual Characteristics Form&quot; will be filled. Then, before&#xD;
      the colonoscopy procedure, the anxiety states of the patients in the experimental and control&#xD;
      groups will be asked with the &quot;State and Trait Anxiety Inventory&quot;, their pain status with the&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS), and their first life findings will be measured and the first measurement&#xD;
      values will be recorded in the &quot;Vital Signs Follow-up Form&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the experimental group will be informed about the virtual glasses before the&#xD;
      colonoscopy procedure and the virtual reality glasses will be placed on the patient's head&#xD;
      during the procedure. Then, during the colonoscopy procedure, the duration of the colonoscopy&#xD;
      will vary between 3-10 minutes, and during the colonoscopy period, videos with music&#xD;
      background, parks, nature and seaside walks, underwater, etc., will be watched by the patient&#xD;
      and the &quot;Vital Signs Tracking Form&quot; The second measurement values will be saved by making&#xD;
      measurement to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the colonoscopy procedure is finished, &quot;Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&quot;, &quot;Life&#xD;
      Findings Follow-up Form&quot; (measurement will be made and 3rd measurement values will be&#xD;
      recorded. The &quot;State Anxiety Inventory&quot; will be read and the answers will be recorded. The&#xD;
      standard application will be applied to the patients in the control group during the&#xD;
      colonoscopy procedure and the second measurement values will be recorded by measuring the&#xD;
      &quot;Vital Signs Follow-up Form&quot;.Immediately after the colonoscopy procedure is completed, the&#xD;
      third measurement value will be recorded by measuring the &quot;Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Vital Signs Follow-up Form&quot;. &quot;State Anxiety Inventory&quot; will be read and the answers&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;

      The universe of the research; patients who are between October 1, 2020, and October 1, 2021,&#xD;
      in the endoscopy unit for colonoscopy procedure where the study will be conducted will&#xD;
      comprise the patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study.&#xD;
      The research was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study. The block&#xD;
      randomization method will be used to determine the experimental and control groups. In order&#xD;
      for the groups to be distributed homogeneously, the order produced by a computer program&#xD;
      (https://www.randomizer.org/) will be used. Randomization will be done by a biostatistician&#xD;
      outside the researcher. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be assigned to the experimental and control groups according to the&#xD;
      randomization list. Research data will be collected in a hospital's endoscopy unit between 1&#xD;
      October 2020 - 1 October 2021. The independent variable of the study is virtual reality&#xD;
      glasses. The dependent variables of the study are anxiety states, pain intensity, and vital&#xD;
      signs score average. In the research, &quot;Individual Characteristics Form&quot;, &quot;State and Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory&quot;, the Analog Scale (VAS), and &quot;Vital Signs Follow-up Form&quot; prepared by the&#xD;
      researcher in line with the literature will be used as data collection tools.&#xD;

    <description>Virtual Reality Glasses (VRG), one of the methods of distracting attention; widely used in clinical medical care to relieve symptoms by providing the opportunity to create therapeutic environments for the evaluation and treatment of medical conditions. Virtual reality is a computer simulation technique that enables individuals to hear and feel the sounds and corresponding stimuli accompanying the visual image through headphones. The most basic feature that distinguishes virtual reality (VR) glasses from similar applications is that it gives individuals a real feeling. VR has helped to distract patients from mental processing and reduce the amount of pain. Virtual reality glasses, which are inexpensive to apply and use, do not cause side effects, and can be used in the recovery of the individual, are an intervention that can be preferred in nursing practices.</description>
