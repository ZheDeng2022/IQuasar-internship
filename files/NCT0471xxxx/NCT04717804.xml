  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers plan to investigate two ways of visualizing and planning to account for the&#xD;
      respiratory motion which takes place while treating lung tumors with radiation therapy. The&#xD;
      researchers will determine if a traditional snapshot (free-breathing) CT or a longer-lasting&#xD;
      CT encompassing the breathing cycle better matches a patient's breathing during treatment.&#xD;

      As part of this study the patient will receive the standard of care treatment of Stereotactic&#xD;
      Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) approach for treatment of lung cancer. The study will compare&#xD;
      whether the quick snapshot or longer-last image is more representative of breathing motion.&#xD;
      The standard of care way to verify breathing is to use the Cone Beam Computerized Tomography&#xD;
      (CBCT) before each treatment. For this study the researchers will use two other standard of&#xD;
      care ways to verify breathing motion during treatment only during the first and last&#xD;
      radiation treatment sessions. During the other radiation treatment sessions the CBCT alone&#xD;
      will be used. These two other methods are FDA approved, but not routinely being used at the&#xD;
      Mays Cancer Center. One method is called 4D-CBCT and is conducted immediately prior to&#xD;
      treatment. This will create an image taken over a longer time of the patient's lungs which&#xD;
      will be compared with the images from the CT Simulation used to plan the radiation. The other&#xD;
      way is called Intrafractional CBCT and is imaging that is done at the same time as the&#xD;
      radiation treatment delivery. This will show the researchers how the tumor is moving while&#xD;
      the radiation treatment is taking place. These two methods require a longer treatment time,&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes during the first and last treatments.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed written consent in either English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cancer involving the lung (primary or secondary) planned to undergo lung&#xD;
             SBRT technique or IMRT technique with an SBRT setup in 10 or fewer fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy, as this is a contraindication to receiving radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients to be treated to multiple targets concurrently.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition or history as evidenced by patient record and/or self-report that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to the prescribed&#xD;
             pattern of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor lung function, as judged by the prescribing radiation oncologist, sufficiently&#xD;
             limiting to make the patient not a candidate for 4D imaging (for example major&#xD;
             differences between the 4D and free-breathing CT scan).&#xD;
