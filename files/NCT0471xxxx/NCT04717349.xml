      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gynecologic conditions are those that are related to the reproductive system. They can be&#xD;
      reproductive gland disorders or reproductive system tumors. They can also be inborn anomalies&#xD;
      of the reproductive tract. Researchers want to gather data over time from a large group of&#xD;
      young people with these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create a database about child and teenage gynecologic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of any age with known or suspected pediatric and adolescent gynecologic&#xD;
      conditions, and their adult family members&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood drawn using a needle. The blood will be used for genetic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have saliva collected. They will spit into a small plastic container. Or&#xD;
      their spit will be absorbed from their mouth using a small sponge. The saliva will be used&#xD;
      for genetic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have samples collected from their vagina. A small cotton swab will be used&#xD;
      to gather the samples. This procedure is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have a surgery related to their condition, a small tissue sample will be&#xD;
      taken. It will be stored for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may complete optional surveys. These surveys ask about their physical and&#xD;
      emotional health. They can choose not to answer any of the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will collect medical data from participants standard tests. Such tests may&#xD;
      include blood and urine tests, X-rays, nuclear medicine scans, and other tests. Data will&#xD;
      also be collected from standard treatments they may receive.&#xD;

      This data collection protocol is designed to allow data and specimen collection of&#xD;
      individuals with pediatric and adolescent gynecology (PAG) conditions such as: reproductive,&#xD;
      endocrine, gynecologic tumors and skin conditions, menstrual abnormalities and congenital&#xD;
      anomalies of the reproductive tract. Adults and children with pediatric and adolescent&#xD;
      gynecology-related condition(s) may be enrolled under this protocol to collect clinical data&#xD;
      and specimen for secondary review and analysis and to provide stimuli for new clinical&#xD;
      research initiatives.&#xD;
