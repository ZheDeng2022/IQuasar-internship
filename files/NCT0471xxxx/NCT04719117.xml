      In this study, the investigators proposed a prospective study about the effectiveness of&#xD;
      artificial intelligence system for Retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The subjects would be&#xD;
      include in an analyses groups. The AI-assisted system helps endoscopic physicians estimate&#xD;
      the difficulty of Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for choledocholithiasis and&#xD;
      make recommendations based on guidelines and difficulty scores. The investigators used the&#xD;
      stone removal times, success rate of stone extraction and Operating time to reflect the&#xD;
      difficulty of the operation, and evaluated whether the results of the AI system were correct.&#xD;

      Endoscopy is a routine and reliable method for the diagnosis of digestive tract&#xD;
      diseases.Common endoscopy are gastroscopy, colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy and enteroscopy,&#xD;
      ultrasonic gastroscopy, after ercp and other related technology, can be used in early gastric&#xD;
      cancer and peptic ulcer, esophageal varices, the stomach before lesion, intestinal polyps and&#xD;
      adenomas and colorectal lesions, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreas disease, biliary tract&#xD;
      disease diagnosis and follow-up.At present, digestive endoscopy almost covers the diagnosis&#xD;
      of the vast majority of diseases of the digestive tract, and diseases of the digestive system&#xD;
      that cannot be directly seen by endoscopy can also be realized through endoscopic-based&#xD;
      technologies such as endoscopy and ERCP (here the investigators collectively refer to&#xD;
      endoscopy), so as to achieve the coverage of the whole digestive system.It can be seen that&#xD;
      digestive endoscopy is of great significance for the diagnosis of digestive diseases and the&#xD;
      development of digestive field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the popularization of these related technologies, the number of endoscopy increased&#xD;
      rapidly, which further increased the workload of endoscopists. The operation of endoscopy by&#xD;
      high-load endoscopists would reduce the quality of endoscopy, which is prone to problems such&#xD;
      as incomplete examination coverage and incomplete detection of lesions.In digestive&#xD;
      endoscopy, there are some problems in China, such as lack of endoscopic physicians and uneven&#xD;
      distribution, and the quality of endoscopy is not up to standard. These problems need to be&#xD;
      solved urgently in order to relieve the pain of patients, save medical resources, save the&#xD;
      time and money of patients, and ensure the quality of patients' medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, the proposal of deep learning brought great changes to the field of artificial&#xD;
      intelligence, which made the development of artificial intelligence leap to a new&#xD;
      level.Computer vision is a science that studies how to make machines &quot;see&quot;. Through deep&#xD;
      learning, camera and computer can replace human eyes to carry out machine vision such as&#xD;
      target recognition, tracking and measurement.Interdisciplinary cooperation in the field of&#xD;
      medical imaging and computer vision is also one of the research hotspots in recent years. At&#xD;
      present, it is mainly applied to the automatic identification and detection of lesions and&#xD;
      quality control, and has achieved good results. It can assist doctors to find lesions, make&#xD;
      disease diagnosis and standardize doctors' operations, so as to improve the quality of&#xD;
      doctors' operations.With mature technical support, it has a good prospect and application&#xD;
      value to develop endoscopic operating system for lesion detection and quality control based&#xD;
      on artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators proposed a prospective study about the effectiveness of&#xD;
      artificial intelligence system for Retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The subjects would be&#xD;
      include in an analyses groups. The AI-assisted system helps endoscopic physicians estimate&#xD;
      the difficulty of Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for choledocholithiasis and&#xD;
      make recommendations based on guidelines and difficulty scores. The investigators used the&#xD;
      stone removal times, success rate of stone extraction and Operating time to reflect the&#xD;
      difficulty of the operation, and evaluated whether the results of the AI system were correct.&#xD;
