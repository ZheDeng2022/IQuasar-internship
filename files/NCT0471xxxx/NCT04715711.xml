  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BHSAI is developing a computational system that provides early alerts of a rise in core body&#xD;
      temperature to help reduce the risk of heat injury in the field and during training. The goal&#xD;
      of the body temperature alerting system is to use it during rest, exercise in the heat and&#xD;
      during body cooling. Using this system during cooling will allow healthcare professionals and&#xD;
      military personnel monitor core temperature to ensure cooling is effective (and prevent&#xD;
      hypothermia). Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation is to validate a body&#xD;
      temperature alerting system using physiological responses that occur during rest, exercise in&#xD;
      the heat and during body cooling. Multiple cooling modalities will be validated. This study&#xD;
      is expanding on a previous intervention IRB#H20-0010 (BHSAI Cooling Study), but will examine&#xD;
      body cooling during more intense exercise and while cycling. We will also examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of each cooling modality (passive cooling, mist-fan cooling, hand/forearm&#xD;
      immersion, ice towel) on physiological variables after exercise in the heat.&#xD;

      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed in the following timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vist 2: Metabolic Heat Production Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3-6: Trial 1, 2 ,3, 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit specific information is described below, however, specific data collection protocols&#xD;
      for dependent variables and procedures are included below the description of the study&#xD;
      design. Participants will be asked to sign a photo/video release form (Appendix H) to be used&#xD;
      in research projects, scientific publications/conferences and for educational purposes.&#xD;
      Participants may be videoed or photographed while exercising or resting in the environmental&#xD;
      chamber. Participants will be assigned after medical clearance is granted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are approved to participate will be scheduled for a baseline and VO2max&#xD;
      testing day. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) will be measured upon arrival during the baseline&#xD;
      visit. The participant will lay supine with a ventilated hood covering their head and torso.&#xD;
      The ventilated hood will be attached to a hose connected to a metabolic cart. The metabolic&#xD;
      cart will continuously measure respiratory exchange ratio, oxygen consumption, and substrate&#xD;
      utilization. The participant will remain under the hood for approximately 30 minutes. Upon&#xD;
      completion of BMR, participants will provide a urine sample in a clean urine cup. Urine&#xD;
      specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass will also be recorded.&#xD;
      Privacy will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by taking&#xD;
      measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door, and&#xD;
      the research reading the scale outside of the room. Participants will only be permitted to&#xD;
      continue to the VO2max test if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG)&#xD;
      ≤1.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject&#xD;
      will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. If USG is greater&#xD;
      than 1.025 the subject will be rescheduled for a different day. Height will be measured with&#xD;
      a tape measure on Visit 1. Percent body fat will be measured using Air displacement&#xD;
      plethysmography (BodPod®; Cosmed, Software Version 4.2+, Concord, CA, USA). This will take&#xD;
      less than ~5 minutes to complete. This information will be used to describe the subject&#xD;
      demographics. Participants will also be asked to complete a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max)&#xD;
      test on a treadmill and on a cycle ergometer in a thermoneutral environment with about 30&#xD;
      minutes to one hour between. This test will provide aerobic fitness levels of the&#xD;
      participants which will be compared between the two exercise protocols. Participants will&#xD;
      also be asked about their average weekly physical activity (Appendix K). This visit will take&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Metabolic Heat Production Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prescribe appropriate exercise intensity, heat production must be controlled.&#xD;
      Heat production will be prescribed utilizing a graded exercise test (3-5 minute stages) in&#xD;
      the heat (same environmental temperature as trials) that will measure metabolic data via&#xD;
      collection of expired air utilizing 2-way non-rebreathing mask in order to calculate heat&#xD;
      production and appropriately choose cycling intensities to compare between groups of research&#xD;
      participants. This test will occur following the baseline visit. The study procedures will&#xD;
      mimic those of trials (described below), with the exception of the exercise protocol. The&#xD;
      exercise protocol will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. It will include 5 stages of&#xD;
      exercise (graded stages). The participant will wear the ACU during this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3-6: Trials 1-4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant numbers will be randomly assigned, and 4 trials (mist-fan, forearm, passive&#xD;
      cooling, ice towel) will be ordered with a random number generator and assigned to a&#xD;
      participant number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These orders will be counterbalanced between participants to ensure that there is not an&#xD;
      order effect. Each participant will complete four trials as part of the study. Participants&#xD;
      will be allowed to make-up trial visits if they are sick, suffer an injury or do not meet&#xD;
      hydration requirements. Participants will be asked if they have a current illness or taking&#xD;
      medications to determine whether they can complete the exercise trial. The participant's&#xD;
      visit will be rescheduled if they have a fever, current illness or taking medications that&#xD;
      influence body temperature. Participants will complete four trials on four separate days.&#xD;

      The exercise protocol and recovery portions of this study will be conducted in a climatic&#xD;
      chamber with ambient temperature approximately 30-40°C and relative humidity at approximately&#xD;
      30-70%. Participants will drink ad libitum throughout the exercise trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the lab, participants will be asked to indicate if they have consumed alcohol&#xD;
      or caffeine in the last 24 hours and 12 hours, respectively. They will not be asked to&#xD;
      specify exactly what they have consumed, but if they provide a positive indication, their&#xD;
      trial will be rescheduled for another day. Participants will provide a small urine sample in&#xD;
      a clean urine cup, and a nude body mass will be measured. Upon arrival to the lab, hydration&#xD;
      status will be assessed by urine specific gravity, nude body mass and urine color.&#xD;
      Participants will only be permitted to continue to the exercise trial if the euhydrated&#xD;
      criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) ≤1.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a&#xD;
      USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure&#xD;
      proper hydration status. If USG is greater than 1.025 then the subject will be rescheduled&#xD;
      for a different day. Participants will be given instructions at the prior visit about how to&#xD;
      obtain desired hydration status for the upcoming trial. Researchers will insert an esophageal&#xD;
      probe. Only trained personnel are permitted to insert the esophageal probe (no undergraduates&#xD;
      will be allowed). Participants will insert a rectal probe and wear a heart rate monitor&#xD;
      strap. Additionally, participants will wear 9-site Biopac skin temperature sensors.&#xD;
      Researchers will apply the skin temperature sensors with medical tape to the participants'&#xD;
      chest, upper arm, forearm, thigh, neck, abdomen, thigh, back, and calf (anterior and&#xD;
      posterior). Participants will also wear iButtons (wireless skin temperature sensors) on their&#xD;
      chest, upper arm, forearm, thigh, and calf (anterior and posterior). The participants will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete a subjective sleep questionnaire upon arriving to the lab.&#xD;
      Participants will wear an active combat uniform (ACU) during the exercise trials. Three ADU&#xD;
      sizes for the blouse and pants (small, medium, large) will be available for the participants.&#xD;
      A belt will be used to ensure the ACU fits appropriately. Participants will not be able to&#xD;
      keep the ACU- ADUs will be washed (according to manufacturer's instructions) and re-used for&#xD;
      participants. ADU manufacturer's instructions is identical to standard washing cycle&#xD;
      (detergent and washing machine dry). The ACU will be weighed before and after use to measure&#xD;
      sweat captured in the clothing. Participants will wear the wrist-based devices (provided by&#xD;
      BHSAI) on their non-dominant arm throughout the testing. The wrist device must be placed&#xD;
      approximately 1-inch proximal to the wrist and be fitted snugly for accurate heart-rate&#xD;
      measurements. The wrist device is used to estimate heart rate using infrared technology. The&#xD;
      wrist device estimates of heart rate will be compared to the polar heart rate monitor (gold&#xD;
      standard). The body alerting system uses heart rate from the wrist device and the&#xD;
      environmental conditions to estimate body temperature. The sponsor of the study will use&#xD;
      rectal temperature and the 7-site skin temperature sensors to alter the algorithm (not in&#xD;
      real time- from the collected data) to better estimate body temperature. The future goal is&#xD;
      to have the body alerting system imbedded in the watch. Participants will wear another&#xD;
      wrist-based device (WHOOP) on the arm that does not have the BHSAI device. The WHOOP device&#xD;
      will monitor heart rate variability and sleep. Participants will be asked to wear this device&#xD;
      daily for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will enter the environmental chamber and sit for 30 minutes to become&#xD;
      equilibrated. The environmental chamber will be set to 30-40°C ambient temperature, 30-70%&#xD;
      relative humidity After baseline measures of heart rate, rectal temperature, participants&#xD;
      will complete the perceptual indices. Participants will also complete an environmental&#xD;
      symptoms questionnaire (ESQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of two 40-minute intervals of cycling from 7W/kg to 15 W/kg. Each&#xD;
      40-minute exercise block will be followed by a rest break where cooling will occur.&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to drink ad libitum throughout the exercise trial. The&#xD;
      participant will be cooled for approximately 30 minutes with their assigned cooling modality.&#xD;
      Rectal and esophageal temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, perceptual measures, and&#xD;
      mood (POMS, described below) will be collected at various time points before, during, and&#xD;
      after exercise and cooling. Metabolic heat production will be measured using indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry (mask connected to metabolic cart) during all four trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive Cooling: Participants will be asked to sit in a chair in the climate chamber for&#xD;
      passive cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mist-fan cooling: A mist-fan will be placed next to the participant and will mist-fan only&#xD;
      their hands and forearms during mist-fan cooling. Participants will be asked to roll up their&#xD;
      ADU sleeves to increase skin surface area. The temperature of the mist and wind speed of the&#xD;
      fan will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forearm immersion: The participant will place their forearm in approximately 20°C water&#xD;
      during forearm immersion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ice Towel: a towel that can hold water for extended periods will be used and submerged in an&#xD;
      ice-water mixture (~2 C). Researchers will gently squeeze the towel to remove excess water&#xD;
      (but remain saturated with water) and then apply to both forearms and hands snuggly so that&#xD;
      there is no air gap between the towel and the extremity. Apply for 1-5 minutes and then&#xD;
      replace it with another fresh, cold towel. This step would ensure that the forearms and hands&#xD;
      have near about constant application temperature as the towel would get warm over the&#xD;
      application period. The process will be repeated for the entire cooling duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be divided into two separate phases. A pilot study will be first&#xD;
      conducted in which the first two participants will complete all study laboratory visits. Data&#xD;
      from those trials will be shared with the sponsor for review before continuation of data&#xD;
      collection. Participants will undergo the same procedures for the pilot testing as regular&#xD;
      testing. Pilot testing data will be included in the dataset. Following approval from the&#xD;
      sponsor, data collection will resume. Each trial will be approximately 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All devices will be properly cleaned according to manufacturer's instruction prior to use by&#xD;
      other participants.&#xD;
