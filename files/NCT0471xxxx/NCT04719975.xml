  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to provide further insights into the neurophysiology behind&#xD;
      the MF-induced impairment in endurance performance. The aim is to perform a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in which we partly replicate studies of Marcora et al. (2009) and Bigliassi&#xD;
      et al. (2017), while extensively monitoring brain activity during the entire protocol (i.e.&#xD;
      both cognitive and physical tasks) by using EEG.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Mental Fatigue (Stroop) - Chair task</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be performing the Chair Task (150 submaximal dynamic knee extensions at 50% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)) when mentally fatigued. A 60 minute variant of the Stroop task will be used to induce the mental fatigue. During the whole trial EEG will be measured.</description>

    <description>In the control task subjects will have to watch a documentary on the same computer screen as that used for the experimental trial. These documentaries are chosen based on their emotionally neutral, yet engaging content. This will be followed by the Chair Task, During the whole trial EEG will be measured.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Mental Fatigue (Stroop) - Bike Task</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be performing the Bike Task (a 9 min cycling task performed at 45 rpm with intensity being constant and will be 10% below VT) when mentally fatigued. A 60 minute variant of the Stroop task will be used to induce the mental fatigue. During the whole trial EEG will be measured.</description>

    <description>A modified Stroop task of approximately 60 min will be used in order to induce mental fatigue (MF). This will be based on their performance during the max test that was conducted during the familiarization session. In this task, which will be partitioned in 4 blocks of 468 stimuli, four colored words (&quot;rood&quot;, &quot;blauw&quot;, &quot;groen&quot; and &quot;geel&quot;) will be presented one at a time on a computer screen. The participants will be required to indicate the color of the word, ignoring the meaning of the word itself.</description>

    <description>In the control task subjects will have to watch a documentary of 60 min on the same computer screen as the one used for the experimental trial. In order to avoid under- and over-arousal the subjects will have the opportunity to choose between several documentaries as proposed by the research team. During the control task physiological and psychological measures will be assessed at the same time points as during the mental fatigue trial.</description>
