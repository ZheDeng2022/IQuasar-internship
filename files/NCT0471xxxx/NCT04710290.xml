    <textblock>
      Immunity of cancer patients is an important issue. According to cancer immunity, it can be&#xD;
      divided into three phases: clearance phase, equilibrium phase, and escape phase (cancer cells&#xD;
      can avoid the recognition of immune cells). Βeta-glucans is extracted from yeast, it can&#xD;
      increase immune function and drive of hematopoietic stem cells in animals and clinical&#xD;
      trials. Glutamine can increase the repair of oral and intestinal mucosa of patients receiving&#xD;
      chemical and radiation therapy and can increase the lymphocytes of patients. Colostrum&#xD;
      contains IgA, IgG, IgM, etc., known to protect the baby Cancer patients who are infected with&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria and undergo systemic chemotherapy are less immune than normal adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will compare β-glucan, glutamine, and colostrum immunoglobulin powder with&#xD;
      β-glucan and control group, each group has 30 people, and observe the side effects and blood&#xD;
      of patients under standard chemotherapy. The performance of the immune system, such as&#xD;
      helpers and cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, and to observe the differences in treatment&#xD;
      interruption or delay rates and treatment rates.&#xD;

      Experiment theme / background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer immune surveillance is considered to be an important host protection process to&#xD;
      inhibit carcinogenesis and to maintain cellular homeostasis. In the interaction of host and&#xD;
      tumor cells, three essential phases have been proposed: elimination, equilibrium, and escape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the elimination stage, a small portion of cancer cells can be eliminated by immune&#xD;
      reactions. Direct cancer and innate immune system interaction including natural killer cells&#xD;
      (NK), dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PM including&#xD;
      neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), mast cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, directly&#xD;
      target cancer cells. NK cells, DC, PMN, mast cells, and macrophages are first-line effectors&#xD;
      to damaged cells and cancer cells. NK-T cells and γδ T cells play roles as both innate and&#xD;
      adaptive components, through close interactions with cells of the adaptive immune system,&#xD;
      such as CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes with cytotoxic effects and memory. In addition to direct&#xD;
      cancer/innate immune system interactions, a large number of molecules released due to cancer&#xD;
      cell death, may function as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) and interact with&#xD;
      innate immune cells. Those cancer-derived DAMP include both intracellular molecules and&#xD;
      extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules released from apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, cancer cells show immune tolerance and go in to escape stage. Currently, programmed&#xD;
      death-1 (PD-1) in T cells and programmed death ligands 1 and 2 in cancer cells overexpression&#xD;
      was proved as one of the mechanisms of immune tolerance of cancer cells. The cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen -4 (CTLA-4) is another negative regulator of immune reaction&#xD;
      in cancer patients. Immune therapy including anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA4 medicines,&#xD;
      developed and showed clinical benefit in many cancer types, including melanoma, renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, etc. It shows us that if&#xD;
      investigators can break immune tolerance in cancer patients, cancer can be controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-glucan (long polymer ([1,6] B-d-glucopyranosoyl-[1,3] Bd-glucopyranose, PGG) is isolated&#xD;
      from Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).8 Preparation of purified yeast beta-glucan&#xD;
      sphere is commercially available in the form of whole glucan particles (Wellmune, WGPs) as a&#xD;
      food supplement. Further efforts resulted in the development of a water-soluble,&#xD;
      pharmaceutical-grade yeast beta-glucan whose biological effects have been extensively studied&#xD;
      in vivo. Beta-glucan particle is consumed by macrophages after being transported from the&#xD;
      lumen of the small intestine through Peyer's patches. The macrophage degrades the beta-glucan&#xD;
      (a pro-drug) to its bioactive fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two major functions of beta-glucan are immune stimulation and hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      mobilization. A substantial number of studies have indicated that beta-glucan functions to&#xD;
      increase the host immune response to infection and cancer Small molecular weight WGPs exert&#xD;
      their function through neutrophils by priming complement receptor 3 (CR3) to kill&#xD;
      iC3b-opsonized microorganism or tumor cells. The complement (C) system is a major component&#xD;
      of innate immunity and plays a critical role in host defense, but also enhances adaptive&#xD;
      immunity through the regulation of both T- and B-cell responses. Furthermore, GPS elicit&#xD;
      mouse dendritic cells to release a significantly higher amount of IL-12 but a lower amount of&#xD;
      IL-6 and TNF, as a potent promoter of Th1 adaptive responses. Cellular immunity against tumor&#xD;
      cells chiefly is dependent on Th1 immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early studies of WGPs demonstrated a rapid hematopoietic recovery following bone marrow&#xD;
      injury from irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents. Stem-cell mobilizing effects of WGP and&#xD;
      the combination of WGP with G-CSF have been studied. A single dose of WGP beta-glucan was&#xD;
      found to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) to the peripheral blood. Moreover, an&#xD;
      additive effect was seen when WGP beta-glucan was used in conjunction with G-CSF. This&#xD;
      mobilization ability requires the activity of matrix metalloproteinase. Because hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell mobilization is enhanced by beta-glucan, WGP is able to shorten the leucopenia&#xD;
      period of patients after chemotherapy. Patients undertaking treatment with WGP should have a&#xD;
      better quality of life (QoL) because higher immunity and leukocyte level are essential to&#xD;
      prevent infection after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant amount of pre-clinical and clinical data is available supporting the efficacy&#xD;
      of this product. A clinical study of advanced colorectal cancer treated with FORFIRI plus&#xD;
      Cetuximab compared to FORFIRI/Cetuximab/beta-glucan has been reported in the ASCO annual&#xD;
      meeting.23 Median progression-free survival increased 38% to 22 weeks with the beta-glucan&#xD;
      combination, compared with 16 weeks for the standard of care. The overall response rate&#xD;
      (complete response + partial response) was 30% with beta-glucan combination, compared to 16%&#xD;
      for the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamine is an abundant and versatile nutrient that participates in energy formation, redox&#xD;
      homeostasis, macromolecular synthesis, and signaling in cancer cells. Glutamine levels in&#xD;
      plasma and skeletal muscle were decreased in tumor-bearing rats, although glutamine&#xD;
      production and the conversion of arginine to glutamine were increased. Glutamine supplement&#xD;
      reduced whole-body protein breakdown rate during chemotherapy in tumor-bearing rats and&#xD;
      increase fat-free mass in cancer-related cachexia patients. It also enhanced lymphocyte&#xD;
      mitogenic function and reduced permeability of the gut during radiochemotherapy in esophageal&#xD;
      cancer patients. However, the role of glutamine in cancer growth is equivocal. In some cancer&#xD;
      cells, excess glutamine is exported in exchange for leucine and other essential amino acids.&#xD;
      This exchange facilitates activation of the serine/threonine kinase mTOR, a major positive&#xD;
      regulator of cell growth. An opposite study showed that glutathione (GSH) increases under&#xD;
      glutamine supplementation that can resist chemotherapy and radiotherapy in normal cells. In&#xD;
      cancer tissue, glutamine supplementation appears to decrease intratumoral GSH stores, which&#xD;
      may cause sensitivity to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators need to evaluate the efficacy of bone marrow function recovery after&#xD;
      chemotherapy, analyze the type of immune cells, and measure the number of immune cells,&#xD;
      including CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, NK-T cells, etc., which can help innate immune&#xD;
      response, cancer response. In addition, Investigators want to assess whether simultaneous&#xD;
      treatments can help treat response and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study nutritional supplements have been used since the 7th day of Week 2 and lasted to 2&#xD;
