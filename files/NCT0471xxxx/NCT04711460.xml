  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this non-randomized, within-group comparison was to evaluate the addition of&#xD;
      mindfulness as a new technique in an outpatient group therapy program for participants&#xD;
      diagnosed with a psychotic spectrum disorder, alongside of cognitive behavioral therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Generalized Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder 7-item scale, at admission and discharge. The first experiment compared scores of&#xD;
      those who received mindfulness training plus standard psychiatric treatment (treatment as&#xD;
      usual: TAU) against those who received TAU. The second experiment compared age using matched&#xD;
      scores from participants who received mindfulness training plus TAU. Participants attended&#xD;
      group therapy for a five-week minimum, and were taught the mindfulness practices of breath,&#xD;
      acceptance, observation, remaining non-judgmental, and letting go.&#xD;

    <measure>The Change in PHQ-9</measure>
    <time_frame>At least five weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a 9-iteem survey of how often patients are bothered by symptoms of depression. Items are rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score is a sum of item scores and ranges from 0 (minimal depression) to 27 (severe depression). Outcome is reported as the change from baseline to approximately 5 weeks.</description>

    <measure>The Change in GAD-7</measure>
    <time_frame>At least five weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) is a 7-item survey of how often patients are bothered by symptoms of anxiety. Items are rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score is a sum of item scores and ranges from 0 (minimal depression) to 27 (severe depression). Outcome is reported as the change from baseline to approximately 5 weeks.</description>

    <measure>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS),</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>The Colombia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) has 5 items related to suicidal ideation, past attempts, self-injurious behaviors of how often patients are bothered by symptoms of anxiety. Intensity of suicidal ideation is rated from 1 to 5 (most severe). The frequency of thoughts is rated from 0 to 4 (most severe). Suicide behavior includes 11 questions about Actual Attempts, Interrupted Attempts, Aborted Attempts, Preparatory Acts, and Death by Suicide. There are two questions about Acutal Lethality and Potential Lethality that rate answers from no harm to potential death.</description>

    <measure>CAGE-Adapted to Include Drug Use (CAGE-AID)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>The cut-annoyed-guilty-eye (CAGE) adapted to include drug use (CAGE-AID) is a screening tool to assess drug use. Participants are asked to answer yes (score of 1) or no (score of 0) to 4 questions about their drug use. Scores range from 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating greater substance use disorder.</description>
