  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence showing that musculoskeletal problems in the cervical and thoracic region&#xD;
      are common among academicians and with it, compared to other musculoskeletal pain the pattern&#xD;
      and physical risk factors for neck pain was at the highest percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common postural disorders in the neck and shoulder girdle occurs when the&#xD;
      position of the head is displaced to forward relation to the point of support, which is&#xD;
      called forward head posture (FHP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate factors affecting neck posture in academicians&#xD;
      with non-specific neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators investigated whether there is a correlation between craniovertebral angle (CVA)&#xD;
      and joint position sense, deep cervical muscle strength and endurance in academicians with&#xD;
      chronic non-specific neck pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic non-specific neck pain is one of the most important common musculoskeletal problem&#xD;
      which has considerable impact on personal and financial costs. Because of physical work&#xD;
      factors, neck pain is significantly associated with holding the neck in a prolonged forward&#xD;
      posture and performing repetitive movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper posture is deﬁned as a musculoskeletal balance which involves a minimal amount of&#xD;
      stress and strain on the body. Postural assessment is one of the most important parts of the&#xD;
      physical examination process. Although correct posture is desired, many people do not exhibit&#xD;
      good posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forward head posture(FHP) is the most common cervical postural fault in the sagittal plane&#xD;
      that is found with different severity levels in almost all populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common postural disorders in the neck and shoulder girdle occurs when the&#xD;
      position of the head is displaced to forward relation to the point of support, which is&#xD;
      called forward head posture (FHP). The craniovertebral angle (CVA) is a widely used method&#xD;
      for the objective measurement of FHP severity. A smaller CVA indicated a greater FHP and a&#xD;
      CVA less than 48-50 is defined as FHP .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that approximately 61.3% of adults who work using a computer and have&#xD;
      neck pain have an anterior tilt posture of the head. This postural disorder is caused by&#xD;
      various factors like sleeping with the head too high, prolonged computer use, weak back&#xD;
      muscles, etc. In recent years, the widespread use of computers in offices has caused people&#xD;
      to use their personal computers too much in their daily life. These changes can cause a bad&#xD;
      posture and accompanying neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term work in front of a computer requires a static posture of the upper body. To&#xD;
      maintain the static posture, the neck, shoulder and upper extremity muscles are overloaded&#xD;
      and consequently injured. Uncomfortable posture, especially depending on the viewing angle of&#xD;
      the screen and the position of the chair and table, can shorten soft tissues and cause muscle&#xD;
      tension, weakness and muscle fatigue. Some researchers reported that the muscle tension and&#xD;
      stress that occurs in shortened structures, this condition can cause pain and this can&#xD;
      develop a vicious cycle of muscle tension-pain-increased tension-increased pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the point of view of biomechanics, FHP causes changes in the muscle tendon unit length&#xD;
      of the cervical extensors and flexors and the atlanto-occipital joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tendency to stay seated for long periods of time is increasing as is the percentage of&#xD;
      the population that use a personal computer or smart phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This can cause changes in the alignment of the spine, leading to improper posture, such as a&#xD;
      rounded shoulder or forward head posture (FHP) . The CVA is a widely used method for the&#xD;
      objective measurement of FHP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cervical vertebra plays role in proprioceptive sensory input. The proprioceptive&#xD;
      perception of the cervical vertebra carry information to correct malalignment and has an&#xD;
      important role in postural control. It also reacts sensitively for proper movement of the&#xD;
      head by acting in coordination with the sensory feedback from the vestibular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FHP can produce problems such as increasing stress on the posterior cervical elements,&#xD;
      restriction in range of cervical motion, muscular activity level and impair cervical&#xD;
      proprioception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Academicians may have to be standing position for a long time, use a computer in a static&#xD;
      posture, and work in a stressful mood caused by academic progress anxieties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, in a study the academicians reported the upper back and neck regions, as most&#xD;
      common musculoskeletal problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers found that in academicians compared to other musculoskeletal pain the pattern and&#xD;
      physical risk factors for neck pain was at the highest percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there is no study evaluating factors affecting neck posture in academicians&#xD;
      with non-specific neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to examine the relationship between neck posture and neck pain and&#xD;
      the factors affecting neck posture among academicians.&#xD;
