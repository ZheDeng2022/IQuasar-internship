  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, observational study was to evaluate frequency and&#xD;
      characteristics of low-grade infections of the intervertebral discs in an unselected&#xD;
      real-life patient population undergoing surgery for degenerative pathologies of the spine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-grade infection of the intervertebral discs, causing disc degeneration and consecutive&#xD;
      pain and disability is reported in literature. Microorganisms are also held responsible for&#xD;
      Modic Changes of the vertebral bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients underwent surgery for degenerative pathology of the spine independent of this study.&#xD;
      After being informed about this study, all patients giving written informed consent who met&#xD;
      eligibility requirements were included. Treatment of the patients was independent of this&#xD;
      study. Intraoperative removed disc tissue was examined using microbiological culture, viral&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and histopathological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other used data were demographic data (Gender, age), Modic Changes on MRI, preoperative&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), preoperative Neck Disability Index (NDI), and preoperative&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of positive microbiological culture findings, viral PCR, and inflammation signs in&#xD;
      histopathological analysis was described, and statistical analysis was performed to identify&#xD;
      if any of the above mentioned parameters influences the frequency of positive microbiological&#xD;
      culture and Modic Changes significant.&#xD;
