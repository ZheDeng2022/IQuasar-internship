  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) are defined as important serological markers for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of some forms of small vessel vasculitis, including granulomatosis with&#xD;
      polyangiitis (GPA) , microscopic polyangiitis(MPA) and to a lesser extent Churg -Strauss&#xD;
      syndrome or Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).So they are called&#xD;
      ANCA-associated vasculitis(AAV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An international consensus statement for ANCA testing statement was issued in 2017 and states&#xD;
      that the antigen specific immunoassays can be used for the accurate diagnosis of&#xD;
      ANCA-associated vasculitis without the need for indirect immunofluorescence(IIF). In the&#xD;
      present study we will test whether the antigen specific assays screening is a valuable&#xD;
      alternative to IIF confirming with immunoassay for the diagnosis of AAV on a number of&#xD;
      patients and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To evaluate the performance of the recommended strategy for the detection of ANCA based&#xD;
      on screening with antigen specific immunoassays on a number of AAV patients and relevant&#xD;
      disease controls In Kagawa university hospital (rheumatology department).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods This is a prospective study will be conducted at the department of&#xD;
      rheumatology in Kagawa university hospital in which consecutive samples will be included from&#xD;
      patients suspected to have AAV; patients subsequently identified as having AAV will be&#xD;
      included as AAV patients, while patients in which the diagnosis AAV is rejected, will be&#xD;
      included as disease controls. PR3-and MPO-ANCA will be performed using assays from Medical &amp;&#xD;
      Biological Laboratories Co (Anchor CLEIA) isayama.takuya@mbl.co.jp&#xD;

      To evaluate the performance of the recommended strategy for the detection of ANCA based on&#xD;
      screening with antigen specific immunoassays on a number of AAV patients and relevant disease&#xD;
      controls (i. e., patients for whom ANCA would be requested in the context of small-vessel&#xD;
      vasculitis such as patients with infections, drug-induced diseases, connective tissue&#xD;
      disease, etc.).&#xD;
