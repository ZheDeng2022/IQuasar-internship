  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the short-term effects of physical activity promotion&#xD;
      messages designed for midlife adults. These messages are designed to provide information and&#xD;
      motivation for physical activity by engaging key social processes, such as social comparison&#xD;
      (i.e., self-evaluations relative to others).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ an intensive assessment procedure, in which participants are asked to&#xD;
      complete several brief surveys per day via mobile device. On some days, as described below,&#xD;
      survey content will be assigned with an embedded experimental design, administered via&#xD;
      &quot;micro-randomization&quot; (i.e., randomization to receive one of multiple types of content at&#xD;
      each momentary report). These methods allow for insight into the immediate effects of&#xD;
      different types of content and their accumulated effects over the study period, as&#xD;
      participants go about their normal activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete an initial survey to assess their global and recent experiences&#xD;
      (e.g., demographic information, social media use). Participants then will be asked to engage&#xD;
      in 7 days of ambulatory data collection (i.e., as they go about their normal daily&#xD;
      activities). This includes wearing pedometers to capture PA behavior (steps per day and&#xD;
      aerobic-intensity PA) and completing 4 surveys per day via their smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. For the first 3 days, surveys will assess each participant's preferences and responses to&#xD;
      potential message content as they naturally occur. Content has been pre-tested in preliminary&#xD;
      work. This will establish participants' baseline behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. For the following 2 days, participants will be randomized at each survey to either: 1)&#xD;
      make an upward PA comparison (to someone engaging in a lot of activity), 2) make a downward&#xD;
      PA comparison (to someone engaging in very little activity), or 3) assess a different&#xD;
      experience (e.g., received social support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. For the final 2 days, participants will be randomized at each survey to either: 1)&#xD;
      informational messages about ways to increase activity, 2) encouragement to increase their&#xD;
      activity in healthy ways, or 3) reminders about their activity goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases B and C will be counterbalanced, such that half of participants will receive prompts&#xD;
      described in Phase B before Phase C, and half will receive prompts described in Phase C&#xD;
      before Phase B.&#xD;
