&#xD;
      Study Design The proposed study consists of a qualitative exploratory study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women aged 18-50 years following a pregnancy where they were diagnosed with preeclampsia&#xD;
           and/or GDM will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health care providers who provide care to women with gestational diabetes and&#xD;
           pre-eclampsia will be interviewed to explore effective intervention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment site 1: the investigators will conduct focus groups in Hebrew and Arabic with&#xD;
      women after preeclampsia and/or GDM who gave birth in the Hadassah medical center or are&#xD;
      participating in the Hadassah postpartum clinic for patients with complicated pregnancies.&#xD;
      Separate focus groups will be conducted for women with prior preeclampsia and for women with&#xD;
      GDM history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible women will be approached by the study investigator and will be informed about&#xD;
      the study. The interested women will be recruited to participate in this study and will be&#xD;
      asked to sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those not able to participate in focus groups will be invited to share their experience&#xD;
      through in-depth interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the evidence about the&#xD;
      difficulty among post-partum women to attend face-to-face interviews50, participants will be&#xD;
      offered to participate in either on-site, face to face interviews in Hadassah or&#xD;
      teleconference-based interviews (by phone or secured online meeting forms such as zoom&#xD;
      meetings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will ensure that the face to face groups/ interviews will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the physical-distancing instructions of the ministry of health due to&#xD;
      Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will be contacted by the research team within 1 year from discharge. The&#xD;
      investigators will contact them through the phone or e-mail to plan their participation in&#xD;
      the focus groups/ in depth interviews. The interviews will take place within 12 months from&#xD;
      the discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment site 2: the investigators will recruit ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) and Arab&#xD;
      participants through community centers from different neighborhoods in Jerusalem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invitation to participate in the interviews will be published using posters and/or direct&#xD;
      contact with the women by the community-center's staff. The investigators will recruit women&#xD;
      that participate in post-partum mothers' programs through community centers, in the Haredi&#xD;
      and Arab neighborhoods. The eligible and interested women will be recruited to participate in&#xD;
      the study and will be asked to sign a consent form prior to the interview. The women will&#xD;
      sign consent before the meetings or phone consent for teleconference/ phone meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria/ Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit women:&#xD;

           or participating to the Hadassah postpartum clinic for patients with complicated&#xD;
           pregnancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After a pregnancy where women were diagnosed with preeclampsia and/or GDM (diagnosed)&#xD;
           within 12 months post-partum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 18 and 50 years old&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      In the community centers, the investigators will recruit women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After a pregnancy where women were diagnosed with preeclampsia and/or GDM (diagnosed)&#xD;
           within 12 months of a live birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 18 and 50 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That will be able to communicate in Hebrew or Arabic The investigators will exclude&#xD;
           women with serious complications of preeclampsia and or/GDM as perinatal mortality or&#xD;
           multi-organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will interview health care practitioners who provided health care within&#xD;
      the Hadassah system and outside clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the meetings, participants will be asked to fill in a questionnaire (will take&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes) . The questionnaire consists on the following sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data including age, family status, number of pregnancies, number of children,&#xD;
      education, and employment History of disease: preeclampsia or GDM, family history of CVD Self&#xD;
      -reported height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, who will be interviewed through tele-conference, will receive the questionnaire&#xD;
      through electronically and will be asked to fill it prior to the interview. The questionnaire&#xD;
      will be filled out using a participant ID which is de-identified, and will be collected&#xD;
      through the Nemala system which is encrypted and secure according to Ministry of Health and&#xD;
      Helsinki committee recommendations. Participants who will be unable to fill in electronically&#xD;
      (Haredi population) will complete the questionnaire by phone. For on-site and face to face&#xD;
      interviews, participants will be administered a print copy or the online questionnaire using&#xD;
      a computer or tablet, using the de-identified participant identification, and will be asked&#xD;
      to fill it prior to the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants - up to 100 Focus group discussions: the investigators will conduct up&#xD;
      to 8 groups or until the investigators reach saturation of themes. For the teleconference&#xD;
      focus groups, the number of participants will be limited to 6 women per group, as recommended&#xD;
      from previous research on teleconference focus groups51. The face to face focus groups will&#xD;
      include up to -12 women. The expected duration of each group, will last 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth interviews: The investigators will conduct up to 36 in-depth interviews. The&#xD;
      expected duration of each interview will last 30 minutes to -1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit up to 100 women in total for focus groups and in-depth&#xD;
      interviews. Each participant will be interviewed only once, in a focus group or in-depth&#xD;
      interview, depending on her preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the interviews, the interviewer will explain again the purpose of the study.&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted by researchers from the Linda Joy Pollin center who have a&#xD;
      previous experience conducting qualitative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked for their consent to record the meetings, audio only. The&#xD;
      discussions will be then transcribed without any identification information of the&#xD;
      participants and the recordings will be destroyed afterwards. An interview guide was prepared&#xD;
      by the research staff (see attached the interview guides- for focus groups and in-depth&#xD;
      interviews).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain confidentiality, the investigators will use first names only during the face to&#xD;
      face/ online meeting forms -zoom meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups and in-depth interviews will be recorded, transcribed and analyzed by&#xD;
      investigator according to a thematic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total impression - from chaos to themes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identifying and sorting meanings units - from themes to codes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Condensation - from code to meaning&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Synthesizing - from condensation to descriptions and concepts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage In order to maintain confidentiality, all paper data will be stored in a double&#xD;
      locked storage space at Hadassah hospital. No identifying information will be collected on&#xD;
      the data itself (either electronic or paper), aside from a coding number. Any documentation&#xD;
      of focus groups/ in-depth interviews outcomes will not include identifying information.&#xD;
