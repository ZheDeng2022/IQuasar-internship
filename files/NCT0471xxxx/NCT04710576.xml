      AGAVE-201 is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of axatilimab at 3 different dose levels in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      or refractory active cGVHD who have received at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy due&#xD;
      to progression of disease, intolerability or toxicity. Disease progression is defined 1) by&#xD;
      the NIH 2014 consensus criteria, either in terms of organ specific algorithm or global&#xD;
      assessment or 2) as active, symptomatic cGVHD for whom the physician believes that a new line&#xD;
      of systemic therapy is required.&#xD;

    <description>Axatilimab (SNDX-6352) is a high-affinity antibody targeting the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R). CSF-1R signaling has been demonstrated in nonclinical studies to be the key regulatory pathway involved in the expansion and infiltration of donor-derived macrophages that mediate the disease processes involved in cGVHD.</description>
