    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and at Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a well-established instrument, comprising 50 items designed to measure Quality of Life in participants with diseases of airway obstruction. It consists of two parts: Part 1 produces the symptom score and Part 2 produces the activity and impact score. A Total score is also calculated which summarizes the impact of the disease on overall health status. Scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment where 100 represents worst possible health status and zero indicates best possible health status. Higher scores indicate worse quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and at Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item questionnaire, which has been developed as a measure of participants' asthma control that can be quickly and easily completed. The five questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening on waking in the morning, activity limitation, and shortness of breath, wheeze) over the previous week. The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. Higher score indicates more limitations.</description>
