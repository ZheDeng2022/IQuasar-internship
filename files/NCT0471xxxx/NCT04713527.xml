  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis receives antibiotics during the operation, and&#xD;
      only patients where the surgeon suspects a complicated appendicitis with spread inflammation&#xD;
      to the abdominal cavity receive antibiotics for 3 days postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study at the surgical department, the investigators were able to show that the&#xD;
      surgeon's assessment during the surgery of whether the appendicitis are complicated or not is&#xD;
      very uncertain. This means that some patients receive antibiotics after surgery for no&#xD;
      reason, and others might have benefited from antibiotics. The aim of this study is to solve&#xD;
      this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By extracting some of the peritoneal fluid, it is possible to investigate whether there are&#xD;
      bacteria or not in the abdominal cavity. Today when the fluid is cultivated, the answer will&#xD;
      appear after 3-4 days. Therefore a new method is needed which confirms the presence of&#xD;
      bacteria in the abdominal cavity within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study growth of bacteria in cultivation is examined and determined within 24 hours.&#xD;
      The study also want to use PCR analysis. It is a special technique, which examines the fluid&#xD;
      from the abdominal cavity for bacteria and provide answer within a few hours. It is&#xD;
      investigated whether it is possible to perform this method in the daily routine of the&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New research also shows that if patients needs antibiotics after surgery they can be treated&#xD;
      with tablets instead of injection into the blood vessel. Antibiotic treatment with tablets&#xD;
      will mean that the patient can be discharged earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible with the PCR&#xD;
      technique or cultivation to determine whether there are bacteria in the abdominal cavity of&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgery for acute appendicitis or not, so that any continued antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment after surgery can be targeted to the individual patient. The secondary purpose is&#xD;
      to investigate whether antibiotic treatment with tablets are as effective as getting&#xD;
      antibiotics into the blood vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients participating in the project will undergo the usual routine treatment and&#xD;
      surgery. The only exception is retrieval of the naturally occurring fluid from the abdominal&#xD;
      cavity. This will be done during the operation by special suction equipment that can be&#xD;
      fitted to the usual operating equipment. It will not cause any discomfort or inconvenience to&#xD;
      the patient. The technique of extracting fluid from the abdominal cavity has been used in&#xD;
      previous studies of patients operated on for acute appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit for the patient will be a more targeted antibiotic treatment so that both&#xD;
      unnecessary treatment is avoided, and patients who previously would not have received&#xD;
      treatment can benefit from this. For society a more targeted antibiotic treatment will mean&#xD;
      less risk of developing resistance and less hospitalization.&#xD;

      Aim The primary aim is to investigate whether it is possible to determine if there are&#xD;
      bacteria in the patient's peritoneal fluid either from PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or&#xD;
      cultivation within 24 hours in patients undergoing surgery for acute appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose is to investigate whether oral administered postoperative antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment is non-inferior to prior standard intravenous administration therapy focusing on&#xD;
      wound infection and intra-abdominal abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies from our department have shown that both over- and under treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics in patients operated for acute appendicitis is reality. It has not previously&#xD;
      been possible to control the treatment based on the result of peritoneal fluid culture,&#xD;
      because the final response to conventional cultivation is first available after a 3-4 days.&#xD;
      The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) technique allows diagnostics within hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second problem is that conventional postoperative antibiotic treatment is most often the&#xD;
      only reason for the patient to remain hospitalized for at least 3 days. With oral antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment the patient can be treated at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of acute appendicitis surgery, it is possible to determine the presence of&#xD;
           bacteria in the peritoneal fluid by PCR or culture within 24 hours, and that the final&#xD;
           response to D + R after a further 3 days of culture is consistent with this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral postoperative antibiotic therapy is non-inferior to traditional intravenous&#xD;
           administration in complicated appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Acute appendicitis surgery is one of the most frequent operations with a lifetime&#xD;
      risk of approximately 9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appendicitis can be classified as uncomplicated (phlegmonous) or complicated (gangrenous,&#xD;
      perforated or peri appendicular abscess) based on perioperative findings. Perioperative&#xD;
      antibiotics prophylaxis is administered to all patients, who are operated for acute&#xD;
      appendicitis, whether there is complicated or uncomplicated appendicitis due to prevent&#xD;
      complications. The complications are primarily wound infection or intra-abdominal abscess. In&#xD;
      complicated appendicitis treatment continues for three days after surgery. The antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment targets both aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria. Several antibiotic regimens&#xD;
      have been found to be equivalent. In our department, cefuroxime and metronidazole as&#xD;
      intravenous administration are used as standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the surgeon who alone determine whether an appendicitis is complicated by the findings&#xD;
      under the surgery. A previous study conducted in the ward showed that in 42% of the cases&#xD;
      where the surgeon assessed that the appendix was perforated, no bacterial growth could be&#xD;
      detected by growing on perioperatively retrieved peritoneal fluid, while in 18% of cases&#xD;
      where the histology showed simply phlegmonous appendicitis, there was a positive culture&#xD;
      result. Therefore, there is a risk of both under- and over treatment, which is inappropriate&#xD;
      for many reasons, including increased resistance development. Therefore, a more&#xD;
      evidence-based approach to postoperative antibiotic treatment after surgery for acute&#xD;
      appendicitis is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prerequisite to organize a more appropriate antibiotic treatment will be the ability to&#xD;
      obtain a reliable culture result from peritoneal fluid within 24 hours. Conventional&#xD;
      cultivation can be problematic because not all bacteria will show growth within this time.&#xD;
      PCR could be a better method and an alternative to ordinary culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is found that it is possible within 24 hours after the operation to determine whether&#xD;
      there is growth of bacteria in the peritoneal fluid, it will be possible to let this&#xD;
      determine if continued postoperative treatment are needed regardless of the operative&#xD;
      findings, thus reducing the risk of under- or overtreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important clinical question is whether antibiotics should be given intravenous or&#xD;
      oral. Oral treatment will be convenient for both the patient and the health care system, as&#xD;
      the patient will then be able to be treated at home. A previous retrospective Danish study&#xD;
      has shown that oral antibiotic treatment is equivalent to intravenous treatment and that the&#xD;
      hospitalization time can be reduced by an average of 61 hours. Oral treatment has been&#xD;
      introduced in some Danish hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The study design is a prospective cohort/feasibility and non-inferior study, which&#xD;
      includes a total of 100 patients older than 18 who undergo an appendectomy due to acute&#xD;
      appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When diagnostic laparoscopy is performed and appendicitis is recognized, 10 ml of peritoneal&#xD;
      fluid is extracted for examination by special equipment approved for this purpose. In the&#xD;
      absence of peritoneal fluid, the surgeon will rinse with 20 ml of sterile saline&#xD;
      corresponding to the peri appendicular area. The peritoneal fluid is then sent for PCR,&#xD;
      culture and resistance determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When these procedures are performed usual antibiotic treatment in the form of 3 g of&#xD;
      cefuroxime and 1.5 g of metronidazole are administered intravenously and the operation is&#xD;
      performed according to usual guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a complicated appendicitis (assessed preoperatively), oral antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      in the form of 875 mg amoxicillin / 125mg clavulanic acid + 500mg metronidazole x 3 daily for&#xD;
      3 days are prescribed. The treatment will be independent to the result of PCR determination&#xD;
      and the culture on the peritoneal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample containing the peritoneal fluid is sent to the microbiological department, where&#xD;
      they make the cultivation and resistance determination as well as the PCR. Growth is observed&#xD;
      on the cultures at 12, 24 and 36 hours and the final result with resistance determination&#xD;
      after 3 days. The type of bacteria in the samples are recorded. Follow-up is done 30 days&#xD;
      postoperative, where the patient is contacted by telephone for postoperative complications.&#xD;
      Complications for appendicitis are typically intraabdominal abscess and wound infection, and&#xD;
      therefore special attention will be given to these. Wound infections are defined by the&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surgical site infections (SSI). These and&#xD;
      any other complications are also recorded according to the Clavien Dindo classification (CD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The part of the study that deals with the PCR and culture on the peritoneal fluid is a&#xD;
      descriptive study to investigate whether the PCR technique can be introduced into the daily&#xD;
      clinic. The technique has not previously been tested anywhere and therefore it is not&#xD;
      possible to make any strength calculation on the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR&#xD;
      method relative to the result of the final culture. From our previous studies it is known&#xD;
      that at least one third of the patients will be classified as having a complicated&#xD;
      appendicitis. The inclusion of 100 patients will in our opinion be enough to be able to&#xD;
      calculate sensitivity and specificity with acceptable safety limits, which can be indicative&#xD;
      of further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other part of the study concerns the change of antibiotic treatment from intravenous to&#xD;
      oral treatment. The basis for assessing this will be the frequency of any infectious&#xD;
      complications compared to the frequencies present in the literature. Wound infections by the&#xD;
      laparoscopic technique is about 3% and intra-abdominal abscess is about 7.5%. The&#xD;
      investigators will continuously record the frequency of these complications, and if&#xD;
      deviations from the above occur a detailed review of each case will be made and a decision on&#xD;
      whether this part of the project can continue or not. The results will also be indicative of&#xD;
      whether a randomized trial will be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project feasibility All methods are tested. The method of taken samples from the peritoneal&#xD;
      fluid is tested in another study at the department. The study itself is a feasibility study&#xD;
      to see if it is safe and possible to use these methods in the clinic. For these reasons, a&#xD;
      pilot study is not necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitation The exclusion criteria are a limitation. Especially the age limit of 18 years&#xD;
      courses that the generalizability to patients under 18 is not possible. It is a problem&#xD;
      because there is a lot of patients with appendicitis under the age of 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also a limitation that the study only includes 100 patients. The reason for this is&#xD;
      that the study is a feasibility study and therefore believed 100 patients is enough to&#xD;
      conclude if further studies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected clinical impact The results could be of great importance for future treatment. If it&#xD;
      is possible to get an answer of the presence of bacteria in the peritoneal fluid within 24&#xD;
      hours, it is possible to target the antibiotic treatment to the right patients. This is&#xD;
      important for the single patient but also important for the society because the use of&#xD;
      antibiotic leads to development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and therefore it is&#xD;
      important to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotic. Since appendicitis is a very frequent&#xD;
      disease, research in this area is of great importance as it involves a high number of&#xD;
      patients and thus a large amount of antibiotics. Especially because it is shown that the&#xD;
      surgeons overestimate the number of patients with complicated appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this the oral treatment has the impact that most patients can be treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics at home. This will have a positive impact for both patient and society.&#xD;
