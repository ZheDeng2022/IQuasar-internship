      The aim of this study is to assess the changes in retinal nerve fiber layer due to SSRI&#xD;
      treatment in first-attack major depressive patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most used and safe&#xD;
      antidepressant drugs in the world. In previous studies, SSRIs have been found to cause an&#xD;
      increase in brain gray matter volume in patients with major depression (MD). Optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive medical imaging method that displays biological&#xD;
      tissue layers by taking high-resolution tomographic sections. Changes in the thickness of the&#xD;
      retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), a layer of the ganglion cell complex in the retinal layer&#xD;
      of the eye and composed of ganglion cell axons, occur due to axonal damage in the retinal&#xD;
      nerve tissue. Since RNFL is similar to brain gray matter tissue, recently neurological and&#xD;
      psychiatric studies have been conducted to provide data on the neurodegeneration that occurs&#xD;
      in the brain by OCT. However, in a recent cross-sectional study, contrary to what was&#xD;
      expected, thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer was detected in psychiatric patients&#xD;
      using SSRI drugs compared to the healthy group, and this was attributed to a probable&#xD;
      maculopathy caused by SSRIs in the eye. In this study, it is aimed to assess the probable&#xD;
      cortical volume changes of the patients by measuring the changes in retinal nerve layers due&#xD;
      to SSRI treatment in first-attack MD patients.&#xD;
