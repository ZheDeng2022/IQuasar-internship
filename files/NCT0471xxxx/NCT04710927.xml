  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is a developmental defect of enamel affecting the&#xD;
      first permanent molar and frequently the incisors with a prevalence of 16-16.9% in Malaysia.&#xD;
      They presented with many problems such as hypersensitivity, increase susceptibility of&#xD;
      caries, need for recurrent complex dental treatment, and difficulty to achieve pain control.&#xD;
      Silver Diamine Fluoride is a new form of topical fluoride that has been extensively used and&#xD;
      recommended for the management of caries in children and adolescents. The influence of&#xD;
      organic material removal from artificial dentine lesions by means of surface pre-treatment&#xD;
      with deproteinizing agent show favoring result of its use on subsequent remineralization with&#xD;
      and without fluoride. The purpose of this trial is to study the clinical outcome of SDF and&#xD;
      papain based gel on hypomineralized teeth restored with HVGIC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm parallel randomized controlled trial and will be performed in&#xD;
      participants between the age of 5 to 15 years presented with hypomineralised molar of MIH in&#xD;
      origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment, radiograph, and photographs will be taken for assessment. Patients that&#xD;
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria will be invited to the study. After that, the patient will&#xD;
      be explained and a Patient Information Sheet (PIS) will be given. Once consent obtained and&#xD;
      the patient randomly allocated for the treatment group, treatment will be done as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group 1, any caries if present will be removed using a hand instrument. The tooth then&#xD;
      will be filled with High Viscous Glass Ionomer Cement (HVGIC) following the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instruction. If the participant is assigned to group 2, after caries has been removed using a&#xD;
      hand instrument, silver diamine fluoride (SDF) will be applied for 1 minute on the affected&#xD;
      area prior to restoration with HVGIC following the manufacturer's instruction. If the&#xD;
      participant is assigned to group 3, papain-based gel (Papacarie Duo) will be applied as a&#xD;
      deproteinizing agent, caries will be removed using a hand instrument if present. Then, silver&#xD;
      diamine fluoride will be applied for 1 minute on the affected area prior to restoration with&#xD;
      HVGIC following the manufacturer's instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be followed up after 6 and 12 months. The teeth and restoration will be&#xD;
      assessed clinically and through radiographic evaluation by an assessor that is not involved&#xD;
      in the provision of treatment. Sign and symptom of pain, tenderness to percussion, presence&#xD;
      of swelling or fistula, the scale of sensitivity using Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale&#xD;
      (SCASS), quality if restorative assessment using ART Index&#xD;
