  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled, multicenter study. According to the inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      volunteers were recruited from patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. After signing the&#xD;
      informed consent, the subjects were assigned to the experimental group and the control group&#xD;
      through the central randomization system. The researchers will complete the total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty for patients in the experimental group with the assistance of surgical&#xD;
      navigation system. The patients in the control group do not use the surgical navigation&#xD;
      system. The proportion of acetabular abduction angle and anteversion angle in the lewinnek&#xD;
      safe area is the primary outcome measurement. The operation time, WOMAC score, Harris score,&#xD;
      range of motion and dislocation rate are the secondaryoutcome measurements. The incidence of&#xD;
      complications, devices and other adverse events were recorded.&#xD;

    <description>The WOMAC is a self administered questionnaire to assess joint function and quality of life for patients with osteoarthritis; it consists of 24 items: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). The higher the total score, the worse the patient's pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. The WOMAC is validated for various languages, including Chinese</description>

    <description>The&quot;VTS&quot; surgical navigation system can accurately match the preoperative and intraoperative image data with the patient's anatomical structure on the operating table, track the surgical instruments during the operation, and update the position of the surgical instruments on the patient's image in real time, so that the doctor can clearly understand the position of the surgical instruments relative to the patient's anatomical structure, and make the operation procedure more accurate and safer.</description>
