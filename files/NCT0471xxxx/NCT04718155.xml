      3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, known as statins, are widely used&#xD;
      to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. As lipid-lowering drugs, statins&#xD;
      exert neuroprotective effects on ischemic stroke. this study will investigate whether the&#xD;
      protective effect of statins is mediated by their ability to impact inflammation and oxygen&#xD;
      free radical levels in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Could Statins affect the neuroinflamation which occurs after traumatic brain injury?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common and financially devastating health&#xD;
      problems in our society. Once the acute care period has ended, many TBI patients are left&#xD;
      with motor, cognitive, or emotional dysfunction as a result of their injury. The treatment of&#xD;
      TBI remains largely supportive, directed toward management of cerebral edema and intracranial&#xD;
      hypertension via temporizing measures, such as administration of osmotic agents,&#xD;
      hyperventilation, and ventricular drainage. None of these interventions have been&#xD;
      definitively demonstrated to improve long-term functional outcome. The failure of preclinical&#xD;
      therapies to translate into clinical benefit may derive from the heterogeneity of TBI&#xD;
      pathology, which includes diffuse axonal injury, cerebral contusion, intracerebral hemorrhage&#xD;
      (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and extra parenchymal hemorrhage. These primary insults&#xD;
      are exacerbated by a secondary neuroinflammatory cascade of cerebral hypoperfusion and&#xD;
      ischemia, oxidative stress, cerebral edema, and intracranial hypertension. There are a series&#xD;
      of reactions following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, such as inflammation and an increase in&#xD;
      free radicals, which may trigger secondary injury in ischemic tissue. Indeed, the inhibition&#xD;
      of inflammation reduces tissue damage in ischemia. Thus, understanding the roles of&#xD;
      inflammation and free radicals in ischemia/reperfusion injury is therefore of great&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, known as statins, are widely used&#xD;
      to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. As lipid-lowering drugs, statins&#xD;
      exert neuroprotective effects on ischemic stroke. In this study, teh study will investigate&#xD;
      whether the protective effect of statins is mediated by their ability to impact inflammation&#xD;
      and oxygen free radical levels in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Statins have been&#xD;
      shown to reduce morbidity in patients who did not have high serum cholesterol or&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease but did have evidence of systemic inflammation. Statins have strong&#xD;
      efficacy on modulation of inflammatory responses. conditions where statins have been found to&#xD;
      have a positive effect on disease progression or mortality are primarily dependent on&#xD;
      leucocyte accumulation. Statins may thus promote the timely resolution of the inflammatory&#xD;
      response, preventing persistence of inflammation and resultant pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows for measurement of metabolites that are&#xD;
      undetectable by conventional neuroimaging thereby holding potential to identify traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury patients that could benefit from specific neuropsychiatric and cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation . Brain energy metabolism is altered after TBI due to posttraumatic&#xD;
      inflammation and ischemia with mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of neuronal integrity with&#xD;
      increased cell membrane turnover. MRS is an MRI technique that can detect nuclei with spins&#xD;
      such as 1H, an abundant by-product of cellular respiration and brain tissue metabolites. As a&#xD;
      noninvasive and safe technique, MRS is available on clinical MR scanners (1.5 and 3.0 T)&#xD;
      without ionizing radiation [15]. This method holds the potential to identify compromised&#xD;
      brain metabolism, but evidence after traumatic brain injury is rare .&#xD;
