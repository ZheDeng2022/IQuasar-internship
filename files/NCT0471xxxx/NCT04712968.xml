  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to improve the treatment effect for outpatients with depression by&#xD;
      adding regular daily morning daylight exposure to their treatment with antidepressants.&#xD;
      Patients will wear a personal light tracker to keep them motivated. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      patients daily exposed to morning daylight, as a supplement to standard treatment for&#xD;
      depression, will achieve significantly higher antidepressant effect that patients receiving&#xD;
      standard treatment alone. Furthermore, we hypothesize that they will experience improved&#xD;
      well-being and sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to inadequate efficiency of existing medical and psychotherapeutic treatments for&#xD;
      depression there is a need for investigating the efficacy of adjunctive treatments. Light&#xD;
      therapy has proven efficient as an add-on treatment for depression, but some patients might&#xD;
      prefer being outdoors rather than sitting in front of a light therapy screen. However, no&#xD;
      high-quality studies, have so far investigated the antidepressant and other potential&#xD;
      positive effects of regular exposure to morning daylight for patients with unipolar&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of morning daylight as add-on to treatment&#xD;
      as usual in patients with depression. Efficacy is measured as reduction of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, improvement of sleep quality, and improvement of well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and material: A randomized controlled trial comprising 150 patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      unipolar depression aged 18-50 years will be conducted. Patients are included after giving&#xD;
      informed consent and the study period is 6 weeks. A wearable Personal Light Tracker,&#xD;
      measuring the amount off light received, will be provided for all participants. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized into the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Daylight (outdoor daylight exposed stay for minimum 30 minutes per day before 1 pm).&#xD;
      To motivate patients to go outside they will receive psychoeducation on the connection&#xD;
      between exposure to morning daylight and a possible antidepressant effect, and they are&#xD;
      introduced to potential options for outdoor activities. A detailed instruction to the&#xD;
      personal light tracker and the matching app, for monitoring the amount of light received&#xD;
      throughout the day, is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Control group receiving treatment as usual. Patients will wear a personal light&#xD;
      tracker but they are not introduced to the light-monitoring-app.&#xD;

    <description>Participants are asked to stay outside in morning daylight for minimum 30 minutes each day before 1 pm for 6 weeks. A specific plan for individual outdoor possibilities for daylight exposure is made (e.g. a walk, a stay in a park or in their garden, a bike trip). Furthermore a detailed instruction to the personal light tracker &quot;LYS Button&quot; and the matching &quot;LYS Insight app&quot; is provided. The &quot;LYS Insight app&quot; gives the user access to real-time insight of light stimulus. Further, the participants receive psycho-education on the connection between exposure to morning daylight and antidepressant effect. All participants in this group receive the intervention as add-on to usual treatment, which may comprise prescribed antidepressants, psychotherapy, including psycho-education and psychiatric care.</description>
