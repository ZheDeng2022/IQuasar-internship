      This is a multicentric, open-label, single arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in pre-treated thymic carcinoma&#xD;
      patients who have progressed after at least one line of platinum-based chemotherapy for&#xD;
      advanced disease without having received any previous immunotherapy (previous bevacizumab&#xD;
      allowed, but not sunitinib), and not amenable to curative-intent radical surgery and/or&#xD;
      radiotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 status.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Relapsed / Recurrent histologically confirmed B3-Thymoma or TC patients not amenable&#xD;
             to curative-intent radical surgery and/or radiotherapy, regardless of PD-L1&#xD;
             expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients progress after at least one previous line of platinum-based chemotherapy for&#xD;
             advanced disease:&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Negative result for Myasthenia Gravis (MG) by acetylcholine receptor antibodies test.&#xD;
             Presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies will be considered a positive result for&#xD;

&#xD;
             a. Disease status must be documented by full chest and upper abdomen (including&#xD;

             Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly&#xD;
             obtained biopsies are preferred to archival tissue. Note: If submitting unstained cut&#xD;
             slides, newly cut slides should be submitted to the testing laboratory within 14 days&#xD;

             hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has received prior investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to â‰¤ Grade 1&#xD;

             prior to elective surgery and until at least 2 weeks following major surgery and&#xD;
             adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of lenvatinib after resolution of&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (i.e., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed;&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
