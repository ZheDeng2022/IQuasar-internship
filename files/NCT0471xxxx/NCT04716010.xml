  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To assess the impact of taxes, warnings, and a combination of taxes and warnings on&#xD;
      US adults' decisions to purchase products that contain red meat in an online grocery store.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Participants will be recruited from Prime Panels (an online panel&#xD;
      research company). Following online consent, participants will be assigned to one of four&#xD;
      trial arms: 1) Control (no warning and no tax), 2) Warnings (all products that contain red&#xD;
      meat have a health warning and environmental warning), 3) Tax (30% tax on products that&#xD;
      contain red meat), and 4) Combined warning and tax (all products that contain red meat will&#xD;
      have the two warnings and a 30% tax). Then, participant will enter an online grocery store&#xD;
      reflecting their assigned arm. The participant will be instructed to complete a shopping task&#xD;
      in the online grocery store. After completing the shopping task, participants will be&#xD;
      redirected to an online survey and answer a series of questions about the shopping task,&#xD;
      labels (excluding tax and control groups), and taxes (excluding warning and control groups).&#xD;
      Questions will also include standard demographic and health related variables.&#xD;

      Participants will be recruited from Prime Panels (an online panel research company).&#xD;
      Following online consent, participants will be randomly assigned to one of four trial arms&#xD;
      affecting the appearance of an online grocery store. Once in the online grocery store,&#xD;
      participants will complete a shopping task. The participants will have 9 specified items to&#xD;
      add to their shopping cart (1 pizza, 1 burrito, Burger patties [meat or vegetarian],&#xD;
      Breakfast sausages [meat or vegetarian], 1 frozen individual meal, 1 loaf of bread, 1&#xD;
      sandwich filling [for example, ham, turkey, or peanut butter], 1 pack of tortillas, 1 taco&#xD;
      filling [for example, steak, chicken, or beans]). Participants will be informed that they&#xD;
      will not be spending any of their own money to complete the shopping task. After completing&#xD;
      the shopping task, participants will be redirected to a survey. They will provide&#xD;
      self-reported responses to survey questions (e.g. perceived healthfulness from eating red&#xD;
      meat, perceived risk of cancer from eating red meat, thinking about the health/environmental&#xD;
      harms of food products). Participants will also answer demographic and health related&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
