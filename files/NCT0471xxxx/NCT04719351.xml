  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current pandemic highlighted an urgent need for early interventions to mitigate the&#xD;
      psychological effects of extreme work demands that healthcare workers currently experience.&#xD;
      This project aims at developing a data driven monitoring system to efficiently track&#xD;
      work-related stress reactions over time. The system will also include a self-awareness&#xD;
      intervention grounded on evidence-based strategies to improve workers' recovery. The solution&#xD;
      will be delivered through a mobile application for a rapid implementation among healthcare&#xD;
      workers and related professions. The mobile application will be developed through an initial&#xD;
      analysis of pilot data, a factorial experiment and a user-experience analysis. Qualitative&#xD;
      user experience data will also be used to validate the functionality of the monitoring&#xD;
      system. The solution developed in this project will be easily scalable to related&#xD;
      occupations, for example workers at elderly homes and social workers. After the pandemic, it&#xD;
      can also be used as a preventive intervention for workers who are at risk of burnout and as a&#xD;
      support for patients returning to work after treatment for common mental disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms indicating possibly pathological stress reactions among healthcare workers are more&#xD;
      prevalent during the current pandemic than they were before. Possible reasons for that&#xD;
      include higher levels of known risk factors such as cognitive, emotional, and physical&#xD;
      demands at work; new stressors such as risk for moral injury and worry about personal safety;&#xD;
      and diminished protective mechanisms, which include recovery opportunities and psychological&#xD;
      detachment. Thus, frontline healthcare workers should be given priority in access to&#xD;
      psychological support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the urgent need for it, a rapid implementation of psychological support for&#xD;
      healthcare workers has proved to be challenging during previous crises and the current&#xD;
      pandemic. Guidelines published thus far underline the necessity of close real-time monitoring&#xD;
      in order to early identify at risk populations and individuals, who should be referred to&#xD;
      seek professional support. However, appropriate tools for efficient real-time monitoring of&#xD;
      stress responses and early screening for possibly pathological reactions among healthcare&#xD;
      workers are currently lacking. Available tools focus either on tracking of stress indicators&#xD;
      e.g. sleep disturbances, or on teaching strategies to better cope with stress e.g.&#xD;
      mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will test whether a separate use or a combination of these&#xD;
      different functions may be the most efficient in managing work-related stress symptoms among&#xD;
      healthcare workers. The study has a factorial design in order to closely investigate the&#xD;
      functionalities focused on real-time monitoring of emotional responses and the&#xD;
      functionalities based on evidence-based strategies to improve workers' recovery, as well as&#xD;
      the possible interactions among them.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The factorial experimental trial will randomize participants to one of 32 experimental conditions which consist of any combination of the five components: 1) questions about positive emotions (yes/no), 2) questions about work environment (yes/no), 3) questions about controllability (yes/no), 4) questions with open answers (yes/no), and 5) behavioral prompts (yes/no). The purpose of this factorial experiment is to estimate the main effects of the five intervention components and interactions between the components.</intervention_model_description>

    <intervention_name>The DIARY mobile application</intervention_name>
    <description>The mobile application has two main functionalities. First, it will remind the user to report in regular time periods on their mental health status (e.g., sleep disturbances, stress). The assessment is done daily for four weeks. Second, some completed assessments will be combined with a behavioral prompt i.e. short message encouraging the user to engage in one of the strategies that can help coping with stress at work, e.g. remember to take short breaks, exercise in daylight, summarize a day with a colleague after a finished shift.</description>

    <ipd_description>An anonymized subset of the data relevant for a particular publication (including metadata and code for the analyses conducted) will be registered on the OSF repository and provided with the DOI number. Neither qualitative data (i.e. answers to open questions) nor any personal data (i.e. gender, age, occupation) will be shared to ensure complete anonymity of the study participants. Data regarding each publication will become available already at the pre-print stage of each publication (i.e. manuscript submitted for publication), under the CC-BY license. Data will be stored in .csv format and will include raw data as well as data analysis files (analysis code). The data publication may be postponed and restricted in case a patent application will be submitted for a review.</ipd_description>
