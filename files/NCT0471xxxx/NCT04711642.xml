  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocular surface disease (OSD), particularly dry eye, is one of the most common conditions seen&#xD;
      by ophthalmologists. Dry eye (DE) is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface&#xD;
      that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear instability. DE&#xD;
      significantly reduces quality of life and affects 5-30% of the population. As the proportion&#xD;
      of individuals over age 60 increases because of greater life expectancies, we can anticipate&#xD;
      the number of people with dry eye will also increase, which represents a major challenging&#xD;
      for aging societies, like the Chilean one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years clinical research on OSD is being intensely focused on diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria, treatment strategies, methods used in diagnosis and better correlations between&#xD;
      symptoms and clinical test results. All these lines of interest aim to improve the&#xD;
      understanding of alterations and consequences occurring in the ocular surface disorders.&#xD;
      Diagnostic testing is greatly valuable both for the detection of early changes due to DE and&#xD;
      also to grade the severity of surface disease. The most commonly performed tests include the&#xD;
      Schirmer test, tear break up time (TBUT), and ocular surface staining. However, newer&#xD;
      point-of-care diagnostics tests such as tear osmolarity and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9)&#xD;
      have been shown to have a high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing ocular surface&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that ocular surface dysfunction has been shown to have an adverse impact on visual&#xD;
      function and can worsen after surgery, it is critical to identify and address any tear film&#xD;
      and ocular surface abnormalities before cataract surgery. In the setting of preoperative&#xD;
      cataract surgery planning, DE disease and meibomian gland dysfunction can impair critical&#xD;
      refractive measures such as keratometry values worsening surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge there are no ongoing or published studies that have evaluated DE&#xD;
      and OSD as evidenced by either an abnormal tear-film parameter (elevated MMP-9 or abnormal&#xD;
      osmolarity), or corneal surface and meibography evaluation findings (using novel non-invasive&#xD;
      technology) in patients previous and after cataract surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized study has been designed to assess and characterize OSD/DE in&#xD;
      consecutive patients presenting for cataract surgery evaluation and to identify eventual&#xD;
      changes on biomarkers of the tear film of the same population postoperatively. At the same&#xD;
      time, 2 different postoperative eye drops regimen will be evaluated in order to determine its&#xD;
      impact on postoperative OSD/DE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All group of patients will be subjected to Dry Eye assessment using diagnosis criteria and&#xD;
      methodologies recommended by the 2017 Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS II) (2), which includes the&#xD;
      assessment of a battery of symptoms (OSDI questionnaire), signs (tear meniscus height,&#xD;
      corneal and conjunctival lissamine green/fluorescein staining), laboratory tests (Schirmer I,&#xD;
      TBUT assessment, tear osmolarity, tear MMP-9, meibography, ocular redness, lipid layer&#xD;
      thickness) and physical examination (lid, meibum gland assessment). This assessment will be&#xD;
      carried out in all groups preoperative and at postoperative week 4 and postoperative week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether, by identifying definite changes either in novel tear film biomarkers or non&#xD;
      invasive ocular tests of patients subjected to cataract surgery, we expect to contribute to&#xD;
      the understanding of the pathophysiology of the OSD and Dry Eye associated to cataract&#xD;
      surgery and to give lights on the utility of those changes as biomarkers in diagnosis and&#xD;
      therapy assessment in these conditions committing the ocular surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis is that there is a high prevalence of ocular surface dysfunction&#xD;
      among patients presenting for cataract surgery as measured by point-of-care objective tear&#xD;
      tests and cataract surgery results in altered ocular surface in a major fraction of patients.&#xD;
      Dry eye symptoms are not necessary associated with objective signs in the ocular surface, but&#xD;
      are less in the group of patients treated with associated lubricant eyedrops postoperatively.&#xD;
      Patients more symptomatic in the postoperative period tend to have multiple preoperative&#xD;
      OSD/DE biomarkers altered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients presenting for cataract surgery evaluation will be recruited at the&#xD;
      Fundacion Oftalmologica Los Andes (FOLA) Ophthalmology Clinic (Santiago, Chile). Patients&#xD;
      will be eligible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria indicated. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will be invited to participate voluntary in the study. The study will comprise three groups&#xD;
      with 30-35 patients per group. Dry eye patients will be diagnosed according to TFOS DEWS II&#xD;
      report and to the recommendations of the Dry Eye Workshop of 2017. It will basically consist&#xD;
      of: a) patient history: symptoms and signs (e.g. ocular irritation, dryness or foreign body&#xD;
      sensation, redness, etc), exacerbating conditions, duration of symptoms, etc., will be&#xD;
      obtained by using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). b) physical examination: visual&#xD;
      acuity measurement, external examination and slit lamp biomicroscopy (tear film, tear&#xD;
      meniscus, eyelashes, eyelid margins, conjunctiva, cornea, lens and retina). c) Diagnostic&#xD;
      tests: Tear film osmolarity (using Tearlab), Tear film MMP-9 levels (using InflammaDry).&#xD;
      Non-invasive tests will be performed using Keratograph 5M, which includes: non-invasive tear&#xD;
      film break up time tear meniscus height, lipid layer thickness, ocular redness and&#xD;
      meibography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise three groups. Each group will comprise 30-35 patients. Each of the&#xD;
      100 patients will be featured by a list of clinical parameters (ocular signs and symptoms and&#xD;
      laboratory tests used conventionally for Dry Eye diagnostic). It is expected to observe&#xD;
      differences in parameters before and after cataract surgery and between the control group and&#xD;
      the two interventional groups. Association of those differences with the type of&#xD;
      postoperative regimen will be defined statistically by using Student t-test and ANOVA for&#xD;
      parametric data and U-test of Mann-Whitney for non-parametric data (p&lt;0.05 will be taken as&#xD;
      significant). Altogether, it is expected that such a multiplicity of signs and symptoms will&#xD;
      give valuable data on specificities of Dry Eye after cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participant surgeons will have a summary document of the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and a flowchart of the patient's enrollment process to improve compliance. The data&#xD;
      will be stored on an external digital platform and only the data analyst will have access to&#xD;
      it. In addition, there will be written records of each enrolled patient.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned by a computer generated randomization list in a 1:1:1 ratio to the intervention groups (2) or the control group. After cataract surgery, all groups will be given a topical steroid-antibiotic (tobramycin 0.3% and dexamethasone acetate 0.1%) commercially available and commonly used by ophthalmologists worldwide postoperatively, in a 3-week tapered regimen (every 2 hours the first day, then every 4 hours for 6 days, then 3 times a day for 1 week and twice a day for 1 week). The 2 study groups will be also prescribed lubricant eye drops from the postoperative day 7 containing sodium hyaluronate 0.1% (in 2 different commercially available formulations) to instill 4 times daily for the following 3 months. Study group patients will be instructed to instill the lubricant eyedrops at least 10 minutes after the tobramycin-dexamethasone eyedrops. At postoperative visits, patients will be asked about compliance with the assigned treatment.</intervention_model_description>
