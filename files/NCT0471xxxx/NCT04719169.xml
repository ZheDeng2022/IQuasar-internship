    <textblock>
      This protocol describes using an MRI-Enema technique to assess the integrity of colorectal&#xD;
      anastomoses when compared to fluoroscopic water soluble contrast enema, and provides&#xD;
      information the participant recruitment process, participant experience and study management.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Both examinations will be performed ideally on the same day or a maximum of 7 days apart. The&#xD;
      order of the two tests will be directed according to scan appointment availability. The WSCE&#xD;
      will take place at St Marks Hospital London. Due to the MRI capacity at LNWH trust the&#xD;
      MRI-Enema will take place at Number 9 Harley Street, London. A service level agreement will&#xD;
      be in place for the scans to occur, and St Marks Seedcorn funding has already been awarded to&#xD;
      fund the MRI scans. The patients will be asked to fill in a survey to assess their experience&#xD;
      immediately after each test in each location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI-Enema:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 16Fr Foley catheter is introduced per-anus with the patient in a left lateral decubitus&#xD;
      position on the MRI scanner table. If the anastomosis was low (within 5 cm of anorectal&#xD;
      junction) the catheter will be taped to the skin to maintain its position. In the event of a&#xD;
      mid-rectal or upper rectal anastomosis (&gt;5 cm from anorectal junction), the catheter balloon&#xD;
      may be filled with 2-5mls of water and withdrawn to a location at the top of the anal&#xD;
      sphincter complex. In both instances, after catheter insertion the patient is then&#xD;
      re-positioned to a supine body position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI protocol used is detailed below. In summary, T2 and T1 (with fat suppression)&#xD;
      sequences are obtained prior to filling the lumen with contrast to assess the presence of any&#xD;
      pre-sacral and peri-anastomotic fluid, to identify the presence of haematoma and to ensure&#xD;
      the catheter is appropriately sited with the catheter tip above the anal canal and close to&#xD;
      the anastomosis, ideally within 3cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enema comprises a mixture of normal saline (400mls) and contrast agent (Gadovist, 4mls)&#xD;
      to produce a 1% contrast solution which part fills a standard contrast enema bag and delivery&#xD;
      system. The bag is attached to a fixed hook located 100cm above the scanner table height,&#xD;
      such that fluid will deliver from the bag via the catheter according to gravity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic MRI sequences are then performed with the delivery tube open to maximise flow of&#xD;
      contrast into the residual rectum/neo-rectum or ileo-anal pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the dynamic sequences, further axial and coronal images are acquired in order to&#xD;
      identify the presence of leaked fluid within the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all images have been acquired, the enema bag is then placed on the floor to allow&#xD;
      drainage of enema solution back into bag prior to removal of catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;

      axial Filling Phase Dynamic sagittal Post Enema 3D volumetric T1 sagittal SFOV Post Enema T2&#xD;
      axial fat sat Post Enema T2 coronal fat sat&#xD;
&#xD;
      WSCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WSCE is undertaken according to standard practice. As with the MRI, a 16Fr Foley catheter&#xD;
      is introduced per anus with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Having&#xD;
      affixed the catheter in place according to the height of the anastomosis above the anorectal&#xD;
      junction as described above, water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin) is introduced via an enema&#xD;
      delivery bag system as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic images are then acquired with the patient in the supine and lateral decubitus&#xD;
      positions as required in order to delineate the anastomosis and any related leak of contrast.&#xD;
      The bag is then placed on the floor to allow drainage of fluid and the catheter removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire immediately following both examinations.&#xD;
      Questions will be targeted to evaluate anxiety, comfort, embarrassment and confidence in the&#xD;
      test's outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference standard = Consensus of both tests (WSCE and MRI-Enema) with agreement between two&#xD;
      radiologists and in agreement with referring consultant /clinical assessment including&#xD;
      findings at clinical examination where applicable.&#xD;
