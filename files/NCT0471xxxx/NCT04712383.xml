  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of consumer-grade wearable health devices&#xD;
      and behavior change support services, including health coaching, on health behaviors,&#xD;
      biometrics, and healthcare costs. The study will be a randomized controlled trial with 700&#xD;
      participants who are employees of UMass Memorial Health Care in which 350 participants&#xD;
      (control group) receive standard wellness and medical benefits and services for UMass&#xD;
      Memorial Health Care employees and in which 350 participants (intervention group) receive&#xD;
      these same standard benefits and services as well as the full Fitbit Care product suite&#xD;
      (Fitbit wrist-worn device, Fitbit connected weight scale, and Fitbit Premium + Health&#xD;
      Coaching service). Participants in the intervention group will be offered support in&#xD;
      improving health behaviors that are important to them, including activity, nutrition, sleep,&#xD;
      stress management, and medication adherence. They will also be offered support in tying these&#xD;
      behaviors to their health goals, including blood pressure management, blood sugar management,&#xD;
      cholesterol management, weight loss, smoking cessation, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that those employees in the intervention group will experience improved&#xD;
      results compared to those in the control group. It is believed that they will have improved&#xD;
      health behaviors, improved biometrics, and lower total healthcare costs (fewer complications,&#xD;
      fewer hospitalizations, etc.).&#xD;
