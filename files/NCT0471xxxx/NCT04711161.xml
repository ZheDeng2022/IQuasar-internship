  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 (Phase IA single agent portion) will test the tolerability of continuous twice a day&#xD;
      dosing of GRN-300, a salt-inducible kinase inhibitor, with each cycle consisting of 28 days&#xD;
      of treatment. The number of administered cycles will depend on the tolerability of each dose&#xD;
      level and the severity and occurrence of side effects and DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (Phase IB combination therapy portion) will test the tolerability of continuous 28-day&#xD;
      cycles of GRN-300 in combination with weekly paclitaxel x 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall duration of the study will be approximately 24 months, depending on the rate of&#xD;
      enrollment and number of subjects enrolled.&#xD;

      Part 1: Phase 1A Portion Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of GRN-300 in the study&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of repeated 28-day cycles of oral GRN-300&#xD;
           therapy in subjects with recurrent or metastatic ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary&#xD;
           peritoneal cancer or other advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of GRN-300 after oral administration of a&#xD;
           single dose and at steady state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the clinical activity of GRN-300 by determining the clinical benefit rate&#xD;
           (CBR: SD≥6 months/PR/CR) and proportion of patients surviving progression free (PFS) at&#xD;
           six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain pharmacodynamic (PD) data on the effects of single agent GRN-300 on peripheral&#xD;
           blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, all doses, pHDAC5, pSIK2) and tumor tissue (cohort&#xD;
           expansion phase, SIK2, pSIK2, pp85α, pHDAC5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate biomarkers for polyploidy, PI3K signaling and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Phase 1B Portion Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the RP2D of GRN-300 in combination with weekly paclitaxel in the study&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of repeated 28-day cycles of daily oral&#xD;
           GRN-300 therapy in combination with weekly paclitaxel x 3 in subjects with recurrent or&#xD;
           metastatic ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer or other advanced&#xD;
           solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the PK profile of GRN-300 and paclitaxel following administration of a&#xD;
           single dose of each and at steady state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the clinical activity of GRN-300 by determining the clinical benefit rate&#xD;
           (CBR: SD≥6 months/PR/CR) and proportion of patients PFS at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain PD data on the effects of GRN-300 plus paclitaxel on peripheral blood&#xD;
           mononuclear cells (PBMCs, all doses, pHDAC5, pSIK2) and tumor tissue (cohort expansion&#xD;
           phase, SIK2, pSIK2, pp85α, pHDAC5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate biomarkers for polyploidy, PI3K signaling and apoptosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Translational Objectives for Both Portions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine SIK2 and SIK2 target total protein and phosphorylation levels before and&#xD;
           on-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore biological difference in tumor biopsies from responders and non- responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the relationship between plasma concentrations/exposure and changes in&#xD;
           safety and efficacy outputs to facilitate population analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if GRN-300 impacts bone mass and biochemical markers of bone turnover.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The study will determine the safety of continuous twice a day oral dosing of GRN-300, with each cycle consisting of 28 days of treatment. The number of administered cycles will depend on the tolerability of each dose level and the severity and occurrence of side effects and DLTs. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GRN-300 as a single agent will be determined. The overall duration of Phase 1a will be approximately 9-12 months, depending on the rate of enrollment and the number of subjects enrolled.</description>

    <description>The study will determine the safety of continuous twice a day oral dosing of GRN-300, with each cycle consisting of 28 days of treatment, in combination with intravenously administered paclitaxel weekly x 3 during each 28-day cycle. The number of administered cycles will depend on the tolerability of each dose level and the severity and occurrence of side effects and DLTs. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GRN-300 in combination with paclitaxel will be determined. The overall duration of Phase 1b will be approximately 9-12 months, depending on the rate of enrollment and the number of subjects enrolled. Phase 1b will commence following determination of the MTD and RP2D of GRN-300 monotherapy in Phase 1a.&#xD;
Overall duration of the study will be approximately 24 months, depending on the rate of enrollment and number of subjects enrolled.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy: Patients must have received at least one prior second-line treatment&#xD;
             for persistent / recurrent disease but may have received any number of prior&#xD;
             treatments.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone major surgery ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;

             neuropathy (excluded from Phase IB portion only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any cytotoxic chemotherapy or investigational drugs, biologics, or devices&#xD;

             active hepatitis B or C infection requiring treatment with antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal dysfunction that may affect oral drug absorption (e.g., intermittent&#xD;
             or chronic bowel obstruction, short gut, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with thrombotic, embolic, venous, or arterial events, such as cerebrovascular&#xD;
             accident (including transient ischemic attacks) deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism within six months of start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical co-morbidities that in the investigator's judgment would increase the&#xD;
             risks of participation&#xD;
