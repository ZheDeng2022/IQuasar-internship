  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of mindful breathing and the mechanism of positive spirals&#xD;
      of mindfulness using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and actigraphy. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown a positive spiral between state mindfulness and positive affect (Du, An, Ding,&#xD;
      Zhang, &amp; Xu, 2018). The mindful coping model (Garland, Gaylord, &amp; Fredrickson, 2011)&#xD;
      suggested that the state of mindfulness can lead to reappraisal and reframing of their&#xD;
      stressful circumstances which further lead to positive emotion and reduced stress. These&#xD;
      positive effects will affect the next cycle and hence form a positive spiral. Since mindful&#xD;
      breathing was an effective practice for immediate decentering (Feldman, Greeson, &amp; Senville,&#xD;
      2010), it will be used as the manipulation of state mindfulness. Besides, there is very&#xD;
      limited research on the associations between these constructs using EMA and actigraphy.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will explore this association by manipulating the state of mindfulness&#xD;
      with mindful breathing using EMA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study will be a randomized control trial which studies the mechanism of&#xD;
      positive spirals of mindfulness in mindful breathing. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from the community through posters, social media sites and/or emails. About 30&#xD;
      eligible participants will be recruited after an online screening (with phone support). Prior&#xD;
      to all study procedures, the research purpose and data collection procedure will be given to&#xD;
      the participants and an online informed consent will be obtained from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will be randomly assigned to either the mindful breathing group&#xD;
      (intervention group) or the waitlist group (control group) in a ratio of 1:1. The&#xD;
      randomization will be performed by an independent assessor using a computer-generated list of&#xD;
      numbers. No deception is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be requested to wear an actigraphy device (ActiGraph GT9X link)&#xD;
      connected to a heart rate sensor (Polar H10) for 8 consecutive days, for recording their&#xD;
      physiological data including HRV and activity level. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA)&#xD;
      will also be used. A smartphone application will be developed and installed in the&#xD;
      participants' smartphones. The app will prompt the participants, 4 times each day (9 a.m., 1&#xD;
      p.m., 5 p.m. and 9 p.m.), to fill in a self-report questionnaire concerning mood. Besides&#xD;
      that, participants have to complete an assessment at baseline and immediate post-intervention&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in treatment group will receive mindful breathing instructions daily (at 9 a.m.&#xD;
      after completing the EMA questionnaires). They will be asked to perform a 10-minute mindful&#xD;
      breathing exercise based on an audio. After that, they will submit a simple record indicating&#xD;
      the time they have completed the exercise. Meanwhile, participants in the waitlist condition&#xD;
      will not receive the recording during the study. However, the same set of mindful breathing&#xD;
      instruction audio will be sent to the waitlist group after the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (1day), intervention/ waitlist period (four times per day over 7days) and immediately post-intervention (7days)</time_frame>
    <description>An in-house smartphone application will be developed and installed in the participant's smartphones for recording the participants' mindfulness at baseline once and 4 times a day over 7 consecutive days. MAAS is a 15-item scale widely used to assess the level of mindfulness, which scores each of the 15 statements as &quot;1&quot; (almost always) to &quot;6&quot; (almost never). The computed score is calculated by averaging the 15 scores. State MAAS is a 5-item scale developed from MAAS, which scores each of the 5 statements as &quot;0&quot; (almost always) to &quot;6&quot; (almost never). The MAAS will be used in baseline and immediately post-intervention while the state MAAS will be used in baseline and intervention/ waitlist period via EMA.</description>
