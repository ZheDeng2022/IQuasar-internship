  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery Disease (PAD) is a major cardiovascular disease that can impair quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL). It affects more often male patients and its pathophysiology is not completely&#xD;
      known. Probably androgen receptors and metabolism alteration may play an important role in&#xD;
      the onset and in the progression of PAD towards its dreadful complications. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the role of Androgen Recetpr , IGF-I receptor, and Insulin Receptor on&#xD;
      the arterial wall of male patients with PAD undergoing open revascularization surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) of lower limbs is one of the most common clinical&#xD;
      manifestation of atherosclerosis and can be considered a major cardiovascular disease with&#xD;
      important morbidity and mortality, affecting also quality of life (QoL), thus representing an&#xD;
      important public health concern. From a clinical point of view, PAD may be initially&#xD;
      symptomatic with intermittent claudication (IC), and in critical limb ischemia (CLI), an&#xD;
      advanced stage of PAD, with rest pain, and also with leg skin ulceration, a complication that&#xD;
      may even lead to limb loss for amputation. From a pathophysiological point of view, in the&#xD;
      presence of atherosclerosis, endothelial activation and dysfunction lead to hemodynamic&#xD;
      alterations such as turbulent flow, abnormal shear stress, loss of potential energy,&#xD;
      anomalies of vascular tone with functional impairment during leg exercise in early stages,&#xD;
      with IC onset, and in advanced stages, during CLI stage, also with rest pain as a result of&#xD;
      an important demand/perfusion mismatch. Endothelial dysfunction, and vascular tone are also&#xD;
      regulated by sex hormones, and incidence and prevalence of PAD have usually been found to be&#xD;
      higher in men than in women, and, more in general, males have a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease during the reproductive period in comparison with females of the same&#xD;
      age. This sex related difference in developing the disease was hypothesized to be related to&#xD;
      the protective role of estrogens in female subjects, and harmful effects of androgens in male&#xD;
      individuals. Furthermore, the androgen receptor (AR) seems to have a role in neointima&#xD;
      formation, in influencing the size and the composition of atherosclerotic plaques, and also&#xD;
      vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) activity. Moreover, sex-specific effects on the&#xD;
      metabolic system are well-known and associated with different risk profiles for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and they have been also related to differences in sex hormones&#xD;
      activities. In fact, the insulin and IGF-I signaling is mediated by hormone interaction with&#xD;
      the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) which are members of subclass II of&#xD;
      the tyrosine kinase receptor super-family and they, on one hand, participate to the metabolic&#xD;
      homeostasis, and on the other hand, they have a direct role on VMMCs, and also in some stages&#xD;
      of the atherosclerotic process..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of AR, IGF-IR, and IR on the arterial wall of&#xD;
      male patients with PAD undergoing open revascularization surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) will undergo arterial reconstructive open surgery. Samples obtained from diseased arteries of lower limbs of patients undergoing arterial reconstructive open surgery will be collected and immediately preserved at -80Â°. Briefly, arterial tissues were excised, homogenized using a motor driven homogenizer and total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of Androgen Receptor (AR), insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) will be quantified by real-time PCR using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy), following the manufacturer's instructions.</description>

        Inclusion criteria were patients with age &gt;18 years, severe peripheral artery disease that&#xD;
        needs surgical repair. Patients with life expectancy &lt;6 months, advanced liver or heart&#xD;
        disease and active malignancies were excluded. At the moment of hospital admission,&#xD;
        clinicians collected the medical history including previous cardiovascular disease (CVD:&#xD;
        stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease), presence of&#xD;
        dysmetabolism, history of arterial hypertension and diabetes, previous amputation, history&#xD;
        of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therapies practiced at home, encompassing hypoglycemic&#xD;
        oral agents, insulin, blood pressure lowering drugs, statins, antiplatelet and&#xD;
        anticoagulants were also collected.&#xD;
