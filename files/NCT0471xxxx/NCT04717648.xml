  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomotic leakage is serious morbidity that can develop in patients operated on for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and can reach potentially life-threatening dimensions. Many international&#xD;
      studies have been conducted to reduce and eliminate this postoperative complication that may&#xD;
      have a mortal course. In these studies, preoperative, perioperative and postoperative factors&#xD;
      of the patient, operation techniques, structure of the material used in the operation and&#xD;
      multiple factors belonging to the surgeon were held responsible. Intraabdominal sepsis&#xD;
      secondary to late anastomotic leakage and subsequent multiorgan failure can cost the&#xD;
      patient's life. Anastomotic leaks that develop in patients who have been operated for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer; In order to detect patients' postoperative clinical findings, laboratory&#xD;
      examinations, imaging tests, and to eliminate them before intraabdominal sepsis develops,&#xD;
      studies including many different laboratory and imaging methods have been carried out.&#xD;
      Although previous studies have shown that there are many laboratory examinations and imaging&#xD;
      methods that can predict anastomotic leaks early, they have many advantages over each other&#xD;
      in terms of efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to investigate the effectiveness of C reactive protein and blood&#xD;
      sodium value, as well as their superiority, among the tests that can predict postoperative&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage, especially in patients who have undergone a single anastomosis following&#xD;
      resection for non-metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      -  Investigate the effectiveness of postoperative C-reactive protein and sodium values in&#xD;
           predicting anastomotic leakage in the early postoperative period in patients who have&#xD;
           undergone anastomosis following resection for non-metastatic colorectal cancer, and&#xD;
           their superiority to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the effectiveness of these laboratory parameters in developing anastomotic&#xD;
           leaks according to tumor location and different age subgroups (&lt;45 years, 45-65 years,&gt;&#xD;
           65 years).&#xD;
