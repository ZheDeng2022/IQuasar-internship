    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a biologic drug targeting the&#xD;
      Interleukin (IL)-17 pathway (secukinumab) on brain plasticity and examine whether the plastic&#xD;
      changes correlate with the improvement of perception of well-being, itch, and pain in&#xD;
      participants with psoriasis.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Between 18 and 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Psoriasis patients (with/without psoriatic arthritis): Psoriasis Area (BSA) is more&#xD;
             than 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Psoriasis patients must have had a TB test in the past 8 months (if a patient has not&#xD;
             had one, the study will provide one).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Healthy subjects: in general, good health without history of neurological and&#xD;
             psychiatric diseases. No chronic itch, pain, skin or systemic conditions currently or&#xD;
             in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of child bearing potential will be administered a pregnancy test to verify that&#xD;
             they are not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. MRI Compatibility: No major contraindication for MRI (pacemaker, vascular stents,&#xD;
             metallic ear tubes, and absence of metal implants or braces) as assessed by MRI&#xD;
             technologist using site approved screening form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants have to be able to speak and read English fluently.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants must have signed a written informed consent before being enrolled in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals under 18 or over 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to complete the required measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants who use antihistamine drugs for itch relief&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Suffering from any disease state or physical condition, which would increase their&#xD;
             health risk by study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with chronic infectious diseases (e.g., mycobacterial and fungal infections&#xD;
             and chronic tuberculosis) or inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients without a negative TB test in the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to biologics&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with treatment of biologics should not receive live vaccines. Thus, age&#xD;
             appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines must be&#xD;
             completed before the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with primary immunodeficient lacking IL-17, patients with autoantibodies&#xD;
             against IL-17&#xD;
&#xD;

             type of drug, biological, or non-drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Recent initiation (within last 3 months) or change in dose of centrally acting agents&#xD;
             such as antidepressants, neuroleptics or neuropathic medications.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Patients who have used biologics in the past in the past 8 weeks or Otezla in the past&#xD;
             4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients who use centrally acting agents only when they need. The purpose is to avoid&#xD;
             a risk of acute effect of these agents on brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Current treatment with opioid analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Uncontrolled thyroid disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

         18. Diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia, major depression or&#xD;
             bipolar disorder that is active currently.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Weight: 250 lb or more&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Any known diseases or disorders that may affect conducting the experiments (e.g.,&#xD;
             intracranial pathology, claustrophobia, severe respiratory or cardiovascular problems,&#xD;
             active fibromyalgia) or diseases that have potential risks of infections (e.g., HIV,&#xD;
             Hepatitis C, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Inability to speak and read English.&#xD;
&#xD;
