  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this baby doll comparison study, clinical lactation specialists will complete two&#xD;
      back-to-back video-based simulations (telesimulations) focused on newborn positioning and&#xD;
      attachment. Study participants will interact with a standardized patient educator (SP)&#xD;
      wearing the Lactation Simulation Model and using two baby dolls in a randomized order.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identifying signs of effective newborn positioning and attachment is an essential skill for&#xD;
      maternal-child care providers. No study has evaluated the effectiveness of commonly used baby&#xD;
      dolls for teaching this skill. In this comparison study, clinical lactation specialists will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned two baby dolls to evaluate in two back-to-back video-based simulations&#xD;
      (telesimulations) with a standardized patient wearing the LiquidGoldConcept Lactation&#xD;
      Simulation Model. Participants will complete a novel competency assessment using 3-second&#xD;
      video clips to show specific components of positioning and attachment and evaluating whether&#xD;
      any correction is needed and why or why not.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will evaluate the Newborn Oral Assessment and Latch Simulator (NORALSim) and one of two other baby dolls: 1) a cloth doll with a puppet-style head where the user can control the opening and closing of the mouth, and 2) a rigid, plastic doll with a static open mouth. The order of presentation of the dolls between the two back-to-back simulations and the second baby doll will be randomized.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants will not be aware which baby doll they will be assessing prior to presentation within the simulation. Standardized patients (SP) will know which baby doll to present during the simulations, so they will not be masked. Following the simulation, the SP will indicate which dolls were used using a blinded numbering system that will be used for data analysis by investigators and outcomes assessors.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Technical Skills Confirmation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will confirm or deny whether they were able to teach specific components of newborn positioning and attachment with the baby doll.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative realism of baby doll</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to compare the realism of the two baby dolls used in their simulation on a 30-point checklist. Respondent will rank the two baby dolls' ability to demonstrate specific components of positioning and attachment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with baby dolls</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will participate in a 10-minute semi-structured interview immediately following the simulations and discuss what worked and didn't work about each baby doll for teaching newborn positioning and attachment. Interviews will be transcribed and thematically analyzed to report participant satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the baby dolls.</description>
