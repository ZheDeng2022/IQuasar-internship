  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stent-FP study investigates the impact of coverage of profound femoral artery (PFA) by&#xD;
      bare metal stent deployed in proximal superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions. 300 patients&#xD;
      with femoral bifurcation lesions will be included and divided into 3 groups according to the&#xD;
      location of proximal stent edge. The primary endpoint of the study is major adverse events&#xD;
      and freedom from target lesion revascularization at 48 months. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      primary patency of PFA and bare metal stent at 1,6, 12,24,36and 48 month, MAE and F -TLR at&#xD;
      1,6, 12,24,36 month.&#xD;
