      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 600 children have received the adenovirus serotype 26 expressing the Ebola virus Mayinga&#xD;
      glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV), modified Vaccinia Ankara Bavarian Nordic vector expressing&#xD;
      multiple filovirus proteins (MVA- BN-Filo) Ebola vaccine regimen in the EBL2002 and EBL3001&#xD;
      clinical trials. The vaccine regimen was well tolerated and highly immunogenic in children;&#xD;
      however, the durability of vaccine-induced immune responses is not known. In adults&#xD;
      previously vaccinated with the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo regimen, a booster vaccination with&#xD;
      Ad26.ZEBOV was safe and induced a strong anamnestic response within seven days of the booster&#xD;
      vaccination. It is important to establish if a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV is safe and&#xD;
      immunogenic also in children, as this can guide the clinical use of the Ad26.ZEBOV,&#xD;
      MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen in this age group. For example, it could support the strategy of&#xD;
      boosting immunised children at the start of an Ebola outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an Ad26.ZEBOV booster dose in&#xD;
      healthy children who were previously (&gt;2 years) vaccinated with the Ad26.ZEBOV (dose 1)&#xD;
      followed by MVA-BN-Filo (dose 2) 56 days later, by monitoring adverse events (AEs) following&#xD;
      the booster vaccination and by assessing binding antibody responses using the Filovirus&#xD;
      Animal Non-Clinical Group (FANG) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV at a dose of&#xD;
           5x10^10 viral particles (vp) in children previously vaccinated with the Ad26.ZEBOV,&#xD;
           MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen with a 56-day interval. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
           assessed by measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Incidence of solicited local (at the administration site) and systemic adverse&#xD;
                events as assessed on the day of booster vaccination and by diary card for 7 days&#xD;
                after booster vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Incidence of unsolicited adverse events from the day of the booster vaccination to&#xD;
                28 days post booster vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess vaccine-induced humoral immune responses to the Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV&#xD;
           GP), as measured by FANG ELISA (EU/ml), at 7 and 21 days following a booster dose of&#xD;
           Ad26.ZEBOV at a dose of 5x10^10 vp in children previously vaccinated with the&#xD;
           Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen with a 56-day interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess neutralising antibody responses directed against the Ad26 vector before booster&#xD;
      vaccination as measured by a virus neutralization assay (VNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: as this study is designed to provide descriptive information regarding safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity without formal treatment comparisons, no formal statistical hypothesis testing&#xD;
      is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label study evaluating the immune response to a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV&#xD;
      administered to children who were previously vaccinated with Ad26.ZEBOV followed by&#xD;
      MVA-BN-Filo 56 days later. Only subjects who received the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo regimen&#xD;
      during their participation in the VAC52150EBL3001 (EBOVAC-Salone) vaccine trial&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02509494), are eligible for enrolment in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited in two age groups: children aged 4-11 years at the time of&#xD;
      dose 1 vaccination and children aged 1-3 years at the time of dose 1 vaccination in the&#xD;
      EBOVAC-Salone trial. Approximately 25 subjects will be enrolled in each of these two age&#xD;
      groups. Parents/guardians will be asked to consent for the participation of their children in&#xD;
      the study. Children aged 7 years and older at the time of enrolment in this study will be&#xD;
      asked to give positive assent for their participation. Participants will be followed up to 28&#xD;
      days after their booster vaccination. The study will be conducted in Kambia, Sierra Leone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: potential participants must be healthy children (based on physical&#xD;
      examination, medical history, a haematological assessment and clinical judgment) who received&#xD;
      the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen in the EBOVAC-Salone trial and were aged ≥1 to&#xD;
      ≤11 years at the time of dose 1 vaccination. They must also be enrolled in the long-term&#xD;
      follow-up study to the EBOVAC-Salone trial, VAC52150EBL3005 (EBOVAC-Salone Extension study,&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03820739) but not in the immunogenicity subset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and administration: a single dose of Ad26.ZEBOV at a dose of 5x10^10 vp administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations: solicited local (at the administration site) and systemic AEs will be&#xD;
      assessed on the day of vaccination and using a diary for a period of 7 days following the&#xD;
      booster vaccination. Unsolicited AEs will be tracked for 28 days following booster&#xD;
      vaccination, while serious adverse events will be tracked for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity evaluations: blood will be drawn for assessments of immune responses at 7 and&#xD;
      21 days post booster vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be done when all subjects have completed their 28-day post-booster&#xD;
      visit or discontinued earlier. This analysis will include all available data up to this&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination: the sample size is a convenience sample and is not based on formal&#xD;
      hypothesis testing considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis: no formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data will be&#xD;
      analysed descriptively by age group, 1-3 years and 4-11 years (age the participant was when&#xD;
      they received dose 1 vaccination in the EBOVAC-Salone trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity analysis: no formal hypothesis on immunogenicity will be tested. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics (i.e. geometric mean and 95% confidence interval, as appropriate) will be&#xD;
      calculated for continuous immunologic parameters at all available time points. Graphical&#xD;
      representations of immunologic parameters will be made as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency tabulations will be calculated for discrete (qualitative) immunologic parameters&#xD;
      (i.e. responder rate), as applicable. Responders rate defined as &gt;2.5-time increase over&#xD;
      baseline value (or lower limit of quantitation [LLOQ]) pre-dose 1 vaccination in the&#xD;
      EBOVAC-Salone trial, will be calculated depending on availability of sample results from the&#xD;
      EBOVAC-Salone trial.&#xD;
