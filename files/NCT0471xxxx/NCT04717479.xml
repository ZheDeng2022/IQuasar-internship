  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to refine and test a strategy for engaging older adults with&#xD;
      symptoms of SCD/MCI (subjective cognitive decline/mild cognitive impairment) as volunteers to&#xD;
      help English language learners (ELLs) who live in the US improve their speaking skills via&#xD;
      structured conversations using videoconferencing.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Conduct a user-centered design process to refine the SPEAK! training protocols for&#xD;
      older adults with symptoms of SCD/MCI and ELLs, and the materials that will support&#xD;
      productive engaging English conversation practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Conduct a randomized, wait-list controlled trial of 8 weeks of SPEAK! participation,&#xD;
      using a variety of recruitment sources, in order to evaluate our capacity to recruit,&#xD;
      implement the intervention, and retain older adults with symptoms of SCD/MCI in sufficient&#xD;
      numbers for a subsequent randomized-controlled trial evaluating the intervention's impact on&#xD;
      participants' psychological well-being, mood, and cognitive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Using mixed methods, evaluate the communication process between older adults with&#xD;
      symptoms of SCD/MCI and ELLs including factors that contribute to satisfaction of both&#xD;
      parties, engagement in planned contacts, possible contributors to stress or dissatisfaction,&#xD;
      and perceptions among older adults of being appreciated and effective. The investigators will&#xD;
      also estimate variances for key outcome variables and conduct exploratory analyses of&#xD;
      intervention-control differences in participants' perceptions of their wellbeing, mood, and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning.&#xD;

    <measure>Psychological Wellbeing Scale (PWB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Psychological Wellbeing Scale (PWB) is a validated measure shown to be sensitive to intervention effects. This is a 6 point scale where the minimum is 1 (strongly disagree) and maximum is 6 (strongly agree). Higher scores reflect higher wellbeing.</description>

    <measure>UCLA Revised Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a validated measure of loneliness with an alpha reliability of .94. This is a 4 point scale from 1=never to 4=always (minimum is 1 maximum is 4). Positively worded questions will be reverse-coded so that higher scores mean more loneliness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale is a measure of depressive symptoms specifically designed for older adults. The 30 point scale has a minimum of 0 points to maximum 30 points. Higher scores reflect greater depression.</description>
