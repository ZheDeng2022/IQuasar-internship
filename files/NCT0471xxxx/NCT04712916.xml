    <textblock>
      Summary of the Research Medication non-adherence has a huge economic impact on the patient&#xD;
      and the society at large. World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that noncompliance&#xD;
      with medication is a common problem which often leads to compromised health benefits and&#xD;
      serious economic consequences in terms of wasted time, money and increased morbidity. Other&#xD;
      consequences are waste of medication, disease progression, reduced functional abilities,&#xD;
      lower quality of life, and increased use of medical resources such as nursing homes, hospital&#xD;
      visits and hospital admissions. Non-adherence is common to patients with chronic diseases,&#xD;
      such as hypertension and diabetes, compared to patients with acute conditions. The annual&#xD;
      cost of medication non-adherence, which includes hospital and nursing home admissions,&#xD;
      increased ambulatory costs, lost productivity and premature deaths, has been estimated to be&#xD;
      more than $100 billion per year in the United States. In Canada, hospital expenditures caused&#xD;
      by non-adherence was estimated to be more than US$1.6 billion. The potential burden of&#xD;
      medication non-adherence outcomes on health care delivery makes it an important public health&#xD;
      concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have addressed non-adherence to medication in developed countries. Past studies&#xD;
      on non-adherence in Nigeria have identified different rates of non-adherence to medications&#xD;
      for disease states such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Literature is scanty on&#xD;
      studies on cost of non-adherence in Nigeria. This study will be focus on cost implications of&#xD;
      non-adherence to treatment among patients of selected disease states (hypertension and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design The study was a quasi-experimental study among T2D patients that were&#xD;
      recruited from the two hospitals using questionnaire-guided semi-structured interview. At the&#xD;
      baseline, participants with HbA1c ≥7% were classified as uncontrolled/intervention group,&#xD;
      while those with HbA1c &lt;7% were considered as control group. Similarly, participants with&#xD;
      blood pressure &lt;140/90mmHg were classified as control/adherent while those with blood&#xD;
      pressure ≥140/900mmHg were uncontrolled/intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology A quasi-experimental study among 201-patients with T2D using semi-structured&#xD;
      interview. Baseline questionnaire comprised modified 4-items Medication Adherence Questions&#xD;
      (MAQ), Perceived Dietary Adherence Questionnaire (PDAQ) and International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire, to assess participants' adherence to medications, diet and physical activity,&#xD;
      respectively. Patients were assigned into control (HbA1c&lt;7%, n=95) and intervention&#xD;
      (HbA1c≥7%, n=106) groups. Post-baseline, participants were follow-up for 6-months with&#xD;
      educational intervention provided to clarify and resolve identified discrepancies among the&#xD;
      intervention group only, while the control group continued to receive the usual care. Costs&#xD;
      of management including transportation fare, consultation fee, medications and laboratory&#xD;
      investigations were estimated for 6-months pre-baseline and 6-months post-baseline for both&#xD;
      groups. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics, while Chi-square, McNemar and&#xD;
      paired t-test were used for categorical and continuous variables at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal exposure: Glycated haemoglobin HbA1c, was measured for Type 2 DM participants and&#xD;
      blood pressure was taken for hypertensive participants Outcome variable: Effect of&#xD;
      pharmacist-led intervention on therapy non-adherence, reasons for non-adherence and costs of&#xD;
      management.&#xD;

      The study involved adult T2D, hypertensive and those with the two diseases attending the&#xD;
      cardiology and endocrinology out-patient clinics of the two tertiary hospitals [University&#xD;
      College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan and Federal Medica Centre (FMC), Abeokuta, Nigeria].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prospective phase, an average of 25 patients regularly attend the weekly medical&#xD;
      out-patient endocrinology clinic of the two hospitals. This gives a total of 100 patients per&#xD;
      month in each hospital, and for the 6-months study period gave an estimated population of 600&#xD;
      T2D per hospital. However, a maximum of 2 to 6 months clinic appointment is usually given to&#xD;
      T2D in UCH, and a maximum of 3 months appointment in FMC, the appointment schedule was based&#xD;
      on the extent of glycaemic control. Based on this information, an estimated T2D population&#xD;
      for 4-months and 3-months was used to calculate the target sample size for UCH and FMC,&#xD;
      respectively. Thus, considering the regular attendee of 100 patients per month in each of the&#xD;
      hospital, a total of 700 T2D was used as estimated population to guide sample size&#xD;
      determination using the Raosoft® sample size calculator at 95% confidence level and 5% margin&#xD;
      of error (http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html). This gave a target sample size of 249 T2D&#xD;
      participants to be enrolled for the study. Similarly, Average of 20 hypertensive patients&#xD;
      regularly attend the weekly medical out-patient cardiology clinic of the two hospitals. This&#xD;
      gives a total of 80 patients per month in each hospital, and for the 6-months study period&#xD;
      gave an estimated population of 320 hypertensive patients per hospital. However, a maximum of&#xD;
      2 to 6 months clinic appointment is usually given to hypertensive patients in UCH, and a&#xD;
      maximum of 3 months appointment in FMC, depending on the extent of control of the blood&#xD;
      pressure. Based on this information, an estimated hypertensive patients population for&#xD;
      4-months and 3-months was used to calculate the target sample size for UCH and FMC,&#xD;
      respectively. Thus, considering the regular attendee of 80 patients per month in each of the&#xD;
      hospital, a total of 560 was used as estimated population to guide sample size determination&#xD;
      using the Raosoft® sample size calculator at 95% confidence level and 5% margin of error.&#xD;
      This gave a target sample size of 229 hypertensive participants to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument descriptions The baseline questionnaire comprised sections A to F. Section A&#xD;
      captured demographic data, section B contained modified International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire short-form (IPAQ-SF) (IPAQ-SF, 2002) and individual physical activity was&#xD;
      calculated as metabolic equivalent task (MET) per week (http://www.ipaq.ki.se). IPAQ -SF&#xD;
      instrument measures duration, frequency, intensity of physical activity in leisure-time,&#xD;
      work, and doing household tasks in the past seven days. This short version consists of seven&#xD;
      items including time spent in walking, vigorous activity, moderate activity, and sedentary&#xD;
      activity weekly. Metabolic Equivalent Tasks (MET) values reported by patients were computed.&#xD;
      To interpret the modified IPAQ-SF, according to WHO, an adult is expected to have minimum of&#xD;
      600 Metabolic Equivalents (MET) physical activities weekly. Participants were classified as&#xD;
      non-adherent and adherent to exercise if he/she has less than 600 and above 600METs per week&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Section C consisted of modified Perceived Dietary Adherence Questionnaire (PDAQ) developed by&#xD;
      Assad et al., (2015), to measure patients' perception of dietary adherence. For these items,&#xD;
      higher scores reflected higher level of adherence (Assad et al., 2015). However, items four&#xD;
      and nine, indicated unhealthy choices (foods high in sugar or fat). For these items, higher&#xD;
      scores reflected lower adherence. In computing the total PDAQ score, the scores for these two&#xD;
      items were inverted. Although based on a weekly timeframe, it was anticipated that the PDAQ&#xD;
      would reflect usual dietary patterns based on knowledge that most people consume similar&#xD;
      foods from week to week (Assad et al., 2015). In this study, PDAQ was interpreted by&#xD;
      classifying participants as adherent to dietary recommendations if they scored 51 (80%) and&#xD;
      above, out of the 63 maximum obtainable score, while those who scored less than 51 (80%) were&#xD;
      classified as non-adherent to dietary recommendations. Section D of the instrument contained&#xD;
      the 4-items Medication Adherence Questions (MAQ) while section E explored reason(s) for&#xD;
      non-adherence to medications, physical activity and dietary recommendations. Section F of the&#xD;
      instrument contained the components of educational intervention to resolve non-adherence&#xD;
      problems that were identified from the responses to questions in MAQ, IPAQ-SF and PDAQ among&#xD;
      patients in the intervention groups. Where necessary, at least one to two clinic appointment&#xD;
      was rescheduled to follow-up of the participants in the intervention group. The 6-months&#xD;
      post-baseline evaluation employed the same questions in sections B, C, D and E to re-assessed&#xD;
      participants in both control and intervention groups, to ascertain the possible change in&#xD;
      adherence status to recommended medications, physical activity and dietary management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation and Pre-test of Data Collection Instrument&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire was assessed for content validity by an endocrinologist and cardiologist in&#xD;
      UCH and three pharmacists in the academia in University of Ibadan who were knowledgeable&#xD;
      about diabetes mellitus and hypertension. A pre-test was caaried out among twenty-five T2D&#xD;
      and hypertensive patients in UCH who were subsequently excluded from the main study. The&#xD;
      pre-test was aimed at ascertaining the appropriateness of the data collection procedure as&#xD;
      well as the study design. Feedback from the pre-test was used to modified. Some questions on&#xD;
      physical activity which were rephrased as open-ended questions. In addition, some food items&#xD;
      in the PDAQ that are not native food of the studied population were replaced with their&#xD;
      indigenous food with similar calorie in accordance with official recommendations (Atkinson et&#xD;
      al., 2008; Evert et al., 2014) for better understanding of the partiicpants. Internal&#xD;
      consistency of the question-items in PDAQ and MAQ were determined using Cronbach alpha test&#xD;
      with values of 0.87 and 0.76, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrollment procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only eligible patients were approached while waiting to consult the attending physicians on&#xD;
      endocrinology clinic day of each hospital. At baseline, a total of 249 T2D and 262&#xD;
      hypertensive patients were approached, while 227 (91.2%) T2D and 248 (94.6%) hypertensive&#xD;
      patients consented to partake in the study from both hospitals within the study period. Every&#xD;
      participant had individualized baseline, and once the 6-months duration of enrolment into the&#xD;
      study is completed, then individual participation is terminated. At baseline, participants&#xD;
      were administered the questionnaire, while glycaemic status (HbA1c) and blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      were also assessed. However, at the end of the study period, a total of 201 (88.5%) T2D and&#xD;
      200 hypertensive patients completed the study and were those considered for data analysis, 26&#xD;
      (11.5%) T2D and 48 (19.3%) hypertensive patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 201 and 200&#xD;
      who competed the study, a total of 95 T2D patients had HbA1c &lt;7%, 120 hypertensive patients&#xD;
      had blood pressure &lt;140/90mmHg and were classified as control group, while 106 T2D patients&#xD;
      had HbA1c ≥7% and 80 hypertensive patients had blood pressure ≥140/90mmHg and were classified&#xD;
      as uncontrolled/intervention group using the ADA target for diabetes control (ADA, 2018) and&#xD;
      according to JNC-7 (Chobanian et al., 2003) respectively. Finger pin-prick blood assay of&#xD;
      glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was done using the clover A1C automated analyser ® (PTS&#xD;
      Diagnostics, IN, USA) point-of-care kit, while BP measurements using Omron® digital monitor&#xD;
      were taken on two separate occasions at few minutes interval and the average was recorded.&#xD;
      Patients' BP and HbA1c were also rechecked after 6-months of interaction to assess the extent&#xD;
      of change in the diabetes-specific clinical parameters and hypertension-clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedure participants were approached on their clinic days while waiting to&#xD;
      meet the physician at each clinic. the structured questionnaire was used to collected&#xD;
      baseline information from the participants. Reasons for non-adherence to medication (s) were&#xD;
      obtained if any of the questions in the MAQ was answered in affirmative. IPAQ -SF instrument&#xD;
      measures duration, frequency, intensity of physical activity in leisure-time, work, and doing&#xD;
      household tasks in the past seven days. Participants were classified as non-adherent and&#xD;
      adherent to recommended physical activity if he/she has less than 600 and above 600METs per&#xD;
      week respectively. Reasons for non-adherence/inability to achieve recommended MET per week&#xD;
      were obtained from such participant. Before recommending an increase in physical activity to&#xD;
      patients in the intervention group, the participant's current health status was put into&#xD;
      consideration based on the information provided by participant on the disease and other&#xD;
      comorbid condition(s) been managed for, such as arthritis, heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, participants were further evaluated for adherence to dietary recommendation for&#xD;
      their disease state using the modified Perceived Dietary Adherence Questionnaire (PDAQ)&#xD;
      (Appendix II). The cut off of 51 points of the total of 63 points indicated that the patient&#xD;
      have 80% adherence to dietary recommendation. Similarly, participants reason(s) for&#xD;
      non-adherence to recommended dietary management was also obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1c/B.P measurement was carried out to assess their clinical outcome at baseline and 6month&#xD;
      post-baseline to evaluate their clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-baseline individualized education (Intervention) Phase The individualized educational&#xD;
      intervention was check using Template for Intervention Description Replication (TIDiER) check&#xD;
      list&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individualized intervention was aimed at improving treatment adherence among patients in&#xD;
      the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individualized educational intervention was aimed at resolving non-adherence to therapy&#xD;
      (medication, diet and physical activity) deficit identified during the face-to-face interview&#xD;
      at the baseline. The hospital information leaflets provided for each patient at the hospital&#xD;
      clinics during registration which focused on recommended diet and physical activities was&#xD;
      employed to further explained the recommended therapy for the patients. Pharmacist who was&#xD;
      knowledgeable on the disease state by the virtue of training and several seminars and&#xD;
      workshops on diabetes and hypertension management carried out the face-to-face individualize&#xD;
      educational intervention. This was done at the clinics while the participants were waiting&#xD;
      for their turn to meet with the physician. At least participants were seen twice to ensure&#xD;
      their understanding of information provided for them and resolve any for of misunderstanding&#xD;
      that might have taken place. During the pretest, the project supervisor assessed the&#xD;
      intervention to ensure it was carried out as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention phase This phase of the study re-assessed the treatment adherence of all&#xD;
      the participants (both control and intervention group). Sections B, C, D, E and F of Appendix&#xD;
      II were re-assessed for both control and the intervention group, six months after the&#xD;
      educational intervention of the intervention group. This was done to assess if there is any&#xD;
      change in the measured parameters from what was obtained at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost estimation The direct medical costs associated with the treatment of diabetes and/or&#xD;
      hypertension for six months prior baseline and six months post-baseline were estimated. The&#xD;
      direct medical cost items included; cost of all outpatient clinic visit (consultation fee),&#xD;
      cost of medications, and cost of laboratory investigations associated with the disease state.&#xD;
      Cost of medication(s) was calculated using the daily dose for medications prescribed with&#xD;
      reference to the hospital pharmacy department tariff for the study year. Consultation fee is&#xD;
      the amount charged by the hospital for a consulting encounter with a physician. Other direct&#xD;
      non-medical costs included are; transportation cost to the hospital for patients based on&#xD;
      patient's residence and this was estimated using the NURTW tariff for the year of study.&#xD;
      Conversion of Nigeria Naira to US Dollar: ₦303 to 1 USD for the year 2017 was based on&#xD;
      conversion rate on currency converter (oando.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis All data was sorted, coded and entered into SPSS version 23.0 for analysis.&#xD;
      Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed for analysis. Descriptive a statistics&#xD;
      including frequencies, percentages, and means ± standard deviation were used to summarized&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      significance of change in continuous variables, especially the clinical parameters (such as&#xD;
      HbA1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure), physical activity performed weekly, adherence&#xD;
      to recommended diet at baseline and six month post-baseline were compared using paired sample&#xD;
      t-test and significance was set at P &lt;0.05. Cost of each cost items 6months prior baseline&#xD;
      and at 6months post-baseline for each disease state within and between the two facilities&#xD;
      were also compared using paired sample t-test. Total cost of management (including all direct&#xD;
      cost associated with the disease state) for each group in each disease state before and after&#xD;
      the intervention was evaluated with paired sample t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      McNemar test was used to evaluate for significant change in responses to MAQ items at&#xD;
      baseline and 6-months post-baseline. Chi-square (χ2) was used to test for association between&#xD;
      categorical variables (gender, age, educational qualifications and adherence status) at&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
