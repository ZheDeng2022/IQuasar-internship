      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To observe the efficacy of Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises applied after the Epley maneuver on&#xD;
      balance, vertigo symptoms, and quality of life in patients with posterior canal BPPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-blind randomized controlled study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-six patients were recruited in the study and were randomized equally into Epley&#xD;
      maneuver (EpleyM) and Epley maneuver and exercise (EpleyM&amp;Exe) groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were treated with the Epley maneuver, while CawthorneCooksey exercises were&#xD;
      given to the EpleyM&amp;Exe group as home exercises for 6 weeks. Static and dynamic balance,&#xD;
      vertigo and associated symptoms, and quality of life were assessed with the Nintendo Wii&#xD;
      Balance Board, Berg Balance Test, Vertigo Symptom Scale, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory,&#xD;
      respectively. The assessments were repeated at the 1st, 3rd, and 6th weeks.&#xD;

    <description>COP displacement on double leg with eyes open/closed (%): Lower scores (approaching 50%) indicate better static balance.&#xD;
Frontal plane stability on dominant leg with eyes open/closed (%): The total score ranges between 0 and 100%. Higher scores indicate better static balance.</description>

    <description>The Epley maneuver was performed for all patients (both EpleyM and EpleyM&amp;Exe groups) included in this study until nystagmus had disappeared in each position. If nystagmus/vertigo was not seen, the Epley maneuver was not performed for patients at the 1st, 3rd, and 6th week assessments.</description>

    <description>Additional Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises were prescribed to the EpleyM&amp;Exe group. The physiotherapist explained and demonstrated the exercises to each patient and the patients practiced the exercises until they performed them correctly. Then the exercises were prescribed twice a day and repeated 10 times for 6 weeks as a home exercise program.</description>
