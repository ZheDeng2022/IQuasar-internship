    <measure>Change of Vestibular pain index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and final assessment (3 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The Vestibular pain index is derived from the Q-tip test and the tampon test. A standardized Q-Tip test (MRC Systems GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), developed for quantitative sensoric testing, will be used. Pain on six defined anatomical regions of the vulvar vestibule (at 2 ,5,6,7,10 and 12 o clock) will be assessed. Patients will be asked to rate the level of vulvar pain on a numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 &quot;none at all&quot; to 10 &quot;worst imaginable&quot;.&#xD;
The tampon test is a standardized tampon insertion and removal test.&#xD;
The vestibular pain index will be calculated as follows:&#xD;
(mean NRS score of the standardized Q-tip test (6 sites) + NRS score during the tampon test) / 2</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Sexual activity</measure>

    <description>Participants will be asked to complete a study diary and record whether they experienced sexual intercourse. Possible answers are: #1-&quot;No, too painful&quot; indicating that the woman could not accept an approach to physical intimacy because of pain, #2 -&quot;No, not interested&quot;, indicating that the subject was not in the mood for sexual intimacy, #3-&quot;No,no opportunity&quot;, indicating that her partner was not available, #4-&quot;Yes&quot; meaning that an attempt at sexual intercourse was made.

    <intervention_name>Erbium:Yag laser</intervention_name>
    <description>Vulvovaginal laser therapies will be performed with the non-ablative 2940 nm Er:YAG laser (Smooth XS, Fotona, Slovenia) in the Renova mode according to the manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations. The spot size (diameter of the laser beam) is 7 mm, with a pulse at a frequency of 1.6 Hz, and a fluence (laser energy delivered per unit area) of 5.0 to 10.0 J/cm2.&#xD;
All sensitive/painful areas of the introitus will be treated, using 1-3 repetitions.&#xD;
In postmenopausal women with signs of atrophy, additional irradiation of the vaginal wall will be performed.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sham Erbium:Yag laser</intervention_name>
    <description>Clinical examination and preparations will be identical to the intervention group. Sham laser treatments will be performed with the same laser and the same procedures. However, a specially devised placebo probe with a steel shutter, which blocks the emission of radiation, will be used. Women will therefore receive no therapeutic irradiation. Before treatment, a study assistant, who is aware of the study allocation, will prepare the laser with the placebo probe, which looks identically to the &quot;normal&quot; probe. The treating physician will not be aware of the study allocation and the type of probe in use.</description>
