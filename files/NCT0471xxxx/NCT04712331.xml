      To investigate the effect of preoperative graduated abdominal exercises and Russian&#xD;
      stimulation on the abdominal muscles' strength after abdominoplasty. Sixty patients will&#xD;
      undergo abdominoplasty, their age ranged from 20 to 45 years, they were randomly distributed&#xD;
      into four equal groups. The ultrasonography was used to evaluate abdominal muscle thickness&#xD;
      as indicator for muscle strength at 4 occasions, initial assessment, pre-operative&#xD;
      assessment, 2 months post-operative assessment, and finally 4 months post-operative&#xD;
      assessment). For study group (A); received graduated abdominal exercises, group (B); received&#xD;
      Russian stimulation on abdominal muscles, group (c); received combination between graduated&#xD;
      abdominal exercises and Russian stimulation on abdominal muscles, the study groups received&#xD;
      the treatment protocol for 30 min., 3 times per week for 6 weeks preoperatively for control&#xD;
      group (D); were instructed to presume in normal activities of daily living preoperatively&#xD;
