  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A breast reconstruction after mastectomy, either due to breast cancer or a high lifetime risk&#xD;
      for cancer, is performed to increase the patient's quality of life. However, there are&#xD;
      studies that show that some women regret their decision to have breast reconstruction. There&#xD;
      are also studies demonstrating similarities in the general patterns of psychosocial&#xD;
      adjustment and quality of life among women with breast cancer who have undergone&#xD;
      breast-conserving surgery, mastectomy alone, and mastectomy combined with breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. Hence, it is unclear which women actually beneﬁt from a breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. The concept of quality of life is connected to patient satisfaction and body&#xD;
      image/investment. Therefore, the aim of this project is to examine the effects of patient&#xD;
      expectations and body image on the patient reported outcomes of breast reconstruction, to&#xD;
      improve preoperative information and postoperative care for women considering a breast&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with breast reconstruction measured with Breast Q reconstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Breast Q reconstruction includes two domains and six different modules: health-related quality of life (HR-QOL; including physical, psychosocial, and sexual well-being) and patient satisfaction (including satisfaction with breasts, outcome, and care). Each scale produces an independent score from 0-100. A higher score means greater satisfaction or better QOL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient expectations measured with Breast Q expectations</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Breast Q expectations.The scale consists of five modules: expectations for support from medical staff , expectations for pain, expectations for coping, expectations for breast appearance when clothed and expectations for breast sensation. The score for each independent scale range from 0-100. A higher score means greater expectations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body image measured with Multidimensional body-self relations questionnaire- appearance scales (MBSRQ-AS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>MBSRQ-AS - Multidimensional body-self relations questionnaire- appearance scales.It is a 34-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure appearance related components of body-image. In consists of five subscales: appearance evaluation, appearance orientation, body areas satisfaction, overweight preoccupation, and self-classified weight. It is a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 to 5.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body image investment measured with Appearance schemas inventory-revised (ASI-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ASI-R - Appearance schemas inventory-revised: is a 20-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure body-image investment. It consists of two subscales, self-evaluative salience (SES) and motivational salience (MS). It is a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Twelve items relate to SES and eight items relate to MS. The total score is the mean of the 20 items, and the score of the subscales is the mean of the items relating to each subscale. A high score indicates greater body-image investment.</description>

    <measure>Depression and anxiety measured with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>HADS - Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: is a 14-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to measure anxiety and depression. It has two domains, where seven items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. It is a 4-point Likert-scale ranging from 0-3. Each domain has a maximum score of 21. For both domains, scores of less than 7 indicate non-cases, whereas scores of 8-10 indicate mild anxiety or depression, 11-14 moderate and 15-21 severe.</description>
