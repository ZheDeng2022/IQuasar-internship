      First-in-disease, Phase 2A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      crossover clinical trial to determine the potential efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      ES-481 in adult patients with drug resistant epilepsy. The study will consist of five&#xD;
      periods.Participants will be randomly assigned to daily dosing of ES-481 or placebo based on&#xD;
      the randomization scheme. The proposed starting oral dose of study medication in each&#xD;
      treatment period is 25 mg qd in the morning and the proposed maximum dose is 75 mg bid.&#xD;

          2. The subject is a male or female 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject must have a history of drug resistant epilepsy (as per the ILAE&#xD;
             definition)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject must be taking 1 to 4 antiepileptic drugs (AED) and must be on a stable&#xD;
             dose of the AEDs for at least four (4) weeks prior to entering the 28-day screening&#xD;
             period&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If VNS implanted, the stimulation setting must have been stable for at least four&#xD;
             weeks prior to entering the 28-day screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject/legal guardian must be able to use the seizure dairy to record seizure&#xD;
             throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;

             average frequency of at least one (1) per hour on EEG recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For continued enrollment into Treatment Period 1, this will be confirmed by a 24-hour&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Current treatment for another significant medical disorder, such as diabetes, or heart&#xD;
             disease or an untreated disorder, that is discovered during the 28-day screening&#xD;
             period and might interfere with the study in the opinion of the Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. An abnormality on clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, EEG or ECG that&#xD;
             might increase the risks associated with trial participation or investigational&#xD;
             product administration, such as hepatic enzyme elevation greater than twice normal&#xD;
             and/or a GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History (within the last year) of iilicit drug use or alcohol dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
