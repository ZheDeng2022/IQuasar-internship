  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiologic studies have revealed a tremendous increase in the prevalence of pituitary&#xD;
      disease and related mortality worldwide. In order to meet all the challenges in the treatment&#xD;
      of pituitary disease in China, CAPASITY was founded in 2020. The objective of CAPASITY is to&#xD;
      launch a pituitary disease management model based on the Internet health information&#xD;
      platform. It allows the application and evaluation of pituitary disease treatment strategies&#xD;
      at multiple centers. The proprietary electronic medical database will help the dynamic&#xD;
      big-data analysis in epidemiology of pituitary disease, diagnosis, and treatment.&#xD;

      In order to meet all the challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of pituitary diseases in&#xD;
      China, CAPASITY was founded in 2020. With advanced medical equipment and Internet of Things&#xD;
      (IoT) technology, CAPASITY is committed to creating an online and offline integrated solution&#xD;
      for pituitary disease, and for the entire spectrum of pituitary disease, to achieve a more&#xD;
      convenient and precise model of care for patients. aiming to establish a platform with&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of pituitary disease and their long-term follow-up. It allows the&#xD;
      application and evaluation of treatment strategies at these centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of the present study is to establish a multi-center nationwide prospective&#xD;
           database of patients with pituitary adenomas to explore the epidemiology, biochemical,&#xD;
           and clinical outcome related to pituitary tumors and its complications, as well as other&#xD;
           pituitary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect cross-sectional data from patients seen and treated at each center so as to&#xD;
           evaluate: the current status of care of patients with pituitary disease and its related&#xD;
           complications, as well as other risk factors treatment strategies at multiple centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect the prospective data of patients treated at each center in order to evaluate&#xD;
           the strategies for the achievement of treatment goals, changes in management, control of&#xD;
           risk factors, incidence and progression of related clinical endpoints (including&#xD;
           mortality), behavioral changes, as well as QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be invited and initiated with a&#xD;
      comprehensive baseline evaluation at each CAPASITY center. Then patients will be followed by&#xD;
      clinical/laboratory visits on according to individualized patient's treatment plans. A&#xD;
      repeated comprehensive clinical and laboratory assessment for hormones and imaging, as well&#xD;
      as complications will be scheduled once a year.&#xD;
