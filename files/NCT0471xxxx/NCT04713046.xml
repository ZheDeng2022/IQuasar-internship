  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, haploidentical relatives of a patient with recurrent or metastatic HPV&#xD;
      16-associated malignancy will be vaccinated with a therapeutic human papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      vaccine series to generate HPV-specific leukocytes. The cancer patient with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic HPV16+ cancer will then be randomized to one of two arms: 1) non-myeloablative&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow transplant or 2) cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-depleted donor&#xD;
      lymphocyte infusion.&#xD;
