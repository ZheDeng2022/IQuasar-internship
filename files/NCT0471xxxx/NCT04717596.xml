    <textblock>
      This study is a hybrid trial that examines both the clinical effectiveness and the&#xD;
      implementation of BC4Teens Contraception Care. The investigators use a naturalistic one-group&#xD;
      longitudinal study design to maximize feasibility and external validity, which is important&#xD;
      for understanding implementation and effectiveness in real-world service delivery settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one in five American youth have experienced severe impairment due to mental&#xD;
      health disorders, with anxiety and mood disorders being most common among female adolescents.&#xD;
      Mental health disorders are associated with a range of sexual risk behaviors and unintended&#xD;
      pregnancy. Youth with mental health disorders have higher rates of condom and contraception&#xD;
      non-use (especially short acting), earlier sexual debut, and higher fertility rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avoiding an unwanted or unintended pregnancy is particularly important for women with&#xD;
      underlying mental health disorders. Experiencing a pregnancy exacerbates underlying mental&#xD;
      health disorders in women with mental health disorder. And children born out of an unintended&#xD;
      pregnancy or in context of mother with active mental health disorder face additional risks to&#xD;
      their wellbeing. Long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), i.e. contraceptive implants&#xD;
      and intrauterine devices, have attributes that may be particularly attractive to adolescents&#xD;
      with mental health disorders. In particular, they are highly effective and do not require&#xD;
      ongoing maintenance. However, adolescents with mental health disorders face multiple barriers&#xD;
      to accessing contraception care. Novel solutions are needed to improve access to&#xD;
      contraception care, including LARC, for adolescents with mental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inpatient pediatric hospitalization setting is a missed opportunity for improving&#xD;
      adolescent sexual and reproductive health. Nearly 10% of pediatric hospitalizations are for a&#xD;
      primary mental health diagnosis, and mood disorders are the most common primary mental health&#xD;
      diagnosis among these hospitalizations. Sexual and reproductive healthcare is rarely provided&#xD;
      to hospitalized adolescents. At Nationwide Children's Hospital, a chart audit completed in&#xD;
      December 2019 found that no adolescents hospitalized for mental health disorders on the&#xD;
      Hospital Pediatrics service had documentation they were screened for sexual activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents are interested in learning about sexual and reproductive health and receiving&#xD;
      sexual and reproductive healthcare in the hospital setting regardless of age, gender, and&#xD;
      prior sexual experiences. Two studies of pediatric hospitalists found that the majority of&#xD;
      those physicians felt that sexual and reproductive services are appropriate for hospitalized&#xD;
      adolescents, with high support for referrals and starting contraception in the hospital.&#xD;
      Numerous barriers to inpatient provision of contraceptives/sexual reproductive healthcare&#xD;
      were endorsed, including: concerns about follow up after discharge, lack of knowledge about&#xD;
      confidentiality, lack of knowledge about contraception, interference with the treatment plan,&#xD;
      time constraints, and pregnancy risk in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth. Riese&#xD;
      et al. conducted a trial of an interactive patient-facing electronic sexual health module and&#xD;
      found that it was acceptable to adolescents and their parents, and that most participants&#xD;
      requested a sexual health service after completing the module. (The most requested service&#xD;
      was viewing a contraception video made by this PI.) There are no published studies of&#xD;
      interventions to improve contraception care to hospitalized adolescents with mental health&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI designed an adolescent-friendly contraceptive counseling training course, called&#xD;
      BC4Teens Counseling, in use since 2014 by outpatient family planning clinicians in BC4Teens&#xD;
      Clinic at Nationwide Children's Hospital, the second largest children's hospital in the US.&#xD;
      BC4Teens Counseling is adapted from Contraceptive Choice Project materials and employs&#xD;
      efficacy-based counseling, which is endorsed by WHO and American Academy of Pediatrics. This&#xD;
      training will be adapted to current best practice recommendations, including shared-decision&#xD;
      making. The PI, with a multidisciplinary team, has also designed a comprehensive&#xD;
      Contraception Clinical Guideline, contraception initiation job aid, and electronic health&#xD;
      record order set with decision support for contraception initiation. These are currently used&#xD;
      in outpatient care across several departments at Nationwide Children's Hospital. The PI is a&#xD;
      Nexplanon Clinical Trainer and has extensive experience with clinical teaching on&#xD;
      contraception care and Nexplanon procedures, and this site is a Merck Center of Experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the following BC4Teens Contraception Care Intervention. All&#xD;
      healthcare professionals participating the intervention will receive training in the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BC4Teens Counseling is a set of adolescent-friendly contraception counseling and&#xD;
           provision protocols for all FDA-approved prescription contraceptives. The training&#xD;
           includes up-to-date information about maintaining adolescent confidentiality, coding,&#xD;
           and care for sexually transmitted infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nationwide Children's Contraception Clinical Guideline, a contraception initiation job&#xD;
           aid, and electronic health record order set and decision support for contraception&#xD;
           initiation. These materials are evidence-based and reference established best practices&#xD;
           for contraception care, pregnancy options counseling, and preconception care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nexplanon Clinical Training and credentialing in Nexplanon procedures during planning&#xD;
           phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about institutional policies, adolescent confidentiality and consent, and&#xD;
           local sexual health resources will be provided to participating healthcare&#xD;
           professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ongoing technical and procedural support from institutional BC4Teens expert trainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 2000 female adolescents with mental health disorders were hospitalized in 2019 at&#xD;
      Nationwide Children's Hospital. In February 2020 The Big Lots Behavioral Health Pavilion&#xD;
      (BHP) at Nationwide Children's Hospital opened its doors. The BHP is America's largest center&#xD;
      dedicated exclusively to child and adolescent behavioral and mental health on a pediatric&#xD;
      medical campus. Due to the impact of COVID and the simultaneous opening of the BHP,&#xD;
      adolescents with mental health disorders are now hospitalized differently within the&#xD;
      Nationwide Children's Hospital system than before. Presently at Nationwide Children's&#xD;
      Hospital adolescents with mental health disorders are admitted to the Psychiatry Unit, the&#xD;
      observation unit of the psychiatric crisis department, or the Youth Crisis Stabilization Unit&#xD;
      (YCSU). The investigators anticipate that once the initial COVID impact has passed,&#xD;
      adolescent patients with mental health disorders may overflow onto the Hospital Pediatrics&#xD;
      service within the main hospital as they previously did.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to examine an intervention to improve access to&#xD;
      contraception care among female adolescents hospitalized with mental health disorders within&#xD;
      Nationwide Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the investigators' long term goals is to scale-up effective contraceptive counseling&#xD;
      interventions like BC4Teens Contraception Care beyond Nationwide Children's Hospital to other&#xD;
      inpatient settings. This type of scale up has potential to expand the reach of contraceptive&#xD;
      care to a broader population of adolescent females with mental health concerns. However,&#xD;
      evidence-based psychosocial interventions sometimes fail to yield the same benefits observed&#xD;
      in controlled studies when they are transported to new settings. Limited resources, poor&#xD;
      alignment with organizational structures and missions, concerns about the interventions'&#xD;
      acceptability, and heterogeneity of patient needs and professional skill can lead to&#xD;
      difficulty delivering the intervention with fidelity (as it was intended with all core&#xD;
      components and at prescribed dosage). This &quot;voltage drop&quot; in intervention effectiveness as it&#xD;
      moves into routine care is often attributed to failure to optimize the intervention in its&#xD;
      new context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the secondary goal is to examine the strategies and processes used to&#xD;
      implement BC4Teens at Nationwide Children's Hospital, and create an implementation manual&#xD;
      that can be used to scale up this intervention in other settings. Thus, the investigators are&#xD;
      embedding a naturalistic observational study of BC4Teens implementation within the&#xD;
      effectiveness research. This study component will focus on specifying the procedures used to&#xD;
      tailor the intervention and training supports, and monitoring the outcomes of implementation&#xD;
      (including the degree to which professionals adopt BC4Teens, deliver it with fidelity, and&#xD;
      reach the target population). In addition to informing an implementation manual, these&#xD;
      results will also advance understanding of the model including the degree to which the model&#xD;
      must be delivered as intended in order to generate clinical benefit, identify types of&#xD;
      professionals best suited for delivering BC4Teens, and patients for whom this intervention is&#xD;
      considered acceptable.&#xD;
