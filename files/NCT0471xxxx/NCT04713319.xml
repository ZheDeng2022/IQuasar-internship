    <textblock>
      Altogether a 25-day study. First 4 days non-blinded with water before 0-control blood samples&#xD;
      (Day0). Thereafter blinded for 21 days (3 weeks). Study group was apparently healthy 50-60&#xD;
      -year-old males and females (N=27).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Blinded 21-day period was divided into two sub-periods (7 days and 14 days) and it included 3&#xD;
      measurement days. All measurements were on the same day of each week to facilitate maximal&#xD;
      comparability (Day0, Day7 and Day21). Additionally on Day0 and Day7 there were acute&#xD;
      measurements 45 minutes after morning &quot;non-acute&quot; resting and fasting blood samples. (In a&#xD;
      &quot;non-acute&quot; measurement last dose of Panavital or placebo was taken 12 hours before the&#xD;
      &quot;non-acute&quot; blood sample collected next morning .)&#xD;
&#xD;
      First week started with Day0 baseline measurements and immediately thereafter a strenuous&#xD;
      VO2max test with 2 recovery days thereafter. After full recovery a 4-day blinded Panavital&#xD;
      regimen. Last &quot;non-acute&quot; dose on Day6 was taken 12 hours before Day7 morning blood sample.&#xD;
      At Day7 an acute 45 min placebo comparison was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter a 14-day follow-up period with halved Panavital dose or Placebo. Altogether 5&#xD;
      arterial blood samples were withdrawn. Three fasting and resting &quot;non-acute&quot; samples were&#xD;
      taken in the morning before any treatments at Day0, Day7 and Day21. Two acute samples were&#xD;
      collected after the VO2max (Day1) and after acute Panavital or placebo doses (Day7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally 5 fingertip blood samples for glucose (and lactate) were taken at the same time&#xD;
      as arterial samples (Day0 and Day7) and one fingertip sample was taken immediately at the end&#xD;
      of VO2max.&#xD;
