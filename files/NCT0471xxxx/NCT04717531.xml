  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assesses the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment with pyrotinib and trastuzumab with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, mainly pathological complete response (pCR) rates in the breast and axilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And also assesses side effects, event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS),&#xD;
      distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and objective response rates (ORR).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Investigational Medical Products (IMPs) will be pyrotinib (B), trastuzumab (H), pertuzumab&#xD;
      (P), docetaxel (T), epirubicin (E), and cyclophosphamide (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed at baseline and 2 cycles after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel (THP*2). Non-objective response patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 2 cycles of pyrotinib and trastuzumab with&#xD;
      docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of pyrotinib and epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (THB*2-ECB[epirubicine, cyclophosphamide, and pyrotinib]*4, cohort A), or 2 cycles of&#xD;
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab with docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin plus&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (THP*2-EC*4, cohort B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the neoadjuvant therapy, the side effects and all the events were recorded and&#xD;
      analyzed. After surgery, the efficacy of pCR rate and ORR were analyzed. And long time&#xD;
      follow-up will also be performed to analyze EFS, DFS, DDFS, and ORR.&#xD;
