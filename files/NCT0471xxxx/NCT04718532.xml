      With the advent of the era of precision medicine, based on FFA image deep learning to&#xD;
      identify the area of fundus lesions, registration of fundus images, according to the severity&#xD;
      of fundus diseases to design the optimal laser energy and path, the accurate treatment of&#xD;
      fundus diseases has urgent clinical needs and very important significance&#xD;

      1. Structured DR Image Database Construction and accurate annotation: retrospective (from&#xD;
           January 1, 2016 to the day of ethical review) and prospective (from the day of ethical&#xD;
           review to December 31, 2023) collected FFA and other multimodal image data. Several&#xD;
           ophthalmologists and senior experts of fundus diseases made diagnostic evaluation on&#xD;
           each image of each patient and completed the accurate grading diagnosis of the data&#xD;
           Finally, a structured Dr database was established step by step. This paper uses the&#xD;
           theory of computer vision to quantify the quality distortion of FFA image, guides the&#xD;
           computer to configure the existing image enhancement and noise reduction algorithms&#xD;
           adaptively, and completes the preprocessing of fundus image data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Construction of Dr intelligent grading diagnosis system based on fundus image: firstly,&#xD;
           the fundus image is used as the fundus data training database, and according to the&#xD;
           international clinical Dr grading diagnosis standard, many doctors mark the fundus image&#xD;
           accurately. International clinical Dr grading criteria: grade 0, no obvious retinal&#xD;
           abnormalities; grade 1, only microangioma; grade 2, more severe than microangioma, but&#xD;
           less severe than severe; grade 3, four quadrants, each quadrant has more than 20 retinal&#xD;
           hemorrhage, more than two quadrants have definite venous beads, more than one quadrant&#xD;
           has obvious Irma, no signs of proliferative retinopathy; grade 4, neovascularization,&#xD;
           vitreous hemorrhage Volume blood, pre retinal hemorrhage. On the basis of Dr grading&#xD;
           intelligent diagnosis standard, convolution neural network is constructed to train and&#xD;
           grade fundus images. After repeating this process many times for each image in the&#xD;
           training set of fundus images, the deep learning system learns how to classify all the&#xD;
           data in the training set to accurately diagnose the fundus images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Convolution neural network construction for FFA image focus area: the convolution neural&#xD;
           network of deep learning is composed of millions of parameters, which is used to train&#xD;
           and perform given tasks. The output generated by each linear convolution operation is&#xD;
           regularized by nonlinear activation function, combined with the dimensionality reduction&#xD;
           of pooling layer and full connection layer, so that the optimization process of deep&#xD;
           neural network not only overcomes the gradient dispersion, but also helps to generate&#xD;
           features similar to the hierarchical perception mechanism of human neural cells to&#xD;
           visual signals. The FFA image is used as the fundus data training database. Based on the&#xD;
           accurate labeling of the lesion area (no perfusion area, microangioma area and leakage&#xD;
           area), the FFA image needs to be treated for the intelligent recognition of the lesion&#xD;
           area. In the training process, the parameters of the neural network are initially set to&#xD;
           random values. Then, for each image, the results given by the function are compared with&#xD;
           the known results of the training set to optimize the parameters of the function. After&#xD;
           repeating this process many times for each image in the training data set, the deep&#xD;
           learning system learned how to classify all the data in the training set to accurately&#xD;
           predict the Dr lesions on FFA images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Construction of intelligent fundus laser navigation model based on FFA image and fundus&#xD;
           image registration: the Dr lesion intelligent recognition system on the above FFA image&#xD;
           accurately identifies the areas that need fundus laser treatment, helps doctors&#xD;
           determine the lesions that need to be treated, and based on the image matching of&#xD;
           machine learning, provides the registration image of fundus image and FFA combination,&#xD;
           which is set according to the location and size information of the lesion area According&#xD;
           to the matching retinal diameter and the arrangement of different laser spots, the&#xD;
           personalized laser treatment scheme is formulated, and the intelligent fundus laser&#xD;
           treatment guidance model is constructed.&#xD;
