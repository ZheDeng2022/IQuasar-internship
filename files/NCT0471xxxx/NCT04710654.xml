    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of a more comprehensive behavioral treatment, physical&#xD;
      activity and exercise program, as well as CTM and IF current stimulation approaches at&#xD;
      different frequencies on functional constipation symptoms and quality of life, compared to&#xD;
      their counterparts in the literature.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional constipation (FC), which is characterized by conditions such as excessive&#xD;
      straining and difficulty in defecation, infrequent bowel movements, and incomplete&#xD;
      defecation, is a common bowel disease that causes activity limitation and decrease in quality&#xD;
      of life in children and adults, regardless of an organic etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there are studies showing the effectiveness of different physiotherapy&#xD;
      approaches such as behavioral therapy, exercise, neuromodulation applications, kinesiotape,&#xD;
      abdominal massage in FC, and investigate and compare the effectiveness of connective tissue&#xD;
      manipulation (CTM) and interferential (IF) current stimulation applied in addition to&#xD;
      behavioral therapy and exercise program. But there was any study which compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these physiotherapy methods with each other and IF current stimulation at&#xD;
      different frequencies (100 Hz and 0-100 Hz). In addition, there are no randomized controlled&#xD;
      studies comparing the current effects of IF applied at 100 Hz and 0-100 Hz in individuals&#xD;
      with FC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment methods to be applied in this study are behavioral therapy, physical activity&#xD;
      and exercise program, CTM and IF current stimulation applied at a frequency of 100 Hz and&#xD;
      0-100 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic method to be used is based on the Rome IV FC Criteria and the Bristol Stool&#xD;
      Form Scale.&#xD;

    <measure>change in severity and symptoms of constipation</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be applied intervention program for four weeks. Change in severity and symptoms of constipation will be assessed at the baseline, the end of the four-week intervention program and after one month intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Turkish version of Constipation Severity Instrument (CSI) will be used to evaluate the severity of the constipation. The Constipation Severity Instrument is a 16-item patient-reported outcome measure that investigates symptoms of constipation based on frequency, severity, and bother of symptoms. CSI consists of three subscales: obstructive defecation, colonic inertia and pain.&#xD;
Higher scores of CSI indicate more severe constipation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be applied intervention program for four weeks. Change in quality of life will be assessed at the baseline, the end of the four-week intervention program and after one month intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Turkish version of Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAC-QOL) will be used to evaluate quality of life. PAC-QOL consists a total of 28 items in four subscales: worries and concerns (11 items), physical discomfort (4 items), psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and satisfaction (5 items). Higher scores of PAC-QOL indicate more negative effects of constipation on the quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>bowel diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be applied intervention program for four weeks. Bowel diary will be assessed at the baseline, the end of the four-week intervention program and after one month intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Before and after treatment, bowel habits will be evaluated with a seven-day Bowel Diary. Intestinal diary with date and time, food/drink consumed, medication (type + amount), bowel urgency? (Rate 1 mild - 3 strong), pain and discomfort (1: mild, 3: strong), voiding time, Bristol Stool Scale Type will be recorded if there is any accident / leak.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>physical activity level</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be applied intervention program for four weeks. The physical activity level will be assessed at the baseline, the end of the four-week intervention program and after one month intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Turkish-International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) will be used to evaluate level of physcial activity of participants. The IPAQ-SF is a self-reported measure consists of seven items. It asks four intensity levels: vigorous-intensity activities, moderate-intensity activities, walking and sitting. The total score is the summation of the duration and frequency of walking, moderate-intensity, and vigorous-intensity activity. The total score was reported as &quot;Metabolic Equivalent of Task-min/week.&quot; The sitting time is reported separately as &quot;h/day.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>treatment satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>The end of the four-week intervention program</time_frame>
    <description>The level of satisfaction with the treatment will be evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). On the 10 cm long line, the starting point will be determined as 0 cm &quot;not at all satisfied&quot; and 10 cm poin indicated &quot;very satisfied&quot;. The distances of the points marked on the VAS to the 0 cm point will be measured and recorded with a ruler.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>stool consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline, the end of the four-week intervention program and after one month intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>The Bristol Stool Scale (BGS) will be used evaluate stool consistency. The stool form is sensitive to the change in transit time. Type 1=separate hard lumps, like nuts; Type 2= gnarled, hard sausage but lumpy; Type 3=cracks on the surface like sausage; Type 4=Soft, smooth, sausage-like; Type 5=separate soft parts; Type 7=classified as liquid without solid particles. While Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation, Types 6 and 7 inflammation, Type 3 and Type 4 are considered normal.</description>
