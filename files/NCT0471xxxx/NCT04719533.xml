    <textblock>
      To compare short- and long-term outcomes of women following episiotomy during the second&#xD;
      stage of labor, following marking of episiotomy location during the first stage of labor with&#xD;
      those of women who underwent episiotomy without marking.&#xD;

      Purpose: To compare short- and long-term outcomes of women following episiotomy during the&#xD;
      second stage of labor, following marking of episiotomy location during the first stage of&#xD;
      labor with those of women who underwent episiotomy without marking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Women following episiotomy following pre-marking of the location will suffer from&#xD;
      fewer short- and long-term complications compared to those without pre-marked episiotomy&#xD;
      location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type: prospective randomized-controlled trial&#xD;
