    <textblock>
      ROS1 translocated Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a rare type of lung cancer with few&#xD;
      datas. We collected datas concerning patients with ROS1 translocated NSCLC who received&#xD;
      Brigatinib in the Compassionate Access after two others Tyrosine kinase Inhibitors&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death in&#xD;
      Western countries. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most usual form (80-85%) of lung&#xD;
      cancers. Unfortunately, at the time of diagnosis, most patients present with metastatic or&#xD;
      advanced disease. Significant advances have been made in recent years on knowledge of&#xD;
      oncogenesis of NSCLC in particularly the discovery of specific oncogenic drivers playing key&#xD;
      role in oncogenic addiction responsible for the occurrence of NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROS1 translocation is found in1 to 2 % of non small cell lung cancer. Due to this rare&#xD;
      subtype of cancer, we have few datas. ROS1 translocation is found in a rather younger&#xD;
      population, with a predominance of woman and non smoker. ROS1 translocation can be detected&#xD;
      by immunohistochemistry and confirmed by FISH or RNA fusion technics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crizotinib demonstrated his interest in the phase 1 trial PROFILE 1001 with an objective&#xD;
      response rate of 72% tested on 52 patients, the median progression free survival was 19,3&#xD;
      months, overall survival of 51% at 48 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar datas were found in different cohortes. A chinese study of 23 patients receiving&#xD;
      crizotinib, the objective response rate was 56,5%, a median progression free survival of 14,5&#xD;
      months. A european retrospective cohorte EUROS1 of 30 patients receiving crizotinib found a&#xD;
      progression free survival of 9,1 months, an objective response rate of 80% . A prospective&#xD;
      european study EUCROSS included 34 patients with an objective response rate of 70% and a&#xD;
      progression free survival of 20 months. The Acsé crizotinib cohorte included 37 patients ROS1&#xD;
      translocated, the objective response rate was lower at 47,2% in this study with heavily&#xD;
      pretreated population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ceritinib has been studied in a phase 2 study of 32 patients in whom 30 patients where&#xD;
      treatment naifs of crizotinib, the objective response rate was 62%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lorlatinib was studied in a phase1-2 trial, including 69 ROS1 patients, 21 were TKI naifs, 40&#xD;
      pretreated with crizotinib and 8 treated with one or two others TKI, with objective response&#xD;
      rate of 62% in the naive population, and 41% on the entire cohorte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, Entrectinib demonstrated his interest in a pooled study of 3 trial, 53&#xD;
      patients were ROS1 translocated and had an objective response rate of 77% with this new&#xD;
      molecule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few datas are available about brigatinib in ROS1 translocated patients, only three patients&#xD;
      ROS1 were included in the brigatinib phase 1 trial. The aim of this study is to obtain more&#xD;
      datas of efficacy, safety, among patients receiving Brigatinib with the compationnate access&#xD;
      in France&#xD;
