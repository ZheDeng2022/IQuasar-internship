  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to compare the fear of falling induced by each type of virtual&#xD;
      scene (rocking and translation). Fear of falling will be assessed by a numerical fear of&#xD;
      falling scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits for the participants would be the discovery of Virtuel Reality, the awareness of&#xD;
      their fear of falling and its repercussions on posture and, if necessary, referral to&#xD;
      specialized rehabilitation centers. This study will provide evidence on the context of the&#xD;
      emergence of the fear of falling in order to propose, in perspective, appropriate&#xD;
      rehabilitation management procedures.&#xD;

      This bicentric study will proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete clinical examination, carried out as part of your consultation in a day&#xD;
           hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a virtual reality session of about 2 hours. This session will take place as&#xD;
           follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Wear a virtual reality headset. The helmet is compatible with the wearing of&#xD;
                glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  View a virtual scene for two minutes in order to familiarize yourself with the&#xD;
                device. This first viewing will be followed by a 10 minute break.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Then the patient will be placed on a rectangular platform (Wii Balance Board - WBB)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Give the virtual reality headset again to the patient, who will view a 2-minute&#xD;
                series of a series of 2 minutes in a standing position comprising a moving virtual&#xD;
                environment (one tilting forward and another in forward translation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After a 10 minute break, the session will continue with 4 other sets of 5 minutes&#xD;
                duration (5 times 1 minute of a forward tilt or forward translation scene). These 4&#xD;
                series will be separated by 10 min break&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During each break, the patient participating in the study will complete a&#xD;
                questionnaire on the possible side effects of virtual reality (cybermalaise).&#xD;
