      Chronic pain is pain that exceeds the duration of the injury or trigger stimulus and lasts&#xD;
      for at least three months. Recent studies show that chronic pain has devastating effects on&#xD;
      cognitive functions by causing emotional stress, anxiety, and depression.The studies show&#xD;
      that chronic pain affects certain cognitive areas. These areas are; processing speed,&#xD;
      short-term memory, longterm memory, inhibitory control and working memory. In addition,&#xD;
      task-oriented studies show that chronic pain affects not single tasks, but rather dual tasks&#xD;
      that require the use of complex cognitive function (executive function). 40-60% of&#xD;
      rheumatologic patients do not have sufficient relief in their pain. For this reason, dual&#xD;
      task performance may be affected in individuals diagnosed with rheumatological disease,&#xD;
      secondary to the impairment of cognition. In the literature, there are only limited studies&#xD;
      showing dual-task performance effects in individuals diagnosed with fibromyalgia and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. However, chronic pain is the main health problem that prevents mobility&#xD;
      restriction and participation in all rheumatic diseases. In addition, there is no study&#xD;
      investigating the dual task performance effect in rheumatic diseases in a comprehensive way.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the effect of rheumatic diseases on&#xD;
      dual-task performance by comparing it with the control group.&#xD;

      Pain is an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or potential&#xD;
      tissue damage and is classified as acute or chronic. Acute pain is felt for a short time&#xD;
      after an injury or harmful stimulus and is considered part of a defense strategy; It points&#xD;
      to an active danger to the organism. Chronic pain that exceeds the duration of the injury or&#xD;
      trigger stimulus and lasts for at least three months. Recent studies show that chronic pain&#xD;
      has devastating effects on cognitive functions by causing emotional stress, anxiety, and&#xD;
      depression. Studies show that chronic pain affects certain cognitive areas. These areas are;&#xD;
      processing speed, short-term memory, long-term memory, inhibitory control and working memory.&#xD;
      In addition, task-oriented studies show that chronic pain affects not simple tasks, but&#xD;
      rather dual tasks that require the use of complex cognitive function (executive function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task; it is a behavior, skill or ability that needs to be done. The simple (single) task&#xD;
      contains only one alert or task. For example, walking. Dual task requires the simultaneous&#xD;
      performance of two different tasks that can be measured independently and have different&#xD;
      goals. For example, calculating while walking at the same time. In rehabilitation approaches,&#xD;
      single or dual task trainings are applied. Among physiotherapy and rehabilitation approaches,&#xD;
      single task training consists only of exercises involving motor performance; Dual task&#xD;
      trainings can consist of different exercise combinations that require two different tasks to&#xD;
      be performed at the same time as motor + motor, cognitive + cognitive or motor + cognitive&#xD;
      performances. The clinical benefit of dual task training is that most of the daily living&#xD;
      activities are done in dual task conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain is a common health problem associated with most rheumatic diseases. It is pain&#xD;
      that lasts for at least 3 months and cannot be completely relieved with standard pain&#xD;
      medication. 40-60% of rheumatologic patients do not have sufficient relief in their pain. For&#xD;
      this reason, dual-task performance may be affected in individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      rheumatological disease, secondary to the impairment of cognition. In the literature, there&#xD;
      are only limited studies showing dual-task performance effects in individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis. However, chronic pain is the main health problem that&#xD;
      prevents mobility restriction and participation in all rheumatic diseases. In addition, there&#xD;
      is no study investigating the dual task performance effect in rheumatic diseases in a&#xD;
      comprehensive way. Therefore, the aim of thestudy is to investigate the effect of rheumatic&#xD;
      diseases on dual-task performance by comparing it with the control group.&#xD;

    <description>10 Meter Walking Test: It is applied by walking at a normal walking speed (like walking in a shopping mall) without any assistance at a marked distance of 10 meters.&#xD;
1- Evaluation of walking under single task conditions is done with the 10 Meter Walk Test and without any cognitive or motor second task. Evaluation of walking under dual task conditions is applied in two different ways: 2-adding a cognitive task to the walking motor task (motor + cognitive dual task) 3-adding one more motor task to the walking motor task (motor + motor dual task). While performing dual tasks, the time-distance (walking speed, cadence, stride length) characteristics of the gait are recorded using with wearable gait device.</description>
