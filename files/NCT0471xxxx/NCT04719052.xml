  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is one of the main public health problems worldwide, reaching 18%&#xD;
      among young people between 5 and 19 years of age in 2016. One possibility of effective&#xD;
      treatment can be the Mediterranean diet (MD). Therefore, it is proposed to carry out a&#xD;
      nutritional intervention based on this diet to more effectively reduce obesity in&#xD;
      adolescents. The main purpose of this multicentre study is to assess whether an&#xD;
      energy-restricted Mediterranean-style diet (MD) intervention including healthy products from&#xD;
      the Mediterranean basin (mixed nuts, pomegranate and hummus) and sourdough bread is more&#xD;
      effective against obesity and associated CVD risk factors than a conventional low-fat diet&#xD;
      carrying out a multicentre nutritional and clinical intervention study specifically targeting&#xD;
      obese/overweight adolescents (13-17y) from different Mediterranean countries; all combined&#xD;
      with an educational web-application designed to encourage healthy behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a multicenter, randomized, controlled intervention study conducted with adolescents&#xD;
      with obesity/overweight ≥90 percentile who do not suffer from any chronic disease. 240&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited from three Mediterranean countries: Italy (Parma), Portugal&#xD;
      (Coimbra) and Spain (Reus), specifically 80 participants per country, 40 adolescents as an&#xD;
      intervention group and 40 as a control group, in Reus. The intervention study is scheduled to&#xD;
      begin in January 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive a diet based on the characteristics of MD, and will be&#xD;
      reinforced with satisfying and healthy Mediterranean foods such as sourdough bread (2&#xD;
      servings of 50-60g / day), squeezed pomegranate (4 servings of 200ml / week),&#xD;
      hummus/chickpeas (2 portions of chickpeas of 150-200g / week, one in hummus format) and mixed&#xD;
      nuts (4 servings of 30g / week); and the control group will receive a recommended diet based&#xD;
      on the consumption of low-fat foods. A caloric restriction of 20% of the total energy&#xD;
      requirements will be applied to both groups in adolescents with BMI ≥95 percentile (obesity)&#xD;
      and a caloric restriction &lt;20% of the total energy requirements will be applied in&#xD;
      adolescents with BMI ≥90 to &lt;95th percentile according to overweight (gender/age / physical&#xD;
      activity). The diet will be applied for 4 months in both groups. Adolescents from both groups&#xD;
      will be given a motivational interview and will be provided with an educational website that&#xD;
      will be used during the intervention, through which they will learn.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal outcome is BMI z-score, a standardized measure of BMI based on the specific age&#xD;
      and gender norms. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated by comparing the&#xD;
      BMI z-score between the control (low-fat diet) and intervention (MD) groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are: Adherence to the DM, KidMed questionnaire; Level of physical&#xD;
      activity, PAQ-A questionnaire; Habit/food intake: 3-day dietary record, Helena study food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire, Knowledge about food and nutrition, a questionnaire from Helena's&#xD;
      study; Quality of life, kid screen-27 Index; Sociodemographic data of the parents;&#xD;
      Anthropometric data: weight, height, BMI, body composition, waist circumference, waist-hip&#xD;
      ratio; Clinical variables: blood pressure, Biochemical variables and omic determinations: in&#xD;
      urine, blood and feces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, the adolescents will receive 5 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 pre-selection visit (to check inclusion / exclusion criteria in the study) (V0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 inclusion visit (V1) in which stool, urine, and blood samples will be collected,&#xD;
           anthropometric measurements (such as weight and waist circumference) and blood pressure&#xD;
           will be taken, and questionnaires and records will be answered dietary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 follow-up visit (V2), at 2 months, in which anthropometric and blood pressure&#xD;
           measurements will be taken and questionnaires and dietary records will be answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 final visit (V3), at 4 months, in which stool, urine, and blood samples will be&#xD;
           collected, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements will be made, and&#xD;
           questionnaires and dietary records will be answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 post-intervention follow-up visit (V4), 4 months after the end of the intervention, in&#xD;
           which anthropometric and blood pressure measurements will be taken and questionnaires&#xD;
           and dietary records will be answered.&#xD;

    <description>1) The MD will be based on high consumption of unsaturated fat from vegetable sources (virgin olive oil and nuts) and minimally processed plant foods (vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), low consumption of meat (especially red and processed meats) and sweets, and moderate consumption of fish and dairy products (mainly yoghurt and cheese). Accordingly, this diet will provide a high amount of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, fibre and phenolic compounds.&#xD;
Adolescents in the MD group will replace the intake of conventional breads by sourdough bread consumption (2 servings of 50-60 g daily) and incorporate into their diet chickpeas (2 servings of 150 g/week chickpeas, minimum one of them in hummus format), and they will consume at least another serving of legumes which can be chickpeas or another legume), pomegranate juice (4 servings of 200ml/week) and mixed nuts (4 servings of 30 g/week).</description>
