  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Registry and Natural History Study for Early Onset Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is&#xD;
      focused on gathering longitudinal clinical data as well as biological samples (skin and/or&#xD;
      blood and/or saliva) from male or female patients who exhibited onset of HSP symptoms at 18&#xD;
      years old or younger with (1) a clinical diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraplegia and/or&#xD;
      (2) the presence of variants in HSP related genes and/or be a relative of a person with such&#xD;
      a diagnosis. Currently, the treatment for this disorder is generally symptomatic and&#xD;
      available therapies improve quality of life, but are grossly inefficient in slowing the&#xD;
      disease progression. Access to the registry information will be limited to the study staff&#xD;
      who are responsible for recruitment and maintenance of the registry. We hope that recruitment&#xD;
      into registry for studies will advance knowledge of the causes, clinical course, diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of these conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of more than 80 neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases that lead to progressive neurological decline. Collectively, the HSPs present the&#xD;
      most common cause of inherited spasticity and associated disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to delineate the core clinical, imaging, and molecular features of pediatric onset&#xD;
      hereditary spastic paraplegia. This registry and natural history study will facilitate an&#xD;
      early diagnosis, enables counseling and anticipatory guidance of affected families and will&#xD;
      help define clinically meaningful endpoints for future interventional trials. Samples will be&#xD;
      collected for the purpose of molecular and cellular investigation that will help identify&#xD;
      biomarkers and novel targets for therapy. The samples and clinical information will be housed&#xD;
      in the Translational Neuroscience Center and a secure REDcap database, respectively; both&#xD;
      located in Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), but will be available to investigators around&#xD;
      the world after approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this protocol are to (1) To systematically document the clinical&#xD;
      presentation and natural history of early-onset forms of HSP and (2) To facilitate an early&#xD;
      diagnosis, enable counseling and anticipatory guidance of affected families and help define&#xD;
      clinically meaningful endpoints for future interventional traits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Create a registry to perform an initial cross sectional analysis of clinical, imaging&#xD;
           and molecular data to establish the disease spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Create a repository of biological samples and collection of longitudinal clinical data&#xD;
           that helps establish the natural history of early onset HSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Create a registry that allows for re- identification and re-contact of participants by&#xD;
           appropriate investigators.&#xD;
