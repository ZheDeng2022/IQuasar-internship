  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral Intravenous Cannulation (PIVC), one of the most common therapeutic procedures in&#xD;
      medical care, can be difficult even for experienced medical practitioners. The pain of&#xD;
      intravenous cannulation is considered the major limitation in pediatric clinical care.&#xD;
      Reducing the pain of intravenous cannulation has been the motive for many investigations.&#xD;
      Intervention methods used to reduce the distress related to painful procedures are widely&#xD;
      recommended. The management of pain and anxiety is more essential because it may modify&#xD;
      children's memory for procedural pain and the subsequent acceptance of later health care&#xD;
      painful interventions. Distraction is the most studied psychological technique to relieve&#xD;
      venipuncture-related pain and distress, with strong evidence supporting its efficacy in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Art therapy commonly used to reduce pain and anxiety of children's disease but was not used&#xD;
      in reducing distress outcomes of painful procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We used a collection of the image need for coloring and tracing called Trace Image and&#xD;
      Coloring for Kids-Book (TICK-B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to exam the effectiveness of TICK-B in decreasing pain and&#xD;
      anxiety during cannulation.&#xD;
