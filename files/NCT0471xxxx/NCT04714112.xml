  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexamethasone has been tested as an effective adjuvant to prolong the effect of local&#xD;
      anesthetics for peripheral nerve blocks, both perineurally and intravenously. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the effect of the addition of dexamethasone (5mg) at different&#xD;
      time to a standard ropivacaine solution (0.5%) on analgesic duration of interscalene block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) is regarded as the standard of care for anesthesia&#xD;
      and analgesia for shoulder surgery by providing the superior analgesia and reducing opioid&#xD;
      consumption. After several hours when the effects of single injection ISB wear off, the&#xD;
      patients often suffer moderate to severe pain of the surgical insult and required strong&#xD;
      opioid analgesia. Efforts to prolong ISB duration by adding adjuvants to local anesthetic&#xD;
      (eg. clonidine, dexmedetomidine) have been studied with promising results. Dexamethasone, has&#xD;
      been added to local anesthetic solutions for ISB and has demonstrated promise in preliminary&#xD;
      studies. Perineural dexamethasone (8-10mg) in conjunction with local anesthetic prolongs the&#xD;
      duration of ISB with an effect sizes ranging from 40% to 75% (absolute effect ~ 6 to 10&#xD;
      hours). Dexamethasone, however, is only approved for intramuscular or intravenous&#xD;
      administration and therefore perineural use is currently off-label. Intravenous&#xD;
      administration of dexamethasone was reported to have similar effects as perineural route&#xD;
      indicating the possible mechanism for prolonging analgesic duration might be due to the&#xD;
      systemic effects of dexamethasone. We hypothesized: should that is the reason, systemic&#xD;
      administration of dexamethasone at different time may provide similar effects on the duration&#xD;
      of peripheral nerve block. Dexamethasone is a slow effect cortisone with long half-time, it&#xD;
      is widely used at the beginning of surgery to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. A&#xD;
      trial that demonstrates enhanced block quality and duration associated with intravenous&#xD;
      dexamethasone at different time may allow us to achieve prolonged duration of effect if&#xD;
      dexamethasone is used in perioperative period for different purpose. This would further&#xD;
      identify the possible mechanism of dexamethasone to prolong the analgesia effect of local&#xD;
      anesthetics.&#xD;
