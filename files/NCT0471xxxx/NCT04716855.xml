  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most important factors affecting the quality of life. The quality of life&#xD;
      of patients with pain and restricted shoulder movements can be affected in patients with&#xD;
      Rotator Cuff Syndrome (RCS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to examine the effect of the pain on functional status, quality of&#xD;
      life and physical activity levels in daily life activities of RCS patients.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 min</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to convert some values that cannot be measured numerically to digital. Two end definitions of the parameter to be evaluated are written on both ends of a 100 mm line and the patient is asked to indicate where his condition is appropriate by drawing a line or by placing a point or pointing on this line. In this study, the severity of pain was questioned as 1- Night pain 2- Rest pain 3- Activity pain 4- Lift pain and it was marked separately for each situation.</description>

    <measure>The Shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Quick-DASH&quot; (The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score) questionnaire, which is the short form of the &quot;DASH&quot; questionnaire, was used to determine the level of activity and engagement from the upper side. The Turkish reliability and validity study of the questionnaire was carried out by Düger et al.. Each answer is scored from 1 to 5 from good to bad; 1: no difficulty, 2: mild difficulty, 3: moderate difficulty, 4: extreme difficulty, 5: not being able to do it at all. A score between 0-100 (0 = no disability, 100 = maximum disability) is obtained from each part of the Quick-DASH questionnaire.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form SF-36 was used to evaluate the quality of life. SF-36 consists of 8 sub-dimensions consisting of 36 items in which physical and mental health is evaluated. The Turkish reliability and validity study of the questionnaire was carried out by Koçyiğit et al. [21]. There are two main subsections belonging to SF-36. In the physical health components subsection are included Physical function (PF), physical role (PR), body pain (BP) and general health status (GHS) sub-dimensions. Sub-dimensions related to mental health status are stated as vitality (VT), social function (SF), emotional role (RE), and mental health (MH).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min</time_frame>
    <description>It has been explained that IPAQ is a safe and valid application in determining physical activity. The Turkish reliability and validity study of the questionnaire was carried out by Ozturk.&#xD;
The questionnaire consists of 4 separate sections and includes 7 questions in total. This questionnaire includes questions about physical activity for a minimum of 10 minutes in the last 7 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual Muscle Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder flexion (Muscle (M)-FL), abduction (M-AB), extension (M-EX), adduction (M-AD), external rotation (M-ER) and internal rotation (M-İR) are scored by scoring between 0 and 5 in manual muscle test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min</time_frame>
    <description>Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation and external rotation range of motion were measured with a universal goniometer for the shoulder joint. The measurement values were recorded in degrees. Normal values for shoulder range of motion are 0-180º in flexion (FL) and abduction (AB), 0-45º in extension (EX) and adduction (AD), 0-90º in external rotation (ER) and 0-70º in internal rotation (IR).</description>
