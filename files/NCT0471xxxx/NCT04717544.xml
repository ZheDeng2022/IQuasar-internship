  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate a sustainable tobacco screening, treatment intervention, and&#xD;
      cessation program implemented within both Los Angeles County (LAC)-Department of Health&#xD;
      Services (LACDHS)-operated outpatient primary care clinics and in LAC-Department of Mental&#xD;
      Health (LACDMH)-operated community mental health clinics. This is a three year implementation&#xD;
      study funded by the University of California Office of the President Tobacco Related Disease&#xD;
      Research Program (TRDRP). This project will support the implementation of smoking cessation&#xD;
      services delivered in LACDHS and LACDMH clinics and will evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;
      feasibility of these services.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research hypothesis is that training LACDHS and LACDMH staff and clinicians to screen for&#xD;
      and treat tobacco use disorder will improve rates of remission from tobacco use disorder in&#xD;
      the clients served by each system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial that compares intervention&#xD;
      clinics (offer smoking cessation group counseling and medication management) integrated into&#xD;
      primary care and community mental health clinics with treatment as usual (offering&#xD;
      information about the California Smoker's Helpline and informal provider counseling). The&#xD;
      specific aim is to randomize 17 clinics (11 at LACDHS and 6 at LACDMH), with a 5:1 ratio in&#xD;
      the assignment of clinical sites assigned to offer smoking cessation services as compared to&#xD;
      the treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to providing support for the implementation of the smoking cessation services,&#xD;
      the study will enroll 1,200 clients with tobacco use disorder from all 17 participating&#xD;
      clinics for an outcome study; 1000 people from clinical sites where smoking cessation&#xD;
      treatment are being offered and 200 people with tobacco use disorder from the TAU clinical&#xD;
      sites. The primary study outcome is to determine if there will be higher rates of smoking&#xD;
      cessation in the implementation sites as compared with TAU sites that do not offer smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is to determine if there will be higher rates of smoking cessation in the intervention sites as compared with matched non-intervention sites. In order to measure these rates, study participants will be asked to complete two objective measures collected at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up. These measures include a carbon monoxide breathalyzer (piCO+smokerlyzer) and urinary rapid dipstick cotinine test (NicCheck). A participant will count as having quit if they reported having abstained from smoking cigarettes/cigars for seven consecutive days and if this report is corroborated by carbon monoxide and cotinine testing.</description>

    <description>Healthcare providers from clinics participating in the intervention refer existing clients to study coordinators for smoking cessation services, wherein the coordinators link clients to the smoking cessation services, which include: 1) a weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy smoking cessation (CBT) counseling group; and 2) smoking cessation medication, which include varenicline (Chantix), bupropion (Zyban) and nicotine patches, gum, and lozenges. Clients interested in these medications will meet with the prescribing clinician to help choose the best prescription option.&#xD;
In addition to linking clients to the smoking cessation services, coordinators will invite clients to participate in the outcome study.&#xD;
Existing clients can sign-up for these services and/or the outcome study directly with the study coordinators and do not require a healthcare provider referral.</description>

    <description>The smoking cessation intervention will include 1) a six-week, 60-75 minute weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) smoking cessation counseling group; and 2) smoking cessation medication include varenicline (Chantix), bupropion (Zyban) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Dispensing these medications will include a 15-minute medication management visit with a prescribing clinician. Clients will choose their own preferred treatment. The standard prescription for NRT will include a transdermal patch at a dose that approximates for current average mg of nicotine intake and nicotine gums or lozenges (in either 2 mg or 4 mg strengths). Prescription for varenicline will be 0.5 mg once daily for three days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for the next four days, then 1 mg twice daily thereafter. Absent any contraindications to the drugs listed above, bupropion (Zyban) 150mg will be offered and prescribed once daily for one week, following by bupropion 300 mg once daily thereafter.</description>
