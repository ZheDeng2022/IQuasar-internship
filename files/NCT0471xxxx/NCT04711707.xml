  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve the treatment of a common, chronic health concern for children:&#xD;
      obesity. It has the potential to improve the care we provide by testing an intervention that&#xD;
      addresses social needs and the important upstream factors that influences health outcomes.&#xD;

      Addressing the social needs of children attending a weight management program. The specific&#xD;
      aims of this pilot randomized controlled trial are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of implementation and delivery of a screening-referral&#xD;
           intervention versus usual care to address social needs of children with obesity enrolled&#xD;
           in a pediatric weight management program at McMaster Children's Hospital, which will&#xD;
           include recruitment rates, uptake of the intervention, and follow-up of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand impact on health outcomes of a screening-referral intervention versus&#xD;
           usual care to address social needs of children with obesity enrolled in a pediatric&#xD;
           weight management program including change in i) body mass index z score (zBMI); ii)&#xD;
           change in body composition; and iii) change in health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that health outcomes of children with obesity are connected to the&#xD;
      social determinants of health, and that an intervention which screens for and refers to&#xD;
      community supports will improve child obesity outcomes.&#xD;

    <allocation>Randomized</allocation>
    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Participants who screen positive for social needs will be randomized to receive one of two possible interventions. An allocation ratio of 1:1 with random permuted blocks of varying size will be used. Random block size will help to ensure that investigators or outcome assessors will not be able to decipher the block size and anticipate future allocations. Allocation concealment is the process that prevents any trial participant or investigator from knowing in advance the treatment to which subjects will be assigned and seeks to prevent selection bias.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Screening</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Data analysts will be blind to the group allocation. Group allocation will be concealed until the final data analysis is performed. Families, research staff and clinical staff will not be blinded to the group allocation.</masking_description>
  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recruitment Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recruitment rate refers to the number of participants enrolled and is measured by the number of consent forms signed or implied. Recruitment will be successful if 80% of our target sample is met.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Uptake of Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Uptake of the intervention refers to the number of enrolled families who completed all aspect of the intervention. Elements that are part of the uptake include: social history following enrollment as well as the quality of life questionnaires and use of service questionnaire at enrolment and 6-months. Uptake will be considered successful if &gt;80% of families complete the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Follow-up of Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Follow-up of participants refers to the participants attending all of their scheduled study visits. The study will be considered successful if &gt;90% of participants complete all study visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index Z-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The body mass index Z-score (zBMI) is calculated using WHO growth charts, for age and sex. Height and weight of the child will be collected from the chart at baseline and from every visit the participant has in clinic until the end of the intervention. BMI will be calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of the body height in metres squared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Composition</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Body fat will be assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention using the Quantum II BIA analyzer (RJL Systems). Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is non-invasive and portable. It measures electrical impedance of tissues by applying alternating current to the body tissues (not felt by the participant), which is used in regression equations to approximate body fat and fat free mass. This will be collected at baseline from the chart and from every visit the participant has in clinic until the end of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the Pediatrics Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™). Both the patient and the parent or guardian will be asked to complete the PedsQL™. The minimum possible score for this inventory is 0 and the highest is 100. Higher scores indicate a better Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).</description>
