      This study aims to understand the enteroendocrine physiological changes in superobese&#xD;
      patients submitted to two different bariatric procedures (biliopancreatic diversion with&#xD;
      duodenal switch versus single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass), when perfomed as primary or&#xD;
      revisional surgeries (after a sleeve gastrectomy). The main purpose is to establish the&#xD;
      metabolic changes obtained with the sleeve gastrectomy and how the revisional procedure&#xD;
      maximizes those changes. Additionally, the study will determine whether BPD with DS or SADI-S&#xD;
      is superior than the other as first choice for the superobese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will monitor the enteroendocrine function before and after the ingestion of a mixed&#xD;
      meal, in pre-operatory and post-surgery timepoints, comparing both primary and revisional&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Abstract Obesity is a chronic disease whose global incidence keeps rising as the twenty first&#xD;
      century goes on. Nowadays, the surgical approach constitutes the best treatment option for&#xD;
      these patients, making the sleeve gastrectomy and the gastric bypass the more frequently&#xD;
      performed bariatric surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the superobese patients (IMC≥ 50kg/m2) present variable weight loss resistance to&#xD;
      the previous techniques, showing better results when submitted to disabsorptive procedures,&#xD;
      namely the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, and the more recently created&#xD;
      single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass. Each constitutes a revisional surgery option after a&#xD;
      primary sleeve gastrectomy, reducing surgical and anesthesia risks. This has brought to light&#xD;
      that some superobese patients do not need the revisional procedure as they achieve the weight&#xD;
      loss target solely by the vertical gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supported on the investigators' previous work and extensive experience performing both&#xD;
      techniques, they now aim to understand the enteroendocrine physiological changes which each&#xD;
      procedure accomplishes and compare them in terms of therapeutic efficacy among the&#xD;
      superobese. The utmost goals will be to unravel the advantages of BPD-DS and SADI-S as&#xD;
      primary or revisional surgeries, the differences between patients that respond well to sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy alone and those who do not, and, finally, providing further insights on which&#xD;
      procedure should be favoured over the other based on the patient characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will have been submitted to either BPD-DS or SADI-S, as a primary&#xD;
      or as a revisional surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants visits will be scheduled before surgery and after surgery at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
           months for those who receive BPD-DS or SADI-S as a primary procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who are firstly submitted to the sleeve gastrectomy, visits will be scheduled&#xD;
           before surgery and after surgery at 3 , 6 and 12 months. The revisional surgery will&#xD;
           take place 1 year after the sleeve, with visits scheduled before surgery and after&#xD;
           surgery at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all these visits, detailed participants assessment will include vitals, anthropometric and&#xD;
      biochemical evaluation, and the performance of a MMTT with plasma sampling for hormonal&#xD;
      profiles. Intraoperative sampling of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue will take place&#xD;
      during BPD-DS or SADI-S as a primary procedure and during the sleeve gastrectomy and repeated&#xD;
      1 year after the revisional surgery, either BPD-DS or SADI-S, is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Enrolment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be selected from the cohort of patients referred for multidisciplinary&#xD;
      evaluation by the clinical team for surgical treatment of obesity of the Centro Hospitalar&#xD;
      Entre Douro e Vouga (CHEDV). Participants found to be suitable according to the entry&#xD;
      criteria and who have accepted to participate will be enrolled in the study and assigned to&#xD;
      one of the four study groups according to participants clinical features.&#xD;
