      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is local, multi-center, prospective, cohort study to collect real world data&#xD;
      related mCRPC patients, prevalence of HRRm and to assess possible influence of HRRm on&#xD;
      treatment outcomes. No additional procedures besides those already used in the routine&#xD;
      clinical practice will be applied to the patients. Treatment assignment will be done&#xD;
      according to the current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Source(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      For testing archival samples (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded [FFPE]) from primary tumor&#xD;
      will be used . 15 HRR genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BRIP1, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL,&#xD;
      PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D and RAD54L) will be analyzed using NGS in dedicated&#xD;
      central laboratory facilities. Choice of laboratory for each center will be made based on&#xD;
      logistical proximity. Each NGS laboratory will have to determine and report clinical&#xD;
      significance of alterations found using database search or other predictors to classify&#xD;
      variants as deleterious or suspected deleterious. VUS have to be reported separately. Benign&#xD;
      variants will be not reported in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical and demographic data for patients with finished therapy will be collected in&#xD;
      prospective or retrospective (where applicable) manner during the study visits. The second&#xD;
      visit will take place when the disease progression or death is occurs or in a year after the&#xD;
      first visit whichever happens first. Data will be entered in the eCRF. The site investigator&#xD;
      will be responsible for ensuring that all required data is collected and entered into the&#xD;
      eCRF with the involvement of clinical research organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that approximately 300 patients will be enrolled in the first stage. After&#xD;
      interim analysis total number of the patients can be increased, depending on the number of&#xD;
      NGS failures. It is estimated that approximately 30 sites in total will be participating in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

        Study population will consist of mCRPC patients with available medical history and FFPE&#xD;
        specimen of archival tissue from primary prostate tumor and who received at least one line&#xD;
        of therapy for mCRPC or is currently receiving this therapy. It is estimated that 300&#xD;
        patients will be enrolled (this sample can be further increased after the interim analysis&#xD;
        based on the actual number of NGS failures). It is estimated that approximately 30 sites in&#xD;
        total will be participating in the study. There will be 2 cohorts of patients: HRRm and&#xD;
        HRRwt to reveal possible differences in treatment pattern, demographic and clinical&#xD;
        characteristics and outcomes in mCRPC patients with and without HRRm.&#xD;
