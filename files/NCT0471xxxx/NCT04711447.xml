  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain increases excitation (or activity) of the upper trapezius (UT) and reduces&#xD;
      excitation in lower trapezius (LT). Despite inconclusive evidence, kinesio-tape (KT) is often&#xD;
      used to modify muscular excitation within the UT and/or LT to help correct alterations in&#xD;
      scapular position and motion associated with shoulder pain/injury. The objectives of the&#xD;
      current study were to determine if: 1) inhibitory KT to the UT acutely increases muscle&#xD;
      excitation (whole-muscle and spatial distribution) within the LT in healthy individuals; and&#xD;
      2) if loading the limb alters the magnitude of change in muscle excitation of the LT. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that: 1) inhibitory KT application to the UT will immediately increase&#xD;
      whole-muscle LT excitation, and result in an inferior shift in the distribution of excitation&#xD;
      within the LT compared to no tape and sham-KT tape conditions; and 2) the magnitude of&#xD;
      immediate increase in LT excitation with KT would be greater in the loaded condition. A&#xD;
      repeated-measures, crossover design was used to determine the impact of KT applied to UT and&#xD;
      load on muscle excitation of the LT. Participants were asked to perform a repeated arm&#xD;
      elevation task during three different taping conditions: no KT, experimental KT and sham KT.&#xD;
      Each taping condition performed the repeated arm elevation task during two loading&#xD;
      conditions: no load and loaded with 2.3 kilograms. All six conditions were tested during one&#xD;
      visit with the no load condition preceding the loaded condition for each taping condition. A&#xD;
      baseline trial (no KT; N-KT) was performed first, followed by both an experimental-KT (E-KT)&#xD;
      and sham-KT (S-KT) condition. The order of the E-KT and S-KT conditions were randomized and&#xD;
      the order was counterbalanced. Testing for each tape condition lasted approximately&#xD;
      10-minutes for a total of 45-minutes per participant including screening, EMG set-up and&#xD;
      clean-up. KT was applied to the UT and muscle excitation (EMG amplitude) was measured in the&#xD;
      LT using one single 32-grid high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) electrode during&#xD;
      a repeated arm elevation task.&#xD;
