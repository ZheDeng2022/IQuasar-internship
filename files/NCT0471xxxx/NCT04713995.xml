  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this interventional study is to identify the root cause(s) of AxSpA (Axial&#xD;
      Spondyloarthritis) relapses, which are likely due to the combination of nutrition, gut&#xD;
      microbiome activities, leaky gut, and human genes (particularly from the immune system). This&#xD;
      will be done by identifying molecular features of the microbiome that are associated with&#xD;
      AxSpA flares, progression and relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit participants with confirmed AxSpA diagnosis and who are HLA-B27&#xD;
      positive. During screening potential participants allow access to medical records to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility requirements, such as diagnosis. Once enrolled, collection kits are sent to&#xD;
      participants to collect samples using at-home collection kits and then provide a fasting&#xD;
      blood sample at a local lab. Samples are then analyzed to identify features that likely cause&#xD;
      AxSpA issues. Survey's are also answered to collect additional health data. Scientists will&#xD;
      then use the data to identify the features that likely cause AxSpA flares and relapses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Interventional study to help find the root causes of AxSpA relapses, flares and&#xD;
      progression. The study will enroll 400 participants who are aged 18 or over, are HLA-B27&#xD;
      positive, have had a diagnosis of AxSpA. An informed consent form is acknowledged and medical&#xD;
      release signed (to confirm eligibility criteria). Participants sign up online and answer&#xD;
      questions about their physical and mental health and how they are doing (through an app&#xD;
      and/or website). The participants will be in the study approximately 3 months, unless they&#xD;
      agree to complete the 3 and 6 month timeline assessments for the longitudinal timelines, then&#xD;
      the study will be completed after those timelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible, participants are shipped at-home collection kits which include: saliva,&#xD;
      finger-prick blood and stool. A Genova urine test is also included to check intestinal&#xD;
      permeability. Participants also make an appointment and go to a local lab to collect an&#xD;
      additional blood sample. All samples are shipped via pre-paid mailers. All collections are&#xD;
      done within a 1-week window (or 7 days). Clinical samples are collected in order to analyze&#xD;
      specific molecular features associated with AxSpA in the microbiome found in participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After shipping home collection kits and visiting the lab for a blood draw, participants&#xD;
      receive diet recommendations which they will follow for ~3 months, after which time they will&#xD;
      fill out a study survey to complete the first timeline in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If interested in participating in the longitudinal portion of the study, participants can&#xD;
      also complete the 3-month and 6-month home collection, blood collection at the local lab and&#xD;
      additional surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientists hope to find the microbiome and molecular information that corresponds to flares,&#xD;
      health and wellness in the microbiome in patients with AxSpA.&#xD;
