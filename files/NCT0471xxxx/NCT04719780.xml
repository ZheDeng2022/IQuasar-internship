  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to examine the efficacy of Emotionally Focused Therapy&#xD;
      for Individuals (EFIT) as a treatment for depression and anxiety. It is formulated as a&#xD;
      trans-diagnostic treatment in line with the call for more transdiagnostic approaches to treat&#xD;
      depression and anxiety given the many similarities in the underlying psychological and&#xD;
      emotional factors of these disorders, the high levels of co-morbidity, and the preliminary&#xD;
      success of transdiagnostic treatment approaches. EFIT has been formulated as an&#xD;
      attachment-based alternative to current cognitive transdiagnostic approaches. The strong&#xD;
      evidence for insecure attachment as an underlying factor in psychopathology, especially&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, positions this theory well as a foundational principle to support&#xD;
      psychotherapy for these conditions. EFIT has been formulated for the first time this year in&#xD;
      the book that will serve as the therapy manual for this study. The current study aims to&#xD;
      examine EFIT outcomes as compared to a control group (a wait-list control followed by online&#xD;
      CBT intervention after the wait period). In particular, this research project aims to&#xD;
      distinguish differences in initial and follow-up outcomes between EFIT versus control, and&#xD;
      demonstrate significant changes in attachment/emotions and mechanisms of change across EFIT&#xD;
      sessions. The primary hypotheses are outlined below.&#xD;

      PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants are recruited from the general population of individuals&#xD;
      self-identifying as having symptoms of depression and/or anxiety in each study site (Ottawa,&#xD;
      Denver, Victoria). Study advertisements are posted and circulated through post-secondary&#xD;
      institutions, online, and within psychotherapy treatment centres. Participants experiencing&#xD;
      depression and/or anxiety are invited to contact the research coordinator of the project via&#xD;
      the email listed on recruitment material. All interested participants receive a telephone&#xD;
      screen by research research assistants to assess potential eligibility. Participants who are&#xD;
      deemed potentially eligible are informed that they will be contacted by an assessor to be&#xD;
      invited for an initial study assessment session to determine final eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment Assessors are individuals with clinical experience in psychotherapy or&#xD;
      counselling at each of the study sites. Informed consent is reviewed and participants have&#xD;
      the opportunity to have all their questions and concerns addressed. Assessors administer the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria modules of the ADIS-5 during this session. Assessments take place either&#xD;
      within the private practice locations at each study site or the university offices of the&#xD;
      investigators in a research session lasting approximately 1-2 hours. During the pandemic&#xD;
      while it is not safe to meet in person, secure encrypted video call platforms are used to&#xD;
      hold these sessions. Responses are evaluated by the assessors' supervisors, at which point&#xD;
      final eligibility is determined. The assessments and therapy take place either within the&#xD;
      private practice locations at each study site as specified or the university offices of the&#xD;
      co-investigators, or online using a secure encrypted video call platform when it is unsafe to&#xD;
      meet for in-person sessions due to the pandemic. After completion of the baseline assessment&#xD;
      session, eligible participants are given access to an online questionnaire to complete at&#xD;
      their own convenience. After completion of the questionnaire, participants are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to study condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignment Once participants have been deemed eligible to take part, and have&#xD;
      completed the baseline questionnaire, they are randomly assigned to the EFIT (treatment)&#xD;
      condition or the waitlist plus online CBT (control group) condition by the research&#xD;
      co-ordinator. A list of numbers (i.e., 1-40 for Ottawa, 1-28 for Victoria, and 1-20 for&#xD;
      Denver) are generated for each city, reflecting the total number of EFIT and control clients&#xD;
      for that city. Within those groups, a separate randomized list (i.e., 20 total numerical&#xD;
      values for Ottawa, 14 for Victoria, and 10 for Denver) is generated using Research&#xD;
      Randomizer, an online tool for random assignment that has been used in previous RCT studies.&#xD;
      As participants are deemed eligible, they are added onto the list and their number will&#xD;
      determine whether they will take part in either the EFIT intervention or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFIT Treatment Group Twenty-two experienced EFT therapists trained in the EFIT model will&#xD;
      provide 15 sessions of EFIT treatment to approximately 2 clients each. Therapy will be&#xD;
      carried out in private practices or the university offices of researchers located in each of&#xD;
      the study sites, or online using a secure encrypted video call platform when not possible to&#xD;
      meet in person due to the pandemic. Each site is associated with an EFT centre: Ottawa&#xD;
      Institute of Couple and Family Therapy in Ottawa, Centre for EFT Vancouver Island in&#xD;
      Victoria, and Colorado Centre for EFT in Denver. Study therapists will receive an average of&#xD;
      1 hour of supervision per week in groups of 3-4 therapists. Each therapy session will be&#xD;
      video recorded and treatment fidelity will be confirmed through the coding of video tapes.&#xD;
      After each therapy session, therapists will ask participants to complete a brief online&#xD;
      questionnaire that takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The link to the online&#xD;
      questionnaire will be sent to each therapist by the research co-ordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wait-List plus online CBT Control Group Participants randomly assigned to the wait-list&#xD;
      control group will wait 15 weeks, following which time they will be given an online&#xD;
      transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioural treatment (MoodGym) for depression and anxiety that has&#xD;
      been empirically validated after they have completed the 15-week wait period. They will be&#xD;
      given access to complete 15 weeks of the online intervention. These participants will also be&#xD;
      requested to complete a brief online questionnaire on a weekly basis - this questionnaire is&#xD;
      identical to the questionnaire given to EFIT participants after each therapy session with the&#xD;
      exception that it does not include the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) or the Post-session&#xD;
      Resolution Questionnaire (PSRQ) as these questionnaires are only relevant to therapy&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;

    <description>The Beck Anxiety Inventory is a 21-item self-report questionnaire used to assess common symptoms of anxiety (e.g., rapid heartbeat, sweating, numbness, trembling, etc.). Participants are presented with a list of common symptoms of anxiety and are asked to note how much they experienced each over the past week from a four item Likert scale (&quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;mildly&quot;, &quot;moderately&quot;, and &quot;severely&quot;). The total score is calculated by finding the sum of all 21 items; a score of 0-21 indicated low anxiety, 22-35 indicates moderate anxiety, and a score of 36 and above indicates potentially concerning levels of anxiety. Both of the Beck inventories used in this study have been widely used in clinical research and possess good reliability and validity. Participants will complete this questionnaire in paper format at the baseline and post assessment sessions. EFIT participants will also complete the BDI-2 after session 5 and 7.</description>

    <description>Emotionally Focused Therapy for Individuals (EFIT) is formulated as a transdiagnostic treatment to treat depression and anxiety, adapted from the well-studied Emotionally Focused Therapy. EFIT has been formulated as an attachment-based alternative to current cognitive approaches (e.g., Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). The strong evidence for insecure attachment as an underlying factor in psychopathology, especially depression and anxiety, positions this theory well as a foundational principle to support psychotherapy for these conditions.</description>
