  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A research project capturing experiences of patients with critical limb threatening ischemia,&#xD;
      with the ultimate goal of setting new standards for diagnosing, describing detailed&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes, and evaluating the variability in therapeutic approaches and their&#xD;
      association with outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 8 million individuals in America are affected by peripheral arterial disease&#xD;
      (PAD). One of its extreme expressions is Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). It is one of the most&#xD;
      severe vascular conditions associated with devastating outcomes, including poorly healing&#xD;
      wounds, extreme pain, and a high amputation risk. It is also one of the deadliest conditions,&#xD;
      with 6-month and 5-year mortality rates estimated to be 20 and &gt;50%, respectively. To date,&#xD;
      however, there is a paucity of prospective clinical evidence about the variability in&#xD;
      patients' presentations, their management or their outcomes. Accordingly, little progress has&#xD;
      been made in adequately staging the disease and to risk-stratify treatment approaches to&#xD;
      patients' individual characteristics. What is desperately needed to advance the care and&#xD;
      management of patients with CLI is a focused research effort to set new standards for&#xD;
      diagnosing, describing detailed patient-centered outcomes, and evaluating the variability in&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches and their association with outcomes. The specific aims of SCOPE-CLI&#xD;
      are to generate new evidence on the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes&#xD;
      of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI); to describe treatment patterns and variability&#xD;
      across practices to identify gaps in delivering quality care; and to perform a series of&#xD;
      analyses to examine the associations of patient and treatment characteristics with outcomes.&#xD;
      The central objective of SCOPE-CLI is to systematically quantify patients' CLI-specific&#xD;
      health status and clinical outcomes and to perform subgroup analyses as a function of&#xD;
      different PAD treatments and patient characteristics.&#xD;
