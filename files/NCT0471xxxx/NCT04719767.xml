    <textblock>
      To study the advantages of visual laryngeal mask combined with endotracheal intubation in&#xD;
      general anesthesia surgery, we compared intubation time, intubation times and intubation&#xD;
      success rate of endotracheal intubation through laryngeal mask airway under visual and&#xD;
      non-visual conditions, at the same time, the laryngeal mask displacement rate, volume of&#xD;
      secretion in airway, the incidence of laryngeal spasm, the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      postoperative oropharyngeal pain were also compared between two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After entering the operating room, the patient received routine general anaesthesia&#xD;
      monitoring, and anesthesia induction was conducted after three-party verification. Propofol&#xD;
      (plasma target-controlled concentration: 3.5ug/ mL), midazolam (0.05mg/kg), fentanyl (2ug/kg)&#xD;
      and rocuronium (0.6mg/kg) were used to induce the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After anesthesia induction, visual laryngeal mask airway was placed in the visual group and&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation was guided under visual conditions. In the non-visual group, after&#xD;
      judging the position of laryngeal mask by clinical experience, endotracheal intubation was&#xD;
      inserted blindly. Selection of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) model based on: the ideal body&#xD;
      weight of the patient, 3 was selected for the body weight of 30-50kg, 4 for the body weight&#xD;
      of 50-70kg and 5 for the body weight &gt; 70kg. The endotracheal tube intubation time,&#xD;
      intubation times and intubation success rate of the two groups were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, propofol and fentanyl are used for anesthesia maintenance, and the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist adjusts the anesthesia depth according to his/her own experience. Ten&#xD;
      minutes before the end of the operation, endotracheal intubation was removed and the&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airway was retained. The displacement rate of the laryngeal mask airway, the&#xD;
      volume of secretion in airway and the incidence of laryngeal spasm were compared between the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery, the residual muscle relaxation was antagonized, and the laryngeal mask was&#xD;
      removed after the patient regained consciousness and reached the extubation criteria. The&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters and the severity of cough during laryngeal mask airway removal were&#xD;
      recorded. The incidence and severity of oropharyngeal pain, oropharyngeal numbness,&#xD;
      hoarseness, nausea, and vomiting were assessed immediately after the patient woke up and was&#xD;
      followed up before leaving the recovery room and on the first day after surgery.&#xD;
