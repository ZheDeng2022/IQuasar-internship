  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Stop sexual harassment&quot; is a school based intervention tailored to reduce sexual- and&#xD;
      gendered harassment among pupils in secondary school. The first aim of this study is to test&#xD;
      to what extent &quot;Stop sexual harassment&quot; reduces sexual harassment and harassment based on&#xD;
      sexual orientation and gender expression (gendered harassment) among 8th to 10th grade pupils&#xD;
      in secondary school. The second aim of the study is to test to what extent the intervention&#xD;
      increases teachers' responses to sexual- and gendered harassment among pupils. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of eight lessons which address the prevention of sexual- and gendered&#xD;
      harassment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: A minimum 32 schools with at least 3840 pupils will participate in a cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Participating schools will be randomly assigned to intervention&#xD;
      schools and control schools. At the intervention schools, teachers will be introduced to&#xD;
      &quot;Stop sexual harassment&quot; through a digital course which will provide them with a manual&#xD;
      containing eight lessons to be held for the pupils. At the control schools there will not be&#xD;
      any intervention. The effects of the intervention on pupils will be determined by assessing&#xD;
      their experiences with sexual and gendered harassment, and internalized and externalized&#xD;
      problems prior to the intervention (T1), shortly after the intervention (T2) and six moths&#xD;
      after the intervention (T3). The effects of the intervention on teachers will be determined&#xD;
      by assessing the teachers' experiences of responding to sexual and gendered harassment among&#xD;
      pupils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: It is expected that the intervention &quot;Stop sexual harassment&quot; will lead to&#xD;
      reduced sexual and gendered harassment perpetration and victimization, and less internalized&#xD;
      and externalized problems among the pupils in secondary school, and that teachers will more&#xD;
      frequently take action when sexual- and gendered harassment is encountered among the pupils.&#xD;

      AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS The first aim of this study is to test the effects of &quot;Stop sexual&#xD;
      harassment&quot;, a sexual- and gendered harassment prevention intervention in secondary school&#xD;
      among 8th to 10th grade pupils. The second aim of the study is to test the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on teachers' responses to sexual- and gendered harassment among the pupils.&#xD;
      &quot;Stop sexual harassment&quot; is targeted at both pupils and teachers with the intention of&#xD;
      reducing sexual harassment and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender expression&#xD;
      (gendered harassment) among the pupils. It is hypothesized that the intervention will lead to&#xD;
      reduced sexual- and gendered harassment perpetration and victimization and less internalized&#xD;
      and externalized problems among the pupils. It is also hypothesized that the intervention&#xD;
      will lead to teachers more frequently taking action when sexual- and gendered harassment is&#xD;
      encountered among pupils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND METHOD Recruitment: All secondary schools (8th to 10th grade) in three counties&#xD;
      (Vestland, Nordland and former county Buskerud) in Norway will be invited to take part in the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be used to test the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention. Participating schools will be randomly assigned to intervention schools and&#xD;
      control schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Questionnaires will be administered to pupils and teachers, prior to the&#xD;
      intervention to obtain a baseline level (T1), shortly after the intervention (T2), and about&#xD;
      six months after the intervention (T3). Previously tested instruments to assess to what&#xD;
      extent the intervention leads to reduction in sexual harassment and harassment based on&#xD;
      sexual orientation and gender expression among the pupils will be utilized. Teachers'&#xD;
      responses to the pupils' sexual and gendered harassment will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analytic plan and power analysis: The data will be analyzed with both simple descriptive&#xD;
      (such as correlations, frequency tables) and advanced statistical methods. With regard to the&#xD;
      latter, 3 level multilevel modelling will be used to assess the impact of the intervention on&#xD;
      the outcome variables. Multilevel modelling takes into account the hierarchical design of the&#xD;
      data due to cluster randomization by school (level 3) and school class (level 2). Cluster&#xD;
      effects were approximated (Intra Class Correlation; ICC) influencing the main outcomes&#xD;
      (Sexual harassment, emotional problems, attitudes towards homosexuals) by taking advantage of&#xD;
      data from previous studies. These studies indicate that whereas relatively little (often less&#xD;
      than 5%) of the total variance of sexual harassment victimization, bullying and emotional&#xD;
      problems are at the school and/or school class level, a still limited amount of studies&#xD;
      suggests that this might not be the case for instance attitudes towards homosexuals where as&#xD;
      much as 12,5 - 30% of the total variance have been explained by school/class levels. Power&#xD;
      calculations, by the use the Optimal Design Software, showed that with a .05 level of&#xD;
      significance, power = .80, ICC level 2 = .25, ICC level 3=0.05, number of cluster level 2=6&#xD;
      (classes) with a cluster size=20 (pupils), 38 schools are needed to be able to detect effect&#xD;
      sizes of .30 (about medium effects according to Cohen (1988). The power of the analyses can&#xD;
      be increased by including the pre-intervention measure of the outcome variable. Assuming the&#xD;
      average school level of the outcome variable at pre-intervention explains 50 or 30 percent of&#xD;
      the variation of the outcome variable at post-test, decreases the number of schools to 30 and&#xD;
      32, respectively, given the same assumptions as above. It was therefore decided to include at&#xD;
      least 32 schools (16 intervention schools) to guard against the possibility of type II&#xD;
      errors. A minimum of 3840 pupils will thus take part in the study.&#xD;
