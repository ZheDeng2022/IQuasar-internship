  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present literature supports the importance of the motor activity since the early stages&#xD;
      of the human development. The children with poor motor skills are at greater risk for&#xD;
      psychosocial, internalizing, and metabolic diseases. In Italy data about obesity and&#xD;
      inactivity are increasing, anyway there is lack of motor program for pre-schoolers. The&#xD;
      movement program Animal Fun seems to be a valid tool to support these children. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to verify the feasibility of using Animal Fun with Italian pre-schoolers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      119 preschool children (3-6 years old) from 3 Italian kindergartens were included in this&#xD;
      study. The schools were randomly allocated to intervention and control group. Movement&#xD;
      Assessment Battery for Children - 2 (MABC-2) was administered to all the children at the&#xD;
      baseline and at one-month follow-up. During this month, the schools assigned to the control&#xD;
      group followed the normal curriculum; the schools assigned to the Animal Fun group, followed&#xD;
      the Animal Fun activity (thirty minutes, thrice a week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the Animal Fun program demonstrates valid and feasible even in&#xD;
      the Italian context, where there is lack of movement program supporting the development of&#xD;
      the pre-school children.&#xD;

      Rationale and Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor skills and physical activity are strongly related to the cognitive, physical, social&#xD;
      and psychological development of children. They are also crucial in the prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular or metabolic diseases, such as obesity or diabetes. There is growing evidence&#xD;
      indicating that children with poor motor coordination may be at significant risk for&#xD;
      psychosocial and internalizing problems. Other research has found significant levels of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression even in 4-5-years-old-children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to fear of failure, or of peer bullying, children with motor difficulties often limit&#xD;
      their opportunity to practice motor activities, thus creating a vicious cycle. In this&#xD;
      continuous negative loop, the child has low motor competency, develops low fitness training&#xD;
      and tends towards hypo-activity. In contrast, if children are confident with their motor&#xD;
      skills, they are more likely to participate in activities such as sports or dancing.&#xD;
      Literature also relates the motor ability of preschool children to their scholastic&#xD;
      adaptation and to the social adjustment in the first year of school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preschool is an essential period in a child's life because Fundamental Movement Skills are&#xD;
      developing at this stage, for both gross and fine motor tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some investigators have demonstrated that most pre-schoolers don't practice the recommended&#xD;
      amount of daily physical activity. Unfortunately, there is a lack of movement programs to&#xD;
      engage pre-school children in motor activities. In 2010, the Curtin University developed the&#xD;
      &quot;Animal Fun&quot; program. This program was designed to provide developmentally appropriate&#xD;
      activities that would be fun and engaging for all children aged 3-6 years whilst targeting&#xD;
      specific areas of development. They created a protocol, which will benefit all children in&#xD;
      the group - those with and without motor difficulties. By referring to all the members of a&#xD;
      class, Animal Fun avoids the stigma associated with &quot;special programs&quot;. This is an ecological&#xD;
      program for use in schools during the ordinary activities. Animal Fun is an imaginative&#xD;
      program of movement, in which the children imitate animals' movements. It is flexible and&#xD;
      doesn't provide a rigid structure to follow, but it adapts to children's interests and&#xD;
      abilities. Evidence demonstrates, that Animal Fun supports the development of overall motor&#xD;
      ability, particularly throwing and balance skills, and significantly improves social skills&#xD;
      in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy there is a lack of motor programs for pre-schooler children. Furthermore, children&#xD;
      with poor motor skills are not recognized, therefore no specific support is provided. The&#xD;
      need to identify an inclusive and flexible motor program has led us to Animal Fun.&#xD;
      Considering the socio-cultural differences between Western Australia and Italy, the purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to verify the feasibility of the Animal Fun program for Italian&#xD;
      pre-schoolers. Study goals and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy there is lack of motor program for pre-schoolers, like Animal Fun. The first aim of&#xD;
      this study is understanding the feasibility of this activity in the Italian kindergartens.&#xD;
      Second, this study would understand the validity of the results of one month of Animal Fun&#xD;
      practice. Using the gold standard assessment for motor skills in children, Movement&#xD;
      Assessment Battery for Children - 2 (MABC-2), the main objective is to verify the motor&#xD;
      improvements in children who practiced Animal Fun, compared to a control group. This&#xD;
      assessment provides score about the manual dexterity, the balance and the aiming and catching&#xD;
      skills. A sum of these scores provides a total score about the motor skills, in general.&#xD;
      Through this test, understanding the motor competences of the pre-schoolers is affordable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a longitudinal randomized controlled trial, and it is participants' blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been approved from the Ethics Committee of the University of Trieste. All methods were&#xD;
      performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations, especially the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As first, kindergartens' directors gave the consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Kindergartens of the province of Trieste have been recruited and randomly allocated to&#xD;
      Animal Fun intervention (1), and control group (2). From the three schools, we recruited 119&#xD;
      pre-schoolers. The parents previously read and signed the written informed consent, to let&#xD;
      the child participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: written informed consent, attending one of the three involved&#xD;
      kindergartens, 3-6 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: not-typically developing children and children with specific sickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As first, all the parents informed the investigators about the specific age of the child, the&#xD;
      hand preference, and the presence of such a deficit or disease. These data were necessary to&#xD;
      set up the assessment for each child. In fact, some administration-differences exist,&#xD;
      especially between ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: baseline assessment with MABC-2; Animal Fun activity with a certified&#xD;
      trainer (physiotherapist) for one month, three times a week, for 30 minutes; one-month&#xD;
      follow-up assessment with MABC-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: baseline assessment with MABC-2; normal curricular activity at school with the&#xD;
      teachers; one-month follow-up assessment with MABC-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal Fun activity was carried out following all the instructions given by the authors in&#xD;
      the published book. This program permits the operators to propose different activities, by&#xD;
      following the needing of the children. The proposed activities are entirely described in the&#xD;
      nine modules of this tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the assessment, the investigators decided to use 30 motor activities (on 97 available)&#xD;
      with the intervention group. As the name of this program suggests, all the activities involve&#xD;
      an animal, and ask the children to move like this animal, in a proper, correct and supervised&#xD;
      way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the assessment, considering the mean-scores of the children and their percentiles, the&#xD;
      investigators decided to focus especially on the activities for improving the balance, and&#xD;
      the aiming and catching skills. In fact, the children scored lower in these activities then&#xD;
      in the manual dexterity test. For this, most of the activities of the first modules of Animal&#xD;
      Fun have been proposed, which focus on the balance on two/one foot, on the locomotion, on the&#xD;
      balance during a throw, on the aim. The animals involved were, for instance, the flamingo,&#xD;
      the elephant, the dog, the monkey, and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the teachers of the control group, the investigators gave no additional information about&#xD;
      what to do during the curricular activities, in order no to create a bias. Even the teachers&#xD;
      of this group were blinded about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the safety of the participants was guarantee. All the activities of the&#xD;
      intervention group were coordinated and managed by a certified trainer, who could control the&#xD;
      safety of the children during Animal Fun. Every possibile accident during the motor activity&#xD;
      was considered as normal accident during the kindergarten time, and consequently managed by&#xD;
      the teachers. The parents were previously informed about this issue, in the written informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the second assessment with the MABC- 2 at one-month follow-up, the participants are&#xD;
      followed no more from the researchers of the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis was conducted in R (R Core Team, 2017) and graphs were produced using the package&#xD;
      Rcmdr and its plug-ins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normality of the variables was assessed through Shapiro-Wilk test. Intervention and control&#xD;
      groups were compared at the baseline through Fisher test for the qualitative variables, and&#xD;
      through the t-test for the quantitative ones. The time Δt was created to define the&#xD;
      difference between the final and the basal scores. The two groups were compared considering&#xD;
      Δt through the Mann-Whitney test. Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median, and 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval were reported for each variable at Δt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of this study could be very significant considering the possibility of&#xD;
      introducing Animal Fun in the Italian kindergartens, as curricular motor activity. The impact&#xD;
      of this program of movement on the quality of the life of the pre-schoolers can be huge.&#xD;
      Furthermore, giving the possibility to these children to move, and learn, can also give a&#xD;
      benefit considering the prevention of metabolic, cardio-vascular, postural and psycho-social&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

    <description>This test is suitable for children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years, and assesses the motor skills of children in the following domains: Aiming and Catching (AC), Balance (Bal), and Manual Dexterity (MD). Cluster and total standard scores for children are provided, with higher scores demonstrating better performance. A total test score (Tot MABC-2) at or below the 5th percentile indicates significant movement difficulty, while a score between the 5th and 15th percentile indicates that a child is &quot;at risk&quot;.&#xD;
In these tests, the items and the scores were compared to the normative data of the uploaded version of the Italian MABC-2.</description>
