  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First-In-Human (FIH) study of [68Ga]-FF58 to characterize the imaging properties,&#xD;
      safety, biodistribution and dosimetry properties of [68Ga]-FF58 in adults with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory (r/r) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2&#xD;
      positive (Her2+) breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain expected to overexpress&#xD;
      alpha-v beta 3 (αvβ3) and alpha-v beta 5 (αvβ5) integrins.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 patients (male and female) will be enrolled into the study, 20 patients with&#xD;
      GBM and 20 patients with Her2+ BC that has metastasized to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have an imaging characterization part and an expansion part. In the imaging&#xD;
      characterization part of the study, approximately 12 patients will be enrolled, 6 with r/r&#xD;
      GBM and 6 with Her2+ BC that has metastasized to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both parts of the study (imaging characterization and expansion) will include a dosimetry&#xD;
      sub-group in which the distribution, pharmacokinetics (PK), radiation dosimetry and absorbed&#xD;
      doses in tissue and tumor will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study will receive a single dose of [68Ga]-FF58 and undergo&#xD;
      [68Ga]-FF58 PET imaging at different timepoints on Day 1 as well as conventional imaging&#xD;
      (high resolution CT or MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated study duration for each individual patient is approximately 44 days (including&#xD;
      screening period of 28 days and 14 days of follow-up (FU)).&#xD;
