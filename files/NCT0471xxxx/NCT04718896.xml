Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16, compared to Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The CDLQI is a questionnaire designed to measure the impact of skin diseases on the lives of children. The questionnaire consists of 10 questions that are based on the experiences of children with skin disease. The instrument asks participants about symptoms and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and treatment. The questions relate to the impact of the skin disease on the child over the last week, (ie, over the last 7 days). The CDLQI total score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating higher impact of skin disease on quality of life (Qol).</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
