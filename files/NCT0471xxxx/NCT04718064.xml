      Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a common type of stroke in the elderly. Timely blood flow&#xD;
      recovery can effectively improve the long-term prognosis of patients. According to five&#xD;
      large-scale multicenter randomized controlled trials (MR clean, swift-prime, revascat, escape&#xD;
      and extend-ia) in recent years, the effect of endovascular therapy (EVT) for acute anterior&#xD;
      circulation occlusion of great vessels is significantly better than that of drug therapy&#xD;
      alone. Therefore, for patients who meet the &quot;Chinese guidelines for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of acute ischemic stroke&quot; (2018 Edition), the effect of EVT is better than that of&#xD;
      drug therapy alone, Intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours and endovascular mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy within 6 hours can effectively relieve the clinical symptoms and reduce the&#xD;
      mortality of AIS. However, due to the narrow application time window of intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, although the thrombectomy time window of some&#xD;
      eligible patients was relaxed to 24 hours after dawn and defuse3 and other related studies,&#xD;
      the reperfusion injury after the blocked cerebral artery recanalization has brought huge&#xD;
      obstacles to clinical application. Therefore, how to improve the prognosis of patients with&#xD;
      endovascular therapy has become a hot research direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fingomod is a kind of sphingosine analogues acting on sphingosine-1-phosphate (sipr). After&#xD;
      phosphorylation in the body, fingomod combines with lymphocyte SIP receptor, changes&#xD;
      lymphocyte migration route, prevents it from entering the area outside the lymphoid tissue,&#xD;
      so as to avoid its infiltration into the central nervous system and achieve&#xD;
      immunosuppression. Currently, it is the first-line disease modifying oral drug for multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis. Fingolmod shows neuroprotective effects on many central nervous system diseases&#xD;
      including cerebral ischemia. Fingomod not only reduced the number of lymphocytes invading the&#xD;
      brain, but also decreased the number of lymphocytes in the microcirculation system&#xD;
