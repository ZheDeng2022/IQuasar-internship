    <textblock>
      Patients were aged &gt;18 years with histological confirmed GC/EGJC and were refractory to the&#xD;
      first line of therapy. Additional eligibility requirements included: ≥1 measurable disease at&#xD;
      baseline per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v 1.1);&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status of 0 or 1; or life expectancy of ≥ 3&#xD;
      months and adequate organ function. The main exclusion criteria were interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease, pulmonary fibrosis, active or prior autoimmune disease or active hepatitis, or&#xD;
      history of anlotinib or any other PD-L1/PD-1 antagonist treatment. Patients with abdominal&#xD;
      fistula, diverticulitis, gastrointestinal ulcerative disease or perforation, or abdominal&#xD;
      abscess within the prior 4 weeks were also excluded. This study was an open, exploratory&#xD;
      single-arm, phase II trial. Enrolled patients received anlotinib (12mg, po. qd, d1-14)&#xD;
      combined with toripalimab (240 mg, inv, over 30 min once every 2 weeks).&#xD;
