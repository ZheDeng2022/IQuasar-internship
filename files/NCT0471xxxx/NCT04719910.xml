  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea/vomiting (PONV) is a common problem following surgery and anesthesia.&#xD;
      There are risk factors that increase the incidence of PONV that are related to the patient,&#xD;
      to the surgical procedure or to the anesthetic agents. At the subjective level PONV is&#xD;
      described as worse and more feared than postoperative pain by many patients. At the objective&#xD;
      level it increases the length of stay in the recovery room, it results in unplanned hospital&#xD;
      admission and Emergency Room visits, and therefore increased cost of care. A lot of research&#xD;
      work has been done to identify pharmacological agents to prevent and treat PONV. The higher&#xD;
      the risk of a patient the higher number of these drugs are combined for prophylaxis. However,&#xD;
      these drugs have significant side effects of their own. Much less attention has been paid to&#xD;
      potential non-pharmacological PONV prevention options. The purpose of our study is to&#xD;
      investigate the putative role of the natural stimulation of normal gastrointestinal function&#xD;
      via the Pavlovian reflex. We seek to find a natural method with no side effects to improve&#xD;
      PONV prophylaxis in patients with risk factors for that postoperative complication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 18-40 years old female volunteers who are undergoing planned,&#xD;
      elective, non-cancer surgical procedure as outpatients, and who are identified to have either&#xD;
      history or significant risk of PONV. The latter will be calculated by the questionnaire we&#xD;
      currently use during our routine preoperative anesthesia evaluation (see in detail below in&#xD;
      the Study design section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the study enrollment criteria will be identified on the surgical schedule&#xD;
      the day before the planned intervention. The recruitment will occur during the preoperative&#xD;
      admission process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will be randomly assigned to either the study group or to the control group.&#xD;
      The study group will watch videos of preparation and cooking of their favorite foods while&#xD;
      waiting for their surgery. Patients in the control group will watch videos that are not food&#xD;
      related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia team in the OR and the PACU team who manages the patient's postoperative&#xD;
      recovery will be blinded to which group the patient is enrolled to. The intraoperative&#xD;
      antiemetics will be provided by the study team as outlined in the Study design section below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia protocol will be standardized. All patient who are enrolled in the study will&#xD;
      require general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. After intravenous induction, muscle&#xD;
      relaxation with rocuronium and intubation of the trachea anesthesia will be maintained with&#xD;
      sevoflurane and opioid boluses for analgesia as deemed necessary by the anesthesia team.&#xD;
      Antiemetics (as described below) will be administered 30 minutes prior to planned emergence,&#xD;
      residual muscle relaxant will be reversed with sugammadex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be taken to the recovery room. Beyond their routine vital sign and pain&#xD;
      score monitoring and observation the occurrence and degree of nausea and vomiting, as well as&#xD;
      the time to discharge to home or unplanned admission due to therapy resistant vomiting will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
