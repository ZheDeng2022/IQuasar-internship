  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the point or nonsense of treating cartilage lesions&#xD;
      at the level of the first metatarsophalane joint. To date, no clear guidelines have been&#xD;
      found in the literature with regard to the treatment of cartilage lesions at the MTP I joint&#xD;
      during corrective surgery for hallux valgus, nor has it been investigated whether this can&#xD;
      have an effect on the clinical outcome.&#xD;

      A randomized, single surgeon study in which two groups will be compared with each other:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 50 patients in whom no treatment of the cartilage lesions is performed: these&#xD;
      patients have no cartilage lesion or a grade I cartilage lesion at the MTP I joint that has&#xD;
      been found to be operative. The grade of the cartilage lesions will be determined on the&#xD;
      basis of the ICRS scale and an MS Hololens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: 50 patients with a cartilage lesion&gt; grade 1 found during surgery. Whether or not to&#xD;
      treat the cartilage injury will be randomly determined. 50 envelopes will be made with 25&#xD;
      treat, 25 not to treat. Just before surgery, Dr. T. Lootens an envelope will be drawn which&#xD;
      will determine the further policy of the operation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2A: 25 patients who are not treated for the cartilage injury. Group 2B: 25 patients who&#xD;
      are treated for the cartilage injury by means of debridement of the lesion and microfracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who will undergo surgery for hallux valgus will be seen pre-operatively at the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic by the investigators. During this consultation, an explanation will be&#xD;
      given about the research and the participant will have to sign an informed consent before&#xD;
      participating in the study. Here, the participant will also receive an envelope with&#xD;
      questionnaires (AOFAS score / SF 36 score / VAS pain and satisfaction), which they will fill&#xD;
      out on the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up The participants will be seen again at the orthopedics outpatient clinic for&#xD;
      clinical follow-up and filling out questionnaires at 10 days, 5 weeks, 4 months and 1 year&#xD;
      postoperatively. This follow up will be done by the co-investigator, who is blinded during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific foundation Corrective hallux valgus surgery currently exists in two ways: open and&#xD;
      closed (percutaneous) technique. To date, there is no consensus on the treatment of visible&#xD;
      cartilage lesions at the MTP I joint during the open technique. It is not known whether or&#xD;
      not treating these injuries has an impact on the patient's clinical outcome. The Principle&#xD;
      investigator already treats the serious cartilage lesions (&gt; GR1 lesions) by means of&#xD;
      debridement of the lesion, followed by microfracture. As there is no literature available on&#xD;
      this topic yet, this research could certainly add value for the therapeutic approach of&#xD;
      cartilage lesions at MTP I in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, if microfracture gives a significantly better clinical outcome, this means that the&#xD;
      closed (percutaneous) technique is contraindicated as a corrective technique in patients with&#xD;
      hallux valgus. If this is not the case, no cartilage lesions at the level of the MTP I joint&#xD;
      need to be taken into account during open technique.&#xD;

    <description>Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey - consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
