  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease is a devastating lung condition with terrible outcomes. Lung cancer&#xD;
      is the world's leading cause of cancer related death. Unlike breast and bowel cancer, there&#xD;
      is no lung cancer screening programme in the UK. However, there are a number of pilot lung&#xD;
      cancer screening programmes taking place including one in Manchester. The CT scans used in&#xD;
      lung cancer screening programmes pick up other lung conditions out with lung cancer,&#xD;
      including interstitial lung disease. This provides a unique opportunity to diagnose&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease at an early and non-symptomatic stage where treatment can be&#xD;
      initiated early to halt progression of disease and development of symptoms. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to determine how much (prevalence) interstitial lung disease can be picked up in a lung&#xD;
      cancer screening programme and how these cases would compare to those diagnosed with&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease through the 'standard' way in the clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis that the patients diagnosed through the screening programmes&#xD;
      will have an earlier stage of disease with less symptoms. If this is to be the case, this&#xD;
      would provide researchers with the opportunity to diagnose interstitial lung disease through&#xD;
      lung cancer screening programmes and initiate treatment early.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Manchester Early Detection of Lung Disease Pilot (lung cancer screening programme) is&#xD;
      already under way and has been for the past 12 months. A total of 1,384 individuals had a CT&#xD;
      scan as part of this service. From these, several individuals (around 40) have been diagnosed&#xD;
      with likely interstitial lung disease (ILD) and been referred to the regional ILD clinic at&#xD;
      the University Hospital of South Manchester (UHSMÍ¾ Wythenshawe). These patients are due to&#xD;
      attend the clinic soon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals attending the regional ILD clinic as a 'new referral' will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be evaluated, and suitable participants&#xD;
      will be provided with a patient information sheet (PIS) on the same day prior to written&#xD;
      consent being obtained for enrolment into the study. Individuals will be given as much time&#xD;
      as needed to read the PIS and ask relevant questions. We will recruit patients from two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: ILD diagnosed through the Manchester Early Detection of Lung Disease Pilot&#xD;
           (lung cancer screening programme) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: age and sex matched individuals with ILD diagnosed through standard&#xD;
           non-screening pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to fill out a number of health-related questionnaires in addition&#xD;
      to the standard care they will receive as part of their clinic visit. No extra tests will be&#xD;
      performed as a result of this study, the only additional information required is related to&#xD;
      the questionnaires. These questionnaires will focus on quality of life and symptom burden and&#xD;
      will on average take 10-15 minutes to complete. The information gathered from their clinic&#xD;
      visit (including any tests performed) will also be collected and used for research purposes.&#xD;
      Once complete, the results between group 1 and group 2 will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall there will be three time points in the study for each participant to fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires. This will be at the baseline visit (as above) and also at 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months. The 6 month and 12 month questionnaires will be completed by participants, with as&#xD;
      required help from the research team, at a follow-up clinic visit if one is set up (ILD&#xD;
      clinic patients are often seen back in clinic at these time points). If not clinic&#xD;
      appointment is set up at these time points, the questionnaires will be posted to the&#xD;
      participants for self-completion at home with help offered over the phone as required.&#xD;
