  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of NTM diseases has been increasing regularly over the past 30 years in&#xD;
      industrialized countries Although NTM are identified worldwide, there are important&#xD;
      geographical disparities as to the relative prevalence of NTM species There are no data&#xD;
      covering the ecology of NTM in Switzerland. Because of the progressive increase in NTM&#xD;
      clinical cases in area Geneva(as noted in other industrialized countries), reporting the&#xD;
      specific NTM distribution is important and relevant. In this study, the investigators aimed&#xD;
      to: 1/ describe the relative prevalence of NTM species in clinical samples analyzed in the&#xD;
      Geneva area, covering ca 500'000 inhabitants over a 5-year period; 2/ determine how many&#xD;
      culture positive patients were treated; and 3/ specify the clinical sites involved.&#xD;

      This study was performed in the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG), a 2008-bed complex&#xD;
      providing care for a population of ca. 500'000 inhabitants. All clinical samples sent for&#xD;
      microbiological analysis within HUG are treated by the Bacteriology Laboratory of Geneva&#xD;
      University Hospitals. An online database is kept up-to-date and includes all samples&#xD;
      processed by the laboratory. The investigators performed a comprehensive analysis of all&#xD;
      clinical samples included in this database over a 5-year period (2015-2020). This report&#xD;
      focuses only on positive results for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).The following items&#xD;
      were recorded: age, gender, BMI whenever available, site of infection (when pulmonary:&#xD;
      description of main radiological abnormalities), presence and type of immunosuppression,&#xD;
      relevant pulmonary and non-pulmonary comorbidities, results of microscopy, and NTM species&#xD;
      identified. The investigators also recorded whether the patient was treated for the&#xD;
      identified NTM or not and if a susceptibility profile had been determined (this is not&#xD;
      routinely performed and must be requested by the clinician).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by their local ethics committee&#xD;
