  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placebo groups in clinical trials on depression show impressive improvements. Yet, there is&#xD;
      little research on the mechanism underlying this effect. The aim of this study is to assess&#xD;
      how patients' treatment expectations modulate the placebo treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that patients' treatment expectation determines placebo responses and treatment&#xD;
      outcomes, and that this expectation is influenced by the disorder explanations (information&#xD;
      about the illness models) typically provided during the initial medical encounters that&#xD;
      precede treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study we aim to manipulate depressed patients' expectations by providing two different&#xD;
      clinician-delivered illness and treatment rationales (biological/ psychological). Patients&#xD;
      will then receive placebo treatment (pharmacological/ psychological), that is either&#xD;
      congruent or incongruent with the previously communicated treatment rationale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Providing a treatment-congruent treatment rationale leads to a better outcome than&#xD;
           providing treatment-incongruent rationales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment-congruent explanations reduce the risk of side effect development, in&#xD;
           particular in the medication arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inter-individual differences in the effect of provided treatment rationale are&#xD;
           associated with pre-treatment experiences and expectations, depression severity and&#xD;
           comorbid anxiety.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will be blinded to the congruency condition. Outcome assessors (diagnosticians) will be blinded to treatment allocation and the congruency condition (both at the pre-measurement and at the post-measurement). The clinicians (care providers) who deliver the illness explanation and treatment rationale will be blinded to the participants' treatment allocation up to the point at which the respective treatment is delivered. This means that the clinician provides the treatment rationale (biological / psychological) without knowledge of whether a congruent or incongruent treatment will be delivered afterwards. The staff members who deliver the treatment (care providers) will be different to the clinician who delivers the rationales. Thus the treatment will be delivered without knowledge of whether a congruent or incongruent illness explanation was given.</masking_description>

    <description>Depression is described as a brain disorder and the role of monoamine, brain structures, and brain functions are reported as central mechanisms of relevance for its etiology and treatment.

    <description>Depression is described as a psychological disorder resulting from emotion regulation deficits. The suppression of emotions receives a special role in explaining depression.

    <description>The active placebo pill does not have direct effects on the brain. Buscopan (butylscopolamine, 10 mg daily, 1 pill in the morning) does not cross the blood-brain barrier, yet induces some smaller side effects that resemble those of antidepressants (e.g., mouth dryness, fatigue, nausea). Treatment duration is 4 weeks. The rationale is briefly explained to participants as &quot;stimulating the biological balance in humans with depression, using a well-tolerated drug similar to Buscopan, which is well-known from pain treatments.</description>
