  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world after cardiovascular disease (8.7&#xD;
      million deaths in 2015 for 17.5 million cases) 1. Despite a great deal of progress in disease&#xD;
      detection and treatment, the incidence of cancer is steadily increasing (+ 33% in 2015) and&#xD;
      particularly in certain locations (pancreas, lungs, brain and stomach), including risk&#xD;
      factors are not always identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced stage cancer (= metastatic) is most often incurable with the exception of germ cell&#xD;
      tumors. Palliative care is then most often offered. Palliative care favors the patient's&#xD;
      quality of life as a whole (medical, physical, psychological and social).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms most often reported by patients are: pain, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea,&#xD;
      and are directly related to phenomena such as cachexia, loss of autonomy and deterioration of&#xD;
      psychological state, resulting in decreased overall survival. Chemotherapies and targeted&#xD;
      therapies (immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, participation in a clinical trial) can provide a&#xD;
      benefit in quality of life and survival only in the early phase (little benefit in the&#xD;
      terminal phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other prognostic factors can impact the quality of life and overall survival in these&#xD;
      situations: sarcopenia and disorders of nutritional status (obesity, undernutrition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of sarcopenia by CT scan of patients in a palliative situation is still too scarce.&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is an often underestimated event and is associated with older age, co-morbidities,&#xD;
      increased infectious complications, and early mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the prevalence of sarcopenia by CT scan would confirm its prognostic impact in a&#xD;
      palliative situation.&#xD;
