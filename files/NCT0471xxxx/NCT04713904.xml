  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed at a single site with 38 subjects. Participantswill take 2&#xD;
      tablets of the test product and reference product in 2 periods and 2 sequences (either test&#xD;
      after reference or reference after test). There will be a washout of at least 14 days between&#xD;
      each study period.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      Clornadinone and Ethinyl estradiol of 2 tablet formulations with Clormadinone 2 mg and&#xD;
      Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg and to demonstrate bioequivalence of both formulations in terms of&#xD;
      rate and extent of absorption:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Andrómaco S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference Product: Evafem 20 [Trademark], product of Grünenthal. The 90% confidence&#xD;
           intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus Reference Product)&#xD;
           for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma concentration-time curve&#xD;
           from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72 hours (AUC0-72), and maximum&#xD;
           plasma concentration (Cmax) for total Clormadinone and Ethinyl estradiol will be&#xD;
           determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 36 hours during each study&#xD;
      period (for 12 hours pre-dosing and for 24 hours post dosing) during which pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) blood samples will be obtained. 16 blood samples will be taken up to 24 hours after the&#xD;
      administration in each period. Participants will return to the site to provide additional&#xD;
      blood samples at 48 h, and 72 h postdose. The washout period between the two study periods&#xD;
      will be at least 14 days. The samples from each participant will be analyzed with 2 methods&#xD;
      of high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical assays to&#xD;
      quantify total Clormadinone and Ethinyl estradiol in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in women by&#xD;
      collecting adverse events.&#xD;
