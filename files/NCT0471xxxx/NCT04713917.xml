  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have shown that locoregional treatment (surgery, radiotherapy) and systemic&#xD;
      treatment (endocrine therapy and chemotherapy) for breast cancer (BC) may impact sexuality by&#xD;
      causing physical and/or psychological damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 50-75 % of BC survivors suffer from vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). The earliest&#xD;
      symptoms of VVA are decreased vaginal lubrication, followed by other vaginal and urinary&#xD;
      symptoms, such as burning, itching, bleeding, leucorrhoea, dyspareunia and dysuria symptoms.&#xD;
      Various surveys have shown that VVA symptoms lead to female sexual disorder and on their&#xD;
      partners through sexual unsatisfactory. However, it appears that sexuality is a little&#xD;
      discussed topic during the follow-up of BC survivors. Most of patients relate a poor&#xD;
      satisfaction with information and counselling related to sexuality and vaginal health, which&#xD;
      are denied by many practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated for BC cannot find relief in hormonal replacement therapy (HRT), which is&#xD;
      considered the gold standard treatment for VVA symptoms. The usual treatments for these women&#xD;
      are topics such as ovula or gel (lubricant, hyaluronic acid (HA)…) with however, a short term&#xD;
      effect even when these topics are applied regularly and correctly during at least 2 to&#xD;
      3/weeks.In the literature, there is a significant impact on VVA at one month but later data&#xD;
      are lacking . Moreover, patients' compliance and daily application are paramount of&#xD;
      importance for efficacy that could disappear when the treatment is stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No randomized controlled trial has compared this treatment to innovative strategies. In this&#xD;
      context, it is important to establish management strategies for VVA and sexual disorder after&#xD;
      BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to assess prevalence rate of VVA among breast cancer survivors after the&#xD;
      loco regional treatment and chemotherapy, and to compare the efficacy of innovative&#xD;
      treatments namely, new biophysical inductor (Laser CO2) and chemical bio inductor (Hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid injections) treatments to the efficacy of standard non-hormonal topic treatment for&#xD;
      improving the VVA and the quality of sexual life on a long-term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label multicentre controlled trial randomized in 3 parallel groups (1:1:1) to assess&#xD;
      the one-year superiority of bio physical inductor (C02 laser, D0 and M6, group laser)&#xD;
      compared to the standard treatment currently recommended (Mucogyne, 2 times a week for one&#xD;
      year, control group) in the one hand, and of chemical bio inductor (Desirial, injection of 1&#xD;
      mL of hyaluronic acid in the first 3 cm of the vaginal walls, D0 and M6, HA injection group)&#xD;
      compared to the control group in the other hand in BC survivors with VVA, with blinded&#xD;
      primary endpoint assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of these innovative treatments (lasers and injections) for Vulvovaginal atrophy based&#xD;
      on the bio induction and the regenerative medicine could improve the quality of the vaginal&#xD;
      mucosa after breast cancer therapy and could be a new strategy for these women who cannot&#xD;
      benefit from Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). The benefits expected are the improvement of&#xD;
      the quality of vulvo-vaginal mucosa and the improvement of the sexual quality of life of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
