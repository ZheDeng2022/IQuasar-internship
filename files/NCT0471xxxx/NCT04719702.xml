  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative Sedation (PS) is defined as the intentional lowering of consciousness of a patient&#xD;
      in the last phase of life, to relieve patients suffering from refractory symptoms. For those&#xD;
      symptoms all possible effective treatments, within an acceptable timeframe, are exhausted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have been performed about palliative sedation, mostly focusing on continuous&#xD;
      deep sedation, with the use of various measurements to monitor its effect. Efficacy of&#xD;
      continuous palliative sedation has been monitored by agitation/distress levels, symptom&#xD;
      control, levels of sedation/awareness, comfort, safety and family/caregivers satisfaction.&#xD;
      Differences between studies occur, for instance in definition, application and monitoring.&#xD;
      Consequently reported outcomes and associated treatment goals differ between studies which&#xD;
      makes it difficult to compare the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this international multicenter observational study, the investigators aim to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of palliative sedation on patient's comfort levels. Participants with different&#xD;
      forms and intensity of palliative sedation (intermittent and continuous, from light to deep)&#xD;
      are included in a prospective design as part of an international study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of palliative sedation on participants' comfort and other&#xD;
           symptoms in different international hospices, palliative care units and hospital ward&#xD;
           settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the clinical practice of palliative sedation in different international care&#xD;
           settings and the accompanying costs and consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective observational multicentre study in hospices, palliative care units&#xD;
      and hospital ward settings in five European countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, The&#xD;
      Netherlands).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Levels of discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: Baseline before start PS (max. 8 hours before); T1: First measurement after start PS, within 6 hours after start PS; T2-T..: Measurements are continued twice a day during PS until the date of death, on average less than 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Change in discomfort levels of participants receiving a form of palliative sedation (PS) will be measured by the Discomfort Scale-Dementia of Alzheimer Type (DS-DAT). The tool covers nine categories: noisy breathing, negative vocalizations, content facial expression, sad facial expression, frightened facial expression, frown, relaxed body language, tense body language, and fidgeting. Items are scored by indicating behaviors that are present/absent with a resulting range of scores from 0 to 27. Higher scores represent higher amount of discomfort.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Levels of agitation and sedation</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: Baseline before start PS (max. 8 hours before); T1: First measurement after start PS, within 6 hours after start PS; T2-T..: Measurements are continued twice a day during PS until the date of death, on average less than 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Change in levels of agitation and sedation of participants receiving a form of palliative sedation will be measured by the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale-modified version for Palliative Care (RASS-PAL). This scale is a modified version of the RASS. The RASS-PAL is a 10-point scale ranging from -5 to +4. Levels -1 to -5 denote 5 levels of sedation, starting with &quot;awakens to voice&quot; and ending with &quot;unarousable.&quot; Levels +1 to +4 describe increasing levels of agitation. The lowest level of agitation starts with apprehension and anxiety, and peaks at combative and violent. RASS-PAL level 0 is &quot;alert and calm.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Daily Registration from start PS until the date of death, on average less than 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>When PS is started a list of medications is completed daily. Part of this medication list contains information about changes in dosages of sedative medication. Medication dosage can be increased or decreased. The changed dosage is registered in numbers; units (mg or mg/hr); and date and time of the change.</description>

    <measure>Changes in sort of administered sedative medication during Palliative Sedation</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily Registration from start PS until the date of death, on average less than 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>When PS is started a list of medications is completed daily. Part of this medication list contains information about changes in sort of sedative medication used for palliative sedation. The sort medication dosage can be changed by starting a new sort of medication or stopping a sort of administered sedative medication. Changes in the sort of sedative medication are registered with the medication name and the date and time of change.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in route of administered medication during Palliative Sedation</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily Registration from start PS until the date of death, on average less than 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>When PS is started a list of medications is completed daily. Part of this medication list contains information about changes in route of the administered medication used for palliative sedation. The route of administered medication can be changed from subcutaneous to intravenous or vice versa; from bolus to continuous. Changes in the route of sedative medication are registered with the route and the date and time of change.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of staff time (in minutes) needed for tasks in different phases of PS</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: During the decision process; T2: Start/Initiation of PS; T3-T..: Daily registration of time until the death date, on average 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>During the different phases of PS (decision making; initiating; monitoring; aftercare) the attending HCPs registrate their individual spent time needed for tasks within the process.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with care during the palliative sedation period by one of the relatives</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: Once, One month after the participant's death the relative receives the questionnaire.</time_frame>
    <description>The Satisfaction of Family Caregivers (FAMCARE-2) Scale is a tool used to measure family satisfaction with advanced cancer care. The FAMCARE-2 measures the degree to which family members are content with the palliative care team behaviors directed toward the patient and themselves. Items are referring to four different areas of care such as availability of care, physical patient care, psychosocial care and information giving. Items are scored at a five-point Likert-scale with the following responses: very satisfied, satisfied, undecided, dissatisfied and very dissatisfied. A total score ranging from 17 to 85 and scores for the four subscales can be calculated. Higher sum scores indicate higher satisfaction.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the palliative sedation period of the patient by one of the Health Care Professionals (HCP)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: Once, within one week after the participant's death the HCP receives the questionnaire.</time_frame>
    <description>One of the attending HCPs, which was present during the start of the palliative sedation, is asked to complete an ad hoc questionnaire about the palliative sedation in the specific participant's case. The items that are asked to score on a Likert scale are: 1. Agreement with the decision (strongly disagree - disagree - undecided - agree - strongly agree); 2. The overall achieved effect of palliative sedation at patient's comfort levels (excellent - good - fair - poor - very poor); 3. The quality of dying (excellent - good - fair - poor - very poor).</description>
