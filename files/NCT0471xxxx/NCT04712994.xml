      This study tests strategies for improving PrEP implementation in maternal and child health&#xD;
      clinics using an interrupted time series.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve integrated delivery of PrEP to women seeking health services in&#xD;
      maternal and child health clinics by piloting and evaluating four strategies or bundles of&#xD;
      strategies for optimized PrEP delivery. Strategies to be tested include three strategies&#xD;
      identified by stakeholders and 1 pre-developed package of strategies (video counseling, HIV&#xD;
      self-testing, and optimized delivery).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>An interrupted-time series design will be used; this is a quasi-experimental design that compares data before an intervention is introduced to data after the intervention is introduced, and controls for time trends. Four rounds of interrupted-time series to evaluate four PrEP optimization interventions, three identified by stakeholders based on qualitative information in Aim 1, and one pre-developed package of interventions (video-based PrEP counselling, HIV Self-Testing [HIVST], and optimized PrEP delivery). Each of the four rounds of interrupted-time series evaluations will include 4 facilities receiving the intervention and 4 facilities serving as an ongoing concurrent comparator group; these 4 facilities will not receive any of the packages of interventions, but will undergo the same data collection procedures.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>There will be four strategies or bundles of strategies tested, one bundle in each of the four interrupted-time series evaluations. Three of the bundles of strategies will be determined based on the qualitative information gathered in Aim 1 by stakeholders and are unknown at this time. One bundle of strategies is pre-developed and includes 3 components: video-based PrEP counselling, HIV Self-Testing [HIVST] for women undergoing repeat HIV testing, and optimized PrEP delivery and prescription processes</description>
