  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only vulnerable patients, when facing environmental stressors, attempt or commit suicide.&#xD;
      Previous research demonstrated that suicide attempters usually misunderstand the social&#xD;
      context and show impairments in decision making. Heart activity, endocrine and inflammatory&#xD;
      response to stress were related with these features. For that, suicide attempters, in a&#xD;
      context of social stress, would have maladaptive physiological response impacting the&#xD;
      following decision making. The main aim is to identify the physiological response (autonomous&#xD;
      nervous system, endocrine and inflammatory response) of suicide attempters under social&#xD;
      stress conditions and to investigate the association of this response with the posterior&#xD;
      decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to compare physiological response to social stress and posterior&#xD;
      decision-making response in 80 euthymics women with a past mood disorder according to their&#xD;
      history of suicide attempt&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: 1. suicide attempters will have a lower cortisol, and, greater alpha-amylase and&#xD;
      peripheral inflammatory response after a social stressor, compared to non-attempters 2.&#xD;
      suicide attempters will have a hyper-activation of the cardiovascular response during the&#xD;
      social stressor and a slower recovery to basal levels, compared with non-attempters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. With respect to decision-making, suicide attempters will demonstrate riskier&#xD;
      decision-making than non-attempters after the social stressor, compared to non-attempters.&#xD;
      Risk-taking behavior will be related with lower cortisol and higher testosterone levels after&#xD;
      the stressor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiography (IKG) will be used to analyse&#xD;
      cardiovascular function during social stressor. Salivary samples to analyze cortisol,&#xD;
      testosterone and Î±-amylase. Blood samples to analyze several peripheral inflammatory&#xD;
      proteins. The Iowa Gambling Task a neuropsychologial task to evaluate decision making.&#xD;
      Several questionnaires of mood, anxiety and psychological pain during the stressor. And a&#xD;
      comprehensive battery of clinical measures for screening and assessment of construct of&#xD;
      suicide, and psychiatric and social status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Depressed females will be screened and assigned to 2 groups: 1) 40 depressed with&#xD;
      suicide attempt history. 2) 40 depressed without suicide attempt history. Participants will&#xD;
      confront a virtual version of the Trier Social Stress Test (V-TSST). This test consists in a&#xD;
      preparation and execution of a presentation in front of a virtual tribunal for obtain a job&#xD;
      position followed by an arithmetic mental task. During the procedure, ECG and IKG will be&#xD;
      performed, 5 salivary samples and 5 blood samples (before and after the stressor) and some&#xD;
      self-reports of mood, anxiety and pain. After procedure decision making will be assessed.&#xD;
      Their participation will consist of 3 visits : inclusion visit (psychiatric interview), visit&#xD;
      between 1 to 8 days (social stressor procedure), at 12 months (follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential impact and next steps: Identifying differences between the two depressed groups in&#xD;
      the physiological response to social stress and their subsequent decision making will advance&#xD;
      the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of suicide. As social stress is&#xD;
      present in several life events during lifetime, know how suicidal people respond to these&#xD;
      issues may help in the implementation of preventive interventions.&#xD;

    <description>The task consists in a brief presentation about the abilities of participants followed by an arithmetic task in front of a virtual 3D audience projected and one researcher in a small room.First, participants have 5 minutes to prepare an exhibition about their qualities, their strengths and defects, and, why they identify with them. During this period virtual reality shows a closed curtain, and sounds from the audience can be heard. In the second phase, the curtain is raised and the participant must expose his speech during 5 minutes. Audience will remain attentive during 2 minutes, then audience will change to a restless attitude. The third phase consists of subtracting back a two-digit number from a four-digit number, as quickly as possible, starting again if participant makes a mistake. A debriefing of the test is scheduled at the end of the protocol, to remind patients of the purely fictional nature of this test. The visit will only end after a return to the baseline emotional state</description>
