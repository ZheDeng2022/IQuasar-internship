  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to transform the diagnosis and treatment of dysphonia by elucidating&#xD;
      cervical and cranial neuromuscular mechanisms underlying typical and disordered voicing. The&#xD;
      overall objective of this application is to propose and evaluate a novel objective&#xD;
      spectrotemporal diagnostic tool measuring functional cervical-cranial muscle network activity&#xD;
      in typical and disordered speakers.The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding&#xD;
      of how the vocal tract and the muscles of the larynx and the head work at baseline and after&#xD;
      vocal fatigue.&#xD;

      Three experiments will be conducted over the 2-year award period. Experiment 1 (Aim 1) will&#xD;
      utilize a 16-channel EMG array to characterize cervical-cranial muscle activity networks in&#xD;
      typical speakers at baseline and after a vocal loading task. Aim 2 will quantify how cervical&#xD;
      muscle networks are perturbed in patients with two different types of dysphonia and examine&#xD;
      if standard-of-care treatment restores cervical-cranial muscle networks to more typical&#xD;
      states. In Experiment 2 (Aim 2), we will measure muscle networks in patients with muscle&#xD;
      tension dysphonia before and after a course of voice therapy. Patients with muscle tension&#xD;
      dysphonia represent an intact butpotentially maladaptive network. In Experiment 3 (Aim 2), we&#xD;
      will measure patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis, representing a neurologically&#xD;
      impaired network, before and after a vocal fold injection medialization procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Both at baseline and after a vocal loading task, muscle network activity using sEMG will be measured in a variety of vocal tasks outlined above in Table 1 to explore the muscle network across different vocal demands and pitch and loudness levels. The pitch and loudness of each task produced at baseline by each participant will be calculated, and visual feedback will be provided to participants using the Real-Time Pitch module of the Computerized Speech Lab (Pentax, Montvale, NJ) to help them reproduce similar pitch and loudness levels during post-loading recordings.</description>

    <measure>Change in Vocal loading task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit, 2 week visit, 2 months visit</time_frame>
    <description>After baseline sEMG measurements, vocal fatigue will be induced using a vocal loading task of reading in the presence of 70-dB background noise, as described in Sundarrajan 51 The duration of reading that induces self-perceived vocal fatigue varies among vocally-healthy individuals.52 Therefore, we will use the CR10 Physical Exertion Scale adapted for vocal effort to have participants rate their self-perceived participant reported</description>

    <description>Experiment 1 (Aim 1) will utilize a 16-channel sEMG array to characterize cervical-cranial muscle activity networks in typical speakers at baseline and after a vocal loading task. Flexible laryngoscopy will be performed to exclude any existing pathology and confirm eligibility in the healthy control group. Aim 2 will quantify how cervical muscle networks are perturbed in patients with two different types of dysphonia and examine if standard-of-care treatment restores cervical-cranial muscle networks to more typical states.</description>

    <description>A device that examines the throat and nasal passages. The flexible laryngoscope or &quot;scope&quot; consists of an eyepiece and a fiber-optic light enclosed in a thin, flexible tube. The scope looks like a strand of black spaghetti with a tiny light on the end of it. The scope is inserted through the nose, and can be moved around to help the doctor see all areas of the nasal passages and throat.</description>
