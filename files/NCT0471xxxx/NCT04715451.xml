  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test a new medical grade swaddling system for optimal and more&#xD;
      appropriate positioning for preterm infants. This is a trial focused on sleep state, state&#xD;
      regulation and long-term neurodevelopment. The central hypothesis is that this novel&#xD;
      swaddling method will promote sleep and an optimal sleep-wake cycle, while also improving the&#xD;
      neurodevelopment of preterm infants. It is proposed that adequate positioning and secondary&#xD;
      feedback of natural movement of arms and legs stimulates and fosters normal brain&#xD;
      development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Throughout pregnancy, the fetus is encouraged to develop by maintaining proper flexed posture&#xD;
      in the uterus and freely moving its arms and legs against the flexible boundaries of the&#xD;
      womb. However, when born too early, preterm infants lose the natural boundaries of the womb&#xD;
      that support this flexor positioning and movement support. In addition preterm infants&#xD;
      undergo stress because of essential treatments in neonatal intensive care units and exposure&#xD;
      to the extrauterine environment. To support the development of preterm infants, cotton wraps&#xD;
      are often used to maintain appropriate body positioning. Swaddling helps maintain continuous&#xD;
      and adequate body positioning which aids and provides a stable sleep environment and&#xD;
      encourages muscle tone. However, traditional swaddling is challenging in preterm infants and&#xD;
      preterm infants frequently become unswaddled. It is fraught with difficulties related to the&#xD;
      neonatal care and monitoring preterm infants receive due to the prematurity. In addition,&#xD;
      this stiff material does not provide the same sensory experience as the flexible boundaries&#xD;
      of the womb. In response to this challenge, The Investigators developed a new medical grade&#xD;
      swaddling system for optimal and more appropriate positioning and natural movement. Here, The&#xD;
      Investigators outline a trial focused on sleep state, state regulation and long-term&#xD;
      neurodevelopment. The central hypothesis is that this novel swaddling method will promote&#xD;
      sleep and an optimal sleep-wake cycle, while also improving the neurodevelopment of preterm&#xD;
      infants. It is proposed that adequate positioning and secondary feedback of natural movement&#xD;
      of arms and legs stimulates and fosters normal brain development. The Investigators will&#xD;
      clinically evaluate sleep at the level of amplitude-integrated electroencephalograph (aEEG)&#xD;
      activity and perform the Prechtl's Assessment of General Movements (GMA) to assess&#xD;
      spontaneous writhing and fidgety movements, which predicts the future neurodevelopment of&#xD;
      preterm babies. The Investigators will also perform the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)&#xD;
      Network Neurobehavioural Scale (NNNS) as a standardized assessment of neurological integrity&#xD;
      and organization. The goal is to provide early intervention to improve development in preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
