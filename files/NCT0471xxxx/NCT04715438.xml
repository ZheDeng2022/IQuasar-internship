      This study will collect information on immune response and adverse events after vaccination&#xD;
      against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a vulnerable patient cohort. Understanding the&#xD;
      ability or disability to mount a protective immune response after vaccination will help to&#xD;
      counsel patients during the pandemic and support decisions on whom to vaccinate and to&#xD;
      identify patients who require other measures to protect them from COVID-19.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cancer have an increased risk of adverse outcome of COVID-19, which is&#xD;
      determined by their underlying disease and/or cancer treatment. Therefore, vaccination of&#xD;
      cancer patients against COVID-19 is recommended. However, phase III studies do not provide&#xD;
      robust information on efficacy and safety in this vulnerable population. In patients with&#xD;
      cancer, the disease itself, but also immunotherapy and chemotherapy, may have a significant&#xD;
      impact on the ability to develop an effective immune response to COVID-19 vaccination, and&#xD;
      could even increase the risk of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess immune response and adverse events after administration of one approved vaccine&#xD;
      against COVID-19 in patients with cancer treated with immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective multicenter, multicohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four cohorts will receive vaccination against COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Individuals without cancer (N=246, i.e., partners of patients in cohort B, C, and D) B.&#xD;
      Patients with cancer treated with immunotherapy (N=135) C. Patients with cancer treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy (N=246) D. Patients with cancer treated with chemo-immunotherapy (N=246)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be vaccinated against COVID-19 with an approved vaccine. Blood will be&#xD;
      drawn at 4 different time points by venipuncture and at 1 time point by a finger prick and&#xD;
      mucosal lining fluid will be collected at 2 time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the antibody based immune response on day 28 after the second&#xD;
      vaccination. Participants will be classified as responders or non-responders. The definition&#xD;
      of response is seroconversion defined as presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgG&#xD;
      antibodies in individuals without measurable anti-S antibodies at baseline. Participants who&#xD;
      are seropositive at baseline will not be included in the analysis of the primary endpoint.&#xD;
      The percentage of responders of each patient cohort will be compared with the percentage&#xD;
      responders in the control group. Safety is a secondary endpoint which will be reported in&#xD;
      terms of percentage of solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) graded according to&#xD;
      severity. Other secondary endpoints include longevity at 6 months and levels of severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific T cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have to visit the hospital at 4 time points and participants who receive a&#xD;
      third vaccination will have 3 additional hospital visits. The vaccine will be administered&#xD;
      two times according to standard of care, with the option of a third vaccination for&#xD;
      participants without an adequate response after 2 vaccinations. Blood will be drawn (~235 ml&#xD;
      in total for participants receiving 2 vaccinations, and ~470 ml in participants receiving 3&#xD;
      vaccinations) prior to the vaccinations and at day 28 and 6 months after the second and if&#xD;
      applicable the third vaccination. Twelve months after vaccination participants will receive a&#xD;
      finger prick set with instructions for self-collection of a blood sample. Blood sampling will&#xD;
      give minor discomfort. Vaccination can cause AEs including fatigue, chills, headache,&#xD;
      myalgia, and pain at the injection site. For seven days after each vaccination, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to record local and systemic reactions using a questionnaire. At baseline and&#xD;
      at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after vaccination, patients will be asked to complete questionnaires&#xD;
      about potential subsequent testing for SARS-CoV-2, diagnosis of COVID-19, and severity of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect information on immune response and adverse events after vaccination&#xD;
      against COVID-19 in a vulnerable patient cohort. It will also explore immune response and&#xD;
      safety of a third vaccination in participants without an adequate antibody response after the&#xD;
      second vaccination. Understanding the ability or disability to mount a protective immune&#xD;
      Version number: 4.15.0, 6 september14 March 2021 13 of 46 response after vaccination will&#xD;
      help to counsel patients during the pandemic and support decisions on whom to vaccinate and&#xD;
      to identify patients who require other measures to protect them from COVID-19. Participants&#xD;
      will be informed about their antibody titer in a letter that includes an explanation about&#xD;
      what this means to them. This will be done after antibody measurements have been completed&#xD;
      for day 28 after vaccination, and again after 6 months and after 12 months.&#xD;
