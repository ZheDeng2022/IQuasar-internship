  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) has recently been reported to be effective&#xD;
      in controlling pain in persistent chronic pain caused by joint surgery and arthritis.&#xD;
      However, opioids are important drugs that still play a pivotal role in pain control after&#xD;
      surgery. In this study, we want to investigate the difference of the result among patients&#xD;
      who undego total knee arthroplasty (TKA), of the result of pain control after TKA from SNRI&#xD;
      administration of duloxetine and opioid in two groups. We designed a randomized controlled&#xD;
      study (RCT) for the effect of post-TKA pain control to determine whether SNRI is effective in&#xD;
      controlling post-TKA pain compared to Opioid, and whether there is a difference in side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients undergoing TKA for osteoarthritis of the knee joint, pain control will be&#xD;
      performed using the same pain control technique (pain control using NSAID) until discharge (1&#xD;
      week after surgery) after surgery. By evaluating the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which is&#xD;
      known as the patient's pain criterion, the study will be conducted only on patients whose&#xD;
      score is more severe than 4 points. Among these subjects, only patients who agreed to the&#xD;
      study will be assigned to the group taking duloxetine and the group taking opioids with the&#xD;
      same probability according to the randomization table for one week after surgery, that is,&#xD;
      upon discharge. In our hospital, almost all patients with total knee arthroplasty are&#xD;
      discharged one week after surgery, except for special cases such as morbidity of systemic&#xD;
      diseases such as cardiopulmonary dysfunction or acute infection after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the co-researchers, one researcher who is in charge of only patient assignment is&#xD;
      selected, and the person in charge creates a randomization table through computer generated&#xD;
      randomization. During the assignment process, the assignee will not know in advance the next&#xD;
      assignment group, and the randomization table is kept in secret. The assignee does not&#xD;
      intervene in any other process of this study, and participates only in the task of selecting&#xD;
      the assigned group using random checks. The evaluation is evaluated by an evaluator who is&#xD;
      not aware of the patient allocation according to the randomization table among researchers&#xD;
      participating in the clinical study. Such a study plan will be fully explained to the patient&#xD;
      in the process of seeking consent for the study before discharge, as it is recorded in detail&#xD;
      in the subject description, and only patients who have obtained this consent will be the&#xD;
      subject of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This criterion is established because both duloxetine and opioid are not used for all&#xD;
      patients after surgery, but for additional pain control after surgery. Prior to discharge,&#xD;
      the drug is prescribed for a total of 6 weeks by dividing the duloxetine-administered group&#xD;
      and the opioid-administering group, respectively. In general, if duloxetine is not taken for&#xD;
      more than 10 weeks, the frequency of discontinuation syndrome that can occur after&#xD;
      discontinuation is remarkably low, so the administration period of 6 weeks was set as the&#xD;
      administration period. The follow-up periods for out-patient clinic are 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, and 1 year after the TKA surgery. During the follow-up period, NSAIDs will&#xD;
      be prescribed the same in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an additional rescue medication, 650 mg of acetaminophen will be allowed to use up to 2g&#xD;
      per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, 1 week after surgery, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year The degree&#xD;
      of pain will be measured using the VAS pain scale, WOMAC pain scale, Brief pain inventory&#xD;
      (BPI), Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis The pain (ICOAP) score is used to measure&#xD;
      additional pain scales in various ways. In addition, SF-36 will be measured before surgery,&#xD;
      at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery.&#xD;
