  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This collaborative screening protocol, developed by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium&#xD;
      (LCMC) and supported by the Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG), is designed to determine&#xD;
      the feasibility of comprehensive molecular profiling to detect actionable oncogenic drivers&#xD;
      in patients with suspected early stage lung cancers scheduled to undergo biopsies to&#xD;
      establish the diagnosis of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of 10 oncogenic drivers&#xD;
      (mutations in EGFR, BRAFV600E , MET exon 14, and HER2, rearrangements in ALK, RET, NTRK, and&#xD;
      ROS1, and amplification of MET and HER2) that can serve as targets making patients eligible&#xD;
      for upcoming targeted neoadjuvant therapy trials. The ultimate goal is to use this&#xD;
      information from the screening process to select the optimal neoadjuvant therapy and wherever&#xD;
      possible enroll patients onto separate neoadjuvant therapy trials with genomically matched&#xD;
      treatments or other appropriate trials if no actionable driver mutation is detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG) is a network of surgeons within North American&#xD;
      Thoracic Surgery Academic Centers aligned with the goal of enhancing patient care through&#xD;
      administration of multi-site trials focused on recent advances in lung cancer. TSOG has&#xD;
      aligned with the LCMC4 sites to enroll the LCRF-LEADER screening trial. TSOG's involvement&#xD;
      will be essential in trial enrollment and ultimate interpretation of the multimodal clinical&#xD;
      and translational data collected as part of this study. We estimate we will detect an&#xD;
      actionable oncogenic driver in 33% of cases. The remaining 66% of patients will represent a&#xD;
      cohort identified by their care teams as candidates for other potential neoadjuvant therapies&#xD;
      which may include checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab or other novel agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The targeted therapy treatment trials will be conducted independently of the LCRF-LEADER&#xD;
      screening trial, evaluating for efficacy. If none of the 10 oncogenic drivers are detected,&#xD;
      the patient will be offered participation in any clinical trial of neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      available at their treating institution or standard of care therapy. For patients not&#xD;
      enrolled on a targeted treatment trial, circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be&#xD;
      collected at 3 time points: before neoadjuvant treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment but&#xD;
      before surgery, and after surgery. This initiative will be correlated with various clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Prespecified clinical data will be collected for correlation with these circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the determination of the proportion of patients with stage IA2-III lung cancers who possess actionable oncogenic drivers. A patient is considered to have a actionable oncogenic driver if they have any of the following 10 genomic alterations: ALK rearrangements, BRAFV600E mutations, EGFR sensitizing mutations, HER2 mutation, HER2 amplification, MET amplification, MET exon 14 mutation, RET rearrangements, NTRK rearrangement, or ROS1 rearrangements.</description>

        The LCRF LEADER screening trial will enroll all patients with clinically suspected,&#xD;
        resectable stage I-III lung cancers. The population of interest is patients with resectable&#xD;
        non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, however a histologic diagnosis is not required at&#xD;
        the time of study enrollment. We anticipate a small portion of patients with squamous cell&#xD;
        and non-NSCLC histologies to be genotyped centrally in parallel to their histologic&#xD;
        diagnosis. Only patients with non-small cell lung cancers that are not purely squamous will&#xD;
        be counted towards the primary study endpoint.&#xD;
