  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators have recently shown that patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe&#xD;
      epilepsy who have undergone brain surgery targeting the medial temporal lobe structures were&#xD;
      more likely to develop tinnitus postoperatively. This discovery of a vulnerability to&#xD;
      tinnitus associated with medial temporal lobe surgery to eliminate drug-refractory epileptic&#xD;
      seizures provides a new clinical model of tinnitus, targeting temporal lobe regions as&#xD;
      generators or mediators of this hearing disorder. The objective of this project is to study&#xD;
      the impact of tinnitus on the cognitive, emotional, psychoacoustic and cerebral functioning&#xD;
      associated with this hearing disorder, and to clarify the pathophysiology of tinnitus by&#xD;
      comparing different groups of individuals with tinnitus (surgical epileptic patients or&#xD;
      non-surgical ORL patients) to matched tinnitus-free groups (surgical tinnitus-free cases and&#xD;
      healthy controls volunteer).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus (known as &quot;ringing in the ears&quot;) is a disabling medical condition. Its psychosocial&#xD;
      impact is substantial, including anxiety, depression, stress, irritability, concentration and&#xD;
      sleep disorder leading to detrimental effects on communication, education, professional&#xD;
      fulfillment, mental health and quality of life. The cerebral bases of tinnitus and its&#xD;
      consequence on human hearing health have received a lot of attention in the scientific&#xD;
      literature. Yet, the relationship between the neurobiological dysfunction, psychological&#xD;
      processes and clinical semiology of tinnitus remains poorly understood. Considering the&#xD;
      current gaps in knowledge, there is a real need for clinical investigations into&#xD;
      tinnitus-related brain changes and rigorous hearing, psycho-emotional, and cognitive&#xD;
      assessments. the investigators recent discovery of a vulnerability to tinnitus associated&#xD;
      with medial temporal lobe surgery (to treat refractory epilepsy) provides a new clinical&#xD;
      model, which targets the temporal lobe regions as a tinnitus generator or mediator of its&#xD;
      severity. The goal of this collaborative interdisciplinary study is to advance knowledge&#xD;
      about the pathophysiology of tinnitus, as well as the socio-emotional, cognitive and&#xD;
      psychoacoustic aspects associated to this hearing disorder. the investigators will first,&#xD;
      characterize the subjective and self-reported hearing disorders with objective&#xD;
      psychoacoustic, cognitive and affective measures in tinnitus sufferers and second, clarify&#xD;
      the cerebral network underlying tinnitus and elucidate the role temporal lobe regions in the&#xD;
      brain networks at play in surgical and non-surgical tinnitus. To this end, individuals with&#xD;
      and without tinnitus, who had undergone or not a surgery will be compared in a 2 by 2 design.&#xD;
      Investigating different patient cohorts with tinnitus who are well matched to both, healthy&#xD;
      control populations and vulnerable clinical populations, without tinnitus is a valuable&#xD;
      contribution of our proposal. Moreover, the psychological and hearing profiles of people with&#xD;
      tinnitus will be examined in relation with their brain morphology and connectivity&#xD;
      profiles.The project builds upon the internationally recognized leadership of the PI and her&#xD;
      collaborators in the fields of auditory cognition and its neurobiological bases using&#xD;
      neuropsychological, psychoacoustic, and neuroimaging methods in clinical populations. The&#xD;
      members of the investigators consortium have all the necessary and unique expertise to carry&#xD;
      out this innovative and interdisciplinary project.&#xD;
