  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive agent prescribed to prevent organ rejection in post&#xD;
      transplant patients, in combination with other immunosuppressants. In post-kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients, tacrolimus blood trough(peak) level must be monitored frequently, and dose&#xD;
      adjustments must be made as necessary to keep trough level within a very narrow target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High tacrolimus intra-patient variability(IPV) can be a marker of medication non-adherence.&#xD;
      The presence of medication non-adherence could be due to multiple factors e.g. Forgetfulness,&#xD;
      misunderstanding or miscommunication due to language barrier etc. Our hypothesis is using QR&#xD;
      code technology along with extended release Tacrolimus medication will reduce tacrolimus IPV&#xD;
      fluctuation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant indicated for the prophylaxis of&#xD;
      organ rejection in patients receiving allogeneic liver, kidney or heart transplants, in&#xD;
      combination with other immunosuppressants. Envarsus XR (extended release tacrolimus) is a&#xD;
      long acting form of tacrolimus that is prescribed as a single dose per day (every 24 hours)&#xD;
      rather than immediate release tacrolimus (IR-Tac) which is prescribed as a two doses per day&#xD;
      (every 12 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In post-kidney transplant patients, tacrolimus blood trough level must be monitored&#xD;
      frequently, and dose adjustments must be made as necessary to keep trough level within a very&#xD;
      narrow therapeutic range. High intra-patient variability (IPV) has also been reported to&#xD;
      promote donor-specific antibody development, increased graft rejection rates and poor&#xD;
      long-term outcome after kidney transplantation. In addition to increased potential for poor&#xD;
      graft outcomes, these fluctuations and frequent dose adjustments are confusing and burdensome&#xD;
      for patients, add to costs via medication expenses and need for lab checks, and consume the&#xD;
      limited resources of transplant centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, non-adherence with immunosuppression medications is common and also linked to poor&#xD;
      graft outcomes in kidney transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High tacrolimus IPV can be a marker of medication non-adherence. The presence of medication&#xD;
      non-adherence could be due to multiple factors such as forgetfulness to take the medication&#xD;
      or remembering the correct dose, misunderstanding or miscommunication due to language barrier&#xD;
      or logistical issues. High tacrolimus IPV could also be due to difficulty in taking&#xD;
      medication every 12 hours, variation in bioavailability of different generic tacrolimus&#xD;
      formulations or drug interactions. Considering the IPV of Tacrolimus level, patients and&#xD;
      their families often have difficulty managing medications, especially during frequent changes&#xD;
      in medication doses. This problem is more prevalent for older patients, who are often on&#xD;
      multiple medications and for whom side effects and drug-drug interactions may lead to more&#xD;
      harm. Once daily tacrolimus has had mixed results in reducing tacrolimus IPV. Very few&#xD;
      studies have been done till now to measure the IPV among patients who received twice daily&#xD;
      IR-Tac and converted to once daily Envarsus-XR. These studies were able to show significant&#xD;
      reduction in IPV among patients who had high IPV prior to conversion. It is also noteworthy&#xD;
      as compared to Astragraf, Envarsus XR has a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Envarsus&#xD;
      XR uses Melt Dose technology to increase bioavailability and allow a more controlled release&#xD;
      of the drug. This results in less fluctuation between maximum (&quot;peak&quot;) exposure and trough.&#xD;
      From a clinical perspective, Envarsus is noninferior in terms of efficacy (composite&#xD;
      endpoint, including kidney transplant graft loss, death, biopsy-proven acute rejection and&#xD;
      loss to follow-up) when compared to IR-Tac with a similar safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital health technologies have not been studied in regards to tacrolimus IPV but have shown&#xD;
      promising results in improving medication adherence, including in kidney transplant&#xD;
      population. TransMedAxTM application; a proposed digital health platform that will be&#xD;
      developed to be used in this study. It will utilize dynamic QR code based technology&#xD;
      customized to each individual patient, to improve medication adherence. It is especially&#xD;
      geared towards patient populations who have frequent changes in medication dosages and have&#xD;
      limited English language proficiency. A brief description of TransMedAxTM workflow is as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked to bring their medication bottle/pill box to the clinic. A QR&#xD;
           code unique to the patient will be printed from TransMedAxTM website and attached to&#xD;
           medication bottle. TransMedAxTM app will be downloaded on patient's phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research staff will input tacrolimus medication and dose into the patient's TransMedAxTM&#xD;
           application account. The TransMedAxTM verbal instructions will be automatically&#xD;
           translated into the patient's preferred language (English, Spanish, Haitian/Creole, or&#xD;
           Mandarin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When this QR code is scanned by the patient using their smartphone camera, it will provide&#xD;
      verbal instructions on Tacrolimus dosage and also display the time of the dose on patient's&#xD;
      phone. The TransMedAxTM application installed on patient's phone home screen will allow&#xD;
      patient to access this information at one-tap and send reminders when the tacrolimus is due.&#xD;
      This application will also be used to monitor patient adherence using brief questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients and clinicians hope technology will help improve safety, but technology may&#xD;
      increase errors if not properly implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project will specifically focus on transplant patients in their home/outpatient setting,&#xD;
      and addresses language barrier for communication, coordination, and information for these&#xD;
      patients. Our focus is on improving patient self-management of tacrolimus medication and&#xD;
      informed partnership with clinicians to improve safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, our work will have the following impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide patients/families, and providers with a readily available tool to manage&#xD;
           Tacrolimus doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve adherence to the immunosuppressive therapy at appropriate doses prescribed by&#xD;
           physician on timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This measures will reduce the rate of acute rejection, graft loss and drug side effects&#xD;
           and hence the hospitalization.&#xD;
