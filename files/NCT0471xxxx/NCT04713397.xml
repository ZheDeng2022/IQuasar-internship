  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this retrospective study is to present clinical and radiological features and&#xD;
      their relationships for differentiating functional scoliosis due to LLD and LLD concurrent&#xD;
      with AIS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted as a single-center retrospective comparative study on 47 consecutive&#xD;
      scoliosis patients detected LLD, aged 10-18 years, between 2018 and 2020. The scoliosis&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of structural LLD were divided into two groups according to whether&#xD;
      there was a concurrent AIS diagnosis or not. Demographic data were recorded. Limb length was&#xD;
      clinically measured by direct, indirect evaluation method and new LLD-Scoliometer Test. Cobb&#xD;
      degree, axial rotation, internal/external pelvic obliquity and LLD were obtained from&#xD;
      posteroanterior spine radiographs measured by two blinded orthopaedic spine surgeons.&#xD;

    <description>Posteroanterior whole spine digital X-Ray images were obtained with the patient barefoot, both heels on the floor, and both knees extended in an upright standing position. The digital radiography detector was 350x430 millimeters in size and clearly showed the positions of the femoral heads, the iliac crests, and whole spine. The distance between the X-ray tube and the detector was two meters. All radiographic data such as Cobb degree, axial rotation by Perdriolle and pelvic obliquity were measured by two blinded orthopaedic spine surgeons using Surgimap ® Spine (Nemaris ™ Inc, New York, NY) a validated software</description>

    <description>A scoliometer used as an indirect and quantitative method to evaluate LLD for the first time in this study, and described it as &quot;Leg Length Discrepancy Scoliometer Test&quot;. Scoliometer were used on Adams' forward bending position and the level of the pelvis accepted as equal when the scoliometer degree pointed zero on the sacral basis (angle of trunk rotation on sacrum). When considering pelvis level is high on the longer side and is low on the shorter side, if the angle of the scoliometer on the sacrum is negative (slope to the left), the left extremity was considered as shorter. In order to determine its correlation with an indirect method, scoliometer degree on the sacral basis was recorded then wooden blocks were added to the unequal leg side on the sacral basis until the pelvic equality was achieved on the scoliometer. Afterward, a correlation between the first measurement of ATRsacrum and the height of the wooden block which provides ATRsacrum to reach zero was investigated.</description>
