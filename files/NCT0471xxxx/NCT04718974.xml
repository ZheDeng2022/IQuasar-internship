  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study purpose: To assess effect of mHealth Call for life Uganda tool (CFLU) on ART adherence&#xD;
      among youth measured by interactive voice response to daily adherence calls mapped in the&#xD;
      database and proportion with viral suppression of copies below 1000 copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention call for life Uganda (CFLU) uses IVR calls or text messages delivered via&#xD;
      MOTECH™ based Connect for Life technology™. The calls are delivered in 4 languages (Luganda,&#xD;
      English, Luo and Runyakitara) and the participant has to make a choice of the preferred&#xD;
      language during registration to the system. The system offers adherence pill reminders,&#xD;
      health message tips, visit appointment reminders and receipt of self-reported symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is mobile phone based IVR. However, the CLFU trial found that, it was&#xD;
      observed that a good number of participants (50 of 256) at the urban site were not enrolled&#xD;
      due to absence of a basic mobile phone, or had malfunctioning phone keyboards (for Poster&#xD;
      Exhibition at the 20th International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA 2019).&#xD;
      Therefore, we shall provide a basic mobile phone to everyone in the study (SoC and&#xD;
      intervention arm). To avoid stigma associated with a particular phone, we shall get 4 or more&#xD;
      types of basic phones. Issues regarding simcard registration will be dealt with by the&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four study questionnaires will be administered at baseline and 6-monthly until the 12-month&#xD;
      exit visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will capture:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stigma scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sexual behavior assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge of COVID-19 ( only at baseline) The data will be entered using REDCap. Blood&#xD;
           for viral load will be collected at baseline and at the 6 and 12-month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: mHealth CFLU tool The tool capitalises on a basic mobile phone's core utilities&#xD;
      of voice and short messaging services. The system design, development, testing and evaluation&#xD;
      was done by Janssen and the Grameen Foundation&#xD;
      (http://motechsuite.org/index.php/implementations). In 2015, Janssen Global Public Health&#xD;
      Research and Development, in close collaboration with the Infectious Diseases Institute&#xD;
      Kampala (IDI), developed Call for Life Uganda (CFLU) tailored to the needs of PLHIV in&#xD;
      Uganda. The CFLU system follows the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act&#xD;
      (HIPAA) Privacy and Security rules. While the Privacy rules deals with electronic Protected&#xD;
      Health Information, the security rule covers administrative, physical and technical&#xD;
      safeguards to ensure confidentiality, integrity and security of electronic protected health&#xD;
      information. Data transaction between patient and system is encrypted when it comes to human&#xD;
      subjects. The system is password protected, and interaction of system and patient is&#xD;
      personalised with a secret code. The system interacts with the patient through a basic mobile&#xD;
      phone via a keypad and with the health worker through a web-based interface. The system has&#xD;
      options to either use interactive voice response or short message service and the user has to&#xD;
      make a choice, get a secret pin code which ensures privacy to enduser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening-Enrolment procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants will be written on the screening log, and a screening form&#xD;
      completed, reasons for screen failure will be documented on the screening log. Following&#xD;
      successful screening, the participant will be referred to the Research Assistant (RA) to&#xD;
      receive a thorough explanation of the study so and informed consent is obtained. The RA then&#xD;
      administers the stigma questionnaire along with the sociodemographic and medical information,&#xD;
      , HIV knowledge and sexual behaviour questionnaires. A client locater form will be completed&#xD;
      which will help in physical contact tracing, and the participant will be registered on the&#xD;
      enrolment log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will follow (see details of randomisation procedure below) thereafter and the&#xD;
      result in the sealed envelope will dictate whether the patient will be registered onto the&#xD;
      Call for Life System for the intervention or continue with standard of care as per Ministry&#xD;
      of Health HIV Management guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration onto the CFLU system: Refer to Standard operating procedures on registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, all patients will be registered onto the electronic and hard copy of the enrolment&#xD;
      log and a next appointment date is given to them. Finally, the lab request forms are filled&#xD;
      and the patient sent for a blood draw. The patient returns from the lab, receives their&#xD;
      transport refund of UGX 20,000, with a basic mobile phone (only at baseline visit, to all&#xD;
      participants) and is allowed to go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intervention: Standard of care arm The Ministry of Health developed a minimum healthcare&#xD;
      services package for PLHIV to standardize the programming, implementation and delivery of&#xD;
      integrated HIV services in Uganda The standard of care arm is based on the Apr 2018,&#xD;
      consolidated guidelines for prevention and treatment of HIV in Uganda (MoH, 2018), and will&#xD;
      also follow the healthcare services package for PLHIV (Uganda. MoH, September 2014).&#xD;
