  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a very common neurological condition characterized by an&#xD;
      uncontrollable desire to move the legs. Due to the traumatic effect of RLS on morbidity, the&#xD;
      patient is negatively affected in many different directions. The duration and quality of&#xD;
      sleep of the patients decrease, and their cognitive functions change. The prevalence or risk&#xD;
      of anxiety and depression increases in this population. At the same time, the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients is significantly reduced. Among the different pharmacological agents used in RLS,&#xD;
      dopamine agonists are the most widely used. However, the reporting of serious and common side&#xD;
      effects related to this treatment has led to non-pharmacological approaches in the treatment&#xD;
      of RLS and the effectiveness of many different approaches has been investigated. The exercise&#xD;
      approach, which is determined to be effective in the treatment of the disease, is a subject&#xD;
      that has been little studied. The type, duration and frequency of optimal exercise could not&#xD;
      be standardized. In addition, the effect of exercise on RLS patients has been investigated in&#xD;
      limited subjects. For this reason, the aim of our study is to examine the effect of different&#xD;
      exercise programs on symptoms, sleep, cognitive functions, quality of life, psychological&#xD;
      status and fatigue in patients with RLS.&#xD;

    <description>The severity of the symptoms of the patients will be evaluated with the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale. It is a 10-item questionnaire developed through expert evaluation of potential items. Scoring varies between 0-40. The higher the score indicates higher symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, after treatment (end of 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>the patient will be asked to sleep by wearing watches that detect movement (movement watch) for 3 nights, one of which is fixed on the metatarsal and the other is fixed on the wrist. While the objective test of sleep is performed with the software compatible with the wrist watch, periodic extremity movements will be recorded with the software compatible with the other watch.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, after treatment (end of 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS) will be used. Its score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, after treatment (end of 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index will be used.Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale has seven sub-scales that portray various domains of sleep: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. Responses for each subscale are scored as 0-3. Having a global score of 5 or higher indicates bad sleep quality. sleepiness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psychological status</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, after treatment (end of 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological status of the patients will be evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The scale has 14 items, 7 of which with odd numbers represent anxiety while the other 7 with even numbers represent depression. The scores range from 0 to 3 for each item and the maximum score in each sub-scale is 2. Higher scores means worse psychological status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of life in RLS</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, after treatment (end of 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life of the patients will be evaluated with the John Hopkins Restless Leg Syndrome Life Quality Questionnaire. It has 18 items. Ten of the items contribute to a single summary score, the overall life impact score. The remaining eight items concern employment (one question), sexual interest (two questions) and work (five questions).13 are scored on a 5-point scale which can be transformed to a 0-100 score, lower scores indicating worse quality of life. The remainder items are recorded as either a numerical value or a dichotomous response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, after treatment (end of 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue of the patients will be evaluated with the the Fatigue Severity Scale.The items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. The minimum score = 9 and maximum score possible = 63. Higher the score = greater fatigue severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gastrointestinal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, after treatment (end of 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Gastrointestinal symptoms of the patients will be evaluated with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale.The GSRS is a 15-item 7-point Likert-type scale that evaluates how the individual feels in terms of GIS symptoms. It consists of five subcategories: abdominal pain, reflux, diarrhea, indigestion, and contipation. The 1st, 4th and 5th questions of the scale are about abdominal pain; 2. and 3. questions are about reflux; questions 11, 12 and 14 are about diarrhea; Questions 6, 7, 8, and 9 areabout indigestion; 10th, 13th and 15th questions are about constipation. Each item in the scale is valued between the statements of &quot;no discomfort&quot; and &quot;very severe annoyance&quot; and higher scores indicate that the symptoms are more severe.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, after treatment (end of 8 weeks)</time_frame>
