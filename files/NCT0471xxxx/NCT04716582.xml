  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Academic educations concurs with a lot of sitting. Studies have shown that prolonged sitting&#xD;
      not only has disruptive effects on physical health, but also influence mental health and&#xD;
      cognition negatively. For physical health evidence grows that short light intense&#xD;
      interruptions of sitting time effectively counterbalance the impact of prolonged sitting. It&#xD;
      is not clear of light intense physical activity breaks have a similar positive effect on&#xD;
      cognitive performance. Also, it is unclear whether cognitive loading might be able to&#xD;
      compensate the impact of prolonged sitting.This study compares the effects of uninterrupted&#xD;
      sitting with or without cognitive loading and interrupted sitting on cognitive functioning;&#xD;
      muscle activation of leg and trunk muscles under various modes of sitting with walking, in&#xD;
      order to calibrate the physical impact of different sitting modes.&#xD;

      healthy university students will attend three separate intervention visits with 6-days (no&#xD;
      more than 14 days) washout in between: 1) uninterrupted sitting (SIT); 2) uninterrupted&#xD;
      sitting with a cognitive task (COGN); 3) sitting interrupted by light physical activity&#xD;
      (INTERRUPT). For the SIT and INTERRUPT conditions, subjects watch a series of documentaries&#xD;
      while sitting. In the COGN condition, while sitting, participants undergo the online GED test&#xD;
      as cognitive load. Four cognitive tests (D2 test, stroop test, trail making test and 2-BACK&#xD;
      test) and mood states will be performed before and after each intervention. On a separate&#xD;
      day, using surface electromyography, activations of major leg and trunk muscles of sitting on&#xD;
      chair, active and passive sitting on a yoga ball and walking were assessed.&#xD;
