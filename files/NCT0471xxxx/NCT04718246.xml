      Statement of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osseo-integration of dental implants depends mainly on bone regeneration around dental&#xD;
      implant. Hyperlipidemia has significant adverse effects on bone health, leading to lower bone&#xD;
      mineral density and to higher risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture (Corwin 2003; Pirih, Lu&#xD;
      et al. 2012). The effects of hyperlipidemia on bone health may also interfere with dental&#xD;
      implant therapy since the host's bone quantity, quality and healing potential play an&#xD;
      important role in osseointegration (Fedele, Sabbah et al. 2011; Gaetti-Jardim,&#xD;
      Santiago-Junior et al. 2011; Olivares-Navarrete, Raines et al. 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for conducting the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperlipidemia has been associated with the pathophysiology of major diseases, such as&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high cholesterol level has significant adverse effects on bone, including lower bone&#xD;
      density, volume and strength. Statins, drugs that lower serum cholesterol levels have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on bone metabolism. Since host's bone quantity, quality and healing&#xD;
      potential play a crucial role in osseointegration of dental implants, it was hypothesized&#xD;
      that hyperlipidemia may negatively affect implant osseointegration.&#xD;

      The high predictability of dental implants has led to routine use with a great expectation&#xD;
      for success. There are many researches focused on the outcome of delayed dental implant.&#xD;
      Since the first report of highly success rate after placement of a dental implant, there has&#xD;
      been increasing interest in this technique for implant treatment (Chen ST., 2004) The goal of&#xD;
      modern dentistry is to restore the patient's dentition to normal contour, function, comfort,&#xD;
      esthetics, speech and health regardless of the atrophy, disease or injury of the&#xD;
      stomatognathic system, as a result of disease related tooth loss and the value placed upon&#xD;
      teeth, there has been a continual search for methods by which missing teeth could be&#xD;
      replaced. Early artificial replacements were made from natural teeth and a variety of&#xD;
      substitute materials. All transplantation of a tooth from one person to another was an early&#xD;
      method by which lost teeth were replaced. Archeological discoveries indicate that many&#xD;
      ancient civilizations practiced allogenic tooth transplantation. In 1561, Ambrose Pare&#xD;
      reported that decayed teeth could be replaced by using extracted teeth from another&#xD;
      individual and is credited with being the first to mention transplantation (Chiu YW., 2015)&#xD;
      Periimplant osteogenesis consists of postsurgical reaction and remodeling of the bone and the&#xD;
      initiation and progression of de novo bone formation, which are represented as a reduction in&#xD;
      primary stability and development of secondary stability, respectively (Ogawa and Nishimura,&#xD;
      2003, Aparicio et al., 2006, Atsumi et al., 2007). Dental implant survival is mainly&#xD;
      dependent on successful osseointegration following placement. Any alteration of this&#xD;
      biological process may adversely affect the success rate. Also, the long-term prognosis is&#xD;
      adversely affected by inadequate bone volume at implant sites. There are several risk factors&#xD;
      that were defined as implant failure. One of the risks of implant's failure depends on the&#xD;
      systemic health of the subject (such as diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, smoking) Recently,&#xD;
      some authors suggested that there is a relationship between hypercholesterolemia and dental&#xD;
      implant osseointegration (Keuroghlian A et al.. 2015, Tirone F et al. 2016). Hyperlipidemia&#xD;
      is a state with an abnormal lipid pro- file, which is characterized by elevated blood&#xD;
      concentrations of triglycerides, elevated levels of total cholesterol and LDL, and decreased&#xD;
      levels of HDL cholesterol ( Saxlin T., 2008) Hyperlipidemia is associated with several&#xD;
      diseases such as atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. The National Health and Nutrition&#xD;
      Examination Survey (NHANES III) reported that 63% of osteoporotic patients have&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia (Bilezikian JP., 2005) The main mechanisms of the relationship between&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia and bone tissue metabolism are the involved aspects of some metabolic changes,&#xD;
      including lower bone mineral density, increase in the number of osteoclasts, and the&#xD;
      inhibition of osteoblastic activity. However, several investigators suggested that lipid-&#xD;
      lowering drugs, such as statins, had beneficial effects on bone metabolism and also favorable&#xD;
      effects on statins observed on osteogenesis around implants (Moriyama Y et al., 2010).&#xD;
      Recently many papers focused on High cholesterol and its impact effect on bone turn over&#xD;
      around dental implant but all of them are animal studies. Mish (2008) defined four bone&#xD;
      density groups (D1 to D4) found in all jaw regions varying according to macroscopic cortical&#xD;
      and trabecular bone types. D1 is dense and homogenous type of bone that is often found in&#xD;
      anterior mandibles. D2 is a combination of dense-to-porous cortical bone on the crest and&#xD;
      coarse trabecular bone on the inside. D3 is composed of thinner porous cortical bone on the&#xD;
      crest and fine trabecule. Mish (2008) defined four bone density groups (D1 to D4) found in&#xD;
      all jaw regions varying according to macroscopic cortical and trabecular bone types. D1 is&#xD;
      dense and homogenous type of bone that is often found in anterior mandibles. D2 is a&#xD;
      combination of dense-to-porous cortical bone on the crest and coarse trabecular bone on the&#xD;
      inside. D3 is composed of thinner porous cortical bone on the crest and fine trabecular bone&#xD;
      within the ridge. The D2 bone trabeculae are 40% to 60% stronger than D3 trabeculae. D4 bone&#xD;
      has very little density and little or no cortical crestal bone. It is the opposite of D1. The&#xD;
      most common locations for D4 type of bone are the posterior region of the maxilla. D4 bone&#xD;
      trabeculae may be up to 10 times weaker than the cortical bone of D1 and the bone-implant&#xD;
      contact after initial loading is often less than 25%. Bone trabeculae are sparse and, as a&#xD;
      result, initial fixation of any implant design presents a surgical challenge (Dvorak G.,&#xD;
      2011) Primary or secondary implant stability usually measured by Periotest or Ostell,&#xD;
      Periotest measuring procedure is electromechanical. An electrically driven and electronically&#xD;
      monitored tapping head percusses the implant 16 times. The entire measuring procedure&#xD;
      requires approx. 4 seconds. The tapping head is pressure sensitive and records the duration&#xD;
      of contact with the test object. Loose implants display a longer contact time and the&#xD;
      Periotest values are correspondingly higher, while osseointegrated implants have a short&#xD;
      contact time and result in low Periotest values. Periotest values (PTV) of (-8 to +50) were&#xD;
      -ve values considered the ideal values that denote successful osseointegration (Molly L.,&#xD;
      2006). Although the ever-increasing number of published animal studies on this topic, there&#xD;
      is however no consensus regarding dental implants stability in patients with hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
