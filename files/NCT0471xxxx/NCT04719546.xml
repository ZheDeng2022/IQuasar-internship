  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With premature newborn increase survival, the risk of serious neonatal morbidity, such as&#xD;
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), also increased. NEC affects between 2 to 7% of premature&#xD;
      infants including 5 to 22% of newborns weighing less than 1000 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEC is an acquired disease, caused by inflammation of the intestinal lining. It is the most&#xD;
      common life-threatening gastrointestinal emergency of prematurity, associated with a&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology and physiopathology are multifactorial, complex, and remain poorly understood.&#xD;
      The mechanism of the lesions seems to involve factors including immaturity of the intestinal&#xD;
      barrier and the immune system, microvascular imbalance, disturbed gut flora and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite improved knowledge about this disease, the proportion of surviving patients has not&#xD;
      improved for several years. It frequently leads to long-term sequelae depending on the&#xD;
      severity of the NEC and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis and early treatment of NEC may reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      The aim of this retrospective bi-centric study is to look for risk factors allowing the&#xD;
      prediction of NEC in order to prevent and improve the early management of this disease.&#xD;
