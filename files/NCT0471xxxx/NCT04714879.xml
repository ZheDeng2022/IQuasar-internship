  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to optimize effects of slow oscillatory transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (so-tDCS) on sleep physiology and memory consolidation in humans by&#xD;
      combining computational and experimental human models in an iterative process. The&#xD;
      investigator therefore works in cooperation with Prof. Dr. Klaus Obermayer (TU Berlin), who&#xD;
      contributes computation models with the aim to mechanistically understand the impact of&#xD;
      different perturbations on sleep-related electrophysiological features, and to subsequently&#xD;
      optimize so-tDCS parameters for inducing SO and spindle activity.&#xD;

      Sleep plays an active role in long-term consolidation of memories. Specifically, slow&#xD;
      oscillations (SO, large amplitude waves &lt;1 Hz) and sleep spindles (8-15 Hz), that can be&#xD;
      measured by electroencephalography (EEG), appear to be critical for declarative memories.&#xD;
      According to the &quot;active system consolidation&quot; account, newly encoded memories are&#xD;
      reactivated during sleep, accompanied by sharp-wave ripple events (80-100 Hz) in the&#xD;
      hippocampus, and redistributed to cortical long-term storage networks through a coordinated&#xD;
      dialog between the hippocampus and neocortex. This dialog is supposedly mediated by a&#xD;
      particular coupling between cortical SO and thalamo-cortical fast spindles (12-15 Hz), with&#xD;
      spindles preferably occurring during SO up-phases, and hippocampal ripples grouped at the&#xD;
      troughs of fast spindles. Slow spindles (8-12 Hz) are a separate kind of sleep spindle&#xD;
      activity whose function in memory consolidation is less well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions targeting sleep parameters may not only make it possible to beneficially&#xD;
      modulate a vital aspect of memory consolidation, i. e., sleep-dependent memory consolidation,&#xD;
      but may also help to delineate which specific elements of the neural dynamics during sleep&#xD;
      are crucial for successful consolidation.&#xD;
