  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication adherence - the extent to which a patient takes their medications as prescribed -&#xD;
      is a global problem. Half of all medicines given to patients with long-term health problems&#xD;
      are not taken properly by the patient. Older adults are also more at risk of harm from their&#xD;
      medications as they tend to take more medicines than young people, and are less able to cope&#xD;
      with their effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been research into how to address these problems. One way has been through&#xD;
      providing patients with a medication compliance aid (MCA), to help with taking their&#xD;
      medications on time. MCAs are pre-packaged boxes containing tablets, grouped together&#xD;
      according to the day and time the medication needs to be taken. Some patients buy the MCA and&#xD;
      fill it themselves, other patients collect a MCA that their pharmacy makes for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is not much proof that pharmacy-filled MCAs help patients, and some research suggests&#xD;
      they may cause harm. The views of patients on MCA use have not yet been fully explored - it&#xD;
      is not clear why some patients choose to stop using an MCA or refuse one when offered. Many&#xD;
      patients with MCAs also have a family member or friend who helps them with their medication.&#xD;
      No research has recognised the role of informal carers in helping patients with MCAs or asked&#xD;
      them their thoughts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to understand what patients, aged 65 and older, and their informal carers&#xD;
      think about MCAs and how they affect their lives. It is a questionnaire study which will take&#xD;
      place within a National Health Service (NHS) hospital. It's designed to take approximately 20&#xD;
      minutes, either face to face or by phone. The investigators hope that the results from this&#xD;
      study will help to inform how healthcare professionals use MCAs to the benefit of patients&#xD;
      and their carers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Definitions Patient is defined as a service user in a hospital/outpatient/community setting,&#xD;
      who may or may not have used an MCA in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informal Carer is a person who, in an unpaid capacity, supports a Patient in some aspect of&#xD;
      their care - for the scope of this study, this must include assistance with medication. They&#xD;
      will also be referred to as a Carer. It must be noted that paid carers are outside the scope&#xD;
      of this study. A paid carer is someone in formal employment in a caring capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant is defined as either a Patient or Informal Carer who consents to be part of the&#xD;
      study, and have their data stored and used for the purposes outlined in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Compliance Aid(s), also referred to as Medication Aid(s) or MCAs, are pre-packaged&#xD;
      boxes containing tablets correctly grouped together according to the day and time the&#xD;
      medication needs to be taken, assembled by a pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants for this study will belong to the following 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients (inpatient or outpatient) aged 65 or over currently using an MCA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients (inpatient or outpatient) aged 65 or over previously offered an MCA but&#xD;
           declined/discontinued&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informal carers (aged 18 or over) of patients (aged 65 or over) using MCAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Informal carers (aged 18 or over) of patients (aged 65 or over) who were previously&#xD;
           offered an MCA but it was declined/discontinued&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants must be able to speak English and have sufficient cognitive function to&#xD;
      provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and informal carers will not be recruited in pairs (i.e patient and their informal&#xD;
      carer). The investigators will be recruiting informal carers of patients that have cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and some of the patients with cognitive impairment will not have sufficient&#xD;
      capacity to partake in the survey themselves. However, their informal carers are an important&#xD;
      and large group of those supporting patients with their medications and therefore need to be&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection for this single-centre study will be taken from participants identified&#xD;
      through various means including outpatient attendees (telephone and face to face), inpatient&#xD;
      wards and community settings e.g. a hospital @home team. The hospital @home team involves a&#xD;
      &quot;community ward&quot;, involving doctors, nurses, pharmacists and therapy teams employed by the&#xD;
      same NHS Foundation Trust, where clinicians assess and treat patients in their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informal carers who assist with medications are identified in these settings as part of&#xD;
      normal clinical practice on hospital admission, clinic or @home review and also in discharge&#xD;
      planning activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also place posters in an outpatient clinic waiting room within the&#xD;
      older persons assessment unit, to advertise the study to patients and informal carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be approached and screened by their clinical care team during the&#xD;
      course of routine clinical activity. A member of the direct clinical team will approach&#xD;
      potential participants, confirm eligibility using a standardised set of screening questions,&#xD;
      describe the study briefly and ask for verbal consent for their name and phone number to be&#xD;
      passed to the research team. Informal carers are commonly identified by clinical teams as&#xD;
      part of routine admission questions when a patient is admitted to hospital, as formal (paid)&#xD;
      care arrangements need to be distinguished from informal arrangements for the purpose of&#xD;
      discharge assessment and onward care at home. Identification of who assists with the&#xD;
      patient's medications is also identified as part of routine care by pharmacy staff. The&#xD;
      investigators will encourage members of the direct clinical care team to ask informal carers&#xD;
      the screening questions during routine care discussions and whether they would be interested&#xD;
      in taking part. If yes, the clinical team member will pass on their contact details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient lacks capacity to give informed consent for inclusion in the study, they will&#xD;
      not be approached for participation. Informal carers of these patients who meet the informal&#xD;
      carer inclusion criteria will still be eligible to be approached and will be contacted by the&#xD;
      clinical team looking after the patient in the first instance to check eligibility and&#xD;
      inquire regarding whether they are interested in taking part. This contact will be during a&#xD;
      routine clinical activity such as obtaining a collateral history from an informal carer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: On approach by researcher, participants will be given a description of the study&#xD;
      verbally (face to face or via phone). All potential participants will be given a copy of the&#xD;
      written participant information sheet prior to completing the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal consent to proceed with the questionnaire will be sought. Optional consent will also&#xD;
      be sought to record a participant's email or postal address to disseminate a lay summary of&#xD;
      results on completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a short questionnaire containing a mix of quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative questions with scope to include free-text comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questions will vary according to whether the participant is a patient or carer, and&#xD;
      whether they are currently using a pharmacy-filled MCA, previously discontinued a&#xD;
      pharmacy-filled MCA or have previously declined a pharmacy-filled MCA. The questions will&#xD;
      explore the followingÍ¾&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients, and the informal carers of patients, who use MCAs&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish patient and informal carer opinions of MCAs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether those who use MCAs would consider switching to taking medicines in&#xD;
           their original packaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients, and the informal carers of patients, who have used an MCA in the past but no&#xD;
      longer do so&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish patient and informal carer opinions of an MCA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore patient and informal carers reasons for stopping an MCA&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore alternative ways in which patients and informal carers organise medications&#xD;
           without the use of an MCA&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients and their informal carers who have been offered an MCA but declined&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore why the MCA was declined&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore alternative ways in which patients and their informal carers organise&#xD;
           medications without the use of an MCA&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore what further support they would like to help them adhere to their medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will administer the questionnaire in all settings including face to face and&#xD;
      phone call. This will broaden participation to those who have difficulty reading and writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Close of interaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be thanked for their time and any further questions will be answered. No&#xD;
      further interactions will occur.&#xD;
