  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PBGM01 is a gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis intended to deliver a functional copy of the&#xD;
      GLB1 gene to the brain and peripheral tissues. This study will assess in a 2-stage design the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of this treatment in patients with early onset infantile&#xD;
      (Type 1) and late onset infantile (Type 2a) GM1 gangliosidosis. Results from the Type 1 and&#xD;
      Type 2a groups will be assessed separately.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PBGM01 is an adeno-associated viral vector serotype Hu68 carrying GLB1, the gene encoding for&#xD;
      human beta-galactosidase, formulated as a solution for injection into the cisterna magna.&#xD;
      This is a global interventional, multicenter, single-arm, dose escalation, adaptive design&#xD;
      study of PBGM01 delivered as a one-time dose administered into the cisterna magna to patients&#xD;
      with infantile GM1 gangliosidosis. There are two infantile subtypes of GM1 gangliosidosis:&#xD;
      early onset infantile (Type 1) and late onset infantile (Type 2a) which are defined by the&#xD;
      age of onset of disease symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Onset Infantile (Type 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset &lt;6 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age at enrollment: &gt;4 to &lt;24 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late Onset Infantile (Type 2a):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset &gt;6 to 18 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age at enrollment: &gt;6 to &lt;36 months of age (except Cohort 1 will be &gt;12 to &lt;36 months of&#xD;
           age)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1 of the study, two dose levels of PBGM01 will be studied separately in patients with&#xD;
      either Type 1 or Type 2a GM1 gangliosidosis (see table below). The cohorts for patients with&#xD;
      Type 1 and Type 2a will be assessed independently from each other. Part 1 will enroll a total&#xD;
      of four cohorts, enrolled sequentially with separate dose-escalation cohorts for Type 1 GM1&#xD;
      and Type 2a GM1. Enrollment will initiate in Cohort 1. Following completion of Cohort 1,&#xD;
      simultaneous enrollment in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 will occur. Cohort 4 will follow completion&#xD;
      of cohort 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will test the safety and efficacy of PBGM01 in confirmatory cohorts for&#xD;
      Types 1 and Type 2a GM1 gangliosidosis with a dose chosen based on the data obtained in part&#xD;
      1 of the study. This will be a 2-year study with a 3-year safety extension.&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Peripheral neuropathy&#xD;

         17. Medical conditions or laboratory or vital sign abnormalities that would increase risk&#xD;
             of complications from intra-cisterna magna injection, anesthesia, fluoroscopy, LP,&#xD;
             and/or MRI including temperature over 38°C, oxygen saturation below 95% on room air or&#xD;
             baseline oxygen requirement, heart rate or respiratory rate abnormal for age of the&#xD;
             subject, abnormal blood pressure for age, or evidence of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any condition (e.g., history of any disease, evidence of any current disease, any&#xD;
             finding upon physical examination, or any laboratory abnormality) that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, would put the subject at undue risk during the administration&#xD;
             procedure or would interfere with evaluation of PBGM01 or interpretation of subject&#xD;
             safety or study results.&#xD;
