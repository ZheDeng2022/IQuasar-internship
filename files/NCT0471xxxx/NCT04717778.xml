      The study was carried out in 21 first grade primary school children, 100% aged 6 years, 52.4%&#xD;
      were female. They were given 5 types of milk, each one was measured on different days (Monday&#xD;
      cow's milk, Tuesday coconut milk, Wednesday almond milk, Thursday soy milk, Friday rice milk)&#xD;

      -  The study was carried out in 21 first grade primary school children, 100% aged 6 years,&#xD;
           52.4% were female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The group was given a brushing technique using a model and 2 videos were shown to&#xD;
           reinforce the brushing technique and explanation of what was going to be done in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supervised tooth brushing was performed in a group of 5 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They were given 5 types of milk, each one was measured on different days (Monday cow's&#xD;
           milk, Tuesday coconut milk, Wednesday almond milk, Thursday soy milk, Friday rice milk).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each child was given 7 plastic cups each day and asked to pour their saliva into the cup&#xD;
           when instructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The samples were taken with pH indicator strips and the result was recorded in&#xD;
           personalized tables.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The average time of pH evaluation for each milk per child was an hour and a half.</time_frame>
    <description>30 minutes after tooth brushing, each child was asked for the first saliva sample (basal pH measurement).&#xD;
After taking the basal pH, each child was given a glass with 50 ml of the milk to be measured.&#xD;
Saliva samples were measured with pH indicator strips and the result was recorded on custom charts.&#xD;
The pH was taken at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 minutes.&#xD;
The normality distribution test (Shapiro-Wilk) was applied to the quantitative variables, with p = 0.0001, so that the data present a non-parametric or free distribution.&#xD;
To assess whether there were differences between the pH of the groups, the Kuskal-Wallis test was applied. For basal pH, p = 0.0001, therefore the null hypothesis is rejected and we conclude that the basal pH level is different in the five milks. Average basal pH:&#xD;
Rice milk 7 Cow milk 6.9 Almond milk 6.6 Soy milk 6.4 Coconut milk 6</description>
