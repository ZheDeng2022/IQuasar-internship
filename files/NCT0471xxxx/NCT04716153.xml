  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proposition of a sensory rehabilitation program that could reduce the olfactory-gustatory&#xD;
      alterations in patients who have been treated with Melphalan for therapeutic intensification&#xD;
      with autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells for multiple myeloma, and also&#xD;
      improve their life quality, psychological well-being, and nutrition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disturbances in taste and smell affect a considerable proportion of patients treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In hematology, dysgeusia depends on the type of graft and the treatments&#xD;
      themselves. It impacts the quality of life, leads to significant emotional and social&#xD;
      consequences, affects the intake, weight and nutritional status of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olfactory-taste disorders can be assessed using subjective and objective tests. There are no&#xD;
      international clinical recommendations for the management of taste and olfactory disturbances&#xD;
      associated with chemotherapy in hematological cancers. Also, this study proposes to evaluate&#xD;
      a taste and olfaction rehabilitation program based on national standards and recent research.&#xD;
      It will help fill gaps in the assessment and management of autografted patients treated with&#xD;
      high-dose Melphalan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis is that this sensory rehabilitation program should make it possible to reduce the&#xD;
      olfactory-gustatory changes in patients who have been treated with Melphalan and&#xD;
      significantly improve their quality of life, their psychological well-being and their&#xD;
      nutrition.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Ramdonized, controlled study with 2 parallel arms (interventional and control). Patients in the interventional arm will follow a multi-factor sensory rehabilitation program focused on smell and taste with daily use (3 times a day) of Liposomal sprays (LipoSaliva® : mouth and LipoNasal® : nose) between V0 and V1.&#xD;
The control group will only receive the usual care provided for as part of routine care. It consists of a nutritional assessment at home by a dietician, with monitoring of intake and weight, in order to readjust nutritional care.</intervention_model_description>

This is a 47-point self-administered questionnaire that measures the quality of life of patients undergoing a bone marrow transplant. The FACT-BMT measures physical, functional, social / family factors, and emotional well-being as well as physician / patient relationship satisfaction and concerns. All items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale based on the week prior to the assessment.</description>

    <description>The psychological distress score objectified by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). This self-questionnaire, validated in French, contains 14 items. It is simple, sensitive and specific. It has been validated in cancer patients, that it is rapid (completion time around 5 minutes), and allows the calculation of 2 sub-scores for anxiety and depression in addition to an overall level. Finally, this tool is sensitive to changes both during the course of medical illnesses and in response to psychopharmacological interventions.</description>

The workshops will take place at the frequency of one session of 2 hours per week and will last for 3 weeks. Each session will accommodate 6 to 10 participants. The program will include 3 workshops on olfactory rehabilitation and taste rehabilitation.&#xD;
Exercises (taking up the themes discussed) will be carried out at home between 2 workshops.</description>
