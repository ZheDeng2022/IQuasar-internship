  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study explores whether Ceramide NanoLiposome (CNL) combined with other conventional&#xD;
      cancer-fighting drugs makes them work better.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research team has shown that C6 ceramide nanoliposome (CNL) has anti-cancer activity in&#xD;
      laboratory models of AML and that when it is combined with other cancer-fighting drugs, it&#xD;
      works better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of CNL given without other cancer&#xD;
      treatments in patients with AML where either their initial treatment didn't work or it&#xD;
      stopped working and your AML came back (refractory or relapsed AML, or RR-AML). This study&#xD;
      seeks to determine the right dose to start with in later studies when CNL is combined with&#xD;
      other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNL is given by intravenous (IV) infusion and will be given twice a week in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment as long as it is considered safe for them to&#xD;
      continue, though their disease status will be checked regularly to make sure that their&#xD;
      disease has not gotten worse. Blood samples will be collected at many time-points in order to&#xD;
      see how their bodies are responding to the drug and how long it stays in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first patients in the study will start at one dose of the drug and, if that is shown to&#xD;
      be safe, the next group will be treated at a slightly higher dose. Participants will be given&#xD;
      CNL by intravenous (IV) infusion twice a week over about 2 hours and then they will be&#xD;
      monitored for about 2 hours to make sure they don't have any bad side effects, but initially&#xD;
      patients will be required to stay at the site for about 6 hours after the start of the&#xD;
      infusion in order to get blood draws to see how long the drug stays active in their system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a bone marrow biopsy before their second &quot;cycle&quot; of drug (after about&#xD;
      1 month) and then again before their third cycle of drug in order to see how their disease is&#xD;
      responding. After that, bone marrow biopsies will be about every other cycle based on what&#xD;
      the study doctor recommends. If the doctor doesn't think that CNL is helping their disease,&#xD;
      of if their doctor decides that it is not safe for them to continue, they will be taken off&#xD;
      study treatment. Participants will be followed for safety and disease status for up to 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Active infection with Hepatitis B virus (HbSAg positive or PCR with detectable viral&#xD;
             load) or Hepatitis C virus (viral load detectable by PCR).&#xD;
