  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is among the most common types of cancer in the world. Factors such as age,&#xD;
      reproduction, nutrition, hormonal, and lifestyle factors also play a role in the etiology of&#xD;
      breast cancer. Nutrition can affect cancer metabolism at stages such as carcinogen&#xD;
      metabolism, cell, and host defense, cell differentiation, and tumor growth. When&#xD;
      investigating nutrition and breast cancer risk, it is important to evaluate the preparation&#xD;
      and cooking processes applied to foods. Advanced glycation end products (AGE) are formed as a&#xD;
      result of heat treatment applied to foods. There are studies showing that AGEs increase&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative stress in the organism. It is aimed to compare the dietary AGE&#xD;
      intake and serum levels of AGE participants with breast cancer and healthy participants and&#xD;
      to examine the relationship with serum inflammatory, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and total&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity. Patients with breast cancer will be evaluated before surgery, before&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and in the sixth and twelfth months after starting chemotherapy. The amount the&#xD;
      dietary AGE intake, serum markers, nutritional status, and changes in quality of life will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;

      The Location of the Research: The research is carried out in Konya Necmettin Erbakan&#xD;
      University Meram Faculty of Medicine General Surgery, Medical Oncology, and Biochemistry&#xD;
      Departments. After obtaining the permission of the ethics committee, official permission was&#xD;
      obtained from Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical Faculty Hospital Chief Physician to&#xD;
      conduct the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sample Size of the Study: It was calculated by in G * Power 3.1.9.2 the computer program.&#xD;
      It was determined by taking into account the mean and standard deviation of the blood&#xD;
      advanced glycation end products level variable of previous (3.3 ± 1.2 × 105 arbitrary units&#xD;
      (AU) in breast cancer patients, 2.3 ± 0.7 × 105 AU in healthy individuals). Considering that&#xD;
      the number of samples in the control and breast cancer groups would be equal, it was&#xD;
      determined that both groups should consist of at least 27 individuals with an error margin of&#xD;
      d = 1.02, α = 0.05, and a power of 0.95. Considering that there will be losses in the sample,&#xD;
      at least 32 individuals will be included in both groups. In this study, all of the patients&#xD;
      participating in the research are informed in detail and informed consent forms are obtained&#xD;
      from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The data will be assessed using the SPSS 22 statistical software&#xD;
      package. Mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of the quantitative data will&#xD;
      be calculated, and the number and percentage tables of the qualitative data will be created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the comparison of quantitative data of the case group (before surgery) and control group,&#xD;
      the Student t-test will be used for the normal distribution, and the Mann-Whitney U test will&#xD;
      be used for the non-normal distribution. The chi-squared test will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      qualitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the comparison of quantitative data of the case group during follow-up (before surgery,&#xD;
      before chemotherapy, and in the sixth and twelfth months after starting chemotherapy) one-way&#xD;
      ANOVA will be used for the normal distribution, and the Friedman test will be used for the&#xD;
      non-normal distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While determining the correlation between quantitative data, the Pearson correlation&#xD;
      coefficient will be used for normal distribution and the Spearman correlation coefficient&#xD;
      will be used for non-normal distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant at the end of the analysis.&#xD;

    <description>The quality of life of women with breast cancer is evaluated with the European Cancer Research and Treatment Organization Quality of Life Scale - Cancer 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). It consists of 30 items to assess physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning, global health status or qualitiy of life scales, fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties. Items are measured using a 4-point Likert Scale ranging from Not at all (1) to Very much (4). The lowest score obtained from the scale is 0, the highest score is 100. Higher scores represent higher general health and functional scores and higher scores indicate higher symptom severity.</description>

Items measured using 4-point Likert Scale ranging from Not at all (1) to Very much (4). The lowest score obtained from the scale is 0, the highest score is 100. Higher scores represent higher functional scores and higher scores indicate higher symptom severity.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey questionnaire is used to determine the quality of life levels of healthy women.The questionnaire consists of eight scales yielding two summary measures: physical and mental health. The physical health measure includes four scales of physical functioning (10 items), role-physical (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), and general health (5 items). The mental health measure is composed of vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role-emotional (3 items), and mental health (5 items). A final item, termed self-reported health transition, is answered by the client but is not included in the scoring process. The SF-36 offers a choice of recall format at a standard (4 week) or acute (1 week) time frame. Likert scales and yes/no options are used to assess function and well-being on this 36-item questionnaire. Obtained score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>
