      In this open-label phase II study, patients will be scheduled for neoadjuvant treatment with&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibitors (Camrelizumab) plus VEGF inhibitor (Apatinib) for dMMR/MSI-H colorectal&#xD;
      cancer staged as locally advanced (cT3-4N+/-M0 for rectal cancer, cT4 or cT3 with extramural&#xD;
      extension ≥5mm for colon cancer). Radiological evaluation will be preformed after 4 cycles of&#xD;
      treatment. Patients with rectal cancer who achieve complete clinical response will be offered&#xD;
      the choice of Watch &amp; Wait.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study, with the aim of determining the efficacy of PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitors (Camrelizumab) plus VEGF inhibitor (Apatinib) as a neoadjuvant therapy for&#xD;
      dMMR/MSI-H locally advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for eligibility within 14 days prior to study initiation with CT&#xD;
      (for colon cancer) and/or MRI (for rectal cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given four cycles of Camrelizumab (200mg iv every 3 weeks) plus Apatinib&#xD;
      (250mg QD day1-14) before being evaluated for response. For patients with colon cancer, if a&#xD;
      SD/PD is achieved and the tumor is deemed unresectable, they will be offered&#xD;
      chemotherapy±radiotherapy; for patients with rectal cancer who have a SD/PD,&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy will be offered.&#xD;
