  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of onapristone and anastrozole in treating patients&#xD;
      with hormone receptor positive endometrial cancer that has not responded to previous&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). Progesterone and estrogen are hormones that can cause the growth of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer cells. Onapristone blocks the use of progesterone by the tumor cells.&#xD;
      Anastrozole is a drug that blocks the production of estrogen in the body. Giving onapristone&#xD;
      with anastrozole may work better than anastrozole alone in treating patients with hormone&#xD;
      receptor positive endometrial cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States with an&#xD;
      incidence that continues to increase each year. More than 60,000 women were diagnosed with&#xD;
      endometrial cancer in 2018 and this disease contributes to more than 10,000 deaths annually.&#xD;
      Unopposed estrogen production and obesity are the most common risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of endometrial cancer; both late stage disease and histologic subtype portends to&#xD;
      a poor prognosis with a five-year survival of only 20%. In the second line setting, cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy has a 13% response rate and hormonal therapy with anastrozole has a response&#xD;
      rate of 9%. For a minority of patients with MSI-high endometrial cancer (about 30% of&#xD;
      patients), pembrolizumab is a therapeutic option and results in an overall response rate of&#xD;
      39% in 149 patients across 15 tumor types with 78% of responses lasting greater than 6 months&#xD;
      and has led to FDA approval of this single agent in tissue agnostic cases. Megesterol acetate&#xD;
      is approved in the second line setting with response rates as high as 24% in conjunction with&#xD;
      tamoxifen, but is not commonly used due to poor tolerance and high risk of thrombosis. The&#xD;
      majority of patients with recurrent endometrial cancer have limited therapeutic options and&#xD;
      the development of second line therapies that result in improved response is an unmet&#xD;
      clinical need. Using targeted hormonal treatment may present potential opportunities for&#xD;
      improved treatment outcomes for these women.&#xD;
