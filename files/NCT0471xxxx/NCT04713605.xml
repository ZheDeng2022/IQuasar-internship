  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: During cardiac surgery, neonates are at high risk of cerebral damage: 36-78% will&#xD;
      have new cerebral lesions after surgery. Adequate cerebral perfusion (CBF) is mandatory to&#xD;
      prevent postoperative brain damage and neurobehavioral outcomes. For CBF, the systemic blood&#xD;
      pressure should be managed above the brain's critical closing pressure (CrCP), and preferably&#xD;
      above the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA), if intact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: We aim to study the patient specific threshold for arterial blood pressure to&#xD;
      maintain adequate cerebral perfusion (CBFV) in the perioperative setting and the association&#xD;
      between perioperative abnormalities with postoperative brain damage and neurobehavioral&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: In a prospective observational cohort study bilateral cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      velocity (CBFV) measurements are performed with transcranial doppler (TCD), together with&#xD;
      invasive arterial blood pressure (iABP) measurements in the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Neonates (semi-) electively scheduled for major cardiac- surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Main study endpoint is the Critical Closing Pressure (CrCP)&#xD;
      within and between subjects. Furthermore, we evaluate the association with new white matter&#xD;
      injury (WMI) on the postoperative MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Anticipated risks caused by TCD monitoring in neonates are considered negligible&#xD;
      when monitoring is executed according to the BMUS guidelines and ALARA principle. Each time&#xD;
      energy is converted from one form to another, part of it is inevitably converted to heat.&#xD;
      Theoretically, if at all, the maximum temperature rise will happen at the skin- temporal bone&#xD;
      side, where the monitoring probes are placed. A maximal thermal index (TI) of 0.7 is allowed,&#xD;
      this corresponds with 0.7 o C temperature rise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients might not benefit from participation in this study as the TCD measurements are only&#xD;
      visible and available to the TCD operator, and we do not yet know how the results could&#xD;
      possibly influence the procedure. However, in the unlikely situation where cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      is severely compromised for a longer period of time or in case of occurrence of large air&#xD;
      emboli, improper cannulation or cross clamping the cardiac team will be notified. Therefore,&#xD;
      a neonate may benefit from participation.&#xD;

    <description>Detection of the critical closing pressure (CrCP) of the brain, the arterial blood pressure at which brain vessels collapse and cerebral blood flow ceases, in a cohort of neonates who need major cardiac surgery. We hypothesize that neonates have a unique CrCP and cerebral ischemia occurs during episodes with critically endangered blood supply to the brain, when the arterial blood pressure (iABP) is below CrCP.</description>
