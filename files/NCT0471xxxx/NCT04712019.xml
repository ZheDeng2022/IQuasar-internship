             infection at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is a chronic opioid user, defined per the CDC guidelines as opioid use for &gt;3 months,&#xD;
             at the time of enrollment.&#xD;

          -  has a current diagnosis of lymphedema in either leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has signs, symptoms, or a current diagnosis of venous insufficiency in either leg, as&#xD;
             determined by the investigator's review of the subject's medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a history of clotting disorder or prior history of deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  will undergo a unilateral TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  will undergo a staged, bilateral TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has had previous knee replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has received a corticosteroid injection into either knee within 30 days of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  undergoes a simultaneous, bilateral TKA with a planned different incision type on each&#xD;
             knee (eg, midline incision vs. medial parapatellar incision).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has known sensitivity to the study product components (drape and/or dressing materials&#xD;
             in direct contact with the closed incision or skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has known sensitivity to silver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is enrolled in another interventional clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has skin cancer localized at or in proximity to the incision site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  does not have access to an electronic device (smartphone, iPad, or computer) on a&#xD;
             daily basis to complete online assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has condition(s) that, in the opinion of the investigator, cause the subject to be an&#xD;
             overall health risk that is unsuitable for the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has condition(s) that, in the opinion of the investigator, will impact study endpoints&#xD;
             (eg, hemophilia or autoimmune disorders) or the ability to comply with study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intra-Op Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  does not receive a &quot;total&quot; knee replacement for first knee. For example, a partial or&#xD;
             uni-compartmental knee replacement is performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a surgical incision that would preclude placement of either dressing onto the knee&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a TKA resulting in a muscle flap&#xD;
