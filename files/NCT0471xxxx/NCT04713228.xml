  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to understand the changes in the heart and the cardiovascular system&#xD;
      that may occur in women who develop high blood pressure during pregnancy.&#xD;

      Upon Enrollment in this study, participants will go through two scans along with some blood&#xD;
      test and other assessments. The first scan is a sonogram of the heart called an&#xD;
      echocardiogram, and another scan is done using the investigational ARTSENS device that will&#xD;
      be used to measure stiffness of the walls in the arterial blood vessel for indications of&#xD;
      inflammation damage. ARTSENS device is not approved for use in the United States. It is&#xD;
      expected that we will enroll 50 people in this study. The entire study is expected to last 2&#xD;
      years. Participation will be for approximately 9 months.&#xD;

    <description>There will be an initial 'Pregnancy' visit within 7-10 days of the screening visit, when the subject will undergo an echocardiogram, have the vascular compliance measurements and will have blood drawn for measurement of serum biomarkers. The second study visit will be the '6-8 weeks post-partum' visit when the echocardiogram and vascular compliance will be re-measured, along with assessment of vitals and medication history. The third study visit will be 6-7 months post partum where there is a collection of a clinical questionnaire, demographics, vitals, chart review, echocardiogram and vascular compliance will be re-measured.</description>
