      Postoperative recovery is an important part of the patient's experience. A good recovery&#xD;
      period is an important guarantee for the recovery of postoperative organs and functions after&#xD;
      surgery. However, the delay in awakening after general anesthesia remains one of the biggest&#xD;
      challenges facing anesthesiologists. The time of resuscitation depends on patient factors,&#xD;
      effects of anesthetic factors, duration of surgery, and painful stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delay of recovery after anesthesia was mainly caused by the use of anesthetic drugs&#xD;
      during the perioperative period. The drugs commonly used during the perioperative period are&#xD;
      opioid analgesics, sedatives and muscle relaxants. Studies have shown that intravenous&#xD;
      opioids are more difficult to control than neuromuscular relaxants. Opioids can extend the&#xD;
      recovery time after anesthesia by direct sedation of opioid receptors. It also reduces the&#xD;
      sensitivity of brainstem chemoreceptors to carbon dioxide, leading to dose-dependent&#xD;
      respiratory depression and hypercapnia, which affects the removal of volatile substances and&#xD;
      carbon dioxide, and ultimately leads to coma. In addition, the active metabolites of some&#xD;
      opioids can prolong the duration of action, especially in the case of impaired renal&#xD;
      function, which can lead to delayed awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an opioid antagonist, nalmefene can inhibit or reverse the respiratory inhibition,&#xD;
      sedation and hypotension effects of opioid drugs. Moreover, it has no opioid excitatory&#xD;
      activity, does not produce respiratory inhibition, hallucinogenic effect or pupil dilation.&#xD;
      In terms of inducing wakefulness during anesthesia, nalmefene can effectively reverse the&#xD;
      sedative effect caused by opioids. There have been reports at home and abroad that nalmefene&#xD;
      can be used to improve the effect of post-anesthesia resuscitation and reduce agitation&#xD;
      during the waking period, but there is still a lack of large sample and well-designed&#xD;
      randomized controlled studies to provide important data on how to improve the quality of&#xD;
      anesthetized resuscitation. This study will conduct a rigorous randomized controlled&#xD;
      studies,with large sample, and the research indicators for patients from the PACU roll-out to&#xD;
      ordinary ward, using Aldrete score , in order to obtain a series of data of nalmefene used&#xD;
      for anesthesia recovery , and to set the foundation of related research of nalmefene and&#xD;
      similar drugs in clinical application in the future.&#xD;

      Postoperative recovery is an important part of the patient's experience, regardless of the&#xD;
      type of surgery. The recovery and prognosis of postoperative anesthesia have gradually become&#xD;
      important indicators for judging the efficacy and quality of anesthesia. The recovery period&#xD;
      of general anesthesia is an important transition period from anesthesia to wakefulness, and a&#xD;
      good recovery period is an important guarantee for the recovery of postoperative organs and&#xD;
      functions after surgery. However, the delay in awakening after general anesthesia remains one&#xD;
      of the biggest challenges facing anesthesiologists. Postoperative resuscitation is the result&#xD;
      of the removal of anesthetics from the brain. The time of resuscitation depends on patient&#xD;
      factors, effects of anesthetic factors, duration of surgery, and painful stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delay of recovery after anesthesia was mainly caused by the use of anesthetic drugs&#xD;
      during the perioperative period. The drugs commonly used during the perioperative period are&#xD;
      opioid analgesics, sedatives and muscle relaxants. Studies have shown that intravenous&#xD;
      opioids are more difficult to control than neuromuscular relaxants. Opioids can extend the&#xD;
      recovery time after anesthesia by direct sedation of opioid receptors. It also reduces the&#xD;
      sensitivity of brainstem chemoreceptors to carbon dioxide, leading to dose-dependent&#xD;
      respiratory depression and hypercapnia, which affects the removal of volatile substances and&#xD;

      opioids can prolong the duration of action, especially in the case of impaired renal&#xD;
      function, which can lead to delayed awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an opioid antagonist, nalmefene can inhibit or reverse the respiratory inhibition,&#xD;
      sedation and hypotension effects of opioid drugs. Moreover, it has no opioid excitatory&#xD;
      activity, does not produce respiratory inhibition, hallucinogenic effect or pupil dilation.&#xD;
      No pharmacological effects were observed without the administration of opioid agonists. In&#xD;
      terms of inducing wakefulness during anesthesia, nalmefene can effectively reverse the&#xD;
      sedative effect caused by opioids. There have been reports at home and abroad that nalmefene&#xD;
      can be used to improve the effect of post-anesthesia resuscitation and reduce agitation&#xD;
      during the waking period, but there is still a lack of large sample and well-designed&#xD;
      randomized controlled studies to provide important data on how to improve the quality of&#xD;
      anesthetized resuscitation. In order to speed up the awakening after anesthesia, promote the&#xD;
      patients' consciousness and respiratory recovery, and improve the quality of awakening&#xD;
      patients after anesthesia, the patients should control postoperative pain immediatly, improve&#xD;
      the comfort of patients in the PACU, reduce the residence time of patients, speed up the&#xD;
      circulation of operated patients, reduce the costs of PACU, and reduce the staff workload in&#xD;
      the PACU. This study will conduct a rigorous randomized controlled studies, large sample, and&#xD;
      the research indicators for patients from the PACU roll-out to ordinary ward, using Aldrete&#xD;
      score , in order to obtain a series of data of nalmefene used for anesthesia recovery , and&#xD;
      to lay the foundation of related research of nalmefene and similar drugs in clinical&#xD;
      application in the future.&#xD;
