      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the #LIFEGOALS intervention for&#xD;
      promoting mental health in early adolescents.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the MOV-E-STAR project is to promote mental health in early adolescents (12-15&#xD;
      years) by motivating them to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Adolescents can protect their mental&#xD;
      health by increasing physical activity, reducing sitting time, getting sufficient sleep, and&#xD;
      taking a daily breakfast. Targeting these healthy lifestyle behaviours in young adolescents&#xD;
      is an empowering, low-threshold approach that can create large public health effects. The&#xD;
      MOV-E-STAR project aims to meet the need for an intervention targeting these behaviors in the&#xD;
      adolescent population. Therefore, the mobile intervention '#LIFEGOALS' was developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with stakeholders and users. The theory-based intervention consists of an&#xD;
      application that includes (a) a self-regulation component for goal setting, self-monitoring&#xD;
      and feedback, (b) a narrative in the form of short episodes from a youth daily drama for&#xD;
      modelling, attitude change and increased engagement, and (c) an automated chat-function for&#xD;
      social support and sustained engagement with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will test the intervention in a group-randomized controlled trial for its&#xD;
      effects on mental well-being. Participants in the intervention group will have the #LIFEGOALS&#xD;
      intervention installed on their phone and will be asked to use the intervention for 12&#xD;
      consecutive weeks. Participants in the control group will not receive an intervention but&#xD;
      will only participate in the measurements. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      intermittent (7 weeks after baseline) and post (13 weeks after baseline). Measures will&#xD;
      include smart wearables and surveys.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Global Well-being from Baseline to Post-measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Post-measurement (Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>An overall measure of well-being and health-related quality of life will be assessed with the KIDSCREEN-10 (Erhart et al. 2009). This is a valid unidimensional global health-related quality of life index (Ravens-Sieberer et al. 2010). The KIDSCREEN-10 consists of 10 items exploring the level of the adolescent's physical activity, energy and fitness, depressive moods and stressful feelings, opportunities to structure and enjoy social and leisure time and participation in social activities, quality of interaction with parent and feelings toward parents, nature of the relation with other adolescents, and cognitive capacity and satisfaction with school performance. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Sum scores range between 10 and 50, and a higher sum score indicates better health-related quality of life. This measure of global well-being is the primary outcome measure of this study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sleep Quality from Baseline to Post-measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Post-measurement (Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep Quality: Average sleep quality over the past week Self-reported sleep quality will be measured in the online questionnaire via four items assessing subjective experience of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep interruption, and daytime sleepiness. The items are based on items from 2017/18 survey of the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) study (Inchley, Currie, Cosma, &amp; Samdal, 2018) and from the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS; Essner et al., 2015), and are scored on a 5 point Likert scale (totally disagree - totally agree). A sum-score will be calculated (ranging from 4 to 20) with higher scores indicating better perceived sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Frequency of Taking Breakfast (BF) from Baseline to Post-measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Post-measurement (Week 14)</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Social Support and Peers from Baseline to Post-measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Post-measurement (Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>The subscale Social support &amp; Peers from the KIDSCREEN-27 will be used to assess the quality of interaction with friends and peers, as well as the perceived support. This subscale consists of 4 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale. A higher sum score (ranging from 4 to 20) indicate feeling more accepted and supported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Resilience from Baseline to Post-measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Post-measurement (Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Resilience will be measured by the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) (Smith, Dalen, Wiggins, Tooley, Christopher, &amp; Bernard, 2008). The BRS consists of 6 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale, assessing the capacity to bounce back after hard times. A higher sum score (ranging from 6 to 30) indicates greater resilience. We added a timeframe and adapted the wording of the Dutch version of the BRS (Soer et al., 2018) to make the items adequate for young adolescents. This was discussed in team, and the adapted questionnaire was tested on comprehensibility with 4 adolescents. The Dutch version of the BRS has shown sufficient reliability (α = .78) and construct validity in healthy workers (Soer et al., 2018).</description>
