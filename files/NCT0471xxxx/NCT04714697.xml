    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 2, multicenter, interventional for cohort 1 &amp; 2, non-interventional for&#xD;
      cohort 3, open-label trial of cabozantinib, with ORR as the primary efficacy endpoint. In&#xD;
      total, 201 eligible subjects will enroll from 5 sites in Korea. The intervention for this&#xD;
      cohort 1&amp;2 is only IMP, Cabometyx provided by Ipsen (off-label). Also, cohort 3 is just RWD&#xD;
      without IMP (on-label)&#xD;

      Cohort 1 (post nivolumab and ipilimumab combination): the subject who failed one prior line&#xD;
      by nivolumab and ipilimumab Cohort 2 (post pembrolizumab plus axitinib, pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      lenvatinib, or avelumab and axitinib): the subject who failed one prior line by PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibitors in combination with VEGF TKI Cohort 3 (post sequential immunotherapy after VEGFR&#xD;
      TKI): the subject who failed the second line by immunotherapy (PD-1 antibody or PD-L1&#xD;
      antibody) following the first line VEGFR TKI Subjects will receive study treatment as long as&#xD;
      they continue to experience a clinical benefit in the investigator's opinion or until there&#xD;
      is unacceptable toxicity or the need for subsequent systemic anticancer therapy. Treatment&#xD;
      may continue after radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 as long as the investigator&#xD;
      believes that the subject is still receiving clinical benefit from study treatment and that&#xD;
      the potential benefit of continuing study treatment outweighs potential risks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Recovery to baseline or/and under Grade 1 CTCAE v.5.0 from toxicities related to any&#xD;
             prior treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on&#xD;
             supportive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age eighteen years or older on the day of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of or/and over 70%.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and must have&#xD;
             signed the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Sexually active fertile subjects and their partners must agree to use medically&#xD;
