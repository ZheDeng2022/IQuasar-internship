  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial intends to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intense pulsed light (IPL)&#xD;
      in the treatment of facial telangiectasia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      (SLE).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can involve multiple&#xD;
      organs and systems. The treatment for SLE mainly depends on long-term use of glucocorticoids.&#xD;
      For many patients with SLE, facial telangiectasia is a commonly seen side effect of long-term&#xD;
      use of glucocorticoids. Featured by facial erythema with or without flushing or burning&#xD;
      sensation, facial telangiectasia seriously affects the quality of life of patients. However,&#xD;
      up to now, there has been little attention paid to this condition in SLE patients. There have&#xD;
      been a lack of effective treatment options for tackling this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intense pulsed light (IPL) is a non-laser light source used to treat a variety of vascular&#xD;
      and pigmented lesions. Unlike ultraviolet that is harmful to patients with SLE, application&#xD;
      of IPL may be a safe and effective treatment for SLE patients with facial telangiectasia.&#xD;
      This study intends to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPL in the treatment of facial&#xD;
      telangiectasia for SLE patients that has been treated with long-term corticosteroids.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of Five-Point Telangiectasia Scale after three times of IPL treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Five-Point Telangiectasia Scale will be used to assess improvement of telangiectasia and erythema. The range of TGS is 1 to 5, where 1 means less than 5% clearance, 2 means 5-25% clearance, 3 means 25-50% clearance, 4 means 50-75% clearance, and 5 means 75-100% clearance, compared to baseline before IPL treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change of Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA) scores after a 4-, 8-, 12- and 24-week treatment, respectively.</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA) scores describe the severity of facial erythema, ranging from 0-4. In CEA scoring system, 0=clear, and 4=severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Patient Global Assessment (PGA) after a 4-, 8-, 12- and 24-week treatment, respectively.</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PGA refers to the subject's global assessment of the facial telangiectasia condition. Change of PGA from baseline to post-treatment will be determined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores after a 4-, 8-, 12-, and 24-week of treatment, respectively.</measure>

    <measure>Change of SLEDAI scores after 12 and 24 weeks, respectively</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SLEDAI reflects the disease activity of SLE. A dramatic increase of SLEDAI during the IPL treatment or immediately after IPL treatment will be considered as an adverse event.</description>

Starting from Week 12 (the time point of the primary endpoint), the control side of face will also be treated by IPL if the IPL-treated side shows satisfactory improvement of erythema or telangiectasia by IPL treatment.
