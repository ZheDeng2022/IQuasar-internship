  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn more about the brain activity underlying Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease nonmotor symptoms. The investigators will utilize neural recordings from&#xD;
      corticostriatal structures performed during deep brain stimulation surgery to measure neural&#xD;
      activity underlying nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to end of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), approximately 3-4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The neurocognitive task will involve seeing stimuli presented on a computer screen and pressing a button to respond. We will use different tasks in different patients to measure working memory and response inhibition. Neurocognitive task performance will be compared between stimulated and non stimulated trials in a within subjects fashion</description>

    <description>For a subset of study participants, neural stimulation will be performed during deep brain stimulation cases performed as routine clinical care for movement disorders. Stimulation will be performed both at rest and during neurocognitive tasks. Subjects will additionally be asked to complete two questionnaires, the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)</description>

    <intervention_name>Observational Microelectrode and Local Field Potential (LFP) Recordings</intervention_name>
    <description>All study participants, both Parkinson's and non-Parkinson's movement disorder patients, will receive microelectrode and local field potential (LFP) recordings obtained during rest and during a neurocognitive task, which tests working memory and/or response inhibition.&#xD;
Microelectrode recordings will use the clinical microelectrodes to guide clinical electrode placement to record from structures along the planned electrode trajectory. Cortical LFP recording will be an optional portion of the study that will use a 4-8 contact strip electrode to record from the surface of the brain exposed by the burr hole created to allow introduction of clinical electrodes. Once recording electrodes are in place, we will perform resting state recordings for 3-5 minutes with the subject resting quietly with their eyes open. Following this, the subject will participate in a neurocognitive task while we continue to record from the electrodes.</description>
