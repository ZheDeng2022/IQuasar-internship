  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is defined as systemic response to infection ,and it is a main problem in ICU and&#xD;
      despite advance in supportive care, the mortality rate in patients with severe sepsis&#xD;
      continues to exceed 30% [Bone RC 1993].The effects of bacterial invasion of body tissues&#xD;
      result from combined actions of enzymes and toxins produced by micro-organisms themselves and&#xD;
      by a network of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines as tumour necrosis factor α and&#xD;
      interleukin 6 which are overexpressed after various noxious insults[P.Delong et al. 2006],[&#xD;
      Yealy et al. 2014].&#xD;
&#xD;
      the patients who are subjected to abdominal surgery in order to treat the cause&#xD;
      surgically,and many of these surgical procedures are lengthy and are at risk for either&#xD;
      pre-operatively or post-operatively with steady increase in intra-abdominal pressure(IAP)&#xD;
      [Malbrain ML et al. 2007] Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is defined as IAP equal to or&#xD;
      greater than 12 mmHg whereas abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as IAP greater&#xD;
      than 20 mmHg, abdominal perfusing pressure (APP) is used to predict prognosis of both IAH and&#xD;
      ACS [Malbrain ML et al. 2006].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice for using a sedative agent in ICU for mechanically ventilated patients&#xD;
      post-operatively is therefore a crucial one as these patients are under hyperstress state and&#xD;
      often require drugs for sedation and analgesia[ Chanques G et al. 2006].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesics and sedation agents have clearly been shown to alter cellular function and other&#xD;
      mediators of immune system with wide range of immune modulation ,ranging from&#xD;
      immunosuppressive effects to significant anti-inflammatory effects during endotoxaemia[&#xD;
      Taniguchi et al. 2004] Also sedation and /or analgesia have the potential to reduce IAP&#xD;
      through improvement of abdominal wall compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although propofol and dexmedetomidine are used for sedation in ICU there are limited data on&#xD;
      their effects on inflammatory responses and IAP in septic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, septic patients treated with dexmedetomidine have shorter time on the&#xD;
      ventilator as compared with those treated with lorazepam, a benzodiazepine and this&#xD;
      beneficial effect of dexmedetomidine is more pronounced in septic patients than in nonseptic&#xD;
      patients. This outcome may be partly the result of dexmedetomidine induced reduction in&#xD;
      pulmonary inflammatory mediators and lung tissue damage.[ M. Ueki et al. 2014] Midazolam is&#xD;
      known to inhibit certain aspects of the immune function. It was suggested that&#xD;
      benzodiazepines bind to specific receptors on macrophages and inhibit their capacity to&#xD;
      produce IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol, nowadays, has become a preferred sedative in ICU because it offers advantages over&#xD;
      benzodiazepines in terms of lack of accumulation, quick onset, easy adjustment, and fast&#xD;
      recovery after discontinuation. [ Jacobi J et al. 2002]&#xD;

      After surgery patients will be transferred to the ICU and will be randomly allocated by use&#xD;
      of sealed envelopes ;into one of three groups 20 patients each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ICU measurements will be recorded by an observer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' demographic and clinical data including age, sex, weight ,operative procedure&#xD;
           time and type and patient's SOFA score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), and temperature&#xD;
           will be continuously monitored . Urine output will be measured hourly and fluid balance&#xD;
           will be calculated every 12 hours. All measurements will be obtained at the start of the&#xD;
           study (baseline), then at the 24th and 48th hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lactate, platelets, leukocytes, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine will&#xD;
           be determined at the same times TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels will be obtained at&#xD;
           baseline, and at the 24th and 48 th hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraabdominal pressure and abdominal perfusion pressure will be measured at baseline&#xD;
           (15 min before start of the study) and at the 24th and 48th hours per the study&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral pain scale, ramsay sedation score and post operative analgesics requirements&#xD;
           as a rescue analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay.&#xD;
