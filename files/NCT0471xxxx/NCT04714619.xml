    <textblock>
      This is a ulticenter, single arm, open-label, Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of CB-103 in combination with a non-steroidal&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor (NSAI), anastrozole or letrozole, in Hormone Receptor-positive and Human&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer patients who have&#xD;
      achieved clinical benefit during prior NSAI-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients include pre- and post-menopausal women age ≥ 18 years with HR-positive and&#xD;
      HER2-negative unresectable advanced breast cancer (ABC, including metastatic), having&#xD;
      achieved at least clinical benefit upon treatment with prior NSAI. Evidence of measurable or&#xD;
      evaluable disease, as per RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) v.1.1, with a&#xD;
      tumor lesion amenable to biopsy. Pre-menopausal women must be under treatment with&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues. Patients are not eligible if they are&#xD;
      candidates for a local treatment with a curative intention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy, defined as progression-free survival (PFS),&#xD;
      of CB-103 in combination with NSAI therapy (anastrozole or letrozole) in women with&#xD;
      HR-positive, HER2-negative, unresectable ABC with evidence of Notch signaling pathway&#xD;
      activation and with progressive disease after clinical benefit while on prior NSAI-containing&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approx 80 patients are expected to be recruited&#xD;
