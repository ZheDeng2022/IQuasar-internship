  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe childhood adversity accounts for a large portion of psychiatric illness, and an&#xD;
      increased risk for major depressive disorder (MDD). For some individuals, childhood adversity&#xD;
      has negative psychological and medical consequences; others preserve mental and physical&#xD;
      health despite such experiences (they are resilient). In spite of this, little is known about&#xD;
      the neurobiological mechanisms related to childhood adversity, especially oxidative stress&#xD;
      abnormalities in the brain. To fill this gap, this study combines functional, structural, and&#xD;
      molecular imaging approaches to examine the role of oxidative stress abnormalities related to&#xD;
      childhood adversity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have shown that severe childhood adversity explains 32-44% of&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders, and is associated with 4.6-fold risk for MDD later in life. In spite&#xD;
      of these epidemiological data, the neurobiological underpinnings associated with maladaptive&#xD;
      sequelae of severe childhood adversity as well as resilience remain largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical research suggests that early adversity leads to (1) structural abnormalities in&#xD;
      brain regions critically implicated in stress regulation; (2) increased oxidative stress; and&#xD;
      (3) glutamatergic abnormalities. The current research protocol is designed to prospectively&#xD;
      test the contributions of these abnormalities in individuals exposed to severe childhood&#xD;
      adversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving our understanding of neurobiological mechanisms associated with different childhood&#xD;
      adversity outcomes is of paramount importance in order to (1) identify individuals at risk&#xD;
      for psychopathology and maladaptive behavior, (2) prevent re-victimization, and (3) develop&#xD;
      more targeted therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
