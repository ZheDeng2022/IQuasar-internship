      The study will be a phase 2, open-label study in patients with solid tumours to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between short-chain fatty acid uptake using [18F]FPIA PET/CT and tumour&#xD;
      proliferation&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancers have increased energy demands to allow for their rapid growth compared to healthy&#xD;
      cells. Glucose is the main source of energy for many cells in the body, and clinicians&#xD;
      routinely use a scan which looks at glucose metabolism to assess if cancer treatment is&#xD;
      working. However, some cancer cells can create energy to survive and grow in a different way,&#xD;
      using fatty acids. In this study, the investigators are using a PET/CT scan to look at a&#xD;
      variety of cancer types to see which cancers use fatty acids for energy and if this can be&#xD;
      measured. The PET/CT scan will be carried out twice on 2 separate visits so that the&#xD;
      investigators can check that both scans give the same result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also carry out special tests on the tumour tissue taken during routine&#xD;
      cancer surgery. These tests will look for specific substances in the cancer cells that are&#xD;
      related to cancer biology and growth. The investigators will then compare the results from&#xD;
      the surgical tissue to the results of the scan to see if there is a relationship between&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will look at 21 patients with solid tumours conducted in 4 NCITA accredited&#xD;
      centres, which have different strengths in recruiting specific patient/tumour-type cohorts.&#xD;
      Each patient will have two scan visits (between 2-15 days apart) prior to any new treatment&#xD;
      starting to check that the scan measurements are repeatable.&#xD;
