  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-blind, parallel-group, randomised trial will be conducted in Sao Paulo, Brazil.&#xD;
      People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) will be recruited at &quot;Brazil Parkinson Association&quot;&#xD;
      (BPA), a non-governmental association of PD care, and randomly allocated in two groups: the&#xD;
      Movement Guidance Group (MVG) and NO-MVG Group. Both groups will perform XBOX Kinect training&#xD;
      for balance and gait. However, the MVG will receive kinesthetic stimuli manually by the&#xD;
      physiotherapist (PT) to improve the participant movements while the NO-MVG Group will not,&#xD;
      the presence of the PT will be restrict to only guarantee the participant safety.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Despite evidences indicate the benefit of motor interventions based on video&#xD;
      games in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD), practice guidelines for the therapeutic use in&#xD;
      physiotherapy were still not established. Although visual and auditory stimuli provided by&#xD;
      video games are pointed as one of the main advantages for their therapeutic use, the effects&#xD;
      of kinesthetic stimuli offered through physical therapist manual intervention during this&#xD;
      type of training in people with PD have not been investigated yet. The answer to this&#xD;
      question is relevant to guide the physical therapist (PT) conduct during this kind of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: To compare the effects of motor training using video games with and without&#xD;
      kinesthetic stimuli offered by physical therapist manual guidance during intervention on the&#xD;
      functionality of people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: A blind randomized clinical trial in people with idiopathic PD, staging of 1 to 3&#xD;
      according to disability scale of Hoehn and Yahr, will be performed. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups: the Movement Guidance Group (MVG) and NO-MVG Group. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive 8 individual sessions, twice a week, for 4 weeks. Each session consist of 10&#xD;
      minutes of warm-up and 40 minutes of XBOX Kinect training for balance and gait. In the MVG&#xD;
      Group, the PT will provide kinesthetic stimuli by assisting manually the participant&#xD;
      movements. In the NO-MVG Group, the involvement of the PT will be restricted to ensure&#xD;
      participant safety. The two groups will be evaluated before (BT) and after (AT) training and&#xD;
      after 60 days (follow-up). A blind physiotherapist will conduct the assessments. Measurements&#xD;
      are categorized according to the International Functioning Classification (ICF), those&#xD;
      associated with the activity level were established as primary measures: Balance Evaluation&#xD;
      Systems Test (BESTest); International Falls Effectiveness Scale (FES-I); 30-second Gait Test;&#xD;
      Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD); Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSTS) and Unified Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease Rate Scale (UPDRS) session II. Secondary measures were the evaluation of function&#xD;
      using UPDRS session III; Rapid Turns Test (RTT); Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA);&#xD;
      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), and participation using the Parkinson's Disease Quality&#xD;
      of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: An ANOVA to repeated measures will be use, having as factors: group&#xD;
      (MVG Group and NO-MVG Group) and evaluations (BT, AT and FU). Followed by post hoc Tukey Test&#xD;
      to the significance factors. A significance of 5% will be considered.&#xD;

    <measure>Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) measures balance. It includes 36 items that evaluate performance of 6 balance systems: biomechanical constraints, stability limits/verticality, anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, sensory orientation, and stability in gait.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Falls Effectiveness Scale (FES-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It presents questions about the concern with the possibility of falling when performing 16 activities, with respective scores from one to four. The total score can range from 16 (no concern) to 64 (extreme worry).</description>

    <measure>30-second Gait Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional mobility test that assesses gait performance under the influence of a verbal fluency cognitive task (speaking as many words that start with a certain letter established by the evaluator), in which the individual must walk continuously for 30 seconds and, when multitasking, he or she is instructed to perform both without interruption (command = &quot;perform both tasks at the same time, without stopping talking or walking&quot;). The evaluator measures the distance that the subject was able to travel in a single task and in a double task.</description>
