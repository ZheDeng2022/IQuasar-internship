      Aim: The aim of this observational cohort study was to measure the prevalence of UR in&#xD;
      patients aged ≥75 years on admission to an acute geriatric hospitalisation unit and to&#xD;
      determine which at risk group would benefit from screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Post-void residual volumes (PVR) were measured within 3 days of admission with an&#xD;
      ultrasound bladder scan. Uni- and multivariable analysis were used to determine risk factors&#xD;
      associated with PVR ≥150 and ≥300 millilitres.&#xD;

      1. Sample and setting An observational cross-sectional cohort study was conducted on the&#xD;
           acute geriatric hospitalisation units of the University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium&#xD;
           which have a collective capacity of 80 beds. All patients aged 75 years or older&#xD;
           admitted with or without an indwelling urinary catheter between October 26 and December&#xD;
           18, 2015 were consecutively screened for inclusion within 72 hours of admission.&#xD;
           Patients with urinary catheters for any other reason than UR, patients with ascites,&#xD;
           dialysis, uro- or nephrostomy, terminally ill patients, and postoperative patients were&#xD;
           not eligible for inclusion. Patients who refused to participate, who were unable to&#xD;
           understand and carry out the instructions for the PVR measurement, with a urinary&#xD;
           catheter for chronic UR, who were discharged or died during the inclusion process were&#xD;
           excluded. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee Research of the University&#xD;
           Hospitals Leuven (mp08305). The study nurse (SV) obtained a written informed consent&#xD;
           from all patients who agreed to participate in the study, or from a proxy when the&#xD;
           patient was incapable to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedures Prior to the start of the study, information sessions were organised for the&#xD;
           nurses from the acute geriatric hospitalisation units, in which the study nurse (SV)&#xD;
           explained the aim of the study and the data collection procedure. In addition,&#xD;
           information was given on the use of the portable ultrasound bladder scan and the&#xD;
           execution of a bladder scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The nurses were asked to perform 3 consecutive post-void bladder scans as soon as&#xD;
           possible after admission and at the latest within 72 hours of admission as standard of&#xD;
           care during the study period. The highest value of the 3 consecutive PVR measurements&#xD;
           was recorded. The study nurse (SV) was present on Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning,&#xD;
           performed informed consents and performed bladder scanning in patients where this had&#xD;
           not yet been done. Before performing the bladder scan, the patients were asked to&#xD;
           urinate. Whenever possible, patients had to walk to the toilet in the bathroom, with or&#xD;
           without assistance, meanwhile their mobility was assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consecutively, the study nurse performed a bedside assessment. A mini-cog examination&#xD;
           was performed and urinary symptoms, defaecation habits, and fall history were assessed&#xD;
           by patient or caregiver interview using a structured questionnaire (SV). The demographic&#xD;
           and remaining clinical data were collected from the patient's electronic medical records&#xD;
           (SV, KH, KF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Variables Outcome variables The PVR was measured using a portable ultrasound bladder&#xD;
           scan (Verathon BladdersScan BVI 3000). Jalbani et al. found a high correlation (r²=0.97)&#xD;
           between urinary catheterisation (gold standard) and bladder scanning and concluded that&#xD;
           the use of the Verathon BladderScan BVI 3000 is as accurate as urinary catheterisations&#xD;
           for measuring the PVR. As there are no official definitions or guidelines on what is&#xD;
           considered a relevant PVR for UR, in this study we defined UR as a PVR of ≥150&#xD;
           millilitres. In addition, we also included a PVR ≥300 ml as secondary outcome. The&#xD;
           cut-offs were chosen for the following reasons: the first bladder-filling sensation is&#xD;
           felt at a volume of 150 ml. At a volume of 300 ml, the pressure receptors in the bladder&#xD;
           wall will be activated, which creates a sense of fullness of the bladder and a need to&#xD;
           urinate. Moreover, in clinical practice a PVR ≥300ml is often considered as threshold&#xD;
           for insertion of a urinary catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographics The following patient characteristics were recorded: age, gender and living&#xD;
           situation. Patients living alone at home and together at home were considered as living&#xD;
           at home and patients living in an assisted living facility or nursing home were&#xD;
           considered as not living at home. Patients living in a convent were considered as not&#xD;
           living at home when they were functionally or cognitively impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comorbidities Various comorbidities were retrospectively retrieved from the patient's&#xD;
           electronic medical records: neurological, gynaecological and urological history, a&#xD;
           history of diabetes type 1 or 2, recurrent falls (more than 1 fall episode in the last 6&#xD;
           months), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD was defined as a glomerular filtration&#xD;
           rate (eGFR, calculated using the CKD-EPI formula) of &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m². An age adjusted&#xD;
           definition (&lt;45 ml/min/1.73 m²) was also considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical evaluation Urinary incontinence was assessed by means of 3 questions: Do you&#xD;
           have/does the patient have (1) an urge to urinate and involuntary loss of urine before&#xD;
           reaching the toilet? (2) involuntary loss of urine when sneezing, coughing, lifting or&#xD;
           moving something? (3) loss of small amounts or drops of urine without urge to urinate or&#xD;
           loss of small drops of urine when changing position. Answering positive on these&#xD;
           questions was classified as urge, stress or overflow incontinence, respectively. Dysuria&#xD;
           was questioned as having a burning sensation or pain when urinating. Urinary frequency&#xD;
           was questioned as urinating more often than usual. Voiding difficulty was questioned as&#xD;
           straining to void. Subtotal voiding was questioned as the feeling of incomplete bladder&#xD;
           emptying. Hypogastric pain was questioned as pain in the lower abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Constipation was defined as the absence of stools for 3 or more days before the PVR&#xD;
           measurement, or if patients reported having had less than 3 stools in the last week with&#xD;
           a need to strain and mostly hard or lumpy stools, or if the patient had faecal&#xD;
           impaction. Faecal impaction was defined as a large mass of compacted faeces in the&#xD;
           rectum or colon on clinical or radiographical examination, that could not be&#xD;
           spontaneously evacuated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The cognitive status of the patients was evaluated using the Mini-Cog. The Mini-Cog is a&#xD;
           brief cognitive test that involves an assessment of an older person's ability to&#xD;
           memorise three words, to draw a clock, and to recall the three words. Repeating only 1&#xD;
           or 2 of the 3 words and being unable to draw a clock correctly or not being able to&#xD;
           repeat any of the words was considered as cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mobility was assessed by walking to the bathroom and going to the toilet. All patients&#xD;
           were asked to urinate on the toilet prior to the PVR measurements. Patients were&#xD;
           considered mobile if they could walk back and forth to the toilet and if they were able&#xD;
           to stand up from the toilet independently. The use of mechanical aids was permitted.&#xD;
           Needing assistance from another person or not being able to walk was defined as impaired&#xD;
           mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory evaluation and urinalysis The patient's renal function was evaluated by serum&#xD;
           creatinine level and eGFR (calculated using the CKD-EPI formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A urinary dipstick test was performed in all patients. In patients with positive&#xD;
           leucocyte esterase or positive nitrites on the dipstick test, further urinalysis was&#xD;
           performed. An automated leucocyte count of ≥10 leukocytes/mm³ and significant&#xD;
           microscopic bacteriuria of &gt;100.000 CFU/ml for which antibiotics were started by the&#xD;
           treating physician was considered as UTI in this study. If the patient was taking&#xD;
           antibiotics at the time of the urine sample and cultures remained negative, the presence&#xD;
           of UTI was determined based on the leucocyte count.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medication For each patient the anticholinergic burden scale (ACB) score was calculated&#xD;
           taking into account medication use in the last 24 hours before the PVR measurement.&#xD;
           Individual drugs with high anticholinergic properties (ACB score ≥2), such as&#xD;
           antipsychotics, antidepressants, as well as detrusor relaxants, were examined separately&#xD;
           for their associations with UR. Antiepileptics, histamine H1 receptor antagonists,&#xD;
           anti-diarrhoea medications, decongestive drugs, spasmolytics, muscle relaxants, and&#xD;
           antiparkinsonian agents with ACB scores ≥2 were not considered individually. Low&#xD;
           prevalence of these drugs prohibited statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reason for referral to the hospital The reasons for referral to the hospital were&#xD;
           divided into the following categories: confusion, falls or immobility, urinary symptoms,&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary symptoms, digestive symptoms, fever or non-specific symptoms with&#xD;
           biochemical inflammation (elevated leucocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein) on&#xD;
           admission, other. In patients with multiple reasons for admission, each reason was&#xD;
           scored separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis Descriptive and comparative statistics were used. Normally&#xD;
           distributed continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations (SD).&#xD;
           Not normally distributed continuous variables were reported as medians with&#xD;
           interquartile ranges (IQR). Categorical variables were reported as numbers and&#xD;
           percentages. Baseline characteristics and clinical variables of patients with a PVR of&#xD;
           &lt;150 ml versus ≥150 ml and a PVR of &lt;300 ml versus ≥300 ml were compared using unpaired&#xD;
           t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables. Pearson Chi-squared tests or&#xD;
           Fisher's exact tests (if ≥1 cell had an expected count of less than 5) were used for&#xD;
           dichotomous or nominal variables, and Mann-Whitney U tests for not normally distributed&#xD;
           continuous variables or ordinal variables. All tests were 2-tailed, assuming a 5%&#xD;
           significance level. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine&#xD;
           independent predictors for a PVR ≥150 ml and a PVR ≥300 ml. Significant variables in the&#xD;
           univariable analysis were considered in a forward stepwise logistic regression&#xD;
           procedure. P-values (Likelihood ratios), odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
           (CI) are reported. The software package used was SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
           IL).&#xD;
