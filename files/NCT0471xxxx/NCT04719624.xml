  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that new synthetic bone graft bioceramic composites&#xD;
      (Adaptos®-Si and Adaptos®, Biomendex Oy) are able to support the preservation of the alveolar&#xD;
      ridge and to promote bone regeneration following dental extraction. New bone graft&#xD;
      substitutes are compared with already existing treatment principles used following dental&#xD;
      extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of the study is that Adaptos®-Si granules can reach a clinical outcome&#xD;
      superior to that of dental socket left empty after extraction. Secondary aim is that new&#xD;
      bioceramic composites can reach a clinical outcome non inferior to the active comparator of&#xD;
      this study (Geistlisch Bio-Oss®).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate new synthetic Adaptos®-Si and Adaptos® in ridge&#xD;
      preservation bone grafting after dental extraction. This is partly randomized, subject and&#xD;
      outcome assessor-blinded, controlled, single center study. The total study duration for each&#xD;
      patient is planned to be 10 months. In total 4 visits per patient are scheduled in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a single tooth extraction and then will be randomized to receive one of&#xD;
      the four bone graft substitutes, which are Adaptos®-Si (one of the the two granula sizes),&#xD;
      Adaptos®, or Geistlich Bio-Oss®. Gelatin sponge is applied on the bone graft filled&#xD;
      extraction socket. Non-randomized part of the study includes the patients that have chosen&#xD;
      the conservative treatment option with dental socket left empty and no intention for dental&#xD;
      implant placement. Following a healing period of 5 months, a dental implant will be placed,&#xD;
      unless the patient has chosen the empty socket. The subject will be followed for ten months&#xD;
      following tooth extraction. Bone ridge horizontal and vertical change assessment will be done&#xD;
      by CBCT (primary and secondary outcome) at the time of tooth extraction, and 5 months and 10&#xD;
      months post-extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study device Bio-Oss® (Geistlich Pharma) and Spongostan Absorbable Haemostatic Gelatin&#xD;
      Sponge (Ferrosan Medical Devices) are CE-marked. The products are used within the indication.&#xD;

    <description>Alveolar ridge horizontal and vertical change assessment by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The vertical reference line is outlined from the apex through the center of the socket and the horizontal reference line through the apex perpendicular to the vertical line. The ridge width (in mm) is measured parallel to the horizontal reference line 1 mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm from the highest buccal ridge point on baseline. Ridge heights (in mm) are measured from the most apical point of the alveolar socket parallel to the vertical reference line. The dimensional changes of the ridge assessed on CBCT images immediately post-extraction, are acquired five months and ten months later. Comparison between Adaptos-Si filled extraction sockets and empty sockets.</description>
