    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Boyle-Davis mouth opener, which is&#xD;
      routinely used in cleft palate surgery, on intracranial pressure by USG-guided optic nerve&#xD;
      sheath diameter measurement, which is a non-invasive method with proven effectiveness and&#xD;
      reliability in recent years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-syndromic cleft lip and / or palate is a complex congenital defect that results from&#xD;
      multiple genetic and environmental factors. It is also one of the most common congenital&#xD;
      malformations. Cleft defects require early surgical repair to minimize nutritional&#xD;
      difficulties and ensure optimum speech function. The Boyle-Davis mouth opener used in cleft&#xD;
      palate surgery consists of tongue blade, mouth opener and suspension system and is used to&#xD;
      fix the endotracheal tube in the midline and provide excellent surgical vision during the&#xD;
      operation. However, it can cause complications such as dental injuries, laryngospasm, and&#xD;
      displacement of the tracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undesirable effects such as changes in heart rate and increases in intracranial pressures may&#xD;
      occur during endotracheal intubation. These hemodynamic responses are thought to be due to&#xD;
      increased sympathoadrenal activity. Laryngoscopy without tracheal intubation has been shown&#xD;
      to increase high catecholamine levels and blood pressure, suggesting that sympathoadrenergic&#xD;
      response occurs more frequently due to stimulation of the supraglottic region. Although the&#xD;
      Boyle-Davis mouth opener provides an advantage for access to the intraoral cavity, its&#xD;
      insertion causes significant increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraocular&#xD;
      pressures by causing hemodynamic changes similar to laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent studies, measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter with ultrasonography, which is&#xD;
      a non-invasive method, is frequently used in the detection of intracranial pressure&#xD;
      increases. The optic nerve is a part of the central nervous system and is covered with a&#xD;
      dural sheath. Pressure changes in the intracranial region are similar to the pressure in the&#xD;
      infraorbital subarachnoid space surrounding the optic nerve. In clinical studies, it has been&#xD;
      shown that changes in intracranial pressure correlate with the optic nerve sheath diameter&#xD;
      measured by ultrasonography. Compared to other diagnostic methods, measurement of the&#xD;
      diameter of the optic nerve sheath is an inexpensive, easy-to-apply and non-invasive method.&#xD;
      In our study, we aimed to determine the intracranial pressure changes that may occur due to&#xD;
      the use of mouth gag in cleft palate surgeries by measuring the optic nerve sheath diameter&#xD;
      with USG, which is a non-invasive method.&#xD;
