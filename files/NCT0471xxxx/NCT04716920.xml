  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies new methods using Tai Chi for the relief of joint pain (arthralgia) caused&#xD;
      by an aromatase inhibitor in patients with stage I-III breast cancer. Tai Chi is a mind-body&#xD;
      therapy that integrates moderate physical activity, deep breathing and meditation. Tai Chi&#xD;
      may help to reduce aromatase inhibitor-induced joint pain, and offer a promising approach to&#xD;
      managing symptoms in cancer patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week Tai Chi&#xD;
      intervention for relieving aromatase inhibitor (AI)-induced arthralgia in women with breast&#xD;
      cancer (BCa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attend Tai Chi exercise classes over 1 hour twice weekly (BIW) and wear a Fitbit&#xD;
      device for up to 12 weeks. Patients are encouraged to complete self-practice over 30 minutes&#xD;
      and record practice times daily in a diary log form. Patients also join a Facebook private&#xD;
      TaiChi4joint group where they receive instructional videos matching the progress of weekly&#xD;
      classes for at-home practices and peer support in Tai Chi engagement.&#xD;
