  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary muscle tension dysphonia is a voice disorder that involves excessive and poorly&#xD;
      coordinated muscle activity affecting multiple subsystems that are involved in speech&#xD;
      production, in the absence of structural or neurologic abnormalities of the larynx. Primary&#xD;
      muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is one of the most common forms of voice disorders, accounting&#xD;
      for at least 40% of patients seen in voice clinics. Perceptually the voice sounds hoarse and&#xD;
      strained, with reduced loudness and pitch range, and people with MTD find speaking very&#xD;
      effortful and fatiguing. The physiological abnormalities that characterize MTD are considered&#xD;
      multifactorial, and include over-activity of muscles in and around the larynx, laryngeal&#xD;
      constriction patterns, and abnormal speech breathing patterns. However, standard treatment&#xD;
      approaches for MTD primarily address laryngeal function, including repositioning of laryngeal&#xD;
      structures, reducing activity in the intrinsic and extrinsic laryngeal muscles, and altering&#xD;
      vibratory patterns. Although voice improvement may follow these treatments, many people with&#xD;
      MTD show recurrence of voice problems after only a few months, and some do not improve with&#xD;
      treatment. These findings highlight the need for alternative treatments that address the&#xD;
      respiratory contributions to MTD, which directly affect the phonatory system. The goal of&#xD;
      this project is to compare the effects of two respiratory-based training conditions in people&#xD;
      with MTD. A randomized group design will be implemented to determine the respiratory and&#xD;
      acoustic effects of each condition. We will determine the effects of each condition&#xD;
      immediately after and then 3 and 6 months after training completion to assess short- and&#xD;
      long-term training effects. We propose that respiratory training will have a positive effect&#xD;
      on related laryngeal behavior and voice. The proposed project has the potential to&#xD;
      substantially advance the evidence-based treatment options for MTD, providing a vital step&#xD;
      toward reducing the debilitating effects of this disorder.&#xD;
