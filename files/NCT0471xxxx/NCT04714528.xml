  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a 12 week randomly controlled open trial 102 participants with symptoms of depression&#xD;
      and/or anxiety will be exposed to either aerobic high intensity training (HIT) or relaxation&#xD;
      therapy. Cognitive functions, biomarkers, psychiatric symptom scales and physical status will&#xD;
      be collected at baseline, after 12 weeks and after a year. Depression and anxiety will be&#xD;
      measured twice during the intervention period.&#xD;
