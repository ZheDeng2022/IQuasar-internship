      The study is a randomized controlled trial investigating a multimodal postoperative pain&#xD;
      management protocol which will include use of ice therapy and scheduled opioid-sparing&#xD;
      medications for pain control after minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. The study will&#xD;
      include women &gt;/= 18yo who speak English and are admitted for observation after a qualifying&#xD;
      laparoscopic or robotic gynecologic procedure. The investigators will identify potential&#xD;
      participants from the operating schedule, screen for any exclusion criteria, and approach&#xD;
      those eligible for inclusion on the day of surgery. All participants will receive a pain&#xD;
      regimen with medications commonly used to manage post-surgical pain including nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and prescription opioids. Participants&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm will receive prolonged scheduled NSAID and acetaminophen&#xD;
      (96 hours instead of 24 hours) and will receive 24 hours of intermittent ice-therapy (20&#xD;
      minutes every 2-3 hours) on their abdominal incisions beginning within 1-2 hours after&#xD;
      surgery. On post-operative day or day 1, a study investigator will administer a study&#xD;
      questionnaire to all participants which will include a pain score, satisfaction score, and&#xD;
      quality of recovery validated survey (the QoR-40). After discharge, participants will&#xD;
      complete short web-based survey questionnaires on day 2 and 3. On day 4 a final and more&#xD;
      comprehensive web-based survey will be sent to all participants which will include the&#xD;
      24-hour assessment in addition to the QoR-40 questionnaire, a final satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire, and pill counts of left-over discharge medications. The day 4 survey completes&#xD;
      the participants active part in the study. On or after day 30 a chart review will be&#xD;
      performed to assess for post-operative complications, emergency room visits, telephone calls,&#xD;
      unexpected office visits, and refill requests. An Ohio Rx Reporting System (OARRS) report&#xD;
      will further screen for any additional narcotic prescriptions in the 30 day postoperative&#xD;
      period. This will mark completion of participation in study. The completion of the study&#xD;
      questionnaires is anticipated to take about 1.5 to 2 hours in total time throughout the&#xD;
      study. There are no additional clinic visits or costs associated with participation in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <measure>Day 1 pain score assessed by NRS-11</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention on postoperative day 1 between 0600 to 0900</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative day 1 or Day 1 pain score will be measured using a commonly used and validated 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS-11) for pain intensity the morning after surgery between 0600 to 0900. The patient will be prompted to evaluate their current pain at rest. A score of zero will correspond with &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 corresponds with &quot;worst possible pain.&quot; The outcome will be recorded directly into their Day 1 study survey in REDCap.</description>

    <description>They will receive scheduled topical ice therapy for 24 hours after surgery. It will be applied over abdominal incisions for 20 minutes every 2-3 hours. Acetaminophen and an NSAID will be scheduled for 96 hours. While inpatient, they will receive acetaminophen 975 mg every 8 hours and IV Toradol 15-30 mg every 6 hours with change to ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours when tolerating oral intake. They may take oxycodone 5 mg every 4-6 hours as needed (PRN) for breakthrough pain and pain score &gt;6. They may use ice PRN after 24 hours. They will be prescribed acetaminophen 1000 mg every 8 hours and ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours for 96 hours postoperative. They may take them as needed after. If the participant used 0 narcotics in the first 24 hours, they will not be prescribed a narcotic. If up to 5 tablets were used, they will be prescribed 5 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg every 6 hours PRN. If more than 5 tablets were used, they will be prescribed 10 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg every 6 hours PRN.</description>
