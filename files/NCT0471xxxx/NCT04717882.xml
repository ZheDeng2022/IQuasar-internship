  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The iLIVE medication study is a before-after study where medication optimisation of patients&#xD;
      with an estimated life expectancy of six months is investigated. The investigators will&#xD;
      include 400 patients in 3 countries. The primary outcome is an assessment of the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients, four weeks after baseline assessment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Patients in the last phase of life often use many medications until shortly before&#xD;
      they die. This is partly inevitable, because these patients often experience multiple&#xD;
      distressing symptoms. However, for a considerable number of medications currently often used&#xD;
      at the end of life, the benefit is debatable, e.g. because they are aimed at the long-term&#xD;
      prevention of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: the primary objective is to examine whether the use of a clinical decision support&#xD;
      system (CDSS-OPTIMED), a personalized medication advice to attending physicians of patients&#xD;
      in the last phase of life, contributes to patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoints: the primary outcome is an assessment of the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients, four weeks after baseline assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks and benefits associated with participation: the intervention in the&#xD;
      medication study supports physicians in using available evidence and knowledge when&#xD;
      prescribing or deprescribing medication for patients in the last phase of life. The&#xD;
      intervention does not involve experimental treatment or medication. The investigators expect&#xD;
      no other risks than known side effects of (stopping) medications. The investigators are aware&#xD;
      that the study population concerns vulnerable people who may experience fluctuating symptoms&#xD;
      and levels of suffering across their disease trajectory. The investigators acknowledge the&#xD;
      risk of overburdening participants. If patients feel burdened by participating in the study,&#xD;
      they are encouraged to indicate that.&#xD;

    <description>After crossing over to the intervention period, attending physicians will receive medication alerts from the Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) within 1 week after inclusion of the patient. The medication alerts will be sent to the physician's email address. The physician is free to follow or ignore the advice in the alerts. If the physicians thinks these alerts are relevant for the patient, the physician will discuss these alerts with the patient and/or relatives. After this conversation, the physician will prescribe or deprescribe medications based on the alerts.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is 18 years or over and provides informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient is aware that recovering from his/her disease is unlikely, as assessed by&#xD;
             the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient agrees to participate in the iLIVE cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The attending physician would not be surprised if the patient would die within 6&#xD;
             months ('Surprise question').&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If the physician is uncertain about the surprise question, the patient is eligible if&#xD;
             presenting with at least one SPICT indicator. The SPICT™ is a tool to help&#xD;
             professionals identify people with general indicators of poor or deteriorating health&#xD;
             and clinical signs of life-limiting conditions for assessment and care planning, based&#xD;
             on general or disease-specific indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for relative/informal caregiver of included patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Relatives of included patients are asked to participate if they are: 18 years or over and&#xD;
        provide informed consent to participate; aware that it is unlikely that the patient will&#xD;
        recover from his/her disease; and capable of filling in a questionnaire in the country's&#xD;
        main language or in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is incapable of filling in a questionnaire in the country's main language&#xD;
             or in English (patients may be supported by relatives when filling in the&#xD;
             questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The attending physician makes the decision that the patient should not be included in&#xD;
             the study due to e.g. illness burden, fast deterioration or imminent death, lack of&#xD;
             trusting relationship with the physician.&#xD;
