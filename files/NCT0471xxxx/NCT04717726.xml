  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will test our hypothesis that, during exercise, red blood cell&#xD;
      (RBC) release of heme and catabolism to bilirubin is an essential process that mediates gene&#xD;
      responses that reduce body fat. We will evaluate whether Milk Thistle extract or&#xD;
      Lactobacillus Gasseri extends bilirubin circulating times to decrease body fat further. Thus&#xD;
      we will perform a 12-week, 6-armed trial with one group performing aerobic exercise 5 times&#xD;
      per week (EX) one group receiving a Milk Thistle extract (MT), one group receiving a&#xD;
      lactobacillus gasseri supplement (LAC), a group receiving only a placebo (CON), and groups&#xD;
      both exercising and receiving the MT (MT + EX) and lactobacillus and exercise (LAC + EX).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigative team's previous work has shown that BR binds to the PPARalpha protein in&#xD;
      fat and liver tissues to activate genes that improve fatty acid oxidation via a hormone known&#xD;
      as fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21). The investigators recently showed that in high&#xD;
      capacity running rats (HCR) compared to low capacity running (LCR), in which the latter are&#xD;
      obese, BR levels and PPARalpha-FGF21 were significantly raised in the high-capacity runners.&#xD;
      New investigations have shown that Milk Thistle (MT) herbal supplement contains polyphenols&#xD;
      that activate pathways that suppress the glucuronyl enzyme UGT1A1 that removes BR from the&#xD;
      blood, improving liver function and moderately increasing BR blood levels by ~2-fold. Similar&#xD;
      findings have been demonstrated with Lactobacillus Gasseri supplementation. Hence, there is a&#xD;
      bilirubin-PPARalpha-FGF21 axis that can be driven by exercise and dietary supplementation. We&#xD;
      will test whether exercise and milk thistle or exercise and lactobacillus gasseri&#xD;
      synergistically increase bilirubin-PPARalpha-FGF21, further reducing body fat in patients&#xD;
      with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the EX, EX + MT, and EX + LAC groups will complete five weekly exercise&#xD;
      sessions on their own, expending roughly 600 kcal per session. Participants will be provided&#xD;
      a Polar A-300 heart rate monitor programmed for their individual attributes (height, weight,&#xD;
      age, training status, gender), which gives a real-time estimate of energy expenditure during&#xD;
      exercise. Participants will report to the lab once per week to download the exercise sessions&#xD;
      and verify compliance. If participants are not compliant (defined as completing 85% of their&#xD;
      assigned exercise sessions per month), they will be disqualified. This intervention has been&#xD;
      successfully used by the investigators in multiple studies to produce significant weight loss&#xD;
      without dietary intervention in this population with a retention rate of over 90%&#xD;
      Participants in the MT and EX + MT groups will be provided 900 mg of standardized milk&#xD;
      thistle extract daily (300 mg three times per day before meals) over the 12-week regimen. The&#xD;
      investigators will use the standardized Jarrow Formulas Milk Thistle Veggie Caps containing&#xD;
      30:1 extract that is standardized to contain 80% total Milk Thistle seed flavonoids&#xD;
      (polyphenols), including the critical Silymarin fractions isosilybinins A and B, silybinins A&#xD;
      and B, silychristin and silydianin that is active against suppressing the UGT1A1 enzyme&#xD;
      increasing plasma bilirubin. The capsules are free of wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, egg,&#xD;
      fish/shellfish, peanuts/tree nuts, and GMOs. Rationale for using this brand: There have been&#xD;
      inconsistencies with previous studies that did not use a standardized silymarin extract,&#xD;
      which may have contained low levels of the active polyphenolic flavonoids in the milk thistle&#xD;
      plant, which varies in the plant's stems, leaves, roots, and flowers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the LAC and LAC + EX groups will receive two doses of 3 billion CFU of&#xD;
      lactobacillus gasseri per day for a total of 6 billion CFU, the recommended upper level for&#xD;
      supplementation of probiotic cultures. The Swanson brand Lactobacillus gasseri will be used,&#xD;
      as these capsules are also free of wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, egg, fish/shellfish,&#xD;
      peanuts/tree nuts, and GMOs. Importantly, this brand uses acid-resistant designed release&#xD;
      capsules to improve the viability of the lactobacillus in the human stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the CON and EX group will receive a placebo (maltodextrin) made to look&#xD;
      identical to the MT capsules.&#xD;
