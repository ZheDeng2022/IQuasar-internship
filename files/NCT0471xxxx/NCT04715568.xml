      This is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial of efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of an FDA-approved angiotensin receptor blocker (losartan) to improve cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      outcomes in individuals with pre-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) due to&#xD;
      prolonged exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) remains a major public health problem.This is important&#xD;
      particularly as the generations that endured the highest amount of SHS exposure are aging,&#xD;
      which could potentially accentuate the SHS-related occult health problems that may have been&#xD;
      previously too subtle to be recognized. Although acute and subacute health effects of&#xD;
      exposure to SHS have been studied, its long-term consequences have been more difficult to&#xD;
      examine in part due to challenges with exposure assessment. Nonsmoking flight attendants (FA)&#xD;
      who worked on commercial aircrafts before the enactment of the smoking ban were exposed to&#xD;
      heavy SHS in aircraft cabin for many years, in a range similar to the nicotine exposure&#xD;
      burden experienced by &quot;light&quot; smokers. The regularity of this intense exposure in the cabin&#xD;
      work environment lends itself to relatively accurate SHS exposure quantification through&#xD;
      employment history, and makes the exposed FA a unique population in which the long-term&#xD;
      health effects of previous exposure to SHS could be examined as a form of &quot;natural&quot;&#xD;
      experiment that is also generalizable to other SHS exposed populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past several years, the investigators recruited a nonsmoking cohort of FA with such&#xD;
      history of cabin SHS exposure who had subclinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary disease.&#xD;
      Furthermore, while the FA in this cohort had no history of known cardiovascular disease, and&#xD;
      were able to perform well on maximum effort exercise testing, they had an abnormal&#xD;
      cardiovascular (hypertensive) response to exercise (HRE) that was associated with their cabin&#xD;
      SHS exposure. Subtle abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise in the absence of overt&#xD;
      disease, such as what the investigators observed in this cohort, has been described in other&#xD;
      populations with likely subclinical disease and is suggested to be associated with impaired&#xD;
      cardiovascular function with potential future adverse outcomes. However, the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms that contribute to these abnormal cardiovascular responses are unclear, and the&#xD;
      rationale for initiation of preventative medical interventions in this setting remains&#xD;
      unproven. Thus, the nature and clinical significance of these subtle abnormalities demands&#xD;
      further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prolonged exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), even when remote, is associated&#xD;
           with occult cardiovascular disease as determined by (a) abnormal cardiac structure and&#xD;
           function, (b) abnormal vascular structure and function, and (c) abnormal circulatory&#xD;
           mediators, which altogether generate a hypertensive response to exertion and limit&#xD;
           exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Management of hypertensive response to exercise (HRE) via blocking of the&#xD;
           renin-angiotensin system, using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptor blocker,&#xD;
           reduces the hypertensive response and improves exercise capacity, proxies for long-term&#xD;
           cardiovascular health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate the above hypothesis through the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1- Determine whether hypertensive response to exercise (HRE) is associated with&#xD;
      abnormal cardiac and/or vascular structure and function in flight attendants (FA) with&#xD;
      prolonged cabin SHS exposure but without overt cardiovascular disease. The investigators will&#xD;
      perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure myocardial dimensions and&#xD;
      function including left ventricular (LV) mass, volume, ejection fraction (LVEF), and&#xD;
      diastolic function. The investigators will also measure aortic stiffness by regional pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity (PWV) measurement in the thoracic aorta from the MRI. The investigators will&#xD;
      then examine the associations of these outcomes with SHS exposure and HRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2- Determine whether HRE is associated with abnormal circulatory markers of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in those with prolonged SHS exposure but without overt disease. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine subjects' peripheral blood samples for circulatory markers of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation, vascular function, and prothrombotic state including ACE, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP), endothelin-1 (ET-1), P-selectin, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand Factor (vWF).&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators will perform molecular phenotyping of peripheral blood monocytes,&#xD;
      an important culprit in atherogenesis, using mass cytometry in search for a proinflammatory&#xD;
      profile associated with cardiovascular disease. The investigators will then examine the&#xD;
      associations of these outcomes with HRE and SHS exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3- Determine whether short-term treatment with an ACE receptor blocker&#xD;
      (Losartan) improves HRE and exercise capacity in those with prolonged exposure to SHS but&#xD;
      without overt cardiovascular disease. The investigators will perform a placebocontrolled&#xD;
      double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) in subjects with HRE but without known&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease to determine the efficacy (and safety) of blocking the&#xD;
      reninangiotensin system in reducing HRE and improving exercise capacity, a proxy for improved&#xD;
      cardiovascular health.&#xD;
