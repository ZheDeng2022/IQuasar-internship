  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While respiratory rate is considered a critical vital sign, it often goes unmeasured or is&#xD;
      ignored primarily due to shortcomings of the currently used measurement methods. Respiratory&#xD;
      rate provides important information on a person's health condition and physiological&#xD;
      stability, and an abnormal respiratory rate is a strong indicator that a health crisis is&#xD;
      imminent. In fact, a sudden change in respiratory rate is one of the strongest predictors of&#xD;
      mortality. Current techniques of monitoring respiratory rate have drawbacks that limit the&#xD;
      frequency and convenience of the respiratory monitoring. Recognizing that closer respiration&#xD;
      monitoring can save lives and improve quality of life, reduce hospital stays, and lower&#xD;
      medical costs, the health care industry is seeking improved respiration monitoring products.&#xD;
      The allocation of high-risk patients to intensive care for more careful monitoring or after&#xD;
      surgery is often arbitrary, and such care might not be available routinely. For those&#xD;
      patients who are cared for in 'general' wards where staffing levels are limited, a practical&#xD;
      continuous monitor of respiratory rate would be of great value. This study will act as a&#xD;
      pilot to determine the feasibility of using respiratory sensor device to monitor respiratory&#xD;
      rate in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deriving a measurement of respiratory rate from a respiratory rate monitoring (RRM) device is&#xD;
      a technological approach that may overcome these limitations. The device principle is based&#xD;
      on a piezoelectric sensor where chest expansions and contractions generate very small amounts&#xD;
      of current by the piezoelectric sensor. The expansion and contractions are measured very&#xD;
      accurately by over-sampling, filtering and digital signal processing to remove noise and any&#xD;
      bias generated by the piezoelectric sensor itself or the sampling circuitry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted from March 2021 to September 2021. During the first phase a&#xD;
      convenience sample of 30 patients undergoing general anesthesia with muscle paralysis and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation will be recruited. This phase will help to validate the RRM against&#xD;
      capnography in mechanically ventilated patients with a set respiratory rate. Following the&#xD;
      first phase, 120 patients undergoing a procedure using sedation or spinal anesthesia will be&#xD;
      recruited. Patients will be breathing spontaneously, and the respiratory rate will be&#xD;
      monitored by capnography connected to the face mask or nasal prongs. Respiratory rate&#xD;
      detected by capnography is recorded in the electronic medical records on a minute to minute&#xD;
      interval.&#xD;
