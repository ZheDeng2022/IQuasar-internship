      As the number of operation increases, it is important to control of the utilization rate of&#xD;
      the operating room. When family members need to be contacted during the operation, whether&#xD;
      family members in the waiting area can be notified in time will affect the overall operation&#xD;
      time of the patient and the utilization rate of the operating room. The way of contact also&#xD;
      indirectly affects issues such as hospital costs and patient privacy. This study is a&#xD;
      comparative study of the benefits of different ways of contacting patients' family members&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the current traditional method (using radio and telephone to notify&#xD;
      the patient's family to the operating room) or the wireless vibrating caller to notify the&#xD;
      patient's family to the operating room, and analyze the variables generated by the two&#xD;
      different methods including demand time of notification, acceptance, and patient privacy&#xD;
      issues. The results of the study will use scientific data to prove which way to notify the&#xD;
      patient's family is more efficient and a good way to take into account of the patient's&#xD;
      privacy.&#xD;
