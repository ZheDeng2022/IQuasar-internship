  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal hypoestrogenism may determine genital atrophy, which may be accompanied by a&#xD;
      non-specific inflammatory process and may hinder or even prevent sexual intercourse. In more&#xD;
      severe cases, the patient may have local pain that interferes with their daily activities.&#xD;
      The best treatment for increasing genital trophism is still estrogen. However, there are&#xD;
      women who can not use this therapy or do not want it. Therefore, there is a need for&#xD;
      alternatives, such as ablation techniques: use of CO2 LASER and fractional radiofrequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out at the outpatient clinic of Lower Genital Tract ambulatory of the&#xD;
      Discipline of Gynecology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinical Hospital, Faculty&#xD;
      of Medicine, University of São Paulo, involving 75 women who were divided after randomization&#xD;
      in three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - treatment with topical vaginal promestriene (n = 25 patients); Group 2 - treatment&#xD;
      with fractional CO2 LASER (n = 25 patients); Group 3 - fractional microablative&#xD;
      radiofrequency treatment (n = 25 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of the complaints were be performed through questionnaires on sexuality,&#xD;
      quality of life and urinary incontinence, as well as biopsies of the vaginal wall for&#xD;
      histomorphometric, immunohistochemical and molecular biology study before and after six&#xD;
      months of treatment. The duration of the study were fifteen months.&#xD;

      After completing the eligibility criteria, patients signed the consent inform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Division of groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were included in the study 75 patients, divided into three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - Treatment with topical vaginal promestriene - 25 patients in this group were&#xD;
      included patients free of systemic or topical hormonal treatment for at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - Treatment with CO2 LASER - 25 patients, in this group were included patients free&#xD;
      of systemic or topical hormonal treatment for at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - Treatment with microablative fractionated radiofrequency - 25 patients in this&#xD;
      group were included patients free of systemic or topical hormonal treatment for at least 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was open and randomized. The randomization was be performed through the&#xD;
      software &quot;Test Generator Software Standard Edition&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, all patients responded to the clinical questionnaire of female sex&#xD;
      quotient (QS-F), the quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) and the urinary incontinence&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were submitted to specular gynecological examination to collect cervical-vaginal&#xD;
      cytology, biopsy of 1/3 proximal vaginal wall for histological analysis and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the results of the examinations and possible treatments required, the patients were&#xD;
      referred for the proposed treatments according to their randomized group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Cytology :Cervical and vaginal oncology cytology were collected through a smear on a&#xD;
      slide with fixative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histological expression of the following immunohistochemical parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence and density of estrogen receptors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular density&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thickness of the epithelium&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Density of collagen fibers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginal microbiota&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginal pH&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it will be done a Morphological Analysis, a Histomorphometric analysis and e&#xD;
      Immunohistochemical analysis.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>It was acessed at the beginnig and in the end of the treatment. We used the Short Form Health Survey 36 questionnaire for this parameter. It contains 36 items measuring eight dimensions, that vary the pontuation between 1-5 to 1-6. All but one of the 36 items are used to score the SF-36 eight domains that are aggregated in two summary measures, Physical and Mental components. Among the eight domains, three scales (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, and Bodily Pain) contributes mostly to the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and three (Mental Health, Role-Emotional, and Social Functioning) contributes to the Mental Component Summary. The domains Vitality, General Health, and Social Functioning present noteworthy correlations with both summary componentNormalized scores below 50 are interpreted as below the generals population. The better is to have a higher pontuation.</description>

    <description>LASER treatment with fractional CO2 Laser was performed in 3 sessions with intervals of 4 weeks between them. Before each session, the patients underwent specular examination.&#xD;
Fractional CO2 LASER was applied following these parameters, fixed in all sessions: vagina wall - power40 W, dwel time 1000 mcs, spacing 1000 mcm and stack 2, vestibule - power 10W, dwel time 500mcs, spacing 300mcg and satck 1</description>

    <description>Microablative fractional radiofrequency was performed with the equipment calibrated in FRAXX mode, 45W, Low Energy program 40 milliseconds in the vaginal and introitus wall. Lidocaine spray was applied to vaginal introitus before the procedure.&#xD;
The patient was in the gynecological position. The vaginal speculum was placed and, afterwards, the vaginal antisepsis was performed with aqueous chlorhexidine and cleaning with 0.9% saline solution.&#xD;
All liquid contents were wiped off before beginning the procedure. The fractured tip will be pressed lightly and as perpendicular as possible into the vulvar or vaginal surface, ensuring full contact of all points in the tissue, starting at the lateral vaginal walls and from the proximal to the distal third.</description>
