  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful medication management is an essential instrumental activity of daily living (IADL)&#xD;
      for older adults with polypharmacy; however, between 40%-70% of older adults fail to take&#xD;
      their medications as prescribed. Providing interventions to address medication management and&#xD;
      restore performance for this IADL is within the scope of practice for occupational therapy&#xD;
      (OT), however, there is paucity of evidence for OT interventions to improve medication&#xD;
      management in community-dwelling older adults. We have developed a tailored medication&#xD;
      management intervention (TIMM) for community-dwelling older adults which recognizes the&#xD;
      unique context in which medication management occurs (the home) and addresses the personal&#xD;
      and environmental barriers experienced by older adults. TIMM is delivered in the home, by an&#xD;
      OT, and in collaboration with a pharmacist to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost 70% of older adults experience multimorbidity and medication is often the first&#xD;
      intervention used to manage it. In fact, 90% of older adults take at least one medication and&#xD;
      36% take 5 or more, commonly known as polypharmacy. When taken correctly, medication can&#xD;
      extend life-expectancy and improve quality of life. However, estimates show 40-75% of&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults are nonadherent, or deviate from their medication regimen.&#xD;
      These older adults are at an increased risk of nonadherence because the physical changes&#xD;
      associated with multimorbidity including decreased memory, fine motor skills, and visual&#xD;
      acuity and because of the complexity polypharmacy adds to a medication routine. Nearly 43% of&#xD;
      older adults with polypharmacy take medications that are inappropriate and can cause negative&#xD;
      long term physical and cognitive function, which further complicates the mediation management&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonadherence has significant consequences which include increased health care costs, falls,&#xD;
      institutionalization, and decreased medication effectiveness, quality of life. In fact,&#xD;
      improving medication adherence has been identified as a public health concern by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization. Despite this, interventions designed to improve adherence in older&#xD;
      adults remain largely ineffective. The majority of interventions are disease or medication&#xD;
      specific or are implemented with a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach (e.g. providing standard pill&#xD;
      organizers that may be difficult for some older adults to open). Furthermore, interventions&#xD;
      are often implemented in a clinical setting such as doctor's office or hospital and do not&#xD;
      consider the unique home environment where medication management typically occurs. Home&#xD;
      environments can offer support (i.e. caregiver to set up medications) or barriers (i.e. low&#xD;
      lighting that makes medications difficult to see) to medication management. Given the&#xD;
      complexity of each older adult's risk factors and home environment, a more tailored,&#xD;
      individualized approach must be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tailored, individualized interventions aimed at remediating the environmental barriers in the&#xD;
      home have been successful in improving daily activity performance for older adults. However,&#xD;
      this type of intervention has not been tested specifically to improve medication adherence in&#xD;
      older adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. We propose a tailored, individualized&#xD;
      medication management intervention (TIMM) for community-dwelling older adults with&#xD;
      multimorbidity and polypharmacy. TIMM is an interdisciplinary, compensatory intervention&#xD;
      which consists of: 1) an initial in-home evaluation of medication management ability,&#xD;
      individual risk factors, and identification of environmental barriers to independence; 2) a&#xD;
      medication review by a pharmacist to address polypharmacy; and 3) tailored intervention by an&#xD;
      occupational therapist to improve adherence by reducing barriers to medication management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a single blind, randomized controlled feasibility trial. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      tailored intervention designed to improve medication adherence in older adults. We will test&#xD;
      the working hypothesis that TIMM will be a feasible and acceptable intervention that is&#xD;
      superior to standard treatment on measures of medication adherence, ability to complete&#xD;
      medication management tasks.&#xD;

    <description>First, the study pharmacist reviews the older adult's medication for potentially inappropriate medications. The pharmacist collaborates with the prescribing physician(s) to deprescribe as indicated. The pharmacist educates the older adult and OT on any changes that were made. The OT and older adult will develop a plan to reduce risk factors and improve medication management. Participants receive tailored compensatory strategies and supports to remediate extrinsic risk factors and modify the home environment to improve medication adherence. The OT provides training and active practice of the compensatory strategies and supports in the home in an effective and safe manner.</description>
