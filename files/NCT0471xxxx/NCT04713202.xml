    <textblock>
      The NET-PACS trial is a Prospective Assessment of patients with neuroendocrine tumors and&#xD;
      current or prior history of Carcinoid Syndrome or diarrhea undergoing peptide receptor&#xD;
      radionuclide therapy with or without telotristat ethyl. The main goal of the study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility of serial in-depth assessment of patients with neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors and current or prior history of carcinoid syndrome or diarrhea undergoing treatment&#xD;
      with PRRT using telotristat ethyl compared to placebo. We aim to report and describe from a&#xD;
      patient's perspective the multi-faceted impact of carcinoid syndrome in patients with NETs&#xD;
      and the changes on treatment while getting PRRT using telotristat ethyl compared to placebo.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or&#xD;
             obtained separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females, aged 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically-confirmed neuroendocrine tumor (GI or other primary)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of somatostatin receptors as by either Ga-68 dotatate imaging or Octreoscan&#xD;
             or comparable method, which is a requirement for PRRT (Lutathera ®). Disease does not&#xD;
             need to be measurable per RECIST since it is not uncommon to have non-target lesions&#xD;
             but not meet criteria for RECIST as long as presence of somatostatin receptors can be&#xD;
             demonstrated. NOTE: Patients undergoing other types of PRRT would not be eligible for&#xD;
             this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible for treatment with PRRT (Lutathera®) according to institutional practice and&#xD;
             product label.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with current or prior history of symptomatic carcinoid syndrome or carcinoid&#xD;
             diarrhea as per investigator assessment. Note: prior history and current controlled&#xD;
             carcinoid patients are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the protocol; all screening labs to&#xD;
             be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks as per investigator opinion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or&#xD;
             serum βhCG) within 7 days prior to study registration. If a urine test is positive or&#xD;
             cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. See&#xD;
             exclusion 4 for WOCBP definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery, radiotherapy, within 4 weeks; chemotherapy, or other investigational therapy&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to study registration, or 5 half-lives of a drug, whichever is&#xD;
             shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure prior to study registration. Patients can be&#xD;
             considered eligible if the disease is controlled at the date of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical conditions,&#xD;
             currently uncontrolled by treatment, which may interfere with completion of the study&#xD;
             as per investigator opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), must agree to use appropriate method(s) of&#xD;
             contraception. Women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless are&#xD;
             surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
             complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without&#xD;
             an alternative medical cause).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP must agree to use appropriate method(s) of contraception from the time of&#xD;
             informed consent until 7 months post-treatment completion. Complete abstinence is also&#xD;
             an acceptable form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use appropriate method(s) of&#xD;
             contraception from the first dose of study drug until 4 months post-treatment&#xD;
             completion. Complete abstinence is also an acceptable form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Telotristat ethyl tablets contain lactose as an excipient. Patients with rare&#xD;
             hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or&#xD;
             glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take telotristat ethyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medications: Any other herbal or alternative medicines being used as an&#xD;
             anti-cancer treatment are not allowed. NOTE: if patient is receiving a drug that is a&#xD;
             CYP3A4 substrate, strongly consider switching to an alternate drug if possible. The&#xD;
             latter is more of a recommendation, not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
