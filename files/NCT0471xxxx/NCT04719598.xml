      nocturnal hot flashes, mood disorders, and obstructive sleep apnea among menopauses. The&#xD;
      Prevalence of sleep problems is variable ranged from 11.8 -62 % based on different studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As life expectancy has increased, women spend more than one-third of their lives in&#xD;
      menopausal transition (MT) and the subsequent post menopause (PM).As a result of hormonal&#xD;
      changes women experiences such symptoms as hot flashes, mood swings, anxiety, and sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction that deteriorate their quality of life. Those symptoms usually begin in&#xD;
      45-53-year-olds and it varies in onset and severity from women to another and from country to&#xD;
      another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of sleep problems include the difficulty of falling asleep, fractioned sleep,&#xD;
      night-time awakening, the inability of resuming sleep, problems in waking up, fatigue, and&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness that potentiate poor physical and mental quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of CBT is to teach women how to modify maladaptive behaviors and thoughts that may&#xD;
      contribute to a particular problem as sleep problems, anxious thoughts, and vasomotor&#xD;
      symptoms&#xD;
