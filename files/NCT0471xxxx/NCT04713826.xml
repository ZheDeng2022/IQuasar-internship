  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).&#xD;
      In people with OSA, the upper airways can narrow or close repetitively while sleeping. These&#xD;
      breathing interruptions lead to reduction of oxygen in the blood or short arousals from&#xD;
      sleep. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical trials&#xD;
      to better understand its safety and how well it works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the researchers want to learn more about how well BAY2586116 works in a small&#xD;
      number of participants with OSA. The trial will include about 160 men and women who have OSA&#xD;
      and are at least 18 years old. Women can only be included in this trial if they are not able&#xD;
      to have children naturally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the participants will take BAY2586116 and a placebo. A placebo looks like a&#xD;
      treatment but does not have any medicine in it. All of the participants will take BAY2586116&#xD;
      through a nasal spray. They will also take the placebo as a nasal spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a crossover trial. This means all the participants will take both trial&#xD;
      treatments one after the other, but in a different order. The participants will take each&#xD;
      treatment once a day for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will use a measurement called the apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI) to measure the&#xD;
      severity of the participants' OSA. The researchers will then compare the participants' AHI&#xD;
      scores when they take BAY2586116 and when they take the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During study, the participants will visit their trial site 5 times. At these visits the&#xD;
      doctors will take blood samples, do physical examinations and check the participants' heart&#xD;
      health using an electrocardiogram (ECG). They will also ask the participants questions about&#xD;
      how they are feeling and if they have any medical problems. At 3 of the visits, the&#xD;
      participants will stay at the trial site overnight. At these visits, the doctors will&#xD;
      calculate the number of times the participants stop breathing per hour of sleep. After&#xD;
      treatment, the participants will have a final visit 7 days later so the doctors can check&#xD;
      their health.&#xD;
