  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) has contributed to the substantial reduction&#xD;
      in malaria cases and deaths. This progress is threatened by increasing resistance to commonly&#xD;
      used insecticides in important mosquito vector populations. Newly developed, next-generation&#xD;
      ITNs that use two insecticides, or an insecticide synergist and an insecticide, are effective&#xD;
      at killing resistant mosquitoes, but large-scale uptake of these nets has been slow due to&#xD;
      higher costs and lack of enough evidence to support broad policy recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will occur alongside a pilot distribution of next-generation ITNs in&#xD;
      two regions of Mozambique. Over three years, data on the entomological and epidemiological&#xD;
      impact of the different ITN types will be collected. Data collection will occur in six&#xD;
      districts: two districts receiving the dual-active ingredient ITN Interceptor® G2 (BASF:&#xD;
      alphacypermethrin + chlorfenapyr); one district that will receive the dual-active ingredient&#xD;
      ITN Royal Guard® (Disease Control Technologies: alphacypermethrin + pyriproxyfen); one&#xD;
      district receiving an ITN containing an insecticide plus an insecticide synergist ,&#xD;
      Olyset®Plus (Sumitomo Chemical: permethrin + piperonyl butoxide); and two districts receiving&#xD;
      the standard pyrethroid-only ITNs DuraNet® (Shobikaa Impex Private Limited:&#xD;
      alphacypermethrin). Data will be collected on malaria vector bionomics, disease epidemiology,&#xD;
      and ITN use in order to help better demonstrate the public health value of next-generation&#xD;
      ITNs and to support donors, policymakers, and National Malaria Control Programs in their ITN&#xD;
      decision-making and planning processes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization's (WHO) 2018 World Malaria Report estimates that in 2017, 219&#xD;
      million cases of malaria occurred worldwide resulting in 435,000 deaths, 93% of which&#xD;
      occurred in Africa (WHO 2018). While this represents a remarkable improvement in comparison&#xD;
      with 2000, with malaria deaths having fallen by 40% in Africa, the downward trends in&#xD;
      incidence and mortality stalled between 2015 and 2017. This recent failure to maintain the&#xD;
      hard-won progress, let alone accelerate progress towards elimination, over the past three&#xD;
      years has caused WHO to describe the global fight against malaria as being at a crossroads,&#xD;
      calling for increased funding and highlighting the need to develop, optimize, and implement&#xD;
      new tools to combat malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universal coverage of populations at risk with malaria vector control interventions,&#xD;
      primarily insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), in&#xD;
      malaria-endemic countries is a global and national priority because of its fundamental&#xD;
      importance for malaria control and elimination. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these&#xD;
      tools is threatened by the emergence and spread of pyrethroid resistance in key mosquito&#xD;
      populations, which is now reported in more than 85% of all malaria endemic countries and&#xD;
      poses significant risk to the future impact of these tools. Emerging evidence suggests,&#xD;
      however, that increasing mosquito mortality and thereby continuing to reduce malaria&#xD;
      transmission is possible in areas with pyrethroid resistance by introducing new insecticide&#xD;
      formulations for IRS and ITNs. For example, Protopopoff et al. showed in Tanzania that the&#xD;
      distribution of LLINs with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) plus pyrethroid reduced malaria&#xD;
      prevalence by 13% compared to standard pyrethroid-only LLIN distribution (42% vs. 29%;&#xD;
      p=0.0011), and Tiono et al., working in Burkina Faso, showed that the distribution of a dual&#xD;
      active-ingredient ITN reduced clinical malaria incidence by 22% (Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.88;&#xD;
      p=0.04) and potentially infective mosquito bites by 51% (entomological inoculation rate ratio&#xD;
      = 0.49; p&lt;0.0001) compared to the distribution of a standard pyrethroid-only LLIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is evidence that standard LLINs can continue to provide effective personal&#xD;
      protection to regular net users in regions with resistant vector populations, new classes of&#xD;
      ITNs developed to perform against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes have been developed, with&#xD;
      early trials and modelling suggesting that they may provide superior protective efficacy&#xD;
      against malaria in areas with pyrethroid-resistant vectors. Access to these new&#xD;
      resistance-breaking ITNs is restricted by need for efficacy data for continuing policy&#xD;
      recommendations, high prices, lack of evidence of cost effectiveness compared to&#xD;
      pyrethroid-only LLINs, and consequent poor demand in an uncertain market. Two types of&#xD;
      next-generation ITNs, each utilizing a different mixture of active ingredients from different&#xD;
      insecticide classes, have recently received WHO prequalification listing demonstrating that&#xD;
      they perform to the thresholds required of pyrethroid-only ITNs and have no known specific&#xD;
      side effects: Interceptor G2® (IG2; by BASF SE) and Royal Guard®(RG; by Disease Control&#xD;
      Technologies, LLC). The IG2 ITN contains a mixture of a pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) and a&#xD;
      pyrrole (chlorfenapyr), while the RG ITN contains a mixture of the same pyrethroid&#xD;
      (alpha-cypermethrin) and an insect growth regulator (pyriproxyfen). While both net types have&#xD;
      been subsequently registered and approved for use in Mozambique based on this WHO listing,&#xD;
      the Roll Back Malaria Vector Control Advisory Group guidance indicates that dual active&#xD;
      ingredient ITNs will require further epidemiological evidence before policy recommendations&#xD;
      are made for their use in preference to pyrethroid-only ITNs in certain settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Global Fund and Unitaid have developed a market shaping program for next-generation ITNs&#xD;
      with novel insecticide formulations. Evidence on the efficacy of IG2 and RG ITNs will be&#xD;
      generated by the project through two randomized control trials taking place in Benin and&#xD;
      Tanzania. In addition, through this program, these next-generation ITNs will be made&#xD;
      available to countries for incorporation into their national distribution programs as pilot&#xD;
      distributions with the aim of determining real-world effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in&#xD;
      different contexts. In addition to the pilot distribution of IG2s taking place in Mozambique,&#xD;
      three other countries will be piloting next-generation ITNs as part of the New Nets project:&#xD;
      Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Rwanda. This research will utilize these pilot distributions to&#xD;
      understand the cost-effectiveness of the new ITNs in the chosen settings. The NMCP in&#xD;
      Mozambique, in discussion with the Global Fund, chose to incorporate IG2, RG, and PBO ITNs&#xD;
      into the 2020 mass distribution campaign. This study will collect information to determine&#xD;
      the public health impact of the RG, PBO, and IG2 ITNs in Mozambique, in comparison to two&#xD;
      sites that will receive standard pyrethroid-only ITNs. The aim of this research is to better&#xD;
      understand the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of IG2 and RG ITNs in Mozambique and to&#xD;
      collect data on community uptake of the ITNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the upcoming pilot implementation enhanced entomological, epidemiological, and net use&#xD;
      data will be collected in up to six study districts: two districts receiving the dual-active&#xD;
      ingredient ITN Interceptor® G2 (BASF: alphacypermethrin + chlorfenapyr); one district that&#xD;
      will receive the dual-active ingredient ITN Royal Guard® (Disease Control Technologies:&#xD;
      alphacypermethrin + pyriproxyfen); one district receiving an ITN containing an insecticide&#xD;
      plus an insecticide synergist, Olyset®Plus (Sumitomo Chemical: permethrin + piperonyl&#xD;
      butoxide); and two districts receiving the standard pyrethroid-only ITNs DuraNet® (Shobikaa&#xD;
      Impex Private Limited: alphacypermethrin). Data will be analyzed and results disseminated to&#xD;
      support the NMCP, donors, policymakers, and other national and regional stakeholders in their&#xD;
      ITN decision-making and planning processes. Each component aims specifically to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiological component - measure the epidemiological impact of the new IG2 ITNs,&#xD;
           Royal Guard ITNs, PBO ITNs, and standard ITNs in real deployment scenarios through&#xD;
           observational studies. These studies will compare trends in (1) malaria case incidence&#xD;
           rates passively reported to the national health system (passive case detection (PCD))&#xD;
           and (2) malaria infection prevalence, measured through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), in&#xD;
           children aged 6 months to 5 years of age from annual cross-sectional surveys during peak&#xD;
           transmission periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Entomological component - evaluate the impact of the different net types on vector&#xD;
           populations and biting rates, compared to standard ITNs, through mosquito surveillance&#xD;
           data that will measure trends in species-specific (1) adult vector densities (2) indoor&#xD;
           and outdoor human landing rates (3) estimated entomological inoculation rates and (4)&#xD;
           insecticide resistance patterns. These entomological surveillance activities are aligned&#xD;
           with NMCP activities and are not part of the human subject research component of this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropological component - map patterns of ITN usage to determine transmission risk&#xD;
           defined as the intersection between time at risk of mosquito blood feeding and human&#xD;
           activities not under protection of an ITN, through gathering evidence on ITN uptake and&#xD;
           usage. The collection of reliable data on such patterns, both indoors and outdoors,&#xD;
           becomes thus an essential component of the evaluation of the ITN pilots for both&#xD;
           modeling and contextual analysis of impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durability monitoring - monitoring of IG2, RG and PBO ITNs in one district each,&#xD;
           prospectively measuring physical durability, attrition, and chemical durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Costing and cost-effectiveness component - estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
           IG2, RG and PBO ITNs in Mozambique through data on the price of the product, delivery&#xD;
           and deployment costs, and product effectiveness based on case incidence rates measured&#xD;
           during the epidemiological component of this study. Additionally, mean costs per case&#xD;
           averted that might occur in other contexts will be modeled and incorporated into the&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness evaluations.&#xD;
