      This study aims to determine the correlation between candida and pro- inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      response in Oral Leukoplakia(OL) with antifungal therapy. Ethical clearance from the&#xD;
      Institutes ethical committee and Informed written consent from the patient will be obtained.&#xD;
      The study group would comprise of clinically and histopathologically confirmed cases of OL&#xD;
      (60 patients). The control group would be 30 dental patients ( age &amp; sex matched) who do not&#xD;
      any malignancy, OL or any other potentially malignant disorder of oral mucosa. Patients who&#xD;
      have any predisposing factor for oral candidiasis will be excluded from the study. Swabs will&#xD;
      be taken from the oral lesion and cultured for candida to determine phenotypes, virulence&#xD;
      attributes and antifungal sensitivity. Sterile PVA opthalmic sponges will be used to collect&#xD;
      sample from the surface of oral epithelium and then processed to determine levels of pro-&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8. IL-17, TNFα). This procedure will be repeated in study&#xD;
      group 2 weeks after a course of antifungal therapy. The results will be tested statistically&#xD;
      at a confidence level of 95%.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Selection of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the study group and control group will be consecutively recruited from the&#xD;
      Oral Medicine &amp; Radiology clinic at Centre for Dental Education &amp; Research AIIMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 60 OL ( 30 Homogenous OL, 30 Non- Homogenous OL) and 30 healthy&#xD;
      controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicopathologic characteristics:&#xD;

      investigations would be done before incisional biopsy and histopathological confirmation of&#xD;
      the diagnosis. The H &amp; E histopathological features with Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining&#xD;
      would be recorded and grading done for study group as per standard World Health Organization&#xD;
      criteria. The clinical staging of OL will be done as per OL staging system (OLEP) ( van der&#xD;
      Waal 2000) with photographic records of lesions by two calibrated observers.Tobacco,betel nut&#xD;
      and alcohol cessation counselling and oral hygiene instructions will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A). Candida phenotypes, virulence and antifungal sensitivity study. Collection , transport&#xD;
      and processing: Two oral swabs from each patient ( pre-wet with sterile normal saline) will&#xD;
      be taken from the oral lesion and sent to the Mycology Laboratory, Department of Microbiology&#xD;
      for further processing as per standard laboratory procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct microscopy: One swab sample will be examined by microscopy for detection of yeast&#xD;
      cells by preparing gram stain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culture: The second swab will be inoculated on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) medium with&#xD;
      gentamicin and will be kept at 37°C for incubation for 48 hours. Gram staining will be&#xD;
      performed on any growth morphologically resembling to that of yeast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotypic identification: Identification of isolates was performed by using germ tube,&#xD;
      morphology on corn meal agar, colour on triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and CHROM agar medium&#xD;
      Determination of virulence factors of Candida spp Various virulence factors like&#xD;
      phospholipase activity, Secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP) and Biofilm formation (BF) will be&#xD;
      determined as per the standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Phospholipase (PL) activity Phospholipase activity will be measure by&#xD;
      growing cells on egg yolk agar medium and measuring the size of the zone of precipitation. A&#xD;
      cell suspension of 106 yeast cells/ml in saline will be prepare and 5μl will be place on the&#xD;
      surface of the egg yolk medium. The culture will then incubated at 37°C for 7-8 days, after&#xD;
      which the diameter of the precipitation zone around the colony will be determine.&#xD;
      Phospholipase activity (Pz) will be measure by dividing colony diameter by the diameter of&#xD;
      the precipitation zone (pz) around the colony formed on the plate. Each isolate will be&#xD;
      tested in duplicate. The C. albicans SC 5314 strain will be used as positive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP) activity All isolates will be tested for&#xD;
      their ability to grow and produce a clear zone of hydrolysis in bovine serum albumin (BSA)&#xD;
      agar. . A 5μl of 1x106 cells /ml will be placed on solid medium and will be incubated at 37°C&#xD;
      for 3-4 days. Subsequently, clearing of the opacity by hydrolysis of precipitated albumin&#xD;
      will be recorded. The C. albicans SC 5314 strain will be used as positive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Biofilm formation (BF) A 100μl volume of 1 x 106 cells /ml suspension will&#xD;
      be place on sterile, polystyrene, flat-bottom 96-well microtitre plates and will be incubated&#xD;
      for 48 h at 37°C for adherence and biofilm. After 48 hr wells will be washed with PBS and a&#xD;
      semi-qualitative measure of biofilm will be detected by XTT [2,3-bis&#xD;
      (2-methoxy-4nitro-5-sulfo-phenyl) - 2H - tetra-zolium-5-carboxanilide] -reduction assay A&#xD;
      colorimetric change in the XTT-reduction assay, a direct correlation of the metabolic&#xD;
      activity of the biofilm, will then be measure in a microtiter plate reader at 490 nm after 2&#xD;
      hr of incubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antifungal susceptibility testing of isolates Antifungal susceptibility for voriconazole&#xD;
      fluconazole and clotrimazole will be performed by disk diffusion method as per the CLSI&#xD;
      M44-A2 recommendation on the yeast isolates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B). Pro- Inflammatory cytokines study Sample collection of oral secretions from lesion Four&#xD;
      Sterile PVA ophthalmic sponges (Merocel) will be used to collect samples of oral secretions&#xD;
      for four pro-inflammatory cytokine study from the oral lesion (other than biopsy site). This&#xD;
      is a non- invasive method and makes it site -specific which is an advantage over other serum&#xD;
      and saliva estimations. In addition, assessment of local cytokine levels via longitudinal&#xD;
      sampling in patients undergoing antifungal therapy in OL may allow for an understanding of&#xD;
      the temporal nature of cytokine elevation and clinical response to antifungals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure will be done for both the study group and control group. The subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to abstain from eating, drinking and rinsing the mouth at least 2 hours prior to&#xD;
      sampling. The sponges will be pre-wet with sterile normal saline, kept in contact with the&#xD;
      lesion without rubbing or movement or 1 minute and then immediately stored in sterile&#xD;
      containers at -80 °C till further analysis in Biochemistry department AIIMS. A photographic&#xD;
      and clinical record of the sample site will be kept with the patient proforma for future&#xD;
      reference. This procedure will be repeated at the same site after antifungal therapy for&#xD;
      study group and a photographic record will be kept for comparison. Ethical clearance from&#xD;
      Institute ethics board will be taken. Informed written consent will be obtained and&#xD;
      information regarding the study would be given to the study subjects and controls prior&#xD;
      sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα levels by ELISA The opthalmic sponges (Merocel )&#xD;
      will be thawed at room temperature for 10 min. Sponges will then be inserted into a&#xD;
      microcentrifuge tube containing a 0.2 μm filter (SpinX centrifuge tube), equilibrated by&#xD;
      adding 300 μl of extraction buffer and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by&#xD;
      centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. After centrifugation, the resultant&#xD;
      supernatant will be collected for the estimation of IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα levels by&#xD;
      ELISA method with commercially available kits. The supernatant will be stored at -80 °C until&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monoclonal antibody against the antigens (IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα) has been pre-coated&#xD;
      onto the wells of the microtiter strips provided. Antigens present in the sample or standard&#xD;
      will be incubated with the plates to allow binding of antigens to the antibody. This is&#xD;
      followed by the addition of a primary monoclonal anti- IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα antibody&#xD;
      respectively conjugated to biotin in respective microtiter plates. An avidin-HRP conjugated&#xD;
      antibody specific for primary antibody will then be added to the wells. After incubation and&#xD;
      following a wash, to remove any unbound antibody enzyme reagent, a TMB one-step substrate&#xD;
      reagent reactive with HRP will be added to the wells. The color development will be&#xD;
      terminated by adding acid and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. A reference curve will be&#xD;
      obtained by plotting the different concentrations of standard samples versus absorbance and&#xD;
      levels of the antigens in samples tested will be calculated by its standard plot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antifungal therapy The study group will be treated with antifungal therapy ( Tab Fluconazole&#xD;
      100 mg as a mouthwash ( tablet dissolved in 10 ml of drinking water and used as a rinse for 2&#xD;
      minute and swallowed) once a day for 14 days). The procedure will be demonstrated to each&#xD;
      study subject before starting the treatment. The oral burning sensation and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of the lesions with intraoral photographs will be recorded after antifungal&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of candida phenotypes, virulence attributes and antifungal sensitivity in&#xD;
      the study and control groups would be correlated with levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα&#xD;
      and clinicopathological characteristics. Correlations between virulence factors and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics will be determined. Cohens kappa statistic will be used to determine&#xD;
      intraobserver reliability. A comparison of the levels of pro inflammatory cytokines(IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα) before and after antifungal therapy will be done in the study group.&#xD;
      The results would be tested for statistical significance.The Chi- square and the Mann-&#xD;
      Whitney U tests will be used to estimate the statistical significance of difference observed&#xD;
      between the groups.&#xD;
