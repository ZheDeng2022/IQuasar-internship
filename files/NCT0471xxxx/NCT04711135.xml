  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and dosimetry of&#xD;
      Lutathera in adolescent patients 12 to &lt;18 years old with somatostatin receptor positive&#xD;
      GEP-NETs and PPGLs. The study will enroll at least 8 patients in the GEP-NET cohort and as&#xD;
      many adolescents with PPGL as possible in the exploratory PPGL cohort.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study schedule for each patient consists of the screening period (up to 2 weeks) followed&#xD;
      by the treatment period (4 treatment administrations at 8-week interval), and the follow-up&#xD;
      period (5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period will consist of 4 Lutathera treatments administered at 8-week intervals.&#xD;
      Lutathera administration will occur on Week 1 Day 1 of each cycle. Each patient will receive&#xD;
      a total of 4 doses of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 weeks;&#xD;
      cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi). An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA)&#xD;
      solution will be co-administered with each Lutathera dose for renal protection according to&#xD;
      the approved Lutathera local prescribing information. An antiemetic will be administered&#xD;
      prior to infusion of the AA solution for prevention of infusion-related nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosimetry and PK assessments will be performed during the first week after the 1st&#xD;
      Lutathera dose, i.e. one time during the study treatment period for each patient. The&#xD;
      dosimetry analysis will allow for estimation from the 1st Lutathera administration of the&#xD;
      cumulative absorbed radiation dose from 4 Lutathera doses and also for taking a decision on&#xD;
      the next dose levels. In the exceptional circumstances when dosimetry cannot be performed in&#xD;
      a particular patient after the first Lutathera dose, it should be completed as soon as&#xD;
      feasible upon a later dose. In order to minimize risk for each study subject, an accelerated&#xD;
      analysis of dosimetry and safety data will be performed for each patient in the study, to&#xD;
      enable the Investigator to take a decision for the subsequent Lutathera doses. The results of&#xD;
      dosimetry assessments (imaging and blood dosimetry) will be provided to the investigators for&#xD;
      their evaluation prior to administration of subsequent therapeutic cycles in each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total follow-up period of 5 years (60 months) after the last Lutathera dose will take place&#xD;
      for each patient who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This follow-up period will be&#xD;
      comprised of a short-term follow-up of 6 months to evaluate cumulative Lutathera toxicities,&#xD;
      followed by a long-term follow up of another 54 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also operate in the study to&#xD;
      evaluate accumulating safety and dosimetry data, to ensure the safety of adolescents enrolled&#xD;
      in the study, and to provide recommendations to investigators as well as to the clinical team&#xD;
      in charge of conducting the study.&#xD;
