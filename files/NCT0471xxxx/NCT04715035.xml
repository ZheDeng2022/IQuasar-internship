  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frozen shoulder is a musculoskeletal condition with a strong negative impact on activities of&#xD;
      daily living, producing pain, disability, anxiety, and sleep disorders. It has a worldwide&#xD;
      prevalence of 5.3%, increasing from 10 to 38% in patients with diabetes and thyroid&#xD;
      conditions. This clinical entity manifests itself mainly in women between 40 and 65 years of&#xD;
      age. Its resolution time is long and can reach 42 months with symptoms that persist&#xD;
      throughout life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical evaluation, patients with Frozen Shoulder are manifested mainly by presenting&#xD;
      mobility deficits. Previous studies described different structural alterations that may&#xD;
      justify this clinical condition and its consequences, such as, for example, fibrosis of the&#xD;
      coracohumeral ligament, alterations of the rotator interval, and of the axillary recess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although passive structures are believed to be primarily involved in this condition, A series&#xD;
      of five cases in which patients with frozen shoulder presented a significant increase in&#xD;
      mobility after a general anesthetic block. The data obtained from this study and the&#xD;
      different complications presented by patients with CH suggest that it is necessary to further&#xD;
      understand the role of the rotator cuff in this clinical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eccentric exercises consist of contracting the muscle to control or decelerate a load while&#xD;
      the muscle or tendon is lengthening or remaining stretched. This intervention has been&#xD;
      proposed for the treatment of tendinopathies in different body regions.&#xD;

    <measure>Perceived Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>European Quality of Life Scale of five domains (EQ5D-3L). This scale has five items with a score between 1 to 3. When the score is more close to 3 worst is the quality of life and when is approximate to 1, it is better in each item. Also has a visual analogue scale of 100 points to assess the health condition, when the score is more close to 0 worst is the quality of life and when is approximate to 100 it is better.</description>
