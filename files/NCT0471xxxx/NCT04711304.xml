    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intraarticular injection&#xD;
      of umbilical cord derived Wharton's Jelly compared to hyaluronic acid and saline for&#xD;
      treatment of knee osteoarthritis symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder in the United States (US), affecting&#xD;
      approximately 12% (~30 million) of US adults aged between 25 and 74 years. By 2030, the&#xD;
      number of US adults with arthritis is expected to reach 67 million leading to continuous&#xD;
      increase in number of total knee replacement surgeries. While total knee replacement&#xD;
      surgeries have shown advantages, avoiding or delaying surgery appears desirable, both from&#xD;
      medical and health care system perspective. Lowering the number of total knee replacement&#xD;
      surgeries will also lead to a reduced number of costly revision surgeries. Published studies&#xD;
      have also demonstrated that the outcomes after total knee replacement surgeries for patients&#xD;
      with Grade II or III knee OA (on Kellgren-Lawrence scale) are worse compared to patients with&#xD;
      Grade IV OA. Additionally, conventional treatment modalities including activity modification,&#xD;
      physical therapy, pharmacological agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, viscosupplementation and narcotics have limitations and potential&#xD;
      side effects. Thus, there is a need for alternative intervention for patients with Grade II&#xD;
      or III knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interest in the use of biologics for regenerative medicine applications has increased over&#xD;
      the last decade. To be compliant in the United States (U.S.), biologics that adhere to the&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and&#xD;
      Tissue-Based Products (HCT/P's) regulated under title 21, part 1271 of the Code of Federal&#xD;
      Regulations (CFR) must meet all the conditions under section 361 of Public Health Safety&#xD;
      (PHS) Act to be regulated solely under this section. According to this regulation, HCT/P's&#xD;
      must meet the criteria of being minimally manipulated, for homologous use only, not to be&#xD;
      combination products, to have no systemic effect, and to be non-dependent on the metabolic&#xD;
      activity of the living cells. Despite increased use, there is insufficient literature&#xD;
      assessing the amount of growth factors (GF), cytokines (CK), hyaluronic acid (HA) and&#xD;
      extracellular vesicles (EV) including exosomes present in these products, and more&#xD;
      specifically, umbilical cord derived Wharton's Jelly. In addition, there is limited or no&#xD;
      literature assessing the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord derived Wharton's Jelly&#xD;
      products via a randomized, controlled, multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the insufficient literature assessing the presence and quantity of GF, CK, HA and&#xD;
      EV including exosomes, investigators formulated a novel umbilical cord derived Wharton's&#xD;
      Jelly product and evaluated it for the presence of these factors. The results from this study&#xD;
      demonstrated that the essential components of regenerative medicine, namely GF, CK, HA and&#xD;
      EV, are all present in large quantities in the formulated Wharton's Jelly. This study was an&#xD;
      essential preliminary step to better characterize this Wharton's Jelly formulation before&#xD;
      performing clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy of this novel formulation for&#xD;
      regenerative medicine applications including for providing symptomatic relief to patients&#xD;
      with Grade II or III knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraarticular&#xD;
      injection of umbilical cord derived Wharton's Jelly for treatment of knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      symptoms. Investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference in patients receiving&#xD;
      injection of umbilical cord derived Wharton's Jelly, HA or saline with respect to safety.&#xD;
      Investigators also hypothesize that patients receiving intraarticular injection of Wharton's&#xD;
      Jelly will show an improvement in their overall satisfaction, Numeric Pain rating Scale&#xD;
      (NPRS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and cartilage formation over a&#xD;
      period of 1 year compared to the baseline visit. Our null hypothesis is that there is no&#xD;
      difference in patients receiving either Wharton's Jelly, hyaluronic acid or saline; and no&#xD;
      difference between the baseline and after-treatment within each treatment group over a period&#xD;
      of 1 year.&#xD;
