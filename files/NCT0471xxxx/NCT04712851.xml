  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of pembrolizumab on cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasia. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Proportion of subjects with pathologic complete response (no evidence of dysplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in subjects with cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasia (CIN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Proportion of subjects with pathologic partial response (regression to a lower grade of&#xD;
      dysplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluation of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in CIN lesions as a biomarker&#xD;
      of response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluation of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) status as a biomarker of response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluation of HPV clearance as a surrogate endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 6 weeks for 4 cycles (24 weeks).&#xD;

               -  Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy&#xD;
                  test and the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or&#xD;
