  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I open-label dose escalation study is conducted in two stages with a primary&#xD;
      endpoint to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FT538 when administered with&#xD;
      daratumumab in patients 12 years and older with advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and&#xD;
      related myeloid diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FT538 is an off the shelf product comprised of allogeneic natural killer (NK)-cell&#xD;
      immunotherapy lacking CD38 and expressing hnCD16 and IL-15RF. Daratumumab is a targeted&#xD;
      therapy (IgG1k human monoclonal antibody) that targets CD38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FT538 is administered once a week for 3 consecutive weeks (Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15). Up to 5&#xD;
      dose levels will be tested. Fixed dose subcutaneous daratumumab is given on Day -12 and Day 5&#xD;
      prior to the NK cells as lymphodepletion, and on Day +3, Day +10, and Day +17 to maximize&#xD;
      targeting. A short course of outpatient lymphodepleting chemotherapy is given on Day -4 and&#xD;
      Day -3 to promote adoptive transfer. Day 1, the day of the 1st FT538 infusion, must be a&#xD;
      Monday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis for Phase I is intent-to-treat in that all patients receiving the 1st&#xD;
      infusion of FT538 are evaluable for toxicity and efficacy. Patients who discontinue therapy&#xD;
      prior to the first FT538 will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are five potential FT538 dose cohorts. The starting dose is FT538 1x10e8 cells per dose&#xD;
      with a lower safety dose of 5x10e7 if needed (Dose Level -1). The subsequent planned FT538&#xD;
      cohorts are 3x10e8, 1x10e9, and 1.5 x10e9 FT538 cells per dose. Dosing is based on hnCD16&#xD;
      expression, where 90% ± 10% of administered FT538 cells express hnCD16. The trial is&#xD;
      conducted with no intra-patient escalation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is performed in two stages, with Stage 1 having two potential steps. A minimum of 28 days separates each patient cohort. Stage 1 step 1 uses a fast-track design (1 patient per cohort) starting at Dose Level 1. The study moves to Stage 1 Step 2 when a pre-defined adverse event occurs during fast-track enrollment, specifically, any Grade 3 non-hematologic event within 72 hours after an FT538 infusion. The cohort size increases from 1 to 3 patients with 2 additional patients added to the current cohort if the event being a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) event. No intra-cohort staggering is required. Escalation in Step 2 continues until the 1st DLT event at which point Stage 2 (CRM) is activated. Stage 2 follows Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and is initiated at the 1st DLT</intervention_model_description>
