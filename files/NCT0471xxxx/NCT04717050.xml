      This study is about testing whether exercise will improve fitness and lessen risk factors&#xD;
      related to heart disease, diabetes, and obesity in Latina breast cancer survivors.&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied. The purpose of this research is to determine whether a 16-week exercise program will&#xD;
      improve fitness and lessen risk factors related to coronary artery disease, stroke, and type&#xD;
      2 diabetes in patients who have breast cancer and is sustainable for a Latina population to&#xD;
      incorporate into their lifestyle following completion of the 16-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned into one of the study groups:&#xD;
      Progressive Combine Training (PCT) or Attention Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progressive combined training (PCT) will be performed in 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. supervised 16-week resistance and cardiovascular exercise at a local YMCA (months&#xD;
                1-4) or remotely at home via Zoom.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. unsupervised 16-week resistance and cardiovascular exercise at a local YMCA (months&#xD;
                5-8) or remotely at home with weekly check-ins with trainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attention Control Group: 51 weeks home-based stretching&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo seven blood draws and participate in nine testing visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is expected to last 12 months for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 160 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Cancer Society is supporting this research study by providing funding for the&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
