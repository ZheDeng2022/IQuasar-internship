      After approval from the graduate committee permission will be obtained from the higher&#xD;
      authorities of the naval anchorage badminton club islamabad. Purpose of this study will be&#xD;
      explained to the all participants written informed consent will be obtained.participants will&#xD;
      recive 6 weeks intervention with a generic warm up consisting of ten body weight squats,ten&#xD;
      forward lunges each side and 3 mintues of dynamic stretching of relevant lower extremity&#xD;
      muscles. The agility t-test will be used to measure and seargent vertical jump test will be&#xD;
      used to measure vertical jump.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Agility T-test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The T-Test is a simple running test of agility, involving forward, lateral, and backward movements, appropriate to a wide range of sports.&#xD;
Equipment required: marker cones, measurement tape, stopwatch, non-slip surface.&#xD;
Pre-test: Explain the test procedures to the subject. Perform screening of health risks and obtain informed consent. Prepare forms and record basic information such as age, height, gender, test conditions. Measure and mark out the test area. Perform an appropriate warm-up.&#xD;
Procedure: The subject starts at cone A. On the command of the timer, the subject sprints to cone B and touches the base of the cone with their right hand. They then turn left and shuffle sideways to cone C, and also touches its base, this time with their left hand. Then shuffling sideways to the right to cone D and touching the base with the right hand. They then shuffle back to cone B touching with the left hand, and run backwards to cone A. The stopwatch stopped as they pass cone A</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vertical Jump Test (Sargent Jump)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test is designed to measure lower limb explosive power by measuring the height a client is able to jump.&#xD;
Equipment required: measuring tape, chalk for marking wall Description / procedure: The person stands side on to a wall and reaches up with the hand closest to the wall. Keeping the feet flat on the ground, the point of the fingertips is marked or recorded. This is called the standing reach. The person puts chalk on their fingertips to mark the wall at the height of their jump. The person then stands away from the wall, and jumps vertically as high as possible using both arms and legs to assist in projecting the body upwards. Attempt to touch the wall at the highest point of the jump. The difference in distance between the standing reach height and the jump height is the score. The best of three attempts is recorded.</description>
