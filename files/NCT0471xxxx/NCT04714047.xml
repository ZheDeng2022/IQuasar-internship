  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate the efficacy of 12&#xD;
      weeks of progressive resistance training (PRT) compared to neuromuscular exercise (NEMEX) on&#xD;
      functional performance in patients with hip OA measured by the 30-seconds chair stand test.&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to investigate; the determinants of improvement in physical function&#xD;
      following PRT or NEMEX; the effectiveness of booster sessions in prolonging the effects of&#xD;
      the initial interventions (12 months), the cost-effectiveness of booster sessions (12 months)&#xD;
      and changes in articular cartilage after PRT or NEMEX (12 months). We will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that PRT is superior to NEMEX in improving physical function measured with the 30s&#xD;
      sit-to-stand test at 12 week follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will be a multicenter trial involving hospitals and&#xD;
      physiotherapy clinics across Denmark. Part 1: For the initial 12-week exercise intervention,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into two groups: PRT or NEMEX. Part 2: After the initial&#xD;
      intervention, participants in each group will be randomized to booster sessions (PRT+B and&#xD;
      NEMEX+B) or to receive no further treatment (PRT-B and NEMEX-B). Booster sessions will be&#xD;
      provided at 4, 6, 8 and 10 months after baseline. Outcomes will be measured at baseline,&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of intervention, and at 6- and 12-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise interventions will be performed at the collaborating hospitals and physiotherapy&#xD;
      clinics across Denmark. All sessions will be conducted in group sessions with one&#xD;
      physiotherapist supervising the exercises. The duration and frequency of the interventions&#xD;
      will be 12 weeks with 2 supervised sessions each week. If participants experience pain during&#xD;
      exercise exceeding 5 out of 10 on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the physiotherapist will&#xD;
      modify the exercise, decreasing the exercise intensity (load) or modifying the range of&#xD;
      motion. All unilateral exercises will be performed for both sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NEMEX intervention will follow the NEMEX program as described by Ageberg et al. The&#xD;
      sessions consist of a 10-minute submaximal warm up on an exercise bike followed by 50 minutes&#xD;
      of NEMEX training with exercises focused on stability, postural function, postural&#xD;
      orientation, lower extremity muscle strength, and functional exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PRT intervention will follow the same protocol for training frequency and duration as the&#xD;
      NEMEX intervention. The sessions consist of a 10-minute submaximal warm up on an exercise&#xD;
      bike followed by 50 minutes of PRT with exercises targeting the muscles of the hip and knee&#xD;
      joints; leg press, hip extension, hip abduction, hip flexion and knee extension.&#xD;
