    <textblock>
      This study is to explore the progression-free survival time (PFS) , overall survival time&#xD;
      (OS), quality of life and side effects between two different clinical target volumes in the&#xD;
      treatment of 3D printing template-assisted CT-guided radioactive iodine-125 seeds&#xD;
      implantation for recurrent rectal cancer after surgery and radiotherapy and investigate the&#xD;
      clinical and dosimetric prognosis factors for outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      From June 2019 to December 2020 in each participating center, patients with recurrent rectal&#xD;
      cancer after surgery and radiotherapy will be included in the study if they meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria. According to the clinical&#xD;
      conditions of the patients, they will be assigned to groups A or B according to the doctor's&#xD;
      recommendations and their own wishes. GTV of both groups are visible tumors. The CTV of group&#xD;
      A is expanded by 3mm on the basis of GTV, and the CTV of group B is expanded by 6mm. Both&#xD;
      groups A and B received prescription dose: 95% GTV (120-160) Gy, 95% CTV (90-120) Gy. The&#xD;
      activities of 125I seeds will be 0.4mCi-0.7mCi. All patients will receive 3D printed&#xD;
      template-assisted 125I seeds implantation and be followed up. The differences in local&#xD;
      progression-free survival time, overall survival time, change of quality of life, and side&#xD;
      effects between different groups will be prospectively analyzed.&#xD;
