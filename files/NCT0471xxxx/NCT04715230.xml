  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this multisite Phase 2a study is that IXT-m200 will be well-tolerated in&#xD;
      patients with acute mild to moderate METH toxicity. A randomized, open label design will be&#xD;
      used in which one dose of IXT-m200 will be compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU).&#xD;
      Approximately 40 participants will be enrolled in 4 cohorts. A dose escalation approach will&#xD;
      be used so that progressively higher IXT-m200 doses will be evaluated in each cohort. In&#xD;
      conjunction with safety monitoring, this design assures the opportunity to observe early&#xD;
      safety findings before any participants are exposed to the next higher dose. The&#xD;
      randomization ratio for IXT-m200 versus TAU is defined as 4:1 for each cohort so that the&#xD;
      number of participants receiving TAU equals the number receiving each dose of IXT-m200 at the&#xD;
      end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agitation scales and vital signs will be recorded to track effect of the antibody treatment&#xD;
      versus TAU over time on agitation associated with METH use. While in the emergency department&#xD;
      (ED), detailed and pertinent medical and psychiatric histories, and physical exam will be&#xD;
      obtained, along with laboratory assessments and ECGs. In the ED, participants will give blood&#xD;
      samples for analysis of METH and IXT-m200 concentrations and followed for development of&#xD;
      adverse events. Participants will be evaluated at 2 days and 4 weeks after discharge from the&#xD;
      ED for adverse events and drug use history. Cohort escalation reviews will be performed by&#xD;
      the Sponsor, Medical Monitor, and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) between cohorts and&#xD;
      the next group will not start until after completion of this review.&#xD;

    <description>IXT-m200 is a high-affinity chimeric anti-METH monoclonal antibody that is well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and in non-intoxicated people with METH use disorder. The total dose will be given over 10 min for the 0.5-g dose and over 20 min for the 1-, 1.5-, and 2-g doses.</description>

    <description>IXT-m200 binds METH with high selectivity and affinity. The product contains a murine METH-binding variable region and the constant domains of a human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2Îº. This antibody isotype was chosen because of the lower risk of immune response compared to an IgG1 or IgG3. IXT-m200 targets METH, does not rely on binding to any endogenous target for its action, and has been well-tolerated in previous clinical studies.</description>
