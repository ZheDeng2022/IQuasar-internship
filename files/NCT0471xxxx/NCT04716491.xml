    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing treatment for heart disease through percutaneous interventions admitted&#xD;
      to intensive care units often suffer from sleep deprivation, with multifactorial factors&#xD;
      being the precursors of this problem. Sleep deprivation has a negative impact on&#xD;
      rehabilitation, with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, implementing&#xD;
      non-pharmacological measures for this population is essential for better quality care, as&#xD;
      well as more satisfactory experiences. The Objectives are to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention that includes the use of eye masks and hearing protectors&#xD;
      has an influence on the quality of sleep of patients undergoing percutaneous interventions&#xD;
      for the treatment of heart diseases admitted to the intensive care unit, to compare the&#xD;
      quality of sleep between patients according to sociodemographic and clinical variables and to&#xD;
      identify whether anxiety is a factor associated with sleep quality in patients undergoing&#xD;
      percutaneous interventions for the treatment of heart disease in patients admitted to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit. Randomized clinical trial blinded to the steps of data collection and&#xD;
      data analysis, with two groups of participants in which the intervention with eye masks and&#xD;
      ear protectors will be evaluated. The inclusion criteria in the study will be patients&#xD;
      undergoing percutaneous intervention treatment for heart disease over the age of 18,&#xD;
      preserved communication skills and understanding. The study site will be a cardiac intensive&#xD;
      care unit in a private hospital of high complexity in the city of São Paulo. The intervention&#xD;
      will be carried out during the period of hospitalization in the intensive care unit, by&#xD;
      nurses trained by the researcher from 9 pm until the patient awakens, and variables related&#xD;
      to sleep quality, anxiety, pain, delirium and length of stay will be collected. in bed. The&#xD;
      sample will consist of 80 patients divided into two groups (intervention and control) and the&#xD;
      data will be analyzed with descriptive statistics, with Student t test and Mann Whitney test&#xD;
      for comparison between groups and with Chi-square test and Spearman for analysis of&#xD;
      categorical variables. . Relative risk, odds ratio will be calculated and the level of&#xD;
      significance adopted will be 5%. It is intended to know if the non-pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention brings benefits to reduce sleep deprivation and contributes to better clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      The intervention to promote sleep in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention to treat&#xD;
      cardiac disorders admitted to the ICU will be the use of ear protectors and eye masks. The&#xD;
      purpose of the intervention is to promote sleep in this population by reducing noise and&#xD;
      light in the Intensive Care Unit environment. The devices used will be the use of black silk&#xD;
      masks with elastic for protection of the eyes against light and a silicone ear protector to&#xD;
      reduce environmental noise. The procedure will consist of the following steps: application of&#xD;
      the free and informed consent form, sleep assessment instruments, trait and state anxiety and&#xD;
      collection of sociodemographic and clinical data and randomization in the arms of the study&#xD;
      at the patient's admission to the ICU, guidance on the use of devices from 21 hours and until&#xD;
      awakening, measurement of noise and brightness at the time of placing the devices,&#xD;
      application of the visual sleep scale in the morning during the physical examination, note&#xD;
      every two hours on a specific form whether the patient remains with the devices. These steps&#xD;
      will be performed by the interventionist nurses who will be trained by the main researcher&#xD;
      and will approach the patients in the inpatient unit or in the Intensive Care Unit after&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be applied only in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, and after discharge&#xD;
      from the ICU, patients will be able to use it if they want the devices to sleep.&#xD;

    <description>When they meet the inclusion criteria and accept to participate in the study, the interventionist nurse will explain to the patient the objectives and protocol of the study, apply the consent form and the instruments for assessing sleep (pittsburgh), trait and state anxiety (STAI). Then the software will be randomized and after defining the group, the nurse will guide the patient on the use of the devices from 9:00 am until the final awakening in the morning. Control group participants will only complete the assessment instruments. Noise and brightness will be measured at randomization of participants. The following morning, the visual sleep scale and the sleepiness scale will be applied for both groups, in addition to filling in information regarding the length of time the devices stay with patients at night and the clinical data that will be collected until discharge from the hospital. ICU, when independent of the group, the state anxiety instrument will be applied.</description>
