  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial studies if contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using a contrast&#xD;
      agent, perflutren lipid microspheres (Definity), can predict the early response of breast&#xD;
      cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy by estimating the pressure gradient between the breast&#xD;
      cancer and surrounding tissues. To estimate the pressures noninvasively, subharmonic (half of&#xD;
      fundamental frequency) aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) using CEUS will be utilized. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that the subharmonic signal difference in the tumor relative to the&#xD;
      normal tissue can predict breast cancer NAC response after 10% of therapy regimen.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To apply and evaluate a novel biomarker from 3-dimensional subharmonic aided pressure&#xD;
      estimation (3D SHAPE) to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response in patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether the accuracy of 3D SHAPE for predicting NAC response varies with breast&#xD;
      cancer subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with Definity (perflutren lipid&#xD;
      microspheres) intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes before NAC, after 10% (1-2 cycles) of&#xD;
      NAC, and after 30% (2-4 cycles) of NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at the completion of NAC.&#xD;

    <description>The SHAPE results from three time points will be compared to the patients' clinical response as well as pathological response. The imaging response outcome will be determined by the tumor size reduction percentage. We will use a threshold value of 90% to differentiate the responders from partial/non-responders. MRI baseline images before and after the completion of the NAC will be acquired if available. If a patient's MRIs are not available, 3D measurements from ultrasound images will be utilized. A subject who drops out of the study during the therapy, due to the progression of disease, will be considered as a non-responder. The pathologic response will be evaluated with a 5-point grading scale: no therapeutic effect (grade 1), minimal therapeutic effect (grade 2), moderated therapeutic effect with invasive tumor or vascular invasion (grade 3), marked therapeutic effect with no/minimal invasive tumor (grade 4), or complete therapeutic effect with no invasive disease (grade 5).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of prediction accuracy of SHAPE based on breast cancer subtype</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to study completion (48 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of SHAPE to predict the patients' clinical and pathological outcomes will be compared among breast cancer subtypes. We will determine the patients' clinical and pathological outcomes in the same way for the primary outcome measure. Based on the collected tumor information after surgery, ER, PR, HER2 and ki-67 will be used to divide breast cancers treated with NAC into 4 subtypes: luminal A (ER+, PR+, HER2-, and ki-67â‰¤14%), luminal B (ER+, PR+, HER2- and ki-67&gt;14%; ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+), HER2-overexpression (ER-, PR- and HER2+) and triple-negative (ER-, PR-, and HER2-). The ability of the SHAPE method to distinguish responders from non-responders will be compared between breast cancer subtypes using ROC analysis.</description>
