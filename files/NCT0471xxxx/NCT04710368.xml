  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of evolocumab on coronary plaque morphology&#xD;
      using intravascular imaging and gene expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMC) in patients with stable CAD on maximally tolerated statin therapy. The study&#xD;
      combines multi-modality intravascular imaging approaches and transcriptomic based machine&#xD;
      learning algorithms to uncover molecular mechanisms responsible for the beneficial changes in&#xD;
      atherosclerotic lesions of patients treated with evolocumab. The primary end-points are the&#xD;
      changes from baseline to follow-up in (1) the minimal fibrous cap thickness (FCT) assessed by&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) and (2) maxLCBI4mm assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      (NIRS) after 26 weeks of evolocumab. The secondary endpoints are the changes in (1) the&#xD;
      maximal lipid arc, lipid length, lipid volume index, macrophage accumulation and&#xD;
      calcification by OCT; (2) PAV and TAV defined by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and (3)&#xD;
      Changes in PBMC gene expression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The single center single arm study will be performed in the Cardiac Catheterization&#xD;
      laboratory of the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY. After informed consent, patients&#xD;
      undergoing clinically indicated elective PCI with a non-obstructive lesion and optimal&#xD;
      background statin therapy will be eligible screening. Non-obstructive lesions (30-50%&#xD;
      stenosis) identified by angiography in a non-culprit vessel with lipid-rich plaque will be&#xD;
      studied. Subjects will receive evolocumab (Repatha) 140 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks for&#xD;
      26 weeks. Serial NIRS/IVUS and OCT imaging will be performed in the non-obstructive lesions,&#xD;
      first during PCI and subsequently after 26 weeks. A total of 25ml of blood will be drawn from&#xD;
      the sheath during angiography for transcriptomic profiling of PBMC.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study team will screen patients scheduled for elective PCI, who are receiving statin therapy for at least 4 weeks with acceptable LDL-C levels. Patients with non-obstructive lesion (30-50% stenosis) by angiography and lipid-rich plaque with lipid arc &gt;90° and minimal fibrous cap thickness ≤ 120 µm detected by OCT will comprise the final study population. Serial NIRS/IVUS and OCT imaging will be performed in a non-target lesions, first during PCI and subsequently after 26 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
