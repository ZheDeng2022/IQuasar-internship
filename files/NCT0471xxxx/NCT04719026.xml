  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart attack remains a major cause of death in adult population worldwide and especially&#xD;
      within Scotland. A large portion of the general population has an increased risk of suffering&#xD;
      from a heart attack because of their genetic make-up, disease profile and lifestyle choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature suggests that apart from these known risk factors, long-standing inflammation&#xD;
      (reaction of tissues to infection or injury) elsewhere in the body may be responsible for&#xD;
      heart attacks. It has been suggested that gum disease may be one such condition. If left&#xD;
      untreated, gum disease may expose the entire body to a long-term inflammatory burden where&#xD;
      inflammatory molecules can disseminate from the gums into the bloodstream and affect various&#xD;
      body structures. This study explores the influence of gum disease on the risk of heart attack&#xD;
      by comparing the gum health of participants who recently had a heart attack to the gum health&#xD;
      of participants with no history of heart problems after accounting for other risk factors.&#xD;
      Findings will provide critical information for the design of our forthcoming study to&#xD;
      establish the effect of treatment of gum disease on the risk of heart attack, and its&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. Ultimately this research will tackle another risk factor for heart&#xD;
      attacks and thus inform enhancement of public health prevention strategies.&#xD;

      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a multifactorial condition leading to most cases of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and results from interaction of genetic, lifestyle and environmental&#xD;
      factors. However, as many as 50% of CAD patients lack classical risk factors of CAD&#xD;
      suggesting the presence of other contributory mechanisms. Inflammation plays a central role&#xD;
      in the initiation and growth of the plaques which form in the arteries (atherosclerosis) and&#xD;
      lead to CAD3. As such periodontal disease, an inflammatory process leading to progressive&#xD;
      destruction of tooth-supporting structures, has been associated with CAD. In vivo&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies have shown that bacteria associated with periodontal disease can&#xD;
      exacerbate atherosclerosis 7. Numerous clinical studies have explored the association between&#xD;
      periodontal disease and CAD at different follow-up times following episodes of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction 8-9. However, there are no reports investigating this association during the acute&#xD;
      phase of myocardial infarction. In addition the need for rigorous matching of all known CAD&#xD;
      risk factors in case control studies has so far been overseen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case-control study aims to compare the health of tooth supporting structures&#xD;
      (periodontium) in patients hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction to a control group of&#xD;
      patients rigorously matched for known CAD risk factors, age and gender.&#xD;
