  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the changes in the medial and lateral meniscus&#xD;
      extrusion of the knee joint before and after surgery using ultrasound in patients who undergo&#xD;
      medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy, and examine the differences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is an established treatment method for medial compartment&#xD;
      osteoarthritis with varus knee deformity in a relatively young patient group. Excellent&#xD;
      outcomes of HTO have been reported. However, about 10-30% of patients are not satisfied with&#xD;
      the results after surgery. After proximal tibial osteotomy, studies on the factors of&#xD;
      dissatisfaction have been actively conducted, but studies on the medial and lateral meniscus&#xD;
      extrusion, which can be the cause, are insufficient. The relationship between the prolapse of&#xD;
      the medial meniscus and articular cartilage is already well known and is known as an&#xD;
      important factor in the progression of arthritis. As such, the association between the knee&#xD;
      joint with meniscus extrusion and the general knee joint has been studied, but the effect on&#xD;
      the clinical outcome after proximal tibial osteotomy has not been studied. Therefore, in this&#xD;
      study, the investigators are planning to investigate the differences in clinical outcomes&#xD;
      such as the degree and change of medial and lateral meniscus extrusion through non-invasive&#xD;
      ultrasound examination before and after surgery in patients who undergo medial open proximal&#xD;
      tibial osteotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll the patients with knee medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee&#xD;
      joint who undergo open proximal tibial osteotomy. The degree of medial and lateral meniscus&#xD;
      extrusion will be measured through ultrasound measurements before and after surgery. Also,&#xD;
      demographic factors and radiographic measurements will be also investigated before and after&#xD;
      surgery. In addition, preoperative, postoperative 3, 6, and 1 year clinical results including&#xD;
      meniscus extrusion will be compared and judged, and the evaluation will be evaluated by an&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeon who has not participated in the operation among registered researchers.&#xD;
