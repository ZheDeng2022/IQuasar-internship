  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-viral treatment in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a Phase II, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      52-week trial using oral valacyclovir 4 g/day in 50 HSV seropositive, AD biomarker-positive,&#xD;
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients (eMCI and lMCI). The trial will directly&#xD;
      address the long-standing viral etiology hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which posits&#xD;
      that viruses, particularly the very common herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) and herpes simplex&#xD;
      virus-2 (HSV2), may be etiologic or contribute to the pathology of AD. This trial will&#xD;
      intervene at an earlier stage (MCI). We will compare the repurposed drug valacyclovir to&#xD;
      placebo in patients with amnestic MCI (eMCI and lMCI) in a randomized, double-blind, two-arm&#xD;
      parallel group 52-week pilot trial. Our Phase II trial will be the first antiviral drug trial&#xD;
      conducted in MCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many viruses are latent for decades before being reactivated in the brain by stress, immune&#xD;
      compromise, or other factors. After the initial oral infection, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1)&#xD;
      becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglion and can later enter the brain via retrograde axonal&#xD;
      transport, often targeting the temporal lobes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSV1 can also enter the brain via olfactory neurons directly. HSV1 (oral herpes) and HSV2&#xD;
      (genital herpes) are known to trigger amyloid aggregation and their DNA is commonly found in&#xD;
      amyloid plaques. Anti-HSV drugs reduce AÎ² and p-tau accumulation in brains of infected mice.&#xD;
      HSV1 reactivation is associated with tau hyperphosphorylation in mice and may play a role in&#xD;
      tau propagation across neurons. In humans, recurrent reactivation with newly produced HSV1&#xD;
      particles, 'drop by drop,' may produce neuronal damage and eventually lead to&#xD;
      neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, partly due to effects on amyloid&#xD;
      and tau. Clinical studies show cognitive impairment in HSV seropositive patients in different&#xD;
      patient groups and in healthy adults, and antiviral treatments show robust efficacy against&#xD;
      peripheral HSV infection. The study team will conduct the first-ever clinical trial to&#xD;
      directly address the long-standing viral etiology hypothesis of AD which posits that viruses,&#xD;
      particularly the very common HSV1 and HSV2, may be etiologic or contribute to the pathology&#xD;
      of AD.This trial will intervene at an earlier stage (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In AD biomarker positive patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (eMCI and lMCI) who test&#xD;
      positive for serum antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2, the generic antiviral drug valacyclovir will&#xD;
      be compared at oral doses of 4 grams per day, to matching placebo in the treatment of 50&#xD;
      patients (25 valacyclovir, 25 placebo) in a randomized, double-blind, 52-week Phase II proof&#xD;
      of concept trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with valacyclovir are hypothesized to show smaller decline in cognition and&#xD;
      functioning compared to placebo, and, using 18F-Florbetapir PET imaging, to show less amyloid&#xD;
      accumulation than placebo over the 52-week trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will explore apolipoprotein E e4 genotype as a moderator, and changes in global clinical&#xD;
      status, viral antibodies and proteomic assays, AD signature of MRI regional and whole brain&#xD;
      cortical thinning, and plasma total tau, p-tau epitopes and neurofilament light (Nfl) protein&#xD;
      markers for neurodegeneration as exploratory hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This innovative Phase II proof of concept trial clearly has exceptionally high reward&#xD;
      potential for the treatment of MCI.&#xD;

    <description>The ADCS-PACC combines four widely used paper-and-pencil cognitive tests. These include the list- learning task from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), as well as a paragraph- recall test from the Wechsler Memory Scale, both of which measure episodic memory. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale tests executive function. The final component, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), assesses global functioning and mental status. Scores range from -5 to +5 with higher scores indicating less deficit and lower scores indicating greater deficit.</description>
