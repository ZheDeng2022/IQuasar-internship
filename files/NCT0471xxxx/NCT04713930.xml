    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI = weight/height^2) between 18 and 30 kilogram per meter square&#xD;
             (kg/m^2) (inclusive), and body weight not less than 50 kilogram (kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12&#xD;
             lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (including QT interval corrected according to&#xD;
             Fridericia's formula [QTcF] less than or equal to [&lt;=] 450 millisecond [msec])&#xD;
             performed at screening. Minor abnormalities in ECG, which are not considered to be of&#xD;
             clinical significance by the investigator, are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal&#xD;
             reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the&#xD;
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be&#xD;
             appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be&#xD;
             recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure (after the participant supine for at least 5 minutes) 90 millimeter of&#xD;
             Mercury (mmHg) or more and less than 140 mmHg systolic, and less than 90 mmHg&#xD;
             diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are&#xD;
             permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the study and for a minimum of one spermatogenesis cycle (defined as&#xD;
             approximately 90 days) after receiving (the last dose of) study intervention, in&#xD;
             addition to the highly effective method of contraception, a man a) who is sexually&#xD;
             active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier method of&#xD;
             contraception (example, condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository), b)&#xD;
             who is sexually active with a woman who is pregnant must use a condom, c) must agree&#xD;
             not to donate sperm. In addition, recommended highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception in this study for female partners of male participants to use in&#xD;
             addition to the male participant wearing a condom include: a) oral hormonal&#xD;
             contraception, b) intrauterine device, c) intrauterine hormone-releasing system, and&#xD;
             d) bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or current clinically significant medical illness including (but not&#xD;
             limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease,&#xD;
             coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid&#xD;
             abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory&#xD;
             disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency, thyroid disease,&#xD;
             neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection or any other illness that the&#xD;
             investigator considers should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of the study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry, or&#xD;
             urinalysis at screening as deemed appropriate by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs, or 12 lead ECG at&#xD;
             screening as deemed appropriate by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-61393215 or its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Test positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies, hepatitis A&#xD;
             antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM), syphilis, hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) or&#xD;
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies at screening&#xD;
