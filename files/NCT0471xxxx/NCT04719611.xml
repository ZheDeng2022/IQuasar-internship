  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to detect the presence of various probiotic strains in vaginal swabs&#xD;
      of healthy women orally consuming a probiotic supplement for 4 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants recruited from the university community in the Southeast U.S. will participate&#xD;
      in a pilot, open-label interventional study for approximately 6 weeks following obtainment of&#xD;
      informed consent. Participants will be asked to maintain their usual diets with the exception&#xD;
      of probiotic supplements, probiotic fortified products or foods with added fiber supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of the study, participants will take part in a 1-week pre-baseline period&#xD;
      where they will begin daily questionnaires inquiring about gastrointestinal symptoms, stool&#xD;
      form and number, stress, and medications taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of the intervention period (Day 1), participants will self collect a&#xD;
      baseline vaginal swab sample, a skin swab, a vaginal pH swab, and a stool sample.&#xD;
      Participants will consume 2 capsules every morning and 2 capsules every evening for four&#xD;
      weeks (from D1 to D28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will self collect a vaginal swab sample, a skin swab, a vaginal pH swab, and a&#xD;
      stool sample at Day 14 and at Day 28. An additional vaginal swab sample will be collected at&#xD;
      Day 35 to assess for probiotic strains persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, participants will be instructed to return any unused&#xD;
      supplements to the study site.&#xD;
