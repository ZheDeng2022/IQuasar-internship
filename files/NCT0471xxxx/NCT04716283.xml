      Sleep is very necessary to our physical and mental health. Sleep is classified into&#xD;
      satisfactory and unsatisfactory sleep. Good sleep is sleep which is sufficient in duration&#xD;
      and has a good quality while bad sleep is the sleep which makes individual feels&#xD;
      unsatisfactory .&#xD;
&#xD;
      University students are exposed to poor sleep, due to high work and study loads. Poor quality&#xD;
      sleep has negative consequences on the daily life activities , associated with memory&#xD;
      reduction , reduced learning abilities which ultimately can lead to reduce their academic&#xD;
      achievements, and can also trigger negative health outcomes, such as mood disturbance,&#xD;
      fatigue, impaired concentration .&#xD;

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be measured after completion of the study ,approximately in october 2022.</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire will be used to measure sleep quality over the last 1 month .The self-related questions include the assessment of seven different sleep domains : sleep quality, sleep latency , sleep duration , habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances , use of sleeping medications , and daytime dysfunction .The seven components scores are then added to yield a global PSQI score in the range of zero to 21. The higher the score, the worse the sleep quality. A global score greater than five is diagnostic of poor sleep quality.</description>

    <time_frame>It will be measured after completion of the study ,approximately in octuber 2022.</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire will be used to measure daytime sleepiness .It can determine the chance of falling asleep in 8 different circumstances. ESS score can range from 0 to 24. A global score greater than ten is diagnostic of excessive daytime sleepiness .</description>

    <intervention_name>Validated questionnaire : The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</intervention_name>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score.&#xD;
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness .The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities.</description>
