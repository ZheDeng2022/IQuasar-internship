  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nivolumab is an approved treatment option for patients with previously treated advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC, based on the survival benefit shown versus docetaxel in randomized phase III trials in&#xD;
      second line. However, the profile of treatment and even patient outcomes are often different&#xD;
      in routine clinical practice than in a clinical trial setting. Furthermore, the financial&#xD;
      impact of an approved therapy is often largely unknown. This study will record the efficacy&#xD;
      and tolerability of Nivolumab in previously treated patients with NSCLC and describe the&#xD;
      treatment patterns and economic impact in real-world settings in Greece.&#xD;

      Patients with advanced NSCLC who had received nivolumab as 2nd line and beyond, between&#xD;
      October 2015 and November 2019, in HeCOG clinical centres in Greece, were enrolled.&#xD;
      Information regarding detailed patient and treatment characteristics including post-nivolumab&#xD;
      therapies, efficacy, and safety data of nivolumab treatment and additionally data on costs&#xD;
      and other economic values are collected, analysed and compared with historical data in order&#xD;
      to describe the real-world patterns of Nivolumab use in 2nd line NSCLC therapy in Greece.&#xD;
