    <textblock>
      In France, cervical cancer screening is based on a cervical smear for women aged 25 to 30&#xD;
      years and on High Risk- HPV (HR-HPV) testing for women aged 30 to 65 years. One of the main&#xD;
      concerns in France is poor attendance to this screening program, up to 40% of women, which&#xD;
      led French Health Authorities to implement population-based organized cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening (DO CCU), based on remind letters, starting in 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project is a complementary strategy to DO CCU based on direct proposal of a vaginal&#xD;
      self-sample device for HR-HPV testing to non-attendee women while attending health care&#xD;
      centers. Our hypothesis is that contacting under-screened women directly and proposing them a&#xD;
      self-sample device to be used at home will increase their participation to cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be held in the Departments of Hérault and Aude, which are among those in&#xD;
      the region of Occitanie (south of France) with the lowest participation to cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women aged 50 to 65 years with no cervical smear and/or gynecological examination for more&#xD;
      than three years, will be recruited in two sites: in a mobile unit for breast cancer&#xD;
      screening implemented in the whole Department of Hérault and in a Medical and Social Care&#xD;
      located in a particularly deprived area of Aude (Limoux-Quillan). In each site, non&#xD;
      attendee-women will be proposed by a trained mid-wife, a vaginal self-sample device to&#xD;
      perform at home and send back by mail to the laboratory of the Hospital of Montpellier, which&#xD;
      will perform HR-HPV testing. Women with positive HR-HPV DNA test will be asked to perfom a&#xD;
      cervical smear and completion of follow-up will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate attendance of under-screened women to&#xD;
      vaginal self-sampling for cervical cancer screening, i.e. the number of women who accepted a&#xD;
      self-sample device among women to whom it has been proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second objective will be to analyse psycho-social factors associated with cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening in this population of non-attendee women, i.e. their socio-economic environment and&#xD;
      the way women perceive and are implicated in cervical cancer screening. This secondary&#xD;
      objective will be based on a specific questionnaire at recruitment and on semi-directive&#xD;
      phone interviews in a sub-group of women. The efficacy of this screening strategy (number of&#xD;
      women who performed vaginal self sample and sent it to the laboratory, and number of women&#xD;
      who completed follow-up in case of a positive HR-HPV test) will also be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of women to be recruited is 300 for each site. The total estimated duration of the&#xD;
      project is 48 months, including 24 months for women's recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results from this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An increase in participation to cervical cancer screening of non-attendee women aged 50&#xD;
           to 65 years in the Departments of Hérault and Aude.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women's education about cervical cancer screening through discussion with the midwife&#xD;
           during recruitment and information tools developed for the project&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information of local health staff and community-based associations about cervical cancer&#xD;
           screening and the place of HR-HPV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of psycho-social factors and potential barriers to compliance to cervical&#xD;
           cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of organizational and practical difficulties that must be overcome to&#xD;
           improve preventive actions towards deprived populations.&#xD;

      Scientific context :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, cervical cancer screening is based on a cervical smear every three years for women&#xD;
      aged 25 to 30 years, and on a High-Risk HPV (HR-HPV) detection test every five years for&#xD;
      women aged 30 to 65 years. One of the main concerns in France is poor attendance to this&#xD;
      screening program. Among non-attendee women, older women (&gt; 50 years old) and women of&#xD;
      unfavourable socio-economic conditions are the most represented groups. This observation led&#xD;
      French Health Authorities to implement population-based organized cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      (DO CCU) starting in 2019. The Departments of Hérault and Aude are among those in Occitanie&#xD;
      region (south of France) with the lowest participation to cervical cancer screening. In 2017,&#xD;
      a group composed of academics, health professionals, the Regional Center for Cancer Screening&#xD;
      in Occitanie and the Association for Breast Cancer Screening in Montpellier-Hérault organized&#xD;
      a preliminary study based on a self-questionnaire showing high acceptability of vaginal&#xD;
      self-sampling by women aged 25 to 65 years, particularly for women older than 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this interventional research is to increase women's participation to cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening and to identify psycho-social determinants associated with screening&#xD;
      observance. For this purpose, the integrative model of change (Attitude Social Influence&#xD;
      Self-efficacy Mode - ASE model) from Vries et al. (2013) seems an interesting model to better&#xD;
      understand behavioural changes regarding participation to cervical cancer screening using the&#xD;
      proposed strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a proximity-incentive strategy complementary to DO CCU based on direct&#xD;
      proposal by a trained mid-wife of a vaginal self-sample device for HR-HPV testing to&#xD;
      non-attendee women while attending health care centers. Our hypothesis is that contacting&#xD;
      under-screened women directly and proposing them a self-sample device to be used at home&#xD;
      along with information on cervical cancer, will increase their participation to cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening. Secondary hypotheses are that 1) motivational determinants of ASE and&#xD;
      contextual opportunities are associated with the realization of vaginal self-sampling 2) and&#xD;
      that vaginal self-sampling is an efficient strategy for cervical cancer screening (i.e.&#xD;
      number of self-sampling performed and sent to the laboratory, and number of follow-up for&#xD;
      women with a positive HR-HPV DNA test among women who accepted the self-sample device).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women aged 50 to 65 years with no cervical smear or no gynecological examination for more&#xD;
      than three years will be recruited in two sites: in a mobile unit for breast cancer screening&#xD;
      implemented in the whole Department of Hérault and in a Medical and Social Care located in a&#xD;
      particularly deprived area of Aude (Limoux-Quillan). Non attendee-women will be proposed a&#xD;
      vaginal self-sample device (Evalyn® brush) to perform at home and send back by mail to the&#xD;
      laboratory of the Hospital of Montpellier, which will perform HR-HPV testing using the Cobas&#xD;
      4800 HPV DNA detection test. Women with positive HR-HPV DNA test will be asked to perfom a&#xD;
      cervical smear and completion of follow-up will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recruitment, women will complete a questionnaire with the help of a midwife on their&#xD;
      socio-economic environment, motivational determinants and on their willingness to perform the&#xD;
      vaginal self-sample. These data will be analyzed according to their participation to the&#xD;
      proposed screening strategy. In addition, semi-directive interviews will be conducted in a&#xD;
      sub-group of women (45 women for each site) to identify the barriers and levers of screening&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of women to be recruited (i.e. non-attendee women aged 50 to 65 years, who&#xD;
      accepted the vaginal self-sample device among those to whom it has been proposed) is 300 for&#xD;
      each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total estimated duration of the project is 48 months, based on 12 months for preparation&#xD;
      of the questionnaires, study subject approvals package and staff recruitment and training, 24&#xD;
      months for women's recruitment, 12 months for follow-up of women with positive HR-HPV DNA&#xD;
      test, for data analysis and final report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Health public impact are (a) an increase in participation to cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening of women aged 50 to 65 years in the Departments of Hérault and Aude (b) the&#xD;
      development of a proximity-incentive strategy to increase cervical cancer screening within&#xD;
      vulnerable populations and populations with limited access to health care in those&#xD;
      Departments (c) the identification of psycho social determinants involved in cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening attendance (i.e. motivational factors, self-efficacy) (d) the construction of a&#xD;
      regional network of professionals involved in cervical cancer screening, including health&#xD;
      professionals, field teams, committee-based associations and researchers (e) the development&#xD;
      of hypotheses and models for future transferability of this intervention to other Departments&#xD;
      of the Occitanie Region as a complement of the national DO CCU program.&#xD;
