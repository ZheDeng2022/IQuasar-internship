    <textblock>
      This cross-over group, double-blind, randomized, single center, study will enroll 26 subjects&#xD;
      to target at least 24 subjects completing the study.Following an initial 3-5 minute&#xD;
      evaluation of resting salivary flow, subjects will wait 10 minutes and then use their&#xD;
      assigned spray. They will then swallow, and unstimulated saliva will be collected for 3-5&#xD;
      minutes. They will then remain in the study center for 60 min to evaluate xerostomia relief&#xD;
      by questionnaire at 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. after the use of mouth spray. They will then be&#xD;
      given their assigned product to use twice daily for one week. Subjects will maintain a daily&#xD;
      diary of their use of the mouth spray and any oral effects they experience, and will answer&#xD;
      all diary questions. Compliance will be assessed by subject diary and measurement of&#xD;
      remaining test mouth spray in bottle when unused portion is returned to the clinic. Subjects&#xD;
      will also receive 2 questionnaires to complete during the office visit at the end of each&#xD;
      7-day study period. After a 1 week washout, subjects will return to the office to begin the&#xD;
      second period of the study, using the same study procedures and be assigned the alternate&#xD;
      treatment mouth spray.&#xD;
