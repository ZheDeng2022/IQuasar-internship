  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the feasibility, acceptability, safety of a 3-month hatha and&#xD;
      restorative yoga intervention to decrease sedentary behavior, stress and blood pressure in&#xD;
      sedentary African-American women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess feasibility of a hatha and restorative yoga intervention compared&#xD;
      to a control group. Investigators will examine feasibility of participant recruitment,&#xD;
      retention and adherence; fidelity of intervention delivery; and intervention materials.&#xD;
      Investigators also aim to evaluate the acceptability and safety of a hatha and restorative&#xD;
      yoga intervention compared to a control group. Investigators will examine the acceptability&#xD;
      of intervention location and strategies, class format, enjoyment of sessions, and safety of&#xD;
      the intervention. Finally, investigators aim to test feasibility and appropriateness of the&#xD;
      targeted outcomes for subsequent trials. Expected outcomes will be properly measured, but no&#xD;
      comparisons between intervention and control groups will be made.&#xD;

    <description>This group will have in-person, 60 minute yoga sessions three times per week for 12 weeks. These sessions will also include a sharing circle to provide group feedback as to how the practice felt and integration into ones' daily life. There will be biweekly themes established for these sessions (i.e. common yoga poses, importance of breath) and biweekly in-person workshops will be offered. These will be specialty classes for participants to experience additional exposure to meditation and breathing. They will be a longer format so participants can delve deeper into yogic philosophy and practice. There will also be a private Facebook group for participants to connect with each other and for the research staff to maintain contact and share information with the participants (eg. weekly reminder for yoga sessions and workshops).</description>
