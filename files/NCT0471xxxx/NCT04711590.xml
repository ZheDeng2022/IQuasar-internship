  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weaning ventilator support in critically ill patients is crucial. Both delayed extubation and&#xD;
      unexpected early reintubation are harmful to the patients. Weaning parameters and spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing trial are used to investigate the indication and predict the successful extubation.&#xD;
      Hemodynamic stability and physical reserve are important indicators as well. Microcirculation&#xD;
      parameters are known to be more sensitive to the change of hemodynamic status than&#xD;
      macrocirculation parameters. We hypothesize that the change of sublingual microcirculation&#xD;
      before and after spontaneous breathing trial is different between the the patients with&#xD;
      successful extubation and the patients with failed extubation. Thus, this study measures&#xD;
      sublingual microcirculation in patients receiving spontaneous breathing trial and record the&#xD;
      extubation status (successful or failed). The microcirculation parameters before and after&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing trial are compared between the the patients with successful extubation&#xD;
      and the patients with failed extubation.&#xD;
