  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuing cetuximab&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy after first-line progression in wild-type KRAS,NRAS and BRAF&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      In addition to the sequential therapeutic schedule of offering maintenance therapy and&#xD;
      reintroduction of chemotherapy regimens to patients with nonresectable mCRC, multiline&#xD;
      treatment strategy of continuing bevacizumab after progression to first-line bevacizumab plus&#xD;
      chemotherapy demonstrated optimal clinical benefits in prolonging progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS) . Continuing cetuximab after progression to first-line&#xD;
      cetuximab is also a promising strategy. The underlying hypothesis is that a sustained&#xD;
      inhibition of EGFR signaling with cetuximab would continuously eliminate sensitive clones of&#xD;
      RAS wild-type tumor. The present phase 2 clinical trial evaluated standard&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy combined with cetuximab among patients with wild-type&#xD;
      KRAS, NRAS and BRAF V600E mCRC who had progressed after cetuximab plus standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      in the first-line setting.&#xD;
