  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within 6 months after the occurrence of stroke, more than 25% of patients will experience&#xD;
      severe disability. Patients and caregivers need to learn stroke self-care knowledge. Nursing&#xD;
      personnel play the role of educator and provide self-care health education content.&#xD;
      Traditional nursing instructions are mainly provided using leaflets and verbal health&#xD;
      education. However, the advancement of information technology and the popularization of&#xD;
      mobile network 3C products make it possible to provide real-time, individualized and&#xD;
      large-capacity information, which is the most real-time and efficient way of clinical care at&#xD;
      present. Therefore, this study investigated whether mobile device health education program&#xD;
      provided for patients with stroke can improve their self-care knowledge and self-efficacy and&#xD;
      reduce depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study enrolled patients at the wards of Division of Neurology in a certain medical&#xD;
      center in the northern Taiwan. This study adopted two-group, pre-and-post-test, randomized,&#xD;
      single-blind experimental research design, and calculated the samples size using G-Power. At&#xD;
      least 35 subjects should be enrolled in the experimental group (APP education program&#xD;
      intervention) and control group (conventional nursing), respectively. This study performed&#xD;
      the pre-test on Day 1 of hospitalization, implemented the interventional program on Day 2,&#xD;
      and performed the post-test before discharge. The research questionnaires included Stroke&#xD;
      Self-care Knowledge Scale, Stroke Self-efficacy Scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), VAS&#xD;
      Health Education Satisfaction Scale. This study performed statistical analysis using the&#xD;
      package statistical software version SPSS 20.0, and tested the distribution and homogeneity&#xD;
      of two groups of data using the independent sample T-test. Moreover, this study also&#xD;
      performed descriptive statistical analysis and inferential statistical analysis. For the&#xD;
      descriptive statistical analysis, this study presented the demographic data and disease&#xD;
      characteristics of the research subjects using frequency distribution, percentage, average&#xD;
      mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum. Furthermore, this study used independent&#xD;
      sample T-test, chi-square, One-way ANOVA, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and&#xD;
      ANCOVA to compare the differences in demographic data, disease characteristics, stroke&#xD;
      self-care knowledge, stroke self-efficacy, depression, and health education satisfaction&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a large teaching hospital in Asia, stroke patients were divided into experimental group&#xD;
      and control group by random allocation. The experimental group was given a mobile device&#xD;
      education program, and the control group was routine nursing care. Two groups of stroke were&#xD;
      discussed. Whether there are significant differences in knowledge, depression assessment, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hopefully, the intervention of mobile device education program can provide patients with a&#xD;
      health education method that is accessible and can be repeatedly watched for learning.&#xD;
      Hopefully, this education program may replace traditional health education leaflet, as well&#xD;
      as reduce the workload of clinical nurses. It is hoped that this education program can&#xD;
      effectively improve the self-care knowledge of patients with stroke, enhance self-efficacy,&#xD;
      reduce depression symptoms, increase satisfaction with educational instructions, and&#xD;
      ultimately prevent patients with stroke from experiencing any relapse to coexist with their&#xD;
      stroke and enjoy a good quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>This study hopes that through the intervention of mobile device education programs, it can provide patients with easy access and repeated viewing and learning. It can replace traditional leaflet health education and reduce the workload of clinical nurses. It is hoped that it can effectively improve the self-care knowledge of stroke patients, improve self-efficacy, reduce the symptoms of depression, and increase the satisfaction of education and guidance. Eventually, patients can be prevented from recurring from stroke, and they can coexist peacefully with stroke and have a good quality of life.</description>
