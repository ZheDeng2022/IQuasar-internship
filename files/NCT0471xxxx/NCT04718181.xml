  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, single oral dose, crossover study in up to three parts to&#xD;
      investigate the relative bioavailability and bioequivalence of two different formulations of&#xD;
      risdiplam 5 mg (dispersible tablets) versus the current risdiplam oral solution formulation&#xD;
      in healthy male and female participants. The effect of food on these two dispersible tablets&#xD;
      and the current oral solution will be studied, as well as the effect of omeprazole on the&#xD;
      dispersible tablets.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study is an exploratory comparison of the relative oral bioavailability of the&#xD;
      two dispersible tablets versus risdiplam powder for oral solution as the reference. The&#xD;
      effect of food on the bioavailability of the two dispersible tablets will be assessed by&#xD;
      comparing fed and fasted states in a five-way crossover manner. It will also be assessed&#xD;
      whether antacids (omeprazole) have an impact on the bioavailability of the dispersible&#xD;
      tablets in a two-way crossover manner. The food effect on the risdiplam oral solution will&#xD;
      also be assessed by comparing fed and fasted states in a two-way crossover manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, based on the data obtained in Part 1 and provided data support further evaluation,&#xD;
      a bioequivalence assessment and a food-effect evaluation will be conducted in two groups with&#xD;
      the selected dispersible tablet formulation. Each group will randomly receive, in a three-way&#xD;
      crossover, a single dose of risdiplam oral solution 5 mg in fasted state, and a single dose&#xD;
      of the selected dispersible tablet in both fed and fasted states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 3, provided Part 1 data support further evaluation of the second formulation, the&#xD;
      second formulation may be assessed for bioequivalence in the same way as described in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of the same participant in more than one cohort or group will not be permitted&#xD;
      regardless of the study part.&#xD;
