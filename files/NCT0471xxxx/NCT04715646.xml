      EP0156 is designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of brivaracetam (BRV) from&#xD;
      pediatric study participants with epilepsy who participated in the study in neonates, N01349&#xD;
      [NCT03325439], and/or the ongoing, open-label, long-term, follow-up study in pediatric study&#xD;
      participants, N01266 [NCT01364597], who have the opportunity to continue BRV treatment by&#xD;
      participating in EP0156.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EP0156 is also designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV from directly&#xD;
      enrolled (DE) Japanese pediatric study participants with partial-onset seizures (POS)&#xD;
      recruited in Japan. In the DE study participants only, pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be&#xD;
      evaluated in addition to the safety and tolerability of BRV.&#xD;

    <description>Study participants who completed a brivaracetam (BRV) core study (N01263 [NCT00422422], N01349 [NCT03325439], EP0065 [NCT03405714]) and continued to N01266 [NCT01364597], as well as study participants directly from N01349, will enroll as long-term follow-up (LTFU) study participants in EP0156. Each LTFU study participant begins treatment in EP0156 at the individualized BRV dose he/she was maintained on at the completion of the core study. EP0156 will also enroll Japanese pediatric study participants with partial-onset seizure (POS) recruited in Japan.&#xD;
LTFU study participants: Up to 5mg/kg/day (for study participants weighing 11kg to less than 20kg) and up to 4mg/kg/day (for study participants weighing 20kg to less than 50kg) and no more than 200mg/day Directly enrolled (DE) study participants: 1mg/kg/day to 4mg/kg/day and no more than 200mg/day.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
