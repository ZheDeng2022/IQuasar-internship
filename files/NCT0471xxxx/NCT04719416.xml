      This study will look at the use of relaxation therapy in children with cancer. The study will&#xD;
      compared patients who are current receiving treatment for their cancer and those who are&#xD;
      currently in remission. Patients will be asked to listen to a short audio recording twice a&#xD;
      week prior to going to bed which will walk patients through a mediation session. Surveys will&#xD;
      be distributed through parental emails on the first of each month for each child to complete&#xD;
      for the duration of 12 months. It is anticipated that the use of relaxation therapy will help&#xD;
      to improve anxiety and pain levels in this population.&#xD;

      Rationale: The utilization of complementary therapies in the management of cancer have not&#xD;
      been extensively studied in the pediatric population. Patients in active treatment and even&#xD;
      those in remission may experience higher levels of anxiety and medical complications compared&#xD;
      to their counterparts. Complementary therapies such as meditation have been found to improve&#xD;
      symptoms and decrease anxiety and pain levels in adult oncology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The goal of this study is to determine the impact of relaxation breathing with&#xD;
      body scan techniques through the utilization of media clips on pediatric oncology patients'&#xD;
      complications, hospitalizations, anxiety levels and outlook on diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized non-blind control trial will be conducted in order to compare a control&#xD;
      to a therapy intervention group. The therapy will consist of a video clip approximately 5&#xD;
      minutes in length. The clip will walk the patient through mindfulness in breathing along with&#xD;
      muscle relaxation of each muscle group. This therapy is to be completed three times a week&#xD;
      prior to falling asleep. Prior to initiation of therapy a baseline questionnaire will be&#xD;
      completed. Following initiation, a follow up survey will be distributed on a monthly basis to&#xD;
      assess for symptom severity, number of hospitalizations and patient outlook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: The study population includes patients seen at Janet Weis Children's Hospital's&#xD;
      pediatric oncology clinic. Patients must be in the age range of 6-20 years old for the entire&#xD;
      year of the study in order to qualify. Exclusion criteria includes patients who are actively&#xD;
      receiving drug therapy for anxiety or depression or receiving palliative care. Patients who&#xD;
      pass away within the year of study will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame: Following recruitment, each patient will be enrolled for the total of a one-year&#xD;
      time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes: The investigators project that the patients utilizing guided meditation&#xD;
      will experience decreased levels of anxiety, pain and complications compared to those of the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
