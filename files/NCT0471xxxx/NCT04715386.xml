    <description>Patients will be asked to start topical application of their allocated topical preparation on the area of skin that will be irradiated at the onset of radiation therapy, every day until skin symptoms subside (see patient information pamphlet). Apply twice per day and can be reapplied as skin symptoms arise or as needed. The amount of StrataXRT provided to each patient will be recorded throughout treatment.</description>
