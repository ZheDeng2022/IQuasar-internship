  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a rather novel system to provide oxygen therapy, which&#xD;
      provides flows up to 60 liters/minute (LPM) of heated and humidified gas through nasal&#xD;
      prongs. HFNC is increasingly being used in patients with acute respiratory failure. In&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and in patients with acute respiratory failure it has been shown to induce&#xD;
      several effects beyond those expected for a standard oxygen therapy, such as increased carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (CO2) clearance and positive airway pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the potential indications for HFNC is to facilitate weaning from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and extubation. As weaning failure is one of the most complex challenges in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients, the use of HFNC after extubation, in order to prevent&#xD;
      reintubation, has been evaluated in some clinical trials, with promising results. However,&#xD;
      the role of HFNC postextubation is still controversial, and information regarding its effects&#xD;
      on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of weaning failure is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this proposal is to compare the acute physiologic effects of postextubation HFNC&#xD;
      versus standard oxygen therapy, in critically ill patients, on relevant mechanisms related to&#xD;
      weaning failure: work of breathing, lung function, systemic hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized crossover study which will include critically ill mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients, who fulfill criteria indicating they may be ready for weaning from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, and in whom a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is planned to&#xD;
      determine if they should be extubated. After checking eligibility and obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent, patients will be monitored with an esophageal catheter (esophageal / gastric&#xD;
      pressures to determine work of breathing, and electric activity of diaphragm to determine&#xD;
      neuromechanical coupling), and a noninvasive ventilation monitor (electric impedance&#xD;
      tomography to assess global and regional ventilation). Work of breathing, lung function, and&#xD;
      systemic hemodynamics will be assessed during the SBT. Inclusion in the study will be&#xD;
      confirmed only if they pass the SBT and are extubated. During the first 2 hours after&#xD;
      extubation patients will undergo one hour of HFNC and one hour of standard oxygen therapy,&#xD;
      with the crossover sequence being randomized previously at the time of inclusion, and with&#xD;
      assessments repeated at the end of each treatment period.&#xD;
