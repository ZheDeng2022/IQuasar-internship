      This Open-Label Pilot Study Aims to Determine Whether a Two-Part Sequenced Out Patient&#xD;
      Procedure Utilizing a Modified Ketogenic Diet Followed by a Series of Titrated Ketamine&#xD;
      Infusions Results in Improvement or Remission of Chronic Anorexia Nervosa in Adults with&#xD;
      Symptoms of Anorexia for at Least 3 Years Despite Treatment Involving at Least 2 Different&#xD;
      Modalities. The Hypothesis is That the Diet Addresses Core Metabolic Deficits in the&#xD;
      &quot;Anorexic Brain&quot; and Primes the Response to Ketamine.&#xD;

      Participants Who Are Deemed Eligible Will Participate in an Open-Label Clinical Trial Using a&#xD;
      Sequenced Treatment Previously Reported in One Case Study to Result in Complete and Sustained&#xD;
      Remission of Anorexia Nervosa for Over One Year (and Continuing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 Involves a Group 2-Day Immersive In-Person Educational Program to Begin a Modified&#xD;
      Ketogenic Diet, Under the Supervision of a Nutritionist Who Has Decades of Experience in&#xD;
      Designing Ketogenic Diets for Seizure Patients. This Group Experience is Followed by a 4 Week&#xD;
      Period of At-Home Adoption of the Diet, With Close Phone and E-Mail Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Involves Administration of a Series of Titrated Intravenous Ketamine Infusions&#xD;
      Scheduled Over 2 Weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Part 1, and Part 2, There Will Be a Range of Objective and Psychological Measures To&#xD;
      Assess Safety and Response. The Participants Will be Followed For 12 Months.&#xD;
