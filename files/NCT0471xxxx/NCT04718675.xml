      Part 1: Dose Escalation. The primary objective of Part 1 of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of KB-0742 in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) solid&#xD;
      tumors or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Cohort Expansion. The primary objective of Part 2 of this study is to further&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of KB-0742 in defined participant cohorts.&#xD;
