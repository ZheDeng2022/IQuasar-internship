      1. To analyze the prevalence of overlap syndromes among NERD or RH, FD, and IBS patients,&#xD;
           and to identify and to compare the differences in their characteristics and symptoms,&#xD;
           and to determine their risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the differences in clinical features according to sex and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze the effect of genetic polymorphisms on overlap FGIDs over long-term follow-up&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
