      We know that there is a link between disorders in the upper and lower airways, both&#xD;
      epidemiologically, patho-physiologically, and therapeutically. What we know less about is the&#xD;
      role for the nose and nasal breathing for physical capacity. That goes both for the ability&#xD;
      of the average, healthy persons well as for patients with ie. asthma and COPD to perform&#xD;
      daily life activities as well as exercise and for top athletes to perform their maximum&#xD;
      oxygen demanding activities. Without this knowledge, we cannot make evidence based decisions&#xD;
      about to what extent measures to open the nose medically and/or surgically should be&#xD;
      considered to improve physical capacity at any level. The aim of the present project is to&#xD;

      Nasal breathing as a prerequisite for global airway health and physical capacity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Introduction The airways are traditionally divided into two segments, the upper and&#xD;
           lower. The former consists of the nose, the paranaseal sinuses, the epipharynx, the&#xD;
           oropharynynx, and the hypopharynx down to the level of the vocal cords. The latter&#xD;
           involves everything below the vocal cords, including the trachea, the bronchi, the&#xD;
           bronchioles, and the alveoli. The latter is the segment where the oxygen/CO2 exchange&#xD;
           take place, critical for life. In this way, the upper and lower airways can be&#xD;
           considered as two of a kind ((Steinsvag 2009). The role of the nose in this is to&#xD;
           filter, temper and humidify the inspired air before entering the lungs. Further, the&#xD;
           nose adds nitrogen monoxide, thereby optimizing the muco-ciliary activity and the&#xD;
           ventilation-perfusion ratio in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We know that there is a link between disorders in the upper and lower airways, both&#xD;
           epidemiologically, patho-physiologically, and therapeutically (Fireman 2000,&#xD;
           Thorstensen, Bugten et al. 2012, Bousquet, Schünemann et al. 2019, Oie, Dahlslett et al.&#xD;
           2020). What we know less about is the role for the nose and nasal breathing for physical&#xD;
           capacity. That goes both for the ability of the average, healthy persons well as for&#xD;
           patients with ie. asthma and COPD to perform daily life activities as well as exercise&#xD;
           and for top athletes to perform their maximum oxygen demanding activities. Without this&#xD;
           knowledge, we cannot make evidence based decisions about to what extent measures to open&#xD;
           the nose medically and/or surgically should be considered to improve physical capacity&#xD;
           at any level. The aim of the present project is to expand our knowledge in the field for&#xD;
           the best of the ordinary man, patients with airway disorders, and athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Needs description The main impact of the present project is an improved understanding of&#xD;
           the role of the upper airways for physical capacity. Physical capacity is essential for&#xD;
           the ability to be physically active, move around, exercise and perform sports at any&#xD;
           level. Thus, it is essential for the general well-being for everybody, essential as a&#xD;
           disease-preventing factor, and essential for athletes. We know that nasal obstruction&#xD;
           has negative impact on the lower airways, sleep(Migueis, Thuler et al. 2016), taste and&#xD;
           smell(Dileo and Amedee 1994) as well as general quality of life(Osborn and Sacks 2013).&#xD;
           But we do not know much about how nasal obstruction affects physical capacity. It is&#xD;
           possible to deduce that measures to reduce mucosal inflammation in the nose and to&#xD;
           improve nasal patency may have beneficial effects. There is scientific support for this&#xD;
           in that intranasal steroids, cromolyn, antihistamines, and decongestants(Bousquet,&#xD;
           Schünemann et al. 2019), which provide relief of nasal symptoms in patients with both&#xD;
           allergic rhinitis and asthma, will also improve the pulmonary symptoms in allergic&#xD;
           asthma(Fireman 2000). Surgical management of sinonasal pathology can improve&#xD;
           asthma(Dunlop, Scadding et al. 1999) In some studies, external nasal dilators have been&#xD;
           shown to improve endurance (Ottaviano, Ermolao et al. 2017). However, this has been&#xD;
           opposed by others(Adams and Peiffer 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
           To be able to move around is important for most people. It is important for those with&#xD;
           severe airway limitations/disabilities to be able to carry out elementary daily life&#xD;
           activities as well as for most top athletes in their chase for trophies. Movement&#xD;
           presupposes physical capacity at some level, from the lowest to the most extreme. When&#xD;
           it comes to airway limitations, the focus usually is on the lower airways while the&#xD;
           upper airways are forgotten. Given the unified airway concept, this is unfortunate,since&#xD;
           optimizing the latter may have major impact on the global airway function. This implies&#xD;
           reducing inflammation by medical means and/or improving patency by medical or surgical&#xD;
           means, i.e. turbinate surgery, septal surgery and polypectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before involving measures on the upper airway to improve physical capacity, we need to&#xD;
           know more about the potential. That is the motivation for this investigation. This&#xD;
           research project may have an impact for patients, the ordinary man, and athletes where&#xD;
           the airways may be a limiting factor for their daily life activities and&#xD;
           self-expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotheses, aims and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: The upper airways may have major impact on the global airway and physical&#xD;
           capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explore physical capacity under increasing physical strain in athletes while:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Breathing through the mouth and nose&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Breathing only through the nose&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Breathing only through the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explore signs and symptoms from the upper airways in athletes and controls&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explore the effect of measures to improve nasal patency on physical capacity in&#xD;
                patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objectives: To be able to optimize the physical capacity in patients with lower airway&#xD;
           diseases, ordinary people and athletes by reducing or eliminating potentially limiting&#xD;
           factors in the upper airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the project period, we expect to obtain evidence-based knowledge about the upper&#xD;
           airways that may be employed to improve physical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Project methodology 3.1. Project arrangements, method selection and analyses 3.1.1.&#xD;
           Project arrangements: This is a co-operate project between Depts. of Otolaryngology,&#xD;
           Head and Neck surgery, Sørlandet Hospital and Haukeland University Hospital, Dept. of&#xD;
           Pulmonary Medicine, Akershus University Hospital, Dept. of Otolaryngology Head and Neck&#xD;
           surgery, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, and &quot;Idrettshøgskolan&quot;, Gothenburg,&#xD;
           Sweden 3.1.2. Methods, selection and analyses. 3.1.2.1: Project 1. Explore physical&#xD;
           capacity under increasing physical strain in athletes while breathing through both the&#xD;
           mouth and the nose, breathing only through the nose and breathing only through the&#xD;
           mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Twelve Swedish elite cyclists between 20 and 40 years will be invited to participate&#xD;
           after informed consent. They will have a VO2 max above 65 ml/min/kg body weight. They do&#xD;
           not suffer from any known upper airway disease such as allergic rhinitis,&#xD;
           rhino-sinusitis, moderate to severe septal deviation, or nasal polyps. They do not have&#xD;
           asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They are non-smokers. They do not use&#xD;
           any kind of topical or systemic medication, Initially, the participants perform a&#xD;
           pre-test to establish the exact VO2 max and Vmax according to standard techniques. Nasal&#xD;
           symptoms like obstruction and running are recorded on Visual Analogue&#xD;
           Scales(Voutilainen, Pitkäaho et al. 2016). The nose is investigated endoscopically.&#xD;
           Spirometry is performed(Liou and Kanner 2009). Nasal geometry and nasal airflow are&#xD;
           measured by acoustic rhinometry and peak nasal inspiratory flow, respectively(Chin,&#xD;
           Marcells et al. 2014), before and after decongestion with oxymetazoline nasal spray 0,5&#xD;
           mg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The testing: All the participants undergo 4 sessions at the test-laboratory. Initially,&#xD;
           there is a test session. Then there are sessions where they run with oral and nasal&#xD;
           breathing, mouth only breathing, and nose only breathing. The order of these tests is&#xD;
           randomized for each test person. Each session takes approx. 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the tests, the participants avoid alcohol and heavy exercise for 24 hours. They&#xD;
           log their dietary intake and repeat this before every test. They fast the night before&#xD;
           testing. Waking up on the test day, the study person drinks 500 ml of water. When they&#xD;
           arrive at the test station, their undressed height and weight are recorded. Blood and&#xD;
           urinary tests are taken. The participants are eligible if the fluid balance evaluated by&#xD;
           urine specific weight (USG) is &lt;1,025 (Atago, Tokyo, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After antropometric measurements, an increasingly strenous test on a test bike with&#xD;
           mechanical breaks is performed(Monark LT2, Varberg, Sweden). Before measuring O2&#xD;
           consumption and CO2 production during sub-maximal load, indirect calometric testing via&#xD;
           an online system is performed (Jaeger Oxycon Pro, Viasys Healthcare, Germany). The&#xD;
           exhaustion test is a socalled ramp test with increasing load until maximum. Heart rate&#xD;
           is continuously recorded as a mean pr. minute(Polar Electro OY, Kempele, Finland). Under&#xD;
           the test station the air temperature is 200 and the relative humidity is 40-50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The described scientific methods have, for many years, been used for research in&#xD;
           rhinology at the depts. of oto-rhin-olaryngology, head and neck surgery, Sørlandet&#xD;
           Hospital and Sahlgrenska sjukehuset, as well as in sports medicine at&#xD;
           &quot;Idrettshøgskolan&quot;, Gothenburg by the investigators. They have been demonstrated to be&#xD;
           valid for research projects like this (referanse). Necessary resources, equipment and&#xD;
           infrastructure are readily available in Gothenburg. This includes competance in&#xD;
           statistics. Potential risks are limited to the test situation. All participants are&#xD;
           familiar with the test bikes. If unexpected and unlikely incidents do occur, they will&#xD;
           be taken immediately taken care of by medical and technical expertise present at the&#xD;
           test station.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1.2.2: Project 2. Explore signs and symptoms from the upper airways in athletes and&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Symptoms may observed in persons with a disease or other abnormal conditions, but&#xD;
           normally not observed in average healthy persons. But they may also be pure subjective&#xD;
           feelings or notions, that do not reflect any disease or dysfunction. The latter is a&#xD;
           well known phenomenon in rhinology. Subjects may have a feeling of complete nasal&#xD;
           obstruction to an extent that interferes with their daily life activities, while&#xD;
           clinical investigations and objective tests do not reveal any abnormalities. Likewise,&#xD;
           i.e. an extensive septal deviation may not give rise to a subjective feeling of nasal&#xD;
           obstruction. We have also shown that patients with asthma experience their nasal airway&#xD;
           differently from those without(Thorstensen, Sue-Chu et al. 2014). This turns them into&#xD;
           mouth breathers at an earlier stage of physical strain than healthy individuals.&#xD;
           Premature switching to oronasal breathing results in inadequate conditioning and&#xD;
           filtering of the inspired air, with drying and cooling of the lower airways, subsequent&#xD;
           release of inflammatory cell mediators and development of an asthmatic response and&#xD;
           asthma chronicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We have recently demonstrated that patients with COPD have more signs and symptoms from&#xD;
           the upper airways that may limit their physical capacity than controls(Oie, Dahlslett et&#xD;
           al. 2020). In this paper we want to explore the corresponding situation in athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will recruit athletes from &quot;Olympiatoppen&quot;, in collaboration with their head of&#xD;
           research Else Marthe Lybekk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The controls will be age and sex matched individuals recruited from businesses near by&#xD;
           the hospital or patients attending the hospital for other illnesses, which are thought&#xD;
           not to affect the upper and lower airways. Those who chose to participate may have been&#xD;
           more interested in their health than the general population, but still we regard&#xD;
           measurements on these individuals to be representative for the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These are the tools that will be employed, see the link&#xD;
           https://nettskjema.no/a/155806#/page/1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (Juniper and Guyatt 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is an interviewer and self-administered disease-specific health-related quality of&#xD;
           life instrument that measures the functional impairments that are most troublesome to&#xD;
           adult (17-70 years) patients as a result of their rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It has 7 domains. Activity limitations (3 items), sleep problems (3 items), nose&#xD;
           symptoms (4 items), eye symptoms (4 items), non-nose/eye symptoms (7 items), practical&#xD;
           problems (3 items), and emotional function (4 items). The response is made on a 7-point&#xD;
           scale (0 = not impaired at all - 6 = severely impaired). Reported interclass correlation&#xD;
           coeficient is 0.86. Cronbach's alpha is not reported. Minimally important differences&#xD;
           are change in scores greater than 0,5.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sino nasal outcome test 22 (SNOT-22)(Piccirillo, Merritt et al. 2002, Hopkins, Gillett&#xD;
           et al. 2009) It is a validated, self-administered quality of life instrument specific&#xD;
           for symptoms of rhinosinusitis and sensitive to clinical changes. It describes the&#xD;
           health burden of rhinosinusitis by measuring; physical problems, functional limitations&#xD;
           and emotional consequences of CRS by asking the participants to score 22 key symptoms.&#xD;
           These are: the need to blow the nose, sneezing, runny nose, cough, postnasal discharge,&#xD;
           thick nasal discharge, ear fullness, dizziness, ear pain, facial pain/ pressure,&#xD;
           difficult falling asleep, waking up at night and difficulty falling asleep. With&#xD;
           reference to symptoms the two last weeks, the participants scored each symptom from 0-5,&#xD;
           giving a summery score, the total SNOT-22 score Visual analogue Scales (VAS)(Grant,&#xD;
           Aitchison et al. 1999) The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a&#xD;
           psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement&#xD;
           instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.&#xD;
           When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a&#xD;
           statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points. In&#xD;
           this project we use VAS to measure 12 sino-nasal symptoms on a 100 mm line with&#xD;
           endpoints &quot;never&quot; (0) and &quot;always&quot; (100). The symptoms are: Nasal obstruction, nasal&#xD;
           running, snoring, apneas during sleep, nasal running, headache, mid facial pain,&#xD;
           sinusitis, coughing, sneezing, general health, and sense of smell. Each subject was&#xD;
           asked to grade each symptom and condition by frequency. VAS 0-30 is defined as mild&#xD;
           disease, &gt;30-7o as moderate disease and VAS &gt;70 as severe rhinosinusitis affecting the&#xD;
           patient´s quality of life. We also use VAS-scales to score nasal function in athletes&#xD;
           and controls,&#xD;
&#xD;
           Self-designed questionnaire &quot;The athlete and his nose&quot;. Together with prof. Hellgren we&#xD;
           have designed a questionnaire focusing on the athletes type of sport, level of&#xD;
           performance, symptoms from the nose during activity, previous medical or surgical&#xD;
           treatment of nasal disorders All questionnaires in this project are made electronic&#xD;
           using the technology from &quot;Nettskjema&quot;, University of Oslo. Collecting data will be&#xD;
           web-based, and the answers are directly imported into systems for data- and statistical-&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis Based on a power test prior to the study, we need at least 45&#xD;
           patients to discover a difference between a normal population and a study population. We&#xD;
           wanted to discover a mean difference of at least one with two-sided test of 5 % and 80 %&#xD;
           power. As data will probably not be normally distributed, Mann-Whitney U test will be&#xD;
           used in paired analyses. P less than 0.05 will be considered to be statistically&#xD;
           significant. The analyses will be done using SPSS ver. 23 (Statistical Package for&#xD;
           Social Sciences, Chicago, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Project 3. The physical capacity in patients with COPD before and after nasal&#xD;
           decongestion evaluated by shuttle walking tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with COPD have more signs and symptoms from the upper airways than controls&#xD;
           that may limit their physical capacity (Arndal, Sørensen et al. 2020, Oie, Dahlslett et&#xD;
           al. 2020). In this study we will investigate to what extent measures to open their nose&#xD;
           may improve their walking capability.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a collaboration project with Anne Edvardsen and Gunnar Einvik at the dept. of&#xD;
           Respiratory Medicine, Akershus University Hospital, Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be recruited from the out-patient section, dept. of Respiratory Medicine,&#xD;
           Akershus University Hospital after informed consent. The COPD diagnosis will be&#xD;
           confirmed by the presence of airflow obstruction, defined as an increase in FEV1 of less&#xD;
           than 12% and 200 ml after administration of salbutamol by inhalation and a post&#xD;
           bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt; 0. Severity of airflow obstruction will be evaluated&#xD;
           according to the GOLD 2014 criteria(Singh, Agusti et al. 2019). Pulmonary function tests&#xD;
           will be performed according to ERS' guidelines for spirometry (Miller, Hankinson et al.&#xD;
           2005) with a calibrated Medikro Pro spirometer (Medikro Oy, Kuopio, Finland). The best&#xD;
           FEV1 of three acceptable attempts will be recorded prior to and 10 minutes after&#xD;
           administration of 0.4 mg Salbutamol aerosol in a spacer (Ventoline, Volumatic,&#xD;
           GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK). Predicted reference values of Crapo et al will be&#xD;
           used(Crapo, Morris et al. 1981). In all subjects, weight and height will be recorded.&#xD;
           They will compete self-administered questionnaires (SNOT-22) and Visual Analogue Scales&#xD;
           on symptoms and signs from the upper airways, and undergo an interview and clinical&#xD;
           examination with nasal endoscopy by one of the 2 doctors (ENT) committed to the study.&#xD;
           Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow will also be recorded. Any subject with a positive&#xD;
           reversibility test or nasal polyps at endoscopy, and subjects with a COPD diagnosis who&#xD;
           do not satisfy the GOLD criteria for COPD, will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participants will then undergo an Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) (Brown and&#xD;
           Wise 2007). First two cones will be placed with 10 meters apart on a flat indoor space.&#xD;
           The participants' speed is determined by a pre-recorded metronome that gives a signal&#xD;
           for each stride pass a cone. The test will be stopped if the participants experience&#xD;
           symptoms like chest pain or a drop in saturation, or if they are not able to keep up the&#xD;
           walking speed. The speed is increased by 0.17 m/s every minute, and it may last 20&#xD;
           minutes maximum. At the end of the test the distanced walked is calculated by the amount&#xD;
           of laps the participants managed to perform. The participants are experiencing a&#xD;
           learning effect if the test is performed several times. Due to this matter the&#xD;
           participants will perform the test twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ESWT) is performed with the same distance as ISWT, but&#xD;
           in at constant walking pace. The pace is calculated as 85% of the maximum sustainable&#xD;
           walking pace from ISWT. The participants will firstly try the field during a 2-minute&#xD;
           warm up period. The test is conducted until the participants has to stop due to symptoms&#xD;
           or 20 minutes has passed. Before the ESWT the participants are asked to fill out&#xD;
           BORG-scale and VAS-scale to determine level of dyspnoea and fatigue. Their blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate and saturation are measured before, during and after the walking&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After 20 min. rest, 1 spray with Otrivin®(Oxymetazoline 0,1 mg/ml) is administered to&#xD;
           each nostril. The patients rest for another 5 minutes. Then PNIF is recorded once again.&#xD;
           They put another mark on a VAS-scale for nasal obstruction without being able to see the&#xD;
           first one.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Then the ESWT is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3. Participants, organization and collaborations&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study involves the following participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fride Uthaug Reite. Medical student and PhD-candidate. Oslo, Norway Sverre K. Steinsvåg.&#xD;
           ENT-specialist. Senior Consultant and Professor at the Depts of Otolaryngology, Head and&#xD;
           Neck Surgery, Sørlandet Hospital, Kristiansand and Haukeland University Hospital,&#xD;
           Bergen, Norway. Initiator and main supervisor for Fride Reite.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Johan Hellgren. ENT-specialist. Senior Consultant and Professor, ÖNH-kliniken,&#xD;
           Sahlgrenska Sjukhuset, Gøteborg, Sverige. Investigator and assistant supervisor for&#xD;
           Fride Reite.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mats Børjeson, MD PhD. Professor. Sahlgrenska Sjukhuset and Centrum för hälsa och&#xD;
           prestationsutveckling, Gøteborg, Sverige. Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stefan Pettersson, PhD, Department of Food and Nutrition, and Sport and Science,&#xD;
           University of Gothenburg, Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fredrik Edin. PhD. Department of Food and Nutrition, and Sport Science, University, of&#xD;
           Gothenburg, Investigator. Centrum för hälsa och prestationsutveckling, Göteborg .&#xD;
           Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a collaboration project between institutions in Norway and Sweden. The research&#xD;
           group consists of experienced investigators. Its totale competence in airway - and&#xD;
           sports medicine ensures a successful completion of Fride Uthaug Reite's PhD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.5. Plan for activities, visibility and dissemination Application to Regional&#xD;
           Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) in Norway and Sweden have&#xD;
           already been submitted, application 134609/2020 (Norway).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The complete research group will meet in Gothenburg, Sweden Oct. 3rd to set the plans&#xD;
           for the first test sessions for the athletes. Alternatively, there will be a&#xD;
           skype-meeting that day, depending on the COVID-19 situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaires about physical activity and airway health will be distributed to athletes&#xD;
           and controls during Oct. -20.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with COPD will be tested in Jan. 2021. 3.6. Plan for implementation As soon as&#xD;
           we learn more about the role of the nose for physical capacity, we will start to test&#xD;
           the effect of nose-opening procedures. These are primarily medical, i.e. topical nasal&#xD;
           decongestants and topical nasal steroids. In the case of structural reasons for nasal&#xD;
           obstruction, these may be corrected surgically. We expect to start experiments with&#xD;
           measures to improve nasal patency in succeeding projects, in 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ethical considerations We cannot see any ethical concerns about testing individuals&#xD;
           voluntarily for the nasal contribution to their physical capacity. The testing as such&#xD;
           does imply very limiteted risk, and medical and technical personnel will always be&#xD;
           present at the test sites in case of any unexpected incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations may potentially arise when the test results are to be used&#xD;
      practically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the testing demonstrates a positive impact of nasal breathing on physical capacity,&#xD;
      medical or surgical measures to improve nasal patency may also improve the capacity. This may&#xD;
      be particularly interesting for athletes and sports medicine. If this happens to be the case&#xD;
      an ethical debate is necessary in the perspective of doping.&#xD;
