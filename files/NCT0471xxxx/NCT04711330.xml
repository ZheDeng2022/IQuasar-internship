      The predictive value of the microbiome (throat swabs, stool and of bronchial samples) to&#xD;
      identify patients who will relapse during durvalumab treatment after CRT (False negative&#xD;
      Rate) at 6 months. Exploratory endpoints include the effects of antibiotic therapy before and&#xD;
      during IO treatment on toxicity and response rate. The role of exhaled breath analysis in&#xD;
      prediction of response and toxicity will also be investigated.&#xD;

      In this observational study we aim to investigate the predictive value of the microbiome&#xD;
      (throat swabs and stool) to identify patients who will relapse during durvalumab treatment&#xD;
      after CRT (False negative Rate) at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of stool and throat swipe before start of durvalumab treatment; sampling of blood&#xD;
      and exhaled air for analysis of volatile organic compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved clinical outcomes after adjuvant treatment with durvalumab following concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for locally advanced NSCLC (PACIFIC trial), led to the rapid&#xD;
      adoption of this treatment strategy as standard of care. However, despite the improved&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival, recurrence rate remains high. Approximately&#xD;
      45% of patients will relapse within 1 year, despite adjuvant durvalumab therapy. To date no&#xD;
      performant biomarker predicting treatment response or failure nor toxicity exists and the&#xD;
      number of prospective studies addressing this issue is limited. Both PD-L1 TPS and TMB should&#xD;
      be considered 'enriching' parameters improving response-chances, but they are far from an&#xD;
      ideal biomarker. Non-invasive biomarkers are essential in the future for better patient&#xD;
      selection and therapy allocation. One of the potential non-invasive biomarkers of interest is&#xD;
      the microbiome.&#xD;
