  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests that myofascial trigger points (MTrP) play an important role in explaining&#xD;
      pain in patients with musculoskeletal knee disorders. Trigger points are usually defined as&#xD;
      hypersensitive tender spots within taut bands of skeletal muscles that are painful on muscle&#xD;
      stimulation and that usually elicit referred pain. Treatment of these trigger points could&#xD;
      possibly alleviate symptoms in patients with knee pain. However, literature on the effect of&#xD;
      trigger point therapy, dry needling in particular, in patients with musculoskeletal knee&#xD;
      disorders is scarce. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of trigger point&#xD;
      therapy (dry needling (DN)) on pain, presence of altered central pain processing, muscle&#xD;
      features and gait pattern in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). 60 patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic KOA will participate in this study. They will randomly be allocated in either an&#xD;
      experimental group (EG) (dry needling technique) or a placebo group (PG) (sham needling&#xD;
      technique). Pain (Visual analogue scale (VAS) &amp; KOA outcome score (KOOS), muscle features&#xD;
      during gait and gait pattern (3D gait analysis and surface electroMyoGraphy (EMG)) and&#xD;
      presence of altered central pain processing (Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI),&#xD;
      Quantitative Sensory testing (QST)) will be measured at baseline and 15 minutes after the&#xD;
      intervention. Additionally, pain will be measured 3 days after the intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the effect on the outcome measures will be significantly&#xD;
      larger in the EG compared to the PG.&#xD;

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>A double-blinded study was achieved by giving no information about the assigned intervention to the executive researchers; and only the same general explanation about the intervention type to the subjects (Appendix A). Moreover, subjects were prohibited to see the needling-intervention. The group allocation was solely known by the treating therapists and the independent researcher (IB).</masking_description>

    <description>All identified MTrPs were inserted with a sterile filiform needle (0,30mm x 40mm or 0,30mm x 75mm, depending on the muscle) that moved up- and downwards until a local twitch response was elicited. When the repeated local twitch response fade away or the subject reported too much pain, the needle was removed. After the treatment, a 15 minutes break(51) was set up and the subjects were not permitted to use a hot pack or to stretch the muscle.</description>

    <description>The SN technique was similar to DN, except for penetrating the muscle. In this technique, the needle only penetrated the skin and was therefore impossible to provoke a local twitch response.</description>
