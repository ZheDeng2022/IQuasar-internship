  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient therapeutic education (PTE) has become &quot;a must&quot; in the modern management of chronic&#xD;
      diseases. Its main objective is to improve compliance with treatment and the application of&#xD;
      preventive measures. The main goal of this study is to assess the influence of the&#xD;
      therapeutic education program on the perception of the disease in patients with autoimmune&#xD;
      myasthenia. Secondary objectives are to assess quality of life, patient satisfaction of the&#xD;
      PTE program, the acquisition of therapeutic goals and the influence of therapeutic education&#xD;
      on the evolution of autoimmune myasthenia Study team hypothesize that therapeutic education&#xD;
      could improve the patient's perception of myasthenia and its quality of life. By improving&#xD;
      patient's adherence to treatments and his knowledge of the disease, it could also improve the&#xD;
      evolution of myasthenia gravis. Study team suppose that PTE program can reduce the&#xD;
      absenteeism at work, the number and duration of hospitalizations, particularly those in&#xD;
      intensive care units.&#xD;
