      BACKGROUND: The complex impact of gender has been studied in different perspectives of health&#xD;
      and disease in the literature. However, few attempts have been made to compile data from&#xD;
      systematic disease specific registrations Swedish National Quality Registers play an&#xD;
      important role in collecting large amounts of diagnose specific data, symptoms, and&#xD;
      treatments. The subset Parkinson Registry has been in use for more than 20 years and are&#xD;
      represented in all counties and hospitals where neurological care is provided in Sweden and&#xD;
      offer optimal conditions to describe gender specific differences in the use of diagnostic&#xD;
      tools, lead times and symptom profiles.&#xD;

      Aim: To study differences between gender in diagnostic tools, pharmacological interventions,&#xD;
      and self-reported symptoms in Parkinson´s Disease (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were extracted from the Swedish Neuro Registers, one of the Swedish National Quality&#xD;
      Registers. A mix of urban and rural parts of the country were chosen and data were divided by&#xD;
      gender. Self-reported first experienced PD related symptom was used to define the starting&#xD;
      point when processing the data. Zero to three years from this point was defined as early&#xD;
      symptoms and over three years as late symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between gender were seen in all chosen aspects, both diagnostically. Distinctions&#xD;
      were also prominent in reported NonMotorSymptoms (NMS) profiles. These findings should be&#xD;
      important to take into consideration for patients, professional staff, and caregivers in the&#xD;
      daily work with gender mixed PD groups.&#xD;
