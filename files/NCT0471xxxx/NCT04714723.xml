  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-blind, randomized trial, about 1200 eligible volunteers, who have higher&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk and aged 20-65 years, will be assigned to one of three&#xD;
      smartphone-based lifestyle intervention arms: 1) Routine education; 2) Programmed-smartphone&#xD;
      intervention; and 3) Programmed-smartphone plus dietitian intervention. Before and after&#xD;
      6-month intervention, &quot;PhenFlex test&quot; (PFT) will be performed to examine and quantify&#xD;
      improved metabolic flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention trial will be conducted by researchers in Shanghai Institute of Nutrition&#xD;
      and Health of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) collaborating with Zhejiang University&#xD;
      affiliated Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committees in Shanghai Institutes of Nutrition and Health, and in Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of this study are to determine 1) efficacy of lifestyle interventions with&#xD;
      different intensity in reducing MetS and its risk factors; 2) improved metabolic responses or&#xD;
      flexibility defined by PFT-based homeostasis index; and 3) major genetic and nongenetic&#xD;
      determinants for the efficacy of interventions among high MetS risk Chinese.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome, a cluster of multiple metabolic disturbances, including central obesity,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia, is associated with 2-5-fold heightened risks&#xD;
      of CVD and T2D. Compelling evidence showed that lifestyle intervention is one of effective&#xD;
      approaches for preventing and controlling cardiometabolic diseases. However, there were&#xD;
      considerably variations among different interventions and different persons. With widely&#xD;
      available smartphone and APP-connected wearable devises, it is possible to provide programmed&#xD;
      nutrition and lifestyle education to help participants achieve intervention targets, and&#xD;
      closely monitor compliance. However, few studies investigated the efficacy of lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions with programmed smartphone and APP-connected wearable devises in MetS&#xD;
      management. Moreover, since present disease-based diagnoses and biomarkers may not adequately&#xD;
      define health status, the concept of &quot;re-redefining health&quot; has attracted growing attention.&#xD;
      The phenotypic flexibility and &quot;PhenFlex test&quot; are one of approaches to measure individuals'&#xD;
      adaptive capacity to maintain hemostatic condition after having a standardized challenge&#xD;
      drinker. To date, the PFT has been studied among 10,000 subjects in western countries and few&#xD;
      studies, if any, have conducted in Chinese who have different genetic background and dietary&#xD;
      patterns. It remains to be established whether and to what extent that the PFT-based&#xD;
      hemostatic index system can precisely evaluate the metabolic health in Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current trial, approximate 1200 subjects with MetS risks will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of three smartphone-based lifestyle intervention arms: 1) Routine education; 2)&#xD;
      Programmed-smartphone intervention; and 3) Programmed-smartphone plus dietitian intervention.&#xD;
      The intervention duration will be 6-month and then have 2-year follow-up. During starting and&#xD;
      end of 6-month intervention, we will include PFT during the physical examination hold in the&#xD;
      Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital. All the subjects will be given a standardized challenge drinker&#xD;
      (75g glucose, 60 fat and 20g protein). Fasting and multiple postprandial time points samples&#xD;
      (blood, t=0,1,3h) and urine and feces will be collected to measure clinical and omics markers&#xD;
      like metabolomics, gut microbiota and SNPs. Finally, the homeostasis index will be built to&#xD;
      estimate improvement of individual metabolic health after the intervention. In conclusion,&#xD;
      this study will provide scientific evidence and novel insights about the effectiveness of new&#xD;
      intervention strategies and precise diagnostic and assessment system for cardiometabolic&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
