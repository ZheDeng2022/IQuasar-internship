  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, randomized, controlled trial of 2'-Fucosyllactose in infants born&#xD;
      between 29 and 32 weeks gestational age. The investigators anticipate enrollment of 90&#xD;
      subjects in total and for the study to be completed in 18 months. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate collecting clinical data, anthropometrics, stool samples (requiring appropriate&#xD;
      storage through analysis), salivary samples from mother and infant, discarded blood samples&#xD;
      from baby after the standard care lab tests are done, a single, optional blood draw at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study, and subjecting infants to a neurodevelopmental survey at study&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to test daily oral administration of 2'-FL 270 mg/day in&#xD;
      the milk of human milk-fed infants who are &gt;1000 gram to &lt;1500 gram birthweight.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, controlled trial, stratified on the mother's choice to feed her&#xD;
      infant using primarily either her own milk or donor milk. Half of study infants will receive&#xD;
      2'-FL in their milk and half will receive the same quantity of placebo (dextrose) added to&#xD;
      their milk. The first day the infant receives the test product (2'-FL or placebo) will be&#xD;
      designated as study day 1 (SDAY1). Infants will be followed until study dat 66 (SDAY66) or&#xD;
      hospital discharge, whichever comes first. The primary outcomes will be weight, length, and&#xD;
      head circumference growth from the start of the trial to its completion. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome will be time to achieving full enteral feeding (in days). Exploratory outcomes will&#xD;
      be neurobehavioral test scores obtained from a standardized Newborn Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      (NICU) Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) examination at 34 to 35 weeks corrected&#xD;
      gestational age (GA); fecal calprotectin; and fecal microbiome.&#xD;
