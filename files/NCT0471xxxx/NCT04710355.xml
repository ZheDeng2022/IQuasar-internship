    <textblock>
      In spinal cord stimulation (SCS), most outcome data are based on patient questionnaires. The&#xD;
      lack of tools for objective evaluation of the effects of SCS on chronic pain has posed a&#xD;
      barrier for providing solid proof of the therapy. Currently, however, SCS-devices with an&#xD;
      accelerator included are available on the market. The position orientation data provided by&#xD;
      the neurostimulator therefore gives new possibilities for objective measurement of gross&#xD;
      activity in daily life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although the interaction between chronic pain and physical functioning is a well-accepted&#xD;
      paradigm, objective data on how pain affects individuals' daily life is scanty. Most data are&#xD;
      based on patient questionnaires. The purpose of this study is to objectively assess the&#xD;
      activity of daily living in chronic pain patients treated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: Chronic pain in the low-back and/or leg(s) due to failed back surgery syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, open-label, multi-center, observational, study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 50 patients receiving an Intellis neurostimulator for treatment with SCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Centers: Up to 10 sites in Europe&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Utilize an existing neurostimulator-based data diary to measure gross daily activity in&#xD;
           patients with chronic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the usefulness of this data diary as a tool for objective evaluation of SCS&#xD;
           efficacy on chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate how the collected objective data relates to the subjective experience of the&#xD;
           patient when evaluating the effects of SCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials/Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) with chronic back and leg pain&#xD;
      that have been evaluated as candidates for SCS will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gross daily activity is recorded using the Intellis neurostimulator (Medtronic Inc.) which&#xD;
      contains a diary (AdaptiveStimâ„¢ Diary) that continuously stores data of seven different body&#xD;
      positions: upright, upright mobile, recline and 4 lying positions. Recordings are performed&#xD;
      for 4 weeks before the SCS trial (baseline) using an external Intellis device adhered to the&#xD;
      skin of the abdomen and thereafter, in patients who responded to SCS during the SCS-trial&#xD;
      period, utilizing the permanent Intellis implanted subcutaneously at the same site. Data will&#xD;
      be extracted from the data diary at 3, 6 and 12 months after implantation of the SCS system&#xD;
      and compared with changes in pain, quality of life and sleep as assessed by patient&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires using validated tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated duration of the study from first enrolment to final report is 24 months,&#xD;
      including a 10 months enrolment period. The estimated duration of a subject's participation&#xD;
      in the study is approximately 12 months. Interim analyses will be performed after 3 and 6&#xD;
      months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND The use of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for pain control has already a history of&#xD;
      more than 50 years. During the last decades many articles have been published, indicating the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of SCS in the pain management of chronic neuropathic pain, and in&#xD;
      particular in patients with chronic back and leg pain due to persisting, new or recurrent&#xD;
      pain after spinal surgery, so called failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS).1 In this patient&#xD;
      group the interaction between chronic pain and physical functioning is a well-accepted&#xD;
      paradigm, although objective data that shows how pain affects individuals' daily life is&#xD;
      scanty. Correlation between reduction in pain intensity and sustained improvement in physical&#xD;
      activity has previously been demonstrated using kinematical sensors.2.3 In SCS, most outcome&#xD;
      data are based on patient questionnaires. The lack of tools for objective evaluation of the&#xD;
      effects of SCS on chronic pain has posed a barrier for providing solid proof of the therapy.&#xD;
      Currently, however, SCS-devices with an accelerator included are available on the market. The&#xD;
      position orientation data provided by the neurostimulator therefore gives new possibilities&#xD;
      for objective measurement of gross activity in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an earlier single center pilot study with the first implantable neurostimulator with an&#xD;
      accelerometer the potential of objective outcome measurements was explored in six patients&#xD;
      with FBSS.4 A positive correlation between decrease in pain and increase in time spent in&#xD;
      upright position has been demonstrated by the preliminary pilot study utilizing this&#xD;
      neurostimulator in which position and upright/upright mobile changes were recorded based on&#xD;
      24-hour cycles. However, not all patients that experience good pain relief showed an&#xD;
      increased activity level depending on which position that is painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the new neurostimulator (Intellis), position changes and level of activity are recorded&#xD;
      on an hour by hour basis, which makes it possible to differentiate between day and night&#xD;
      activity. The goal of the current study is to repeat the pilot study on objective outcomes&#xD;
      with the newly available neurostimulator with inbuilt accelerometer using a prospective,&#xD;
      open-label, observational study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Utilize an existing neurostimulator-based data diary to measure gross daily activity in&#xD;
           patients with CBLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the usefulness of this data diary as a tool for objective evaluation of SCS&#xD;
           efficacy on CBLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate how the collected objective data relates to the subjective experience of the&#xD;
           patient when evaluating the effects of SCS.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline VAS at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS questionnaire is a standardized instrument that tries to measure the amount of pain that a patient feels across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain. Operationally a VAS is a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end. A score of 0 (zero) is &quot;no pain&quot; while a score of 10 (ten) is &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state.</description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life: EuroQoL Group - 5 Dimensional (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline EQ-5D at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQoL EQ-5D is a generic measure of self-rated health status, where health is characterized on five dimensions: mobility, self-care, ability to undertake usual activities, pain and anxiety/ depression. Patients are asked to indicate their level of health on each dimension using one of three levels: &quot;no health problems&quot;, &quot;moderate health problems&quot;, and &quot;severe health problems&quot;. Designed for self-completion, this scale provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status.</description>

    <measure>Disability: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline ODI at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ODI is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used by clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>
