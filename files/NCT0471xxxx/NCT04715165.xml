      Pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is common and may lead to delayed hospital discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is very commonly performed nowadays, and it has now&#xD;
      completely replaced open cholecystectomy in the management of biliary lithiasis. Although it&#xD;
      is minimally invasive surgery, pain in postoperative period is always major concern as it&#xD;
      increases perioperative stress, morbidity, and hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two components involved in pain after LC; the visceral component is due to tissue&#xD;
      damage in anterior abdominal wall during the insertion of trocar and shoulder tip pain due to&#xD;
      diaphragmatic irritation caused by Spillage of blood or bile and peritoneum stretching caused&#xD;
      by pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several methods employed in the management of postoperative pain after LC such as&#xD;
      conventional systemic analgesics, including paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs, systemic opioids, thoracic epidural analgesia, low-pressure pneumoperitoneum, and warm&#xD;
      air with all having its side effects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has got a substantial role in postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      after abdominal surgery because deposition of local anesthetics in transversus abdominis&#xD;
      fascial plane can produce sensory block over the anterior abdominal wall from T7 to L1. Many&#xD;
      clinical studies reported beneficial effects of TAP but results were mainly connected to&#xD;
      lower abdominal surgery. Since the major part of pain after LC derives from abdominal wall&#xD;
      incisions, some trials investigated TAP block as potential analgesic option. Some studies&#xD;
      showed that TAP block can reduce opioid requirements and pain scores but the results were not&#xD;
      conclusive enough because many differences in study designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound-guided (USG) subcostal transversus abdominis plane block (STAP), first&#xD;
      described by Hebbard 2008, is a variation of TAP which successfully solve the problem of&#xD;
      unreliable supraumbilical distribution of the block. Results obtained in a few small studies&#xD;
      showed significantly better analgesia after LC compare to traditional opioid analgesia,&#xD;
      port-site infiltration and standard TAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraperitoneal (IP) instillation of local anaesthetics around the operative site is used as&#xD;
      an analgesic technique on the assumption that conduction from visceral sites is obstructed&#xD;
      and may lessen the intensity of referred pain to the shoulder (C3, C4) which results from&#xD;
      irritation of diaphragmatic innervations, i.e., phrenic nerve (C3, C4, C5) and diaphragmatic&#xD;
      stretching due to gaseous distension, in the postoperative period. Narchi I' et al., as early&#xD;
      as in 1991 had reported that instillation of local anaesthetic (80 mL of bupivacaine 0.125%,&#xD;
      epinephrine (1:200,000) under the right diaphragm reduced shoulder pain after minor&#xD;
      gynaecologic laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a selective, short acting, agonist of the α2-adrenergic receptors. It has&#xD;
      high affinity to α2-adrenergic receptors (more than eight-fold) and lower affinity to&#xD;
      α1-receptors, compared with other α2-agonists agents, besides its great selectivity to&#xD;
      α2A-adrenergic receptors, which is responsible for its analgesic effect. It has been used&#xD;
      clinically as an adjunct to anesthesia and analgesia, and it is useful for painful surgical&#xD;
      procedure and ICU sedation.&#xD;
