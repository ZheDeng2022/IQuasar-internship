  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease&#xD;
      characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and incompletely reversible airflow&#xD;
      limitation. It is usually caused by airway and / or alveolar abnormalities caused by obvious&#xD;
      exposure to toxic particles or gases.COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of death in&#xD;
      the world, and is expected to be the third leading cause of death by 2020.HPP737 as an oral&#xD;
      PDE4 inhibitor for the treatment of COPD.Preclinical data showed that the activity of HPP737&#xD;
      was similar to that of rofloxacin, but HPP737 significantly reduced the permeability to CNS&#xD;
      and may have better tolerance. HPP737 will be used to develop indications for chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, and PK study in Chinese people is going to to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of HPP737 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      This PK study it to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HPP737 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      84 healthy subjects were included.A single dose of about 48 patients: expected 6mg, 10mg,&#xD;
      20mg, 40mg or undetermined, 12 subjects in each group, the ratio of HPP737 to placebo was 3:1&#xD;
      (9 cases: 3 cases), 6mg and 10mg could be carried out simultaneously.The dose group and the&#xD;
      total number of subjects can be adjusted according to the latest data obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were 36 patients with multiple doses: expected 10mg, 20mg, 40mg or undetermined, with&#xD;
      12 subjects in each group. The ratio of HPP737 to placebo was 3:1 (9 cases: 3 cases). The&#xD;
      dose group and total number of subjects could be adjusted according to the latest data.&#xD;
      Multiple dose group and single dose group can be carried out simultaneously. Each multiple&#xD;
      dose group will be enrolled after the first subject in the same dose group of single dose is&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
