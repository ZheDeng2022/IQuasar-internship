  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molecular alterations in Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) genes have been associated&#xD;
      with clinical benefit from chemotherapy and/or Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors&#xD;
      in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Therefore, the performance of tumor molecular&#xD;
      profiling is currently recommended by international guidelines at initial diagnosis, among&#xD;
      other reasons, for the modification of the treatment plan. The investigators' hypothesis was&#xD;
      that tumor molecular profiling reveals additional parameters that can improve the predictive&#xD;
      and prognostic role of the mere presence of HRR gene mutations. The study aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the prognostic and predictive role of clonality of pathogenic variants in HRR&#xD;
      genes and/or concurrent pathogenic variants in other clinically relevant genes.&#xD;

    <description>Tumor tissue processing and all NGS genotyping were performed at the Laboratory of Molecular Oncology (Hellenic Foundation for Cancer Research / AUTH). Paraffin H&amp;E sections from the retrieved tissue blocks were centrally reviewed for tumor histology and tissue adequacy for DNA extraction and were marked for macrodissection along with tumor DNA content [(former tumor cell content (TCC%)] assessment. DNA was extracted from macrodissected tissue fragments with the QIAamp® DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), measured in a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK), and genotyped with NGS in an Ion Torrent Proton sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by using a previously published custom panel (Kotoula, Lakis et al. 2019). Following stringent variant quality filtering (Kotoula, Chatzopoulos et al. 2021), 500 tumors</description>

        Patients with epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma with archival tumor tissue available for&#xD;
        analysis were identified through the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG)'s tumor&#xD;
        repository. Patients had received treatment at HeCOG-affiliated institutions from following&#xD;
        standard international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In total, 501 patients with ovarian adenocarcinoma were included in the study (median age&#xD;
        at ovarian cancer diagnosis was 58 years). Tumor histological types included predominantly&#xD;
        high-grade serous, followed by endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas. All except 3&#xD;
        patients underwent surgery at initial diagnosis, most commonly total abdominal hysterectomy&#xD;
        with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.&#xD;
