  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare&#xD;
      the effects of arthroscopic debridement and repair for Ellman grade II bursal-side&#xD;
      partial-thickness rotator cuff tears.The hypothesis was that there would be no difference in&#xD;
      prognosis between arthroscopic debridement and repair.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, comparing&#xD;
      arthroscopic debridement and arthroscopic repair for Ellman grade II BPTRCTs. Participants&#xD;
      were recruited from September 2017 to April 2019. Before initiating the trial, an&#xD;
      investigator who was not involved in the study generated a computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      list (block length 10, ratio 1:1). Allocation concealment was achieved by using opaque,&#xD;
      sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes containing details of group assignment. Assignment&#xD;
      occurred after baseline information was recorded. Whereas participants and surgeons were&#xD;
      aware of the group assignments, the outcome assessors and data analysts were remained blinded&#xD;
      during the study period. Operations were performed by the same team of sports medicine&#xD;
      surgeons under general anesthesia. For the debridement group, only stump refreshing and&#xD;
      surrounding soft tissue cleaning were performed. For the repair group, partial tears were&#xD;
      converted into full-thickness tears and sutured. The sample size calculation was based on&#xD;
      data from previous studies, where the difference in Constant-Murray Shoulder (CMS) score&#xD;
      between patients with arthroscopic repair and arthroscopic debridement was 8.81 points (93.90&#xD;
      vs. 85.09) with standard deviations of 5.4 and 21. Accepting an α risk of 0.05 and a β risk&#xD;
      of 0.2 in a bilateral contrast, the minimum sample size required for each group was 35. To&#xD;
      compensate for an estimated 15% loss to follow up, at least 82 patients would be included.&#xD;
