  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 2-arm RCT that will assess the efficacy of a culturally adapted, 10-session&#xD;
      SGM-affirmative, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) among young men who have&#xD;
      sex with men (YMSM) in Hunan province China. The affirmative treatment called ESTEEM is based&#xD;
      on a minority stress-focused, CBT framework. In collaboration with colleagues at Central&#xD;
      South University (CSU), the investigators will assess whether a culturally adapted version of&#xD;
      iCBT ESTEEM demonstrates significant reductions in HIV risk behavior and mental health&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) compared to self-monitoring of stress and mood.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a Chinese-adapted version of&#xD;
      iCBT ESTEEM on YMSM's sexual health and HIV risk behavior. The secondary objectives of this&#xD;
      study are to determine whether iCBT ESTEEM impacts HIV/sexually transmitted infections (STI)&#xD;
      results and symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as whether baseline minority stress&#xD;
      exposure moderates treatment efficacy, such that participants with the most minority stress&#xD;
      exposure benefit more from iCBT ESTEEM than those in the self-monitoring of stress and mood&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed prospective study will follow a 2-arm RCT design where 120 Chinese YMSM&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ESTEEM iCBT: This online CBT treatment consists of 10 weekly modules that participants&#xD;
           will complete over the course of 10 weeks. Modules contain weekly psychoeducational text&#xD;
           and vignettes about minority stress and mental health; brief videos illustrating the CBT&#xD;
           skills; and homework exercises that therapists review and provide feedback on. Homework&#xD;
           exercises include weekly tracking of stress and mood, practicing new skills (e.g.,&#xD;
           mindfulness, cognitive restructuring), and exercises related to considering the origins&#xD;
           of stress and negative emotions that participants may be experiencing. Therapists&#xD;
           provide feedback after each homework assignment, including reviewing each participant's&#xD;
           treatment goals as part of the first session's homework. Therapists who support this&#xD;
           condition will be instructed to incorporate SGM-specific content and feedback into&#xD;
           homework reviews. In the US, modules were adapted directly from the in-person materials&#xD;
           (e.g., therapist manual, participant handouts) used in our previously successful trials&#xD;
           of this treatment. The treatment has also been recently culturally adapted for in-person&#xD;
           treatment among Chinese YMSM and found to be acceptable and feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-monitoring control: In this control condition, participants will be asked to&#xD;
           indicate their past 7-day mood, stress experiences, and mental and behavioral health on&#xD;
           an online survey. This type of self-monitoring has been shown to yield improvement in&#xD;
           behavioral health outcomes. Self-reporting SGM stress experiences has also been shown to&#xD;
           produce reductions in depression symptoms over time. Participants will record these&#xD;
           experiences once per week for 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the full trial is launched, the investigators will ensure comprehension of the ESTEEM&#xD;
      iCBT online module material with 10 separate YMSM, as well as gather their feedback on the&#xD;
      usability of the iCBT online platform.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in HIV-Related Sexual Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 months, 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) assesses retrospective estimates of HIV-related sexual behavior in the past 30 days. The TLFB was originally developed in interview format, but has been adapted as online self-report questionnaire. Participants report on daily partner type (e.g. main, casual), type of sexual behavior (e.g. insertive anal sex, receptive anal sex, oral sex), and condom use. The TLFB has good test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and agreement with collateral reports for HIV-related sexual behavior. Administration time ranges from 10-30 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Condom Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 months, 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Decisional Balance for Condom Use Scale is an 18-item psychometrically validated scale measuring one's motivation to increase condom use (e.g., &quot;I would feel bad if my friends found out I had sex without a condom&quot;), with response options ranging between 1 = not at all to 5 = extremely. Lower scores are indicative of greater likelihood to use a condom. Administration time is less than 5 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Safer Sex</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 months, 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Safer Sex Questionnaire is a psychometrically validated measure and consists of 13-items based on a 5-point Likert scale assessing one's confidence in avoiding having anal sex without a condom in various contexts. Higher scores are indicative of greater safer sex self-efficacy. Administration time is less than 5 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in HIV/STI Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 months, 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Past 4-month HIV/STI Testing Questionnaire consists of 7 multiple choice questions previously developed by the study PI for another study asking participants about their HIV/STI testing history. The questionnaire consists of questions, such as, &quot;Have you provided a urine sample as part of any STI test in the last 4 months&quot; with response options of &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;I don't remember.&quot; More &quot;yes&quot; responses indicate greater HIV/STI testing in the past 4 months. Administration time is less than 5 minutes.</description>
