    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of LISA used in the delivery room (DR) in&#xD;
      decreasing the intubation rates in preterm infants at 23-25 weeks gestational age (GA),&#xD;
      during first 72 hours compared to the standard approach of stabilization on nasal CPAP in the&#xD;
      DR and administering surfactant in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in both groups will be resuscitated per NRP algorithm. Infants who maintain a stable&#xD;
      HR and respiratory effort on CPAP will qualify for the intervention. Infants in Group 1&#xD;
      (Intervention arm) will receive LISA in DR. CPAP will be titrated between 5-8 cm H20 after&#xD;
      LISA. Infants in Group 2 (Control arm) will be transferred to NICU on CPAP. The CPAP level&#xD;
      will be increased stepwise every 30 minutes to 7 cm H2O if FiO2 ≥0.3. Infants requiring CPAP&#xD;
      7 at FiO2 ≥0.3 will receive LISA. CPAP will be titrated between 5-8 cm H20 after LISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in both arms requiring CPAP 7 and FiO2 &gt;0.8 at 20 MOL in the delivery room will be&#xD;
      intubated in DR. Any infant with a heart rate not responding with appropriate PPV will be&#xD;
      intubated in the DR. CXR will be obtain on admission and umbilical lines will be placed.&#xD;
      Infants in both arm who require FiO2 ≥0.6 for ≥1 hour, apnea requiring stimulation 3 times&#xD;
      within one hour or ≥6 over 6 hour period, any apnea requiring PPV, or CO2 &gt;0.65 in two&#xD;
      consecutive blood gases drawn over two hours will be considered as reasons for intubation&#xD;
      after LISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the need for MV within 72 hours of life, secondary outcome includes need&#xD;
      for MV during first week of life and during hospital stay, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD),&#xD;
      intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), spontaneous intestinal&#xD;
      perforation (SIP), need for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), composite death or&#xD;
      BPD and mortality. This is a feasibility trial with the intention to enroll 30 infants in&#xD;
      each arm of the study over three years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, unblinded, randomized control, feasibility trial to evaluate the use&#xD;
      of LISA in the DR for extremely preterm infants born 23-25 weeks GA who were successfully&#xD;
      resuscitated without being intubated. The study team will approach a mother who is at risk of&#xD;
      delivering an infant between 23-25 week GA for consent to be included in the study. Infants&#xD;
      will be resuscitated according to NRP algorithm. Infants who are successfully resuscitated&#xD;
      without requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation (HR &gt;100, regular spontaneous&#xD;
      respiratory effort, able to maintain oxygenation per NRP target saturation goal) are eligible&#xD;
      for enrollment. Randomization will be achieved by opening an opaque envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention arm (DR-LISA): Infants with a stable heart rate and spontaneous respiratory&#xD;
           effort on CPAP are eligible for surfactant therapy. A LISA catheter will be prepared for&#xD;
           use prior to the birth of the infant. Surfactant will be drawn into a syringe soon after&#xD;
           the initial stabilization. A trained physician will perform LISA. The infant will be&#xD;
           maintained on CPAP by prongs during the procedure. PPV will be provided if needed after&#xD;
           the procedure. The infant will be monitored in the DR for stable HR, respiration and&#xD;
           SpO2 prior to being moved to a transporter. Infants requiring FiO2 &gt;0.8 on CPAP 8 cm H2O&#xD;
           to maintain SpO2 88-94% by 20 minutes of life will be intubated prior to transport.&#xD;
           After admission to NICU, CPAP level will be titrated between 5-8 cm H20 based on FiO2&#xD;
           threshold ≥0.3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm: Infants will be resuscitated per NRP guidelines. Infant with stable HR and&#xD;
           respiratory effort will be changed to binasal prongs and transported to NICU on CPAP.&#xD;
           CPAP level be titrated between 5- 7 cm H2O in the DR. Infants requiring FiO2 &gt;0.8 to&#xD;
           maintain SpO2 88-94% by 20 minutes of life will be intubated in DR. After admission to&#xD;
           NICU, CPAP will be escalated every 30 minutes up to a maximum level of 7 cm H2O at which&#xD;
           point infant would qualify for LISA if the FiO2 requirement is ≥0.3. CPAP level will be&#xD;
           titrated between 5-8 cm H20 based on FiO2 threshold ≥0.3. Infants in both groups who&#xD;
           require FiO2 ≥0.6 for ≥1 hour, apnea requiring stimulation 3 times within one hour or ≥6&#xD;
           over 6 hour period, any apnea requiring PPV, or CO2 &gt;0.65 in two consecutive blood gases&#xD;
           drawn over two hours will be considered as reasons for intubation after LISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat doses of surfactant will be administered every 12 hours for FiO2 ≥0.4 up to a maximum&#xD;
      of three doses.&#xD;

    <description>LISA administered in the DR after initial resuscitation or in the NICU after stepwise escalation of CPAP based on FiO2 ≥0.3. While maintaining infant on CPAP with binasal prongs/small nasal mask, a thin catheter (Hobart method) is inserted below the vocal cord using direct laryngoscopy. Poractant alfa (200mg/kg) is administered slowly over 2-3 minutes. Catheter is then withdrawn and infant is maintained on CPAP</description>
