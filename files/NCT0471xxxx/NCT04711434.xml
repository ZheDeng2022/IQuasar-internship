      This study aims to explore the role of PD-1 Antibody in preventing adenomatous polyps and&#xD;
      second primary tumors in patients with Lynch Syndrome. There two arms, one is the&#xD;
      experimental arm (PD-1 antibody prevention group) and the other is the control arm (routine&#xD;
      follow-up group). For the experimental group, Tripleitriumab (PD-1 antibody) is given every 3&#xD;
      months for a year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lynch syndrome (LS) is a hereditary cancer syndrome that causes the majority of hereditary&#xD;
      CRC and approximately 3% of all CRC. LS significantly increases the risk for an individual to&#xD;
      develop CRC during their lifetime. Individuals with LS also have an increased risk to develop&#xD;
      extracolonic cancers, including endometrial, gastric, ovarian, upper urinary tract, small&#xD;
      bowel, biliary tract, CNS, and certain types of skin cancer. Given the hereditary nature of&#xD;
      this syndrome, preventing second primary tumors in patients with Lynch Syndrome after surgery&#xD;
      to the primary site is very important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to prevent adenomatous polyps and second primary tumors using&#xD;
      PD-1 antibody (Tripleitriumab) in patients with Lynch Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the incidence of intestinal adenomatous polyps and&#xD;
      secondary primary tumors. The secondary outcomes are the incidence of colorectal adenomatous&#xD;
      polyps greater than 1cm, incidence of high-grade colorectal polyps, treatment-related adverse&#xD;
      events, disease-free Survival and overall Survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two groups: the PD-1 antibody prevention group and the routine follow-up group. For&#xD;
      the PD-1 antibody prevention group, participants will receive Toripalimab 240mg IV every 3&#xD;
      months for a year. For the routine follow-up group, there is no drug intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This whole study will take 5 years: the first year for recruiting and the latter four years&#xD;
      for follow-up.&#xD;
