  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is one of the major contributing factors for the development of chronic&#xD;
      diseases and highly correlated with increased all-cause mortality. In the last decade an&#xD;
      exponential growth in research concerned with the study of sedentary behaviour and the&#xD;
      potential for detrimental effects on health have been published. In this field increasing&#xD;
      evidence suggests that prolonged periods of sedentary time, independent of the amount of&#xD;
      physical activity, also increases the risk for the development of several chronic conditions&#xD;
      and all-cause mortality. Here, sedentary behaviour is defined as &quot;any waking behaviour,&#xD;
      characterized by a low energy expenditure (â‰¤1.5 METs), while being in a sitting or reclining&#xD;
      posture&quot;. Interestingly, the advised moderate-to-vigorous bouts of exercise recommended by&#xD;
      the various guidelines cannot compensate the negative impact on health risks arising from&#xD;
      prolonged periods of sitting. In other words, it seems that people compensate their total&#xD;
      amount of physical activity after exercise training by decreasing their physical activity&#xD;
      levels throughout the rest of the day. Here, it appears that frequent, even low-intensity&#xD;
      interruptions of periods of sitting are required for good cardiometabolic health. Therefore,&#xD;
      not only physical activity but also prolonged sitting should be targeted to optimize&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health. Nevertheless, a recent harmonized meta-syntheses indicated that the&#xD;
      association between self-reported sitting with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality&#xD;
      are only partially independent of physical activity, but were particularly evident in those&#xD;
      who undertake insufficient physical activity (&lt;150min/week). However, it is unclear whether&#xD;
      high amounts of objectively measured physical activity attenuates or even eliminates the&#xD;
      detrimental effects of prolonged sitting. In addition, it is still unclear whether high&#xD;
      amounts of physical activity can preserve a healthy cardiometabolic risk profile, despite&#xD;
      prolonged sitting. Therefore, in this study we want to investigate the association between&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour, physical activity and cardiometabolic health in highly physically active&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
