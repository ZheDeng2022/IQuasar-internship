  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will address the scarcity of research and the variations in recommendations&#xD;
      regarding core strengthening and stability programs. As physical fitness is a major concern&#xD;
      of individuals and mostly people refer gym for fitness enhancement, this study will thus&#xD;
      provide a guideline for effective core strength training program&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male clients, aged 19 to 44 years, coming to the gym for strength training will be&#xD;
      purposively selected based on the inclusion criteria and then randomly assigned into two&#xD;
      groups. They will undergo a series of pre-intervention tests that would assess their strength&#xD;
      using Bourbon TMS and standing long jump tests; flexibility using stand and reach test;&#xD;
      balance using Y balance test; coordination using jumping sideways test and speed using 20-m&#xD;
      sprint test. After initial assessment, they will be advised and demonstrated for curl-up,&#xD;
      side-bridging and quadrupled exercises. The experimental group will perform these exercises&#xD;
      on Thera-BandÂ© Exercise Ball while the control group will perform the same exercises on gym&#xD;
      floor. The clients will have sessions on preferably the first day and 4th day of the week but&#xD;
      is subject to their attendance at the gym. There will be interval assessments at 2nd and 4th&#xD;
      week based on the tests mentioned above to record changes at these intervals. After 6 weeks&#xD;
      of bi-weekly sessions, the clients will undergo post-intervention tests that will be the same&#xD;
      as pre-intervention tests.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bourbon TMS test (core strength)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Bourbon Trunk Muscle Strength(TMS) test is an economical measure for assessment of dorsal, ventral and lateral trunk muscle chains.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stand-and-reach test (flexibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is used for the measurement of spinal and pelvic flexibility. Excellent test-retest reliability has been reported for the stand-and-reach test with an ICC of 0.94.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>20-m sprint test (speed)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum effort sprints will be assessed from a stationary start to a distance of 20 meters to assess the speed of participant. Excellent test-retest reliability has been reported for the hand stopped 20-m sprint test with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.90 variable</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Jumping Sideways Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The jumping sideways test evaluates motor coordination under time pressure. Excellent test-retest reliability has been reported for the jumping sideways test with an ICC of 0.89</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Y Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The lower quarter Y balance test is a dynamic test that requires subjects to maintain single leg stance while reaching as far as possible with the contralateral leg in 3 different movement directions (i.e., anterior, posteromedial, posterolateral). Excellent test retest reliability has been reported for the Y balance test in all 3 movement directions with ICC values ranging between 0.89 and 0.93.</description>
