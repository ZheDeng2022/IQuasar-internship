      Investigators research team conducted a previous human clinical trial of brown algae and&#xD;
      conducted liver and metabolic indicators of brown algae to improve nonalcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease, and found brown algae extract (LMF-HSFx, commodity In addition to reducing the liver&#xD;
      function index, HbA1c in some patients with early stage diabetes or type 2 diabetes has an&#xD;
      improved effect. In the mouse model of type 2 diabetes, comprehensive anti-hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      anti-hyperlipidemia and hepatoprotective activity were studied using LMF-HSFx. Intake of&#xD;
      LMF-HSFx reduced fasting blood glucose, increased adiponectin levels, reduced urine glucose,&#xD;
      and improved hepatic glucose metabolism. LMF-HSFx can improve glucose and lipid metabolism in&#xD;
      adipose tissue of diabetic mice, and inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-6 can also be&#xD;
      reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study,participants will be given Fuco-HiQ, and their effects on blood glucose and&#xD;
      various metabolic indicators will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Brown seaweeds rich in flavonoids and bioactive polysaccharides have been shown the potential&#xD;
      effects on suppressing fat accumulation, oxidative stress and inflammation in liver. The&#xD;
      refined seaweed compounds such as low-molecular-weight-fucoidan (LMF) and high stability&#xD;
      fucoxanthin (HSFx), have not been well studied for its biological function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high stability fucoxanthin (HSFx) and the low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMF) were&#xD;
      produced by HiQ Marine Biotech Company in Taiwan. Study use fucoidan-fucoxanthin mixture&#xD;
      (abbreviated as LMF-HSFx, each capsule contains 275 mg LMF and 275 mg HSFx).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin resistance has a high correlation with fatty liver. Our research team conducted a&#xD;
      previous human clinical trial of brown algae and conducted liver and metabolic indicators of&#xD;
      brown algae to improve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and found brown algae extract&#xD;
      (LMF-HSFx, commodity In addition to reducing the liver function index, HbA1c in some patients&#xD;
      with early stage diabetes or type 2 diabetes has an improved effect. In the mouse model of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, comprehensive anti-hyperglycemia, anti-hyperlipidemia and hepatoprotective&#xD;
      activity were studied using LMF-HSFx. Intake of LMF-HSFx reduced fasting blood glucose,&#xD;
      increased adiponectin levels, reduced urine glucose, and improved hepatic glucose metabolism.&#xD;
      LMF-HSFx can improve glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue of diabetic mice, and&#xD;
      inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-6 can also be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these studies, we hope to further explore whether LMF-HSFx can improve insulin&#xD;
      resistance and thus assist blood glucose control.In this study,subjects will be given&#xD;
      Fuco-HiQ, and their effects on blood glucose and various metabolic indicators will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
