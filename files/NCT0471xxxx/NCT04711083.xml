    <textblock>
      Nocturnal reduction in blood oxygen is expected independently associated with the development&#xD;
      of worsened glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to assess the correlation between nocturnal oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation assessed by overnight pulse oximetry and glycemic control in diabetic patients&#xD;
      with obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a prevalent illness showing a heterogeneous&#xD;
      symptom presentation, which ranges from low clinical suspicion to evident limitations in the&#xD;
      quality of life. The main reasons for this variability relate to its potential association&#xD;
      with major concomitant diseases, which include diabetes and a variety of cardiovascular&#xD;
      pathologies. (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, OSA is a known risk factor for many comorbid disorders, causing resistance to&#xD;
      conventional treatments and increasing the risk of mortality, which multiplies health care&#xD;
      expenditures and even though the distribution of comorbidities differs between men and women,&#xD;
      their effect progressively increases with OSA severity (2,3) Occurrence of apneic events and&#xD;
      Reduction in blood oxygen and elevations in blood carbon dioxide are sensed by chemoreceptors&#xD;
      in the brain and carotid bodies, which trigger brief microarousals and result in sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nocturnal reduction in blood oxygen has also been independently associated with the&#xD;
      development of worsened glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to assess the correlation between nocturnal oxygen desaturation assessed by overnight pulse&#xD;
      oximetry and glycemic control in diabetic patients with obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted on all patients referred for evaluation of sleep related&#xD;
      breathing disorders. All Medical files were reviewed. Data collected included .full medical&#xD;
      history, demographics, measurements of weight and height, body mass index in kg/m2, neck&#xD;
      circumference (NC), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, measurements of overnight pulse&#xD;
      oximetryglyceminc control (measurement of glycated HB, fasting and 2h postprandial blood&#xD;
      sugar)The diagnosis that was concluded after a polysomnography study.&#xD;

    <description>Wrist worn Overnight oximetry was performed using portable Nonin 2500 (Nonin Medical Inc., USA) pulse oximeters. The test was explained to the subjects and their caregiver by experienced health-care staff from the sleep unit. The recording was done at home and started just before going to bed and ended on awakening; the recommended duration was a minimum of 5 h and a maximum of 7 h. The awake SpO2, mean SpO2. The data were analysed to calculate the overnight minimum SpO2, mean SpO2, dip frequency (defined as a fall in SpO2 of &gt; 4%), the percentage of oximetry sleep time spent with a SpO2 of &lt; 90%, and the total oximetry time. Recordings were classified as &quot;normal&quot; (&lt; 4.9 desaturation events an hour), &quot;equivocal&quot; (5 to 14.9 desaturation events an hour), or &quot;abnormal&quot; (&gt; 15 desaturation events an hour) according to the severity and pattern of nocturnal desaturation observed .</description>
