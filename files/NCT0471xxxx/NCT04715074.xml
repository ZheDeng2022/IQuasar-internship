  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dr. Rogers' long-term goal is to better understand the etiology of an early-onset colorectal&#xD;
      (CRC) diagnosis and to improve long-term survivorship and quality of life for early-onset CRC&#xD;
      (EOCRC) survivors globally by studying the burdens accompanying this condition. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to better understand the reasons why people under age 50 in Utah are being&#xD;
      diagnosed with CRC. As a first step, the researchers plan to identify the specific places in&#xD;
      Utah where diagnoses of CRC among younger people are increasing the most. Next, they plan to&#xD;
      conduct 1-hour recorded Zoom interviews over phone and/or video with 20 people who live in&#xD;
      these places and were diagnosed with CRC when they were under age 50. Thirdly, the&#xD;
      researchers plan to create and test a program that will raise Utahns' awareness of the&#xD;
      increasing risk of CRC among residents of the state who are aged under 50. This study is&#xD;
      unique as CRC survivors are key to helping drive the study forward.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is preventable when detected early. Because of effective screening,&#xD;
      fewer Americans aged 50 and older are now being diagnosed with CRC or dying from it. Over the&#xD;
      past 20 years, however, the number of Americans under age 50 who are diagnosed with CRC has&#xD;
      doubled. Health experts estimate that the numbers of younger Americans with CRC will continue&#xD;
      to increase rapidly over the next 10 years. The reasons for this increase are poorly&#xD;
      understood. In addition, younger people are less likely to be diagnosed with CRC when the&#xD;
      disease is still at an early stage. Also, of concern is that among men and women of all ages&#xD;
      and all races, African-American men are the most likely to die of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central hypotheses are: (1) Patients residing in hotspots-counties with high EOCRC&#xD;
      incidence/mortality rates-will have significantly worse EOCRC survival juxtaposed to those in&#xD;
      other Utah areas. (2) Rurality and county-level access to health care will contribute to an&#xD;
      explanation of EOCRC incidence and survival.&#xD;

    <description>We will use quantitative methods to link incidence and mortality data for the years 2000 to 2020 from the Utah Cancer Registry (UCR) and the Utah Population Database (UPDB) to derive county-level estimates of hotspots for early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) incidence and mortality among Utahns aged 18 to 49 years and obtain county-level estimates using our previous geospatial methods.21 Counties with high EOCRC incidence and/or mortality rates will be identified as hotspots. Next, we will use UCR-UPDB linked data to determine the independent contributions of (1) geographical, (2) personal, and (3) county-level factors to EOCRC incidence and survival. We will perform hierarchical Cox regression models and implement a generalized R-square analysis to determine the variance explained by each factor.</description>

    <description>For Objective 2 (Year 1), we will draw on factors associated with hotspots identified in Objective 1 and our team's prior research21,29-33 to develop an interview guide with six EOCRC advocate-survivors. Using the interview guide, we will conduct one-on-one interviews with 20 individuals who received a first diagnosis of CRC at age 18 to 49 years to yield a richer understanding of the impact of psychosocial, lifestyle, and familial aspects on an EOCRC diagnosis. The qualitative data obtained from these interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Hatch's methods as previously used by our team.34-36</description>

    <description>Linking incidence and mortality data (years 2000-2020) from the Utah Cancer Registry (UCR) and the Utah Population Database (UPDB), we will derive county-level estimates of hotspots for EOCRC incidence and mortality among Utahns aged 18-49; we will obtain county-level estimates using our geospatial methods.39 Counties with high EOCRC incidence and/or mortality rates will be identified as hotspots.&#xD;
Using UCR-UPBD linked data, we will determine independent contributions of (1) geographical, (2) personal, and (3) county-level factors on EOCRC incidence/survival. We will perform hierarchical Cox regression models and implement a generalized R-square analysis to determine the variance explained by each factor.&#xD;
Central hypotheses: (1) Patients residing in hotspots will have significantly worse EOCRC survival compared with those residing in other Utah areas. (2) Rurality and county-level access to healthcare will contribute to an explanation of EOCRC incidence/survival.</description>

    <description>Intervention development will be informed by (1) integrating Aims 1 and 2 findings, (2) Community Action Board [CAB] input, and (3) the Behaviour Change Wheel,48 a step-by-step intervention development approach that identifies and addresses barriers using theory and evidence-based methods.&#xD;
The intervention pilot may be based on a multicomponent media campaign, as endorsed by the Community Preventive Services Taskforce for promoting CRC screening among individuals â‰¥ age 50.49,50 iBeat CRC may entail both outdoor mass media and online social media. iBeat CRC will target Utah hotspots and non-hotspots for comparison, with pre-post-assessment among 17 individuals in each group.</description>
