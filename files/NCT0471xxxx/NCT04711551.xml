  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the aim is to improve the evaluation of the outcomes of regenerative medicine treatments&#xD;
      performed in the regenerative medicine centers involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients who undergo regenerative medicine treatments present acute and chronic pathologies&#xD;
      of the musculoskeletal system, of the stomatological system and of the integuments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective pre, peri and post treatment evaluations are collected. A dedicated software&#xD;
      collects the PROMs compiled by the patients, the objective clinical data and the biomolecular&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
