    <textblock>
      A feasibility controlled trial of an eight-session group intervention for siblings of&#xD;
      children who have an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be recruited from a multi-academy trust of nine schools. Due to the on-going&#xD;
      impact of COVID-19 restrictions, children will be allocated to the intervention condition&#xD;
      (eight session support group) if they are physically attending school and to the control&#xD;
      condition (receipt of a booklet) if they remain at home. Pre and post outcome measures will&#xD;
      be completed by children and their parents in both research arms.&#xD;
