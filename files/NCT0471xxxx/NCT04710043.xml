  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multisite Phase I dose escalation, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) trial of BNT152+153 in various solid tumor indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will enroll patients with various solid tumors that are metastatic or&#xD;
      unresectable for whom there is no available standard therapy likely to confer clinical&#xD;
      benefit, or patients who are not candidates for such available therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of Part 1 and Part 2 with adaptive design elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 consists of Groups A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group A is a BNT153 monotherapy dose escalation in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
                malignancies until the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) is defined. If MTD is not&#xD;
                reached, maximum administered dose (MAD) may be used for further development (or&#xD;
                another dose as determined by the safety review committee (SRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group B is a BNT152 monotherapy dose escalation in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
                malignancies until the MTD or optimal biological dose (OBD) is defined, whichever&#xD;
                occurs earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group A will be activated first and activation of Group B is at sponsor's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 will start once Part 1 is completed, i.e., dose escalations for both BNT152 and&#xD;
           BNT153 monotherapy are completed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A man who is sexually active with a WOCBP and has not had a vasectomy must agree to&#xD;
             use a barrier method of birth control, e.g., either condom with spermicidal&#xD;
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
             cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, and all men&#xD;
