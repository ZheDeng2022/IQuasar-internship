  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have among the highest rates of new HIV infections of&#xD;
      any group in the United States. Developing effective HIV prevention interventions that work&#xD;
      with this group is a critical element of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. In the first phase&#xD;
      of our study (&quot;the ethnographic phase&quot;), the investigators will carry out community-based&#xD;
      research that will explore structural, social and cultural factors relevant to how Black MSM&#xD;
      might engage with Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). This phase of community-based research&#xD;
      will inform the design of an enhanced PrEP adherence intervention, which will be subsequently&#xD;
      tested at a community-based health clinic in Harlem in the second phase of the project.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN This randomized clinical trial will enroll HIV-uninfected Black&#xD;
      MSM and transgender females (TGF) and randomly assign them to receive enhanced versus&#xD;
      standard PrEP adherence packages. Study participants will receive PrEP-related clinical care&#xD;
      at Harlem United, a community-based healthcare provider in New York City's Central Harlem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective Compare the effectiveness of enhanced versus standard packages for&#xD;
      increasing adherence to PrEP in a community-based primary care clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the enhanced and standard PrEP adherence packages on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sexual risk behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  retention in care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PrEP knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  seroconversions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the safety of PrEP among participants as measured by the type and frequency of&#xD;
           adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe acceptability of daily PrEP among Black MSM and TGF generally and among those&#xD;
           who have agreed to take PrEP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is an open-label, randomized clinical trial that aims to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an enhanced PrEP adherence package compared to a standard PrEP adherence&#xD;
      package on PrEP adherence. PrEP uptake, acceptability, safety, retention in care, and&#xD;
      feasibility will also be measured. Participants will be prescribed once daily oral&#xD;
      co-formulated emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) by physicians at Harlem&#xD;
      United, a community-based primary-care clinic located in Harlem, New York City. 200&#xD;
      participants will be recruited through: Harlem United client services; studies being&#xD;
      conducted at the Harlem Prevention Center; the study's ethnographic component; and targeted&#xD;
      direct recruitment strategies. Each participant will receive PrEP for one year. In addition&#xD;
      to PrEP, all participants will receive comprehensive HIV prevention services with access to&#xD;
      condoms, risk reduction counseling, and STI screening and treatment. Participants will have&#xD;
      follow up clinical visits at 12 week intervals to be evaluated for side effects, renal&#xD;
      toxicity, adherence, risk behavior, and HIV seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will assess: 1) correlates of PrEP knowledge, uptake, safety,&#xD;
      retention in care, and acceptability among Black MSM and TGF individuals who are determined&#xD;
      to be eligible for PrEP based on self-reported sexual risk behavior and history of sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infections (STIs); and 2) patterns and correlates of adherence among participants&#xD;
      in the study. The project will also assess other aspects of PrEP feasibility including risk&#xD;
      compensation and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first eligible 50 individuals who are agree to be in the study but decline to take PrEP&#xD;
      will be asked to answer a brief set of questions about the reasons for their decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Site The study will be implemented in Harlem, New York by the Harlem&#xD;
      Prevention Center (HPC), Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. HPC is located&#xD;
      on 125th Street in Central Harlem and is the home for various HIV and tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
      studies, including HIV prevention studies. Informed consent and research interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted and study records stored at HPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harlem United (HU), a community-based organization offering health and social services in&#xD;
      Central Harlem, will serve as the locus of many study activities. HU has the capacity to&#xD;
      comply with the protocol, project-specific procedures, and all applicable regulations. HU&#xD;
      locations include 1) HOME (Helping Our Members Evolve), a drop-in center for younger MSM and&#xD;
      TGF clients, 2) the Prevention Center which provides non-clinical HIV and non-HIV services to&#xD;
      clients of all ages and genders, and 3) the Willis P. Green Jr Clinic providing HIV and&#xD;
      non-HIV medical services. All sites have reception areas with waiting areas, counseling&#xD;
      rooms, private rooms for HIV testing, and data management areas. Additionally, the clinic has&#xD;
      physical examination rooms, medication storage areas, and access to laboratory facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Population The study population is Black MSM and TGF, who are at-risk&#xD;
      for HIV infection. MSM and TGF at-risk for HIV infection are defined as men or male-to-female&#xD;
      transgendered individuals who report indicators of HIV risk. We expect that approximately 95%&#xD;
      of participants will be MSM due to their larger population size in the Harlem community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES Individuals who meet criteria for the study will receive a referral for&#xD;
      medical assessment. Individuals who are medically eligible to take PrEP and who agree to&#xD;
      initiate PrEP will provide Informed Consent. They will then be given a 30-day PrEP&#xD;
      prescription, followed by a baseline research interview. After enrollment, participants will&#xD;
      be seen for a 4-week follow-up visit to be evaluated for evidence of HIV seroconversion,&#xD;
      adherence to medication, and clinical toxicity. Subsequent medical and research follow-up&#xD;
      visits will occur at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. Quarterly medical visits will&#xD;
      include testing for HIV and STIs as per clinic protocol. In addition, study participants will&#xD;
      have creatinine levels checked and will receive brief adherence and risk reduction&#xD;
      counseling. Participants who wish to discontinue PrEP will remain in the study and may resume&#xD;
      PrEP. Those who discontinue PrEP and wish to leave the study will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      exit interview.&#xD;
