  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to their role in allergic inflammation, mast cells are often found at the site of&#xD;
      tumors. They have been attributed both to pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles depending on the&#xD;
      tumor type. Secretion of mast cell mediators such as histamine, tryptase, fibroblast growth&#xD;
      factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) can&#xD;
      enhance tumor growth and angiogenesis while TNF-a and heparin act as tumor suppressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-small cell lung cancer constitutes the majority of cases of lung cancer. In lung&#xD;
      cancer, mast cell numbers correlate with tumor angiogenesis and poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, we are interested to determine the factors in lung cancer microenvironment that&#xD;
      attribute to mast cell activation. Beside the tumor cells themselves, the cancer&#xD;
      microenvironment includes other cells such as fibroblasts. The fibroblasts arising from tumor&#xD;
      stroma, called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), undergo activation, and have different&#xD;
      feature compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs). In this work we are interested to determine&#xD;
      whether CAF cells derived from lung tumors, together with the lung cancer cells, or&#xD;
      microvesicles-derived from these cells, are able to stimulate mast cells to degranulate and/&#xD;
      or to release various cytokines and chemokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this propose, during surgery of patients with lung cancer, we will take unnecessary&#xD;
      sample from the cancer and from normal area for purification of CAF or normal fibroblast&#xD;
      cells. Those cells will be co-cultured with both lung cancer cell line (A-549) or&#xD;
      microvesicles-derived from these cells, and human mast cell line (LAD2). Supernatants will be&#xD;
      collected for determine degranulation and cytokine release from these mast cells.&#xD;
