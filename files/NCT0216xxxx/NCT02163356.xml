  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no known effective treatment for recurrent or resistant neuroblastoma.&#xD;
      Fenretinide is an anticancer agent that may work differently than standard chemotherapy. It&#xD;
      may cause the buildup of wax-like substances in cancer cells called ceramides. In laboratory&#xD;
      studies, it was found that if too much ceramide builds up in the neuroblastoma cells, they&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fenretinide has been given by mouth as a capsule to many people, including children. When&#xD;
      Fenretinide is given in capsules, very little of the drug is absorbed through the intestines&#xD;
      into the body. This means patients have to take many capsules of fenretinide by mouth several&#xD;
      times a day. In this study, a new oral preparation of fenretinide (called 4-HPR/LXS oral&#xD;
      powder) is being tested to see if more fenretinide can be absorbed into the body. 4-HPR/LXS&#xD;
      oral powder has been tested previously in a limited number of both children and adult cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketoconazole, commonly used to treat fungus infections, can increase fenretinide levels in&#xD;
      the body by interfering with the body's ability to break down fenretinide. Ketoconazole will&#xD;
      be given at the same time as the fenretinide powder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is preclinical data that shows that combining fenretinide and vincristine prolonged&#xD;
      survival in animal models, therefore, it is hoped that giving the vincristine with&#xD;
      fenretinide will work better against the neuroblastoma that either drug given alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 70 children with neuroblastoma have been treated with various versions of the&#xD;
      fenretinide powder to date, including about a dozen children that also took the fenretinide&#xD;
      powder with ketoconazole, and no toxicities have occurred that limited the dosage and no&#xD;
      serious or unexpected side effects occurred. However, vincristine has never been given with&#xD;
      fenretinide or fenretinide plus ketoconazole before. Vincristine has been been given before&#xD;
      with ketoconazole to both children and adults with neuroblastomas and other cancers.&#xD;
