  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A simple, painless and reliable method to detect Parkinson's disease at an early stage is&#xD;
      very important to patients, doctors and researchers. Doctors want to help patients early, and&#xD;
      scientists want to select patients for their research who will help in development of better&#xD;
      drugs. We hope that the changes in electrical activity of hand muscles during handwriting&#xD;
      will help in early detection of this disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use the analysis of electrical activity recorded from hand muscles during&#xD;
      handwriting and at rest. There will be two groups of subjects: early Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      patients and healthy people. The researcher analyzing the recorded data will not know who is&#xD;
      a patient and who is healthy, as subjects will be identified only by numbers. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be of similar age as patients. In the course of this study, various&#xD;
      properties of hand muscle electrical activity will be examined, and results will be verified&#xD;
      by third party.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neurologist will accrue 10 early PD patients with mild symptoms and 10 healthy controls.&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria of participants (early PD patients and healthy controls)&#xD;
      will be described by the clients after a discussion with the neurologist. It is important&#xD;
      that the healthy controls should be similar to the early PD patients in terms of age, gender,&#xD;
      and other factors which might also cause differences in EMG signals. The neurologist's&#xD;
      diagnosis of the participants' disease status (early PD or health) will be considered the&#xD;
      &quot;reference standard test&quot; results, and will be kept confidential until the end of the study.&#xD;
      That is, only the neurologist knows the diagnosis for each participant accrued at the end of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assistant (recorder), who does not know the disease status of these participants and does&#xD;
      not know the study design (e.g., how many PD participants and how many health controls), will&#xD;
      record EMG signals of these participants following the pre-specified protocol. The order of&#xD;
      these participants being examined by the recorder will be randomized. The signals will be&#xD;
      analyzed by the software provided by the clients and results needed for diagnosis will be&#xD;
      outputted and saved in individual files, one for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another assistant (reader), who has no contact with these participants and does not know the&#xD;
      study design (e.g., how many PD participants and how many health controls), would then&#xD;
      diagnose each individual as early PD or health based on the analysis outputs, according to&#xD;
      pre-specified rules as described in the proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the reader's diagnoses will be compared to the neurologist's&#xD;
      diagnosis by a third party. A diagnosis by the reader is defined as correct if this diagnosis&#xD;
      is the same as the neurologist's diagnosis. The success rate of our approach of diagnosing&#xD;
      early PD disease is defined by the total number of corrected diagnoses by the reader divided&#xD;
      by the total number of diagnoses, which equals to the total number of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The null hypothesis will be rejected, i.e., the client's claim about the&#xD;
      capability of their approach in diagnosing early PD should be accepted, if the number of&#xD;
      correct diagnosis equals to or exceeds 15, Otherwise, the null hypothesis will not be&#xD;
      rejected and the clients' claim about the capability of their approach in diagnosing early PD&#xD;
      will not be accepted. We claim that the success rate of their approach should be no less than&#xD;
      0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We denote P0 (= 0.5) as the success rate under the null hypothesis, and P1 as the success&#xD;
      rate under the alternative hypothesis. We expect P1 &gt;= 0.80 based on pilot study results. A&#xD;
      sample size of 20 participants achieves 80% power to detect a difference (P1-P0) of 0.30&#xD;
      using a one-sided binomial test. The target significance level is 0.05. The actual&#xD;
      significance level achieved by this test is 0.0207. These results assume that the population&#xD;
      proportion under the null hypothesis is 0.50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary objective, the clients could also generate estimates and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals of sensitivity and specificity of this approach for diagnosing PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it should be noted that given the small sample size, we couldn't produce accurate&#xD;
      estimate of sensitivity and specificity. For example, with 10 PD participants, and assume&#xD;
      that the sensitivity is about 0.9, the width of the 95% CI for the estimated sensitivity&#xD;
      would be as large as 0.44.&#xD;
