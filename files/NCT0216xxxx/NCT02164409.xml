  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study for patients who currently have or previously had an H. pylori&#xD;
      infection or who have gastric or esophageal cancer and who plan to undergo an endoscopy as&#xD;
      part of their care. The purpose of this study is to find out how and why H. pylori infections&#xD;
      can cause progression to gastric cancer and if it's possible for intervention prior to this&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      H. pylori infection is a prevalent environmental cause of gastric cancer. The molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms of carcinogenesis due to H. pylori remain unexplained and consequences of&#xD;
      infection are variable and unpredictable. The aim of this research is to examine the RNA&#xD;
      transcriptome of gastric cancer mucosa (gastric mucosa is the mucus membrane of the stomach),&#xD;
      in patients with H. pylori infection and examine the spectrum of disease associated with&#xD;
      infection. We will also examine bacterial content of samples to pinpoint the specific H.&#xD;
      pylori strain(s) and the stomach microbial profile to correlate with the gastric mucosal&#xD;
      transcriptome and predisposition of gastric cancer. Patients with prior or current active H.&#xD;
      pylori infection who are planning to under endoscopic evaluation will be eligible for&#xD;
      participation. From these patients, we plan to take up to four additional biopsies from each&#xD;
      area of stomach already being sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biopsies will be used for next-generation RNA and DNA sequencing and novel bioinformatics&#xD;
      analyses. The analysis will be performed at Weill Cornell Medical College by Doron Betel,&#xD;
      PhD. The sequencing will be performed in the Epigenetics Core laboratory under the&#xD;
      supervision of Doron Betel, who will be working closely with the principal investigator,&#xD;
      Manish A. Shah, M.D. Examination of the genetic impact of H. pylori infection in patients may&#xD;
      expose genetic factors that influence gastric cancer carcinogenesis and give deeper insight&#xD;
      into molecular pathways that serve as candidate biomarkers for gastric cancer carcinogenesis.&#xD;
      Our goal is to distinguish patients with chronic H. pylori infection who are at risk of&#xD;
      subsequently developing gastric cancer from the vast majority of patients with H. pylori&#xD;
      infection who do not develop malignancy.&#xD;

      To examine RNA tranome of gastric cancer mucosa, in patients with H. pylori infection &amp;&#xD;
      examine spectrum of disease associated with infection. We will also examine bacterial content&#xD;
      of samples to pinpoint specific H. pylori strain(s) &amp; stomach microbial profile to correlate&#xD;
      with gastric mucosal tranome &amp; predisposition of gastric cancer. We plan to take 2-3&#xD;
      additional biopsies from an area of stomach already being sampled. The biopsies will be used&#xD;
      for next-generation RNA &amp; DNA sequencing &amp; novel bioinformatics analyses. Examination of the&#xD;
      genetic impact of H. pylori infection in patients may expose genetic factors that influence&#xD;
      gastric cancer carcinogenesis &amp; give deeper insight into molecular pathways that serve as&#xD;
