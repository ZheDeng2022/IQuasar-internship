  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acid/base imbalances are not well understood in pre-eclamptics, and better tools are needed&#xD;
      to allow a thorough and meaningful evaluation. Disorders of electrolytes and albumin are&#xD;
      common findings [13, 14], and the impact of such disorders on acid-base homeostasis has&#xD;
      increasingly been acknowledged [4, 15]. The purpose of this prospective case-control study is&#xD;
      to evaluate acid-base status in 100 women with mild or severe pre-eclampsia and 25 healthy&#xD;
      controls by applying the Stewart Fencl's physicochemical acid-base model. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      several simultaneous, and possibly offsetting, metabolic acid-base disorders will be&#xD;
      identified and quantified, and that these may be useful to guide clinicians in their medical&#xD;
      management and indication for delivery. Intermediate and long-term goals are to evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of the Stewart Fencl's physicochemical acid-base model to guide fluid management and&#xD;
      predict maternal and neonatal outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies evaluating acid/base imbalances are scarce in pre-eclamptics, and tools to thoroughly&#xD;
      evaluate them are lacking. The detection of metabolic acidosis has been proposed as a&#xD;
      diagnostic criterion for a severe disease state8, 11, however other studies entirely reject&#xD;
      the presence of any metabolic acid-base disorder in pre-eclampsia10. One reason for this&#xD;
      controversy may lie in the fact that no study performed a full comprehensive acid base&#xD;
      analysis. Whereas some measured plasma pH, HCO3 and BE8, 11 others focused on AG1 or AG and&#xD;
      HCO32, 10 only. Merely one study corrected the AG for low albumin1, and no study focused on&#xD;
      independent variables. While some of the cited reports were based on retrospective chart&#xD;
      review without differentiating mild and severe disease state1, 2, the few prospective studies&#xD;
      available were of low sample size including a total number of 311 or 98women with severe&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia. As indicated above, it is totally legitimate to use the traditional approach&#xD;
      to describe changes in hydrogen ion concentration and HCO3. The Henderson-Hasselbach equation&#xD;
      does differentiate well between respiratory and metabolic acid-base changes. However, it is&#xD;
      unable to quantify metabolic causes15. SBE quantifies net change in metabolic acid-base&#xD;
      status in vivo, but does not tell us about mechanisms16. The AG is insufficient to detect&#xD;
      unmeasured anions17, 18, but when corrected for low albumin it does not detect all unmeasured&#xD;
      cations16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular volume depletion and disorders of electrolytes and albumin are common findings&#xD;
      in pre-eclampsia1, 2 and the impact of such disorders on acid-base homeostasis has been&#xD;
      increasingly acknowledged in the last decade3, 19. Decreased serum albumin has an alkalizing&#xD;
      effect on plasma, resulting in hypoalbuminemic alkalosis. Furthermore, derangements in&#xD;
      volume, sodium and chloride homeostasis, as well as the accumulation of unmeasured anions,&#xD;
      are common findings in pre-eclampsia7 and may result in multiple acid-base disorders. The&#xD;
      presence of hyponatremia or hyperchloremia has an acidifying effect on blood pH, whereas&#xD;
      hypernatremia or hypochloremia lead to alkalosis. The accumulation of unmeasured anions, such&#xD;
      as lactate or uric acid, will lead to acidemia, if not otherwise compensated3, 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that with comprehensive analysis, clinically significant and complex metabolic&#xD;
      derangements might be discovered in pre-eclamptics that will potentially impact their care&#xD;
      plan. To our knowledge, this will be the first time that the Stewart-Fencl methodology will&#xD;
      be used to determine causes of acid-base status in pre-eclamptics, which takes into account&#xD;
      the multiple, potentially opposing, electrochemical disturbances observed in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Prevalence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is a description of the prevalence of acid-base disorders in pregnant women&#xD;
      with pre-eclampsia at three time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. at time of diagnosis with mild pre-eclampsia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. at time of progression to severe pre-eclampsia, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. at time of delivery. Pregnant women without pre-eclampsia will be used as a comparison&#xD;
           group for (a) and (b) for testing whether the.prevalence of acid-base disorders is&#xD;
           higher in pre-eclampsia than in pregnancy without pre-eclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Changes over time in acid base status This aim is to describe and test change over&#xD;
      three time points in the prevalence of acid-base disorders among those women who progress&#xD;
      from mild to severe pre-eclampsia, and change from initial diagnosis to delivery among women&#xD;
      whose pre-eclampsia remains mild.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Acid-base as clinical predictor This aim will test whether acid-base variables at time&#xD;
      of diagnosis with mild pre-eclampsia predict which women will progress to severe&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia and/or need an urgent delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance (Note-include significance in relation to translational health science)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-eclampsia complicates 2-8% of pregnancies, and is a major contributor to fetal and&#xD;
      maternal morbidity/mortality worldwide5, 21, 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only cure for pre-eclampsia is delivery. However, especially remote from term, the&#xD;
      premise that delaying delivery to allow for the fetus to continue to grow and thrive in utero&#xD;
      is a big part of what expectant management is trying to achieve. The challenge remains to&#xD;
      this day to balance the benefits of a prompt delivery (undeniably benefiting the mother)&#xD;
      versus allowing the fetus to remain in utero (although if placental insufficiency is severe&#xD;
      and endothelial dysfunction critical, the baby may well be better off delivered).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there are no strict criteria (hemodynamic, metabolic or other) or any&#xD;
      predictive model that may guide obstetricians in the decision to proceed with a prompt&#xD;
      delivery or allow prudent expectant management. Therefore, management is mostly guided by&#xD;
      expert opinion-based guidelines, which do not accurately predict adverse maternal events23,&#xD;
      24. The fullPIERS-model, recently published results from a large clinical trial, considers&#xD;
      gestational age, chest pain or dyspnea, oxygen saturation, platelet count, serum creatinine&#xD;
      levels and aspartate transaminase concentration, to predict adverse maternal outcome with a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 87%25. However, for most of these predictors the&#xD;
      worst values recorded during the first 48 hours of study were used to predict complications&#xD;
      within the same 48 hour time frame 26. In practice, a model based exclusively on information&#xD;
      available at admission is still needed. The data evaluated by the proposed Stewart-method&#xD;
      would add to the physiologic understanding of the disease, would be easy to obtain at&#xD;
      admission and possibly discover new predictors for adverse maternal and perinatal events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective case-control study, previously normotensive women diagnosed with mild&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia as defined by the American Association of Hypertension 27 will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Blood samples from women with pre-eclampsia and healthy controls will be gathered, and plasma&#xD;
      pH, HCO3- and BE will be measured. According to the Stewart-Fencl methodology these&#xD;
      parameters are dependent variables of the following four factors 12, 28:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference of strong cation and anion concentration, or 'strong ion difference'&#xD;
           (SID)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pCO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The concentration of weak acids, which are mainly albumin and phosphate (Atot)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of other acids, so called unmeasured anions (UMA) or strong ion group (SIG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on that concept, BE can be defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) plasma dilution/concentration (=changes in Na+-concentration, (BENa+)) (B) changes in&#xD;
      chloride concentration (BECl-) (C) changes in albumin concentration (BEAlb) (D) changes in&#xD;
      lactate (BELac) (E) changes in unmeasured anions (BEUMA). BE = BENa+ + BECl- + BEAlb + BELac&#xD;
      + BEUMA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each component will be identified and quantified as described by Gilfix et al.17. (A detailed&#xD;
      explanation can be found in the Appendix of this application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Because of the descriptive and exploratory nature of this pilot study,&#xD;
      no controls for multiple comparisons will be made. Any results from this study will be&#xD;
      interpreted as hypothesis generating, to justify a larger further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Prevalence The primary aim is a description of the prevalence of acid-base disorders&#xD;
      in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia at three time points: (a) at time of diagnosis with mild&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia, (b) at time of progression to severe pre-eclampsia, and (c) at time of&#xD;
      delivery, in comparison to pregnant women without pre-eclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the BE measures, abnormal will be defined as differing from +/-2mEq/l or more. If&#xD;
      any one of the BE measures is abnormal, the woman will be classified as having an acid-base&#xD;
      disorder. Descriptive displays (tables and/or bar charts) will be used to describe the&#xD;
      percent of women with an acid-disorder at each of (a) to (b) and in control women. In&#xD;
      addition, we will describe how many of these cases have offsetting disorders so that the&#xD;
      total BE is normal, i.e. they would not have been identified by the traditional approach.&#xD;
      Further displays will describe the prevalence of abnormal values for each of the 5 components&#xD;
      separately. In addition, we will explore the utility of displaying means and SDs of each of&#xD;
      the 5 BE components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression will be used to test for differences in prevalence of acid-base disorder&#xD;
      in pre-eclampsia versus controls, at each of (a) and (b) time points, while controlling for&#xD;
      gestational age as a covariate. Linear regression will be used to test for differences in the&#xD;
      means of each of the BE components between pre-eclampsia and controls, controlling for&#xD;
      gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Changes over time in acid base status This aim is to describe and test change over&#xD;
      three time points in the prevalence of acid-base disorders among those women who progress&#xD;
      from mild to severe pre-eclampsia, and change from initial diagnosis to delivery among women&#xD;
      whose pre-eclampsia remains mild.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed models for binary outcome data, using for example xtlogit in Stata, will be used to&#xD;
      test for changes over time in prevalence. Further analyses will use mixed models for&#xD;
      continuous outcomes to test for changes in means of the individual BE scores over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Acid-base as clinical predictor This aim will test whether acid-base variables at time&#xD;
      of diagnosis with mild pre-eclampsia predict which women will progress to severe&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia and/or need an urgent delivery. A chi-square test can be used to test whether&#xD;
      the fraction of women progressing to sever pre-eclampsia is different in those with abnormal&#xD;
      versus normal acid-base at time of diagnosis of mild pre-eclampsia. Further analysis will use&#xD;
      logistic regression analyses to test whether the 5 BE components predict probability of&#xD;
      progression. Potential confounding variables such as medications (e.g furosemide) used to&#xD;
      control symptoms or severity of the disease will also be evaluated to see whether controlling&#xD;
      for these variables changes the association of acid-base variables with risk of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will further explore a variety of neonatal and maternal outcome variables for a possible&#xD;
      association with acid-base predictors. Please find those secondary outcome variables&#xD;
      described in detail in the appendix of the revised application. Please find also clarified if&#xD;
      variables are categorical or continuous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is based on the observation in a pilot sample of 25 paired arterial and venous&#xD;
      blood specimens in women with severe pre-eclampsia of mean venous BE(Alb) = + 4.4 (± 0.75)&#xD;
      mEq/l. Considering a power of 1.0 and an alpha of 0.05, a sample size of 25 women in each&#xD;
      group was needed to show a difference of 20% in BE(Alb) between cases and control groups.&#xD;

        Patients diagnosed with mild pre-eclampsia and admitted on the labor and delivery unit at&#xD;
        the UWMC will be included consecutively and their clinical course will be followed, until&#xD;
        25 cases have progressed to severe pre-eclampsia. At each state of the disease a blood gas&#xD;
        will be drawn (mild disease, severe disease, beginning labor or with decision for cesarean&#xD;
        delivery). However, some women will deliver before severe pre-eclampsia develops&#xD;
        (continuing mild pre-eclampsia), because disease is either late or only slowly progressing&#xD;
        (study flow chart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Analyzing the number of women treated for mild and severe pre-eclampsia in 2011 and 2012,&#xD;
        we are expecting to see a 3x higher number of mild than severe cases of pre-eclampsia,&#xD;
        which means we will need to enroll approximately 100 women with mild pre-eclampsia in order&#xD;
        to have 25 who develop severe pre-eclamsia..&#xD;
