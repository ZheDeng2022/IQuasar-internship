    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. The disease is&#xD;
      characterized by a high mortality rate (about 40%) and a course continuously altered by&#xD;
      lifestyle, gene polymorphisms and therapeutic treatment. Fasting concentration of blood&#xD;
      lipids and lipoproteins only partially express the complex relation between dyslipidemia and&#xD;
      CHD. Following the indication stated nearly 40 years ago by Zilversmit, there is now&#xD;
      accumulating evidence that postprandial lipemia plays an important role in the atherogenic&#xD;
      process [ref Kolovou], particularly that most hours of the day are spent in the postprandial&#xD;
      state. Furthermore, the increases in blood glucose and triglycerides (TGs) following meals&#xD;
      stimulate oxidative stress, impair endothelial function, and rises the inflammatory factors&#xD;
      that lead to atherosclerosis. Previous studies reported on postprandial lipemia in subjects&#xD;
      with obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, elderly, patients with CHD and others.&#xD;
      However, currently the estimation of cardiovascular disease risk is based on fasting blood&#xD;
      values of triglycerides (TGs) and inflammatory markers. The effect of postprandial&#xD;
      atherogenic factors on the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis is actually not&#xD;
      known.The Hellenic Postprandial Lipemia Study (HPLS) was designed to study the consequences&#xD;
      of postprandial lipemia in CRP as inflammatory marker in high-risk adults. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      HPLS study will investigate whether hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic or antihypertensive&#xD;
      medication may lessen the exaggerated postprandial lipemia as well as the rest abnormal&#xD;
      postprandial metabolism. Finally, the HPLS study is intending to evaluate the influence of&#xD;
      gene polymorphisms involved in lipid and glucose metabolism on postprandial lipemia and&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;

      The study aims to recruit 1200 patients that are characterized either as high risk or&#xD;
      very-high risk for Coronary Heart Disease. It is assumed that an equal number of high risk&#xD;
      and very high risk patients will be included in the study. Patients will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study from outpatient clinics in the 14 centers in Athens, Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be approved by the institution ethics committee and informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all participating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients will have recently (up to 15 days) been initiated in one of the&#xD;
      following dislipidemic treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simvastatin up to 40 mg,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atorvastatin up to 80 mg,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rosuvastatin up to 40 mg,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statin intolerant subjects receiving colesevelam up to 3.75 g/day or fenofibrate 145&#xD;
           mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should have received the above treatments as initial treatment for dyslipidemia&#xD;
      with the exception of statin intolerant patients. All patients at the time of their inclusion&#xD;
      in the study will have been evaluated for gene polymorphisms as part of their dyslipidemic&#xD;
      profile evaluation. Furthermore patients will have been characterized as high risk or very&#xD;
      high risk according to the SCORE level of risk, calculated using the Greek version of&#xD;
      low-risk regions charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each center will recruit 50 very high and 50 high risk patients. Each site will include 10&#xD;
      consecutive high risk and 10 very high risk patients for each treatment group as described&#xD;
      above. The following data will be collected for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal and demographic details&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family and personal medical history (including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and&#xD;
           glucose metabolism, as well as cardiovascular disease history)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past measurements of blood pressure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes and lipids,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic procedures undertaken (coronary or other angioplasty, Coronary artery by-pass&#xD;
           surgery),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of blood pressure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight, height, waist and hip circumference. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as&#xD;
           weight/height2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The SCORE level of risk will be also calculated using the Greek version of low-risk&#xD;
           regions charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have to complete 2 Lipotest meals with the first one given at the beginning&#xD;
      of the study and the second one after at least 3 months of hypolipidemic treatment. Before&#xD;
      and 4 hours after the meals blood samples will be collected. After that, subjects will be&#xD;
      followed annually for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipotest Meal The Lipotest meal is a diagnostic standardized meal recognized by Hellenic Drug&#xD;
      Organization (EOF, National Drug Organization). A single serving, provided in a sachet, is&#xD;
      comprised of 115 g powder that is rehydrated by adding 150 ml water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The powder and water are mixed to homogeneity (2-3 minutes with a hand held mixer), and then&#xD;
      refrigerated to form a mousse. All ingredients are food grade and are stable for a period of&#xD;
      24hours after preparation as proved by antioxidant tests The ingredients' composition of&#xD;
      Lipotest is hydrogenated vegetable fat, glucose syrup solids, milk proteins, sugar,&#xD;
      emulsifiers (lactic and acetic acid esters of monoglycerides and diglycerides, cocoa powder&#xD;
      (20-22% fat content), defatted cocoa powder (10-12% fat content), and flavorings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a per serving basis, Lipotest provides 832 kcal (42% FDA Daily reference value (DRV) for&#xD;
      adults, and 42% of the European Guideline Daily Amount, GDA), 10 g protein (20% DRV, 20%&#xD;
      GDA), 25 g of carbohydrates (8.3% DRV, 10% GDA) of which simple sugars comprise 14.3 g (no&#xD;
      DRV, 16% GDA), 2.1 g fiber (8.4% DRV), 0.15 g salt (2.5% DRV for sodium), and 75 g fat (115 %&#xD;
      DRV, 109% GDA), all of which is fully saturated (375% DRV and GDA) through hydrogenation of&#xD;
      vegetable fat. Fat used is coconut oil named Cegepal VF HC 77 and Lamequick 6068 both from&#xD;
      Cognis, which are fully approved for use in food applications and are in powder form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral fat loading The meal will be administrated in the morning after 12-h overnight fast.&#xD;
      Subjects will eat meal within 20 min and will be instructed to keep physical activity to a&#xD;
      minimum, refrain from smoking and fast during the 4 h of the test. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      withdrawn at 0 and 4 h for determination of TGs concentration. The meal will be administrated&#xD;
      twice, before any treatment (visit 1) and 3 months after treatment with hypolipidemic,&#xD;
      hypoglycemic or antihypertensive drugs (visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of blood and biomarker analyses All laboratory tests will be carried out at as&#xD;
      part of everyday clinical practice and will be covered by the patient insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and TG&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured from both fasting and postprandial blood samples and plasma&#xD;
      glucose concentrations will be measured from true fasting blood samples only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory marker analysis Plasma will be analyzed for hs-C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
      according to everyday clinical practice and will be covered by the patient insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration 18 months recruitment period. 3 years follow up for every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Participation Duration 36 Months 1200 very high and high risk for CHD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participating Sites 14 clinics in 12 Hospitals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product: Not Applicable Investigational Product Dosage &amp; Administration: Not&#xD;
      Applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medication All patients will receive concomitant medication in accordance to the&#xD;
      everyday practice of their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluation All adverse events will be recorded in accordance to all applicable laws&#xD;
      and regulations concerning medications prescribed according to their approved summary of&#xD;
      product characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Continuous variables will be described using means and standard&#xD;
      deviations. Comparisons of continuous variables will be performed using the Student's t-test&#xD;
      or the Mann-Whitney-U test for parametric and non-parametric data, respectively. Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be expressed as absolute (N) or relative (%) frequencies and will be analyzed&#xD;
      for associations using the chi-square test. The Paired t-test will be used to compare changes&#xD;
      within the groups of variables and the Bonferroni test will be used to compare the changes&#xD;
      between the groups, as a method for their post hoc comparisons Univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      stepwise linear regression analyses will be performed in order to identify independent&#xD;
      predictors for CRP and other dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival analysis will be performed to elucidate potential predictors of MACE using both&#xD;
      fasting and postprandial values of the studies variables and gene polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be two-sided. P-value will be considered statistically significant if &lt;0.05.&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using STATA™ statistical software (Version 9.0, Stata Corporation,&#xD;
      College Station, TX 77845, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations The Ethics Committee of the each participating Hospital will approve&#xD;
      the non interventional study. All participants will sign the written informed consent prior&#xD;
      to participation in the study. The information protection rules in the National Institute for&#xD;
      Health and Welfare (former National Public Health Institute to 2009) will be followed&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
