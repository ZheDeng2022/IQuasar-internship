      The study will evaluate the radiographs (x-rays) of 100 patients with a TriFIT total hip at 2&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and yearly following surgery to see if there has been&#xD;
      any movement or wear in the hip stem over the course of the study. The study will also record&#xD;
      clinical data on each patient using various functional tests and questionnaires at the same&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;

      The present study will prospectively recruit 100 patients scheduled for elective total hip&#xD;
      replacement with Corin's TriFIT Hip System at the Ottawa Hospital - General Campus. As part&#xD;
      of their clinical care, patients routinely undergo a clinical examination and have had&#xD;
      radiographs taken at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and yearly following surgery.&#xD;
      Using specialized software, radiographs from each interval will be examined to assess femoral&#xD;
      stem migration and joint wear patterns. Femoral stem migration will be assessed using&#xD;
      computer-assisted software. The study will also assess the rate of implant failure during the&#xD;
      first two post-operative years. Clinical assessments and questionnaires will also be&#xD;
      completed during each of the follow-up intervals.&#xD;
