    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies KeraStat Skin Therapy in treating radiation dermatitis in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed stage 0-IIIA breast cancer. Radiation dermatitis is an itchy,&#xD;
      painful skin rash that can occur following treatment with radiation. KeraStat Skin Therapy&#xD;
      may be a better treatment for radiation dermatitis.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain a preliminary estimate the incidence of early adverse skin reaction (EASR)&#xD;
      during radiation therapy (RT) and up to two months post RT after the application of the&#xD;
      cosmetic cream KeraStat Skin Therapy during RT in breast cancer patients in a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To associate personal characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, hormone therapy, smoking&#xD;
      status, comorbidities, breast size) and treatment characteristics (e.g., RT dose) to&#xD;
      incidence of EASR at any time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients apply KeraStat Skin Therapy topically twice daily (BID) during radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Occurrence of any RT-induced EASR defined as a grade 4 or higher toxicity using the Modified Oncology Nursing Society Criteria for Radiation-Induced Acute Skin Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>At each time point the proportion of women who have RT-induced EASR present will be estimated and a 95% confidence interval will be calculated around this estimate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Categorical confounders, such as race/ethnicity, age, hormone therapy, smoking history/status, diabetes, high blood pressure, breast size, RT characteristics, and RT dosimetry characteristics, using the Baseline Study Risk Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A series of 2xr tables will be examined to determine the relationship between each of the categorical confounders and the primary endpoint. Chi-squared statistics will be estimated for each of these tables to give some preliminary descriptive data to identify potential variables that may be associated with the primary outcome.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Status post-lumpectomy, -quadrantectomy, or -mastectomy&#xD;
