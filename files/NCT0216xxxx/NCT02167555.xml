  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to characterize the relative bioavailability and kinetic profile of wild&#xD;
      blueberry polyphenols over 24-hours period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to examine the relationship between bioavailability and kinetic&#xD;
      profile of wild blueberry polyphenols on markers of chronic diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, single blinded, 2-arm, within-subjects, placebo-controlled design&#xD;
      utilizing a multiple sampling, repeated measures paradigm to characterize the bioavailability&#xD;
      and kinetic profile of wild blueberry polyphenols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 12 will be enrolled into the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening visit, one pre-study visit, and 2 study visits. This study will take&#xD;
      approximately 3-4 weeks per subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subject with the informed consent document and&#xD;
      determine subject eligibility through anthropometric measurements, vital signs, fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose test (finger prick), and completion of a survey relate to general eating, health, and&#xD;
      exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, a 3-day food record (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day)&#xD;
      will be instructed at the Screening Visit and collected at the Pre-study visit to assess&#xD;
      subjects' baseline dietary intake pattern. Subjects will be instructed to follow a strictly&#xD;
      limited polyphenolic diet for 7 days prior to the study and throughout their participation&#xD;
      time, while maintaining their usual diet pattern and physical activity, with counseling by&#xD;
      staff investigator and/or Registered Dietitian. A dinner meal will be provided the day before&#xD;
      the study visit to control the second meal effect from the food and beverage intake of the&#xD;
      night before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will arrive at the center in a fasted state for at least 10 hours, well hydrated and&#xD;
      rested. Each study visit will require blood draws throughout the visit. After evaluation of&#xD;
      subject's health status (via anthropometric, vital sign and blood glucose measurements and&#xD;
      in-person interview), a registered nurse will place a catheter in subject's arm for the&#xD;
      purpose of multiple blood sample collections and take the initial blood draw in the fasting&#xD;
      state. Subjects will be randomized to receive a placebo or wild blueberry beverage treatment&#xD;
      based on randomized treatment sequences at 2 study visits along with 3 standard meals&#xD;
      (breakfast, lunch and dinner). The sequences of receiving the beverage treatments at each&#xD;
      visit will be randomly assigned to one of two of following sequences: placebo-wild blueberry&#xD;
      or wild blueberry-placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study visit will involve with blood samples collection at time points 0 (fasting), 0.25,&#xD;
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 24 hour (h) for assessment of change in plasma&#xD;
      metabolites of wild blueberry polyphenols and influence of metabolic and inflammation&#xD;
      markers. Also, urine samples will be collected prior to the study treatment as a baseline and&#xD;
      all voids over 6 time periods, 0 to 2 h, 2 to 4 h, 4 to 6 h, 6 to 8 h, 8 to 10h and 10 to 24&#xD;
      h during each study visit to assess wild blueberry polyphenolic metabolites.&#xD;
