  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      high-risk patients, such as immunocompromised patients. Candida is currently the predominant&#xD;
      fungal pathogen in these patient populations and is associated with significant morbidity and&#xD;
      a high mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micafungin (MCF) is a semisynthetic compound belonging to the new class of antifungal agents,&#xD;
      the echinocandin lipopeptides, that has potent in vitro and experimental in vivo activity&#xD;
      against a variety of pathogenic Candida species and Aspergillus species. Its applied&#xD;
      indications are so the treatment and/or the prophylaxis of Candida and Aspergillus&#xD;
      infections. MCF is currently licensed for the treatment of candidiasis at doses of either 100&#xD;
      or 150 mg a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of MCF is linked to the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the&#xD;
      steady state divided by the MIC (AUC0-24/ MIC ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On one hand:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - It was demonstrated that 98% of invasive candidiasis patients with a MCF AUC/MIC ratio&#xD;
      between 3 and 12 achieve microbiological clearance, as opposed to only 85% of those with an&#xD;
      AUC/MIC ratio &lt; 3. In the case of infections by Candida parapsilosis, which exhibits drug&#xD;
      MICs that are 50- to100-fold higher, 100% of patients with an AUC/MIC ratio &gt;285 achieve&#xD;
      microbiological clearance, as opposed to 82% of those below that exposure level.(1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is well known that patients of intensive care units (ICU) are characterized by&#xD;
           particular pharmacokinetic parameters with higher apparent volume of distribution (VC/F)&#xD;
           and/or higher apparent systemic clearance (CL/F). In a population of healthy volunteers,&#xD;
           it was observed that CL/F of MCF presents a high interpatient variability.(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether most ICUs patients achieve optimal AUC/MIC ratio thresholds at standard doses&#xD;
           has not been investigated so far. In particular, lower AUCs might be reached in patients&#xD;
           having the highest VC/F values. Such patients would then be at risk of therapy failure&#xD;
           and would benefit from individualized-dosing strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the study of the pharmacokinetics of MCF in critically ill patients seems to&#xD;
      be necessary.&#xD;
