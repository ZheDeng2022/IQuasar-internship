      The specific aims of the the investigators studies are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect the tear samples from patients with different ocular surface disorders,&#xD;
           including SLK, conjunctivochalasis, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the differential expression of tear cytokines and pH values between&#xD;
           different ocular surface disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect the surgical conjunctival specimens from the patients with SLK and&#xD;
           conjunctivochalasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the factors inducing mast cell migration and how mast cell is activated in&#xD;
           SLK via surgical specimens and cultivated fibroblast.&#xD;

      1. Detection of various tear cytokine levels in patients with superior limbic&#xD;
           keratoconjunctivitis, conjunctivochalasis, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Basal tear samples will be collected atraumatically from the inferolateral tear&#xD;
           meniscus by using glass capillary tubes. Care is taken to avoid touching the corneal and&#xD;
           conjunctival surface. Approximately 30 μl of tear samples is obtained, and then the&#xD;
           samples are centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 rpm (225g). Tear sample are placed in&#xD;
           microtubes (Eppendorf) and stored at -70°C. IL-1β, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-γ levels will&#xD;
           be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immunohistochemistry stain method for conjunctival specimens - The conjunctiva will be&#xD;
           collected from SLK and conjunctivochalasis patients who received superior and inferior&#xD;
           bulbar conjunctival resection as needed. The redundant conjunctiva noted after peritomy&#xD;
           during cataract or retinal surgery will be excised to serve as a normal control. The&#xD;
           conjunctival specimens of all the SLK, conjunctivochalasis, and control groups are sent&#xD;
           to the pathology department for routine paraffin embedding and hematoxylin and eosin&#xD;
           staining. The surgical specimens are placed into 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 C for one to&#xD;
           two days and then stored in 1% sodium phosphate buffer at 4 C. They then are embedded in&#xD;
           paraffin. To enhance tissue adhesion, 5-micrometer thick sections are mounted on glass&#xD;
           slides pre- treated with Vectabond (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA).&#xD;
           The paraffin sections are deparaffinized, rehydrated and washed with phosphate-buffered&#xD;
           saline (PBS; pH 7.4). Antigen retrieval is performed by immerse the sections in 0.1%&#xD;
           trypsin in water bath for 15 mins. The endogenous peroxidase activity is quenched by&#xD;
           placing the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide. The slides are then blocked with serum&#xD;
           followed by incubation with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies (TSL and SCF) are&#xD;
           incubated overnight at 4°C. Thereafter, incubation with biotin conjugated secondary&#xD;
           antibody is performed at room temperature for 60 min. Further, incubation with&#xD;
           avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase complex is then performed at room temperature as&#xD;
           well for 30 min using Vectastain elite® ABC kit (Vector labs, CA USA). The location&#xD;
           where the enzyme is bound will be visualized by the addition of the substrate&#xD;
           3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAKO, CA, USA), a chromogen which produces a brown insoluble&#xD;
           precipitate. The sections are then counterstained with haematoxylin, which is followed&#xD;
           by dehydration and mounting with Vecta Mount Mounting medium was used to evaluate the&#xD;
           slides.&#xD;
