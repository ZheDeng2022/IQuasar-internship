  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is significant in the super-obese and&#xD;
      diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation is believed to play an important part in the development of CHD, and the large&#xD;
      collection of abdominal fat in the obese person is a vast source of inflammation. Diabetics&#xD;
      have abnormal glucose and cholesterol metabolism which ultimately compromise their bodies'&#xD;
      circulatory system and nerve function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol plays a vital role in CHD. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles carry&#xD;
      cholesterol and deposit it in blood vessel walls which become damaged as a result. When LDL&#xD;
      particles undergo changes chemically (called oxidation) or as a result of high circulating&#xD;
      blood glucose (called glycation), they become more harmful to the body. High-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL) particles have a protective function in CHD. Not only do they transport&#xD;
      cholesterol away from the blood vessels to the liver to be broken down, they have properties&#xD;
      against oxidation and inflammation. These properties are related to the activity of an enzyme&#xD;
      on HDL called paraoxonase 1(PON1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Super-obese patients are increasingly treated by weight-reducing surgery (bariatric surgery).&#xD;
      In this study we examine whether weight loss following bariatric surgery results in reduced&#xD;
      inflammatory state, improved HDL function (higher PON1 activity), better control of blood&#xD;
      glucose and less nerve damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study PON1 activity, inflammation and glucose control in patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (with and without kidney damage) and type 2 diabetes. We will also study the effects&#xD;
      of rapidly rising blood glucose levels on PON1 and glycated LDL in patients undergoing oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known to have a protective role in cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Apart from transporting cholesterol from peripheral blood vessels back to the liver where it&#xD;
      is processed, HDL has the ability to inhibit chemical changes (called oxidation) to&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) which would make the latter more toxic to the body. HDL can&#xD;
      also stop inflammatory particles from damaging the vessel walls. The anti-oxidation and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties of HDL are associated with an enzyme on HDL called paraoxonase 1&#xD;
      (PON1). It is not the level of measured HDL but the level of PON1 activity that is important&#xD;
      in preventing cardiovascular disease. PON1 activity determines the quality of HDL and the&#xD;
      effect against vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese patients accumulate most of the fat within their abdomen (termed visceral fat). It is&#xD;
      known that visceral fat produces large quantities of inflammatory particles so that obese&#xD;
      patients have increased systemic inflammation and thus higher risk of vascular disease. The&#xD;
      impact of heightened inflammatory status on HDL functions and PON1 activity is not known.&#xD;
      Weight-reducing (bariatric) surgery can result in significant weight loss in obese patients.&#xD;
      It is unclear whether the weight loss is associated with improvement in HDL functions,&#xD;
      possible reversal of lipoprotein abnormalities and other physiological parameters. We plan to&#xD;
      study a population of obese patients scheduled to have bariatric surgery before and after the&#xD;
      surgery and compare the results with a matching population of healthy control patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic patients are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. HDL in diabetic&#xD;
      patients is often dysfunctional. Even though HDL levels are normal, PON1 activity may be&#xD;
      reduced. LDL is able to interact with raised levels of blood glucose (called glycation) and&#xD;
      become more harmful to the body. Glycation of lipoproteins associated with PON1 may affect&#xD;
      PON1 activity. We plan to study glycated lipoproteins and PON1 activity in a population of&#xD;
      diabetic patients who have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some of the type 1 diabetics&#xD;
      will have diabetic kidney disease, these patients are known to be particularly at high risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular complications. We also plan to recruit a cohort of patients who do not have&#xD;
      diabetes but who have had an abnormal blood glucose test. These patients will be having an&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) which establishes whether they have diabetes. During the&#xD;
      OGTT, patients are given an oral glucose load which results in a rapid rise in blood glucose.&#xD;
      We will see if this accelerated change in blood glucose level has any effects on the&#xD;
      glycation of lipoproteins.&#xD;
