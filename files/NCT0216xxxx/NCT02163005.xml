  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an allergy to iodine based intravenous contrast cannot undergo a CT scan with&#xD;
      contrast, unless they are premedicated. Premedication can result in a delay in diagnosis,&#xD;
      that can be significant with acute conditions such as Pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are evaluating the use of Gadolinium as an alternative contrast agent in&#xD;
      CT. Gadolinium has been used extensively in MRI exams but the dose that is used is not&#xD;
      sufficient to provide good enhancement on CT. Dual Energy CT is a new technology that has&#xD;
      better sensitivity to lower doses of intravenous contrast and the investigators aim to study&#xD;
      its effectiveness in improving the enhancement with Gadolinium. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare enhancement of Iodine with enhancement of Gadolinium during Dual Energy CT, to assess&#xD;
      the possibility that Gadolinium could be used as an alternative for patients who are&#xD;
      suspected of having Pulmonary embolism. They will recruit up to 50 patients who are having a&#xD;
      routine Chest CT during treatment for a malignancy and administer Gadolinium contrast and&#xD;
      Iodine contrast during a chest CT exam. The enhancement with the two agents can be compared.&#xD;

      Although safe in most patients, iodine may be associated with lifethreatening adverse events,&#xD;
      particularly in high-risk patient. This application is of particular clinical significance in&#xD;
      patients with conditions like pulmonary embolism which could be fatal. CT pulmonary angiogram&#xD;
      (CTPA) with sensitivity of 83-100% and specificity of 89-97% is currently the gold standard&#xD;
      for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. However, in patients who have allergy to iodinated&#xD;
      contrast agent, CTPA cannot be performed. Gadolinium based contrast agent can serve as a&#xD;
      viable alternative in such patients and can be used for Gadolinium enhanced MR pulmonary&#xD;
      angiography (MRPA) and CTPA. Gadolinium enhanced MRPA however has inherent limitations in&#xD;
      evaluating pulmonary embolism as evident from multicentre prospective study (PIOPED III)&#xD;
      which reported technically inadequate exams in as many as 25% of patients (range 11% to 52%).&#xD;
      The MRPA sensitivity was also low in the range of 78%. Moreover, unlike CT, low spatial and&#xD;
      temporal resolution of MR hampers precise evaluation of lung parenchyma. Previously&#xD;
      investigators have evaluated gadolinium enhanced CTPA on a single energy CT (SECT) at&#xD;
      different tube potential (80 - 120 kV) and reported encouraging results. However, these&#xD;
      patients received higher volume of gadolinium contrast (mean 53 ml, range 30-64 ml) and in&#xD;
      spite, the scans performed at 120 kV demonstrated overall suboptimal pulmonary artery&#xD;
      enhancement. These limitations can be potentially over come with dual-energy CT which&#xD;
      simultaneously acquires low and high energy data. From this data, monochromatic images can be&#xD;
      reconstructed at any desired energy from 40 keV to 140 keV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit up to 50 patients who will guide in determining gadolinium&#xD;
      contrast volume, injection rate and image delay required to maximize pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      enhancement.&#xD;
