      The VICTORIA Study (Vascular CalcIfiCation and sTiffness induced by ORal antIcoAgulation) is&#xD;
      a comparative, parallel, prospective, controlled and randomized study of the structural and&#xD;
      functional impact of rivaroxaban versus anti-vitamin K drugs on the arterial vasculature.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Long term oral anticoagulant treatment (&gt; 12 month) is mainly indicated for atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, prosthetic valves and conditions with high risk for recurrent or deep venous&#xD;
      thrombosis. For more than 60 years, vitamin K antagonists have been the only oral&#xD;
      anticoagulant drugs available to prevent thrombus formation. The use of vitamin K antagonists&#xD;
      is associated to the major constraint of a well-adjusted anticoagulation leading to&#xD;
      minor/major risk of life threatening bleeds. They also exhibit other rare side-effects&#xD;
      including skin eruption and necrosis, hepatic disorders, alopecia. A less known side effect&#xD;
      is an increase in soft tissue calcification, including the cardiac valves and the peripheral&#xD;
      arterial system. This side effect is explained by the inhibitory effect of vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonists on the central (liver) and peripheral (e.g. vascular) carboxylation cycle&#xD;
      synthesis of several vitamin K-dependant calcification inhibiting factors, such as the matrix&#xD;
      gamma-carboxyglutamate protein, osteocalcin or Gas6 (1). The active form of&#xD;
      gamma-carboxyglutamate protein is now identified as a potent local tissue inhibitor of&#xD;
      vascular calcification. The calcifying effect of a decrease in gamma-carboxyglutamate protein&#xD;
      or the ratio of carboxylated (i.e. active) /uncarboxylated (i.e. inactive) forms of&#xD;
      gamma-carboxyglutamate protein have been reported in various acquired metabolic diseases such&#xD;
      as chronic renal insufficiency, aging and of genetic origin (e.g. Cutis Laxa, Keutel&#xD;
      syndrome,â€¦) (2, 3) as well as in mouse gamma-carboxyglutamate protein -/- models (4).&#xD;
      Furthermore, administration of warfarin in rats is a well-known pharmacological model to&#xD;
      induce a vascular calcification within 2-4 weeks with an increase in systolic and pulse&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular calcification is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbi-mortality and&#xD;
      it is well-demonstrated that an increase in coronary calcium, as measured by the scan&#xD;
      Agatston score, is independently linked to a higher risk for events (6, 7). The lower limb&#xD;
      mediacalcosis (i.e. Monckeberg disease) is also a risk factor for limb amputation and&#xD;
      calcification (8) of the atheromatous plaque represents a risk factor for plaque instability&#xD;
      and rupture (9). The pathophysiological mechanisms linking the dystrophic calcification&#xD;
      process to morbi-mortality are still unclear. Calcium deposit within the arterial intimal&#xD;
      layer is generally associated to atherosclerosis with an increased risk for plaque rupture&#xD;
      whereas deposit of calcium within the medial layer of the peripheral arteries (i.e.&#xD;
      mediacalcosis) is rather responsible for an increased arterial stiffness and the development&#xD;
      of arterial hypertension (10). Recent data from the investigators laboratory have showed site&#xD;
      heterogeneity assessed by scan scoring in the calcifying process in the general population&#xD;
      and also in a genetically-determined calcifying disease (i.e the pseudoxantoma elasticum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two recently published studies have pointed out a link between the use of vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonists and an enhanced coronary (11) and extra-coronary (6) calcifications. Although the&#xD;
      conclusions of these studies remains limited by a cross-sectional and retrospective design, a&#xD;
      small number of patients and a large range of exposure to vitamin K antagonists (from 6 to&#xD;
      143 months - mean 46) they questioned a potential deleterious effect on the peripheral&#xD;
      vasculature mainly for the long term use of non-vitamin K antagonists anticoagulants. One&#xD;
      prospective controlled study in post-menopaused woman has demonstrated a long-term beneficial&#xD;
      effect only of a supplement containing vitamins K1 and D on the elastic properties of the&#xD;
      carotid artery (12). Therefore, in the present study, the investigators propose to determine&#xD;
      the structural (i.e. calcification) and functional (i.e. stiffness) impact of the anti-Xa&#xD;
      inhibitor rivaroxaban compared to vitamin K antagonists on the arterial structure in a&#xD;
      longitudinal, prospective comparative study.&#xD;
