    <textblock>
      Vitamin D supplements might substantially reduce the risk of falls, potentially by more than&#xD;
      25%. The proposed study is a clinical trial that will determine the effects of 4 doses of&#xD;
      vitamin D (200 International Units [IU]/day, 1000 IU/day, 2000 IU/d and 4000 IU/d) as a means&#xD;
      to prevent falls in high-risk adults, ages 70 and older. Results of this trial will be&#xD;
      directly relevant to public health and clinical guidelines, and will immediately influence&#xD;
      policy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The public health burden of falls in older persons is substantial. Several lines of evidence&#xD;
      suggest that vitamin D supplements might reduce the risk of falls, potentially by 25% or more&#xD;
      in persons with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. However, existing evidence is&#xD;
      inconsistent and insufficient to guide policy. The trial is a seamless two-stage, Bayesian&#xD;
      response-adaptive, randomized dose-finding trial designed to select the best dose of vitamin&#xD;
      D supplementation and to potentially confirm the efficacy of that dose for fall prevention&#xD;
      and other related outcomes. Participants will be community-dwelling adults, aged 70+ (goal of&#xD;
      ~40% black, ~60% women), with a baseline serum 25(OH)D level of 10-29 ng/ml, who are at high&#xD;
      risk for falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 1 of the adaptive design, participants will be randomly assigned to one of four&#xD;
      vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) doses: 200 IU/d (control), 1000 IU/d, 2000 IU/d, or 4000 IU/d,&#xD;
      with assignment probabilities that will vary as falls are reported. Participants will take&#xD;
      their assigned pills for two years, or until the study ends, whichever comes first. This&#xD;
      stage of the design will select the best non control dose of vitamin D for prevention of&#xD;
      falls, or confirm the futility of distinguishing any differences among the non control doses&#xD;
      for fall prevention. If a best dose is selected, subsequent participants will be randomized&#xD;
      in Stage 2 of the trial into the comparison (200 IU/d) or best dose group, and all&#xD;
      participants (Stage 1 and Stage 2) will continue to be followed to potentially confirm&#xD;
      efficacy. The investigators anticipate enrolling approximately 1,200 participants over the&#xD;
      entire length of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is time to first fall (or death) over two years of therapy. Next in&#xD;
      importance is the outcome of gait speed. Other outcomes include fall rates, types of falls,&#xD;
      balance, muscle strength, frailty, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score, 6-minute&#xD;
      walk time, and physical activity assessed by accelerometry. Falls will be ascertained from&#xD;
      fall calendars completed daily by participants and from self-report by phone. In-person&#xD;
      follow-up visits will occur at 3, 12, and 24 months, with telephone visits occurring at 1, 6,&#xD;
      9, 15, 18, and 21 months after randomization. Subgroups with potential for greater benefit&#xD;
      from vitamin D supplementation are blacks, those with baseline 25(OH)D of 10-19 ng/ml, and&#xD;
      those with objective evidence of low physical function.&#xD;

          <title>Short Physical Performance Battery score</title>
          <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a 3-part assessment of physical functioning: balance testing, gait speed testing (timed 4-meter walk at usual pace), and demonstration of ability to complete 5 chair stands; each part is scored 0 to 4 and the 3 subscores are summed to obtain the total score which ranges from 0 to 12. Higher scores indicate better physical function.</description>

          <title>SF-12 mental health component score</title>
          <description>The Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey (4-week recall) v2 (SF-12) is an interviewer-administered 12-item scale measuring a person's perceptions of their health and health-related quality of life; the mental component score is based on responses to 6 items and has a normative mean (SD) of 50 (10) (range 0 to 100). Higher scores indicate better mental health.</description>
          <population>4 participants in the 200 IU/day group and 1 participant in the 1000 IU/day group were missing the SF-12 mental component score at baseline.</population>
