      Membrane modifecation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guided tissue membrane perforations may serve as a more biologic scaffold that could allow&#xD;
      for the free passage of biologic mediators from the periosteum and overlying gingival&#xD;
      connective tissue into the periodontal defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hyposethis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hyposthesis, this study was designed to evaluate levels of vascular endothelial&#xD;
      cell growth factors and platlet derived growth factors in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)&#xD;
      during the early stages of healing for localized intrabony defects treated with modified&#xD;
      perforated membranes (MPMs), occlusive membranes (OMs) as compared to open flap debridement&#xD;
      control (OFD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Thirty non-smoking patients with severe chronic periodontitis participated in this&#xD;
      prospective, randomized and single blinded trial. Each patient contributed one interproximal&#xD;
      defect that was randomly assigned to experimental modified perforated membrane group (10&#xD;
      sites), occlusive membrane group (10 sites) or open flap debridement control (10 sites).&#xD;
      Plaque index, gingival index, probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and the&#xD;
      intrabony depth of the defect (IBD) were measured at baseline for patients enrollment.&#xD;
      Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected on day 1 and 3, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days&#xD;
      after therapy. The primary outcome variable was the change in VEGF and PDGF-BB levels for&#xD;
      sites treated by MPMs or OM compared to that of the OFD treated cases.&#xD;

      surgical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All surgeries were performed by the same operator (AYG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surgical treatment phase was initiated only if the subject had a full-mouth dental&#xD;
           plaque score of less than one and site plaque score of 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical procedures were accomplished as described in detail by Gamal and Iacono. 14&#xD;
           Under local anesthesia, a mucoperiosteal flap was elevated starting with an internal&#xD;
           bevel incisions to the mucogingival junction to allow passive closure. Debridement of&#xD;
           all inflammatory granulation tissue from the intrabony defect was performed by means of&#xD;
           Gracey 7/8 metal curettes until a sound, healthy bone surface was obtained. At this time&#xD;
           point, teeth were thoroughly root planed combining the use of metal curettes and&#xD;
           power-driven instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For MPM treated sites, collagen membrane perforations were prepared just before surgery&#xD;
           using a custom made 1 mm diameter pin and 1mm perforated acrylic template with a coronal&#xD;
           occlusive rim of about 3 mm . Inter-perforation spaces were determined to be not less&#xD;
           than 2mm in order to avoid loss of membrane stiffness. Thereafter, collagen membranes&#xD;
           were hydrated in sterile saline, trimmed according to the template prepared for each&#xD;
           defect, and adapted over the defects in such a manner that the entire defect and ≥2 of&#xD;
           the surrounding alveolar bone was completely covered to avoid membrane collapse within&#xD;
           the defect. The membranes were extended supracrestally 1 mm below the CEJ to ensure&#xD;
           optimum gingival CT involvement in supracrestal wound healing. Collagen membranes were&#xD;
           simply adapted in place according to the surgical protocol of the manufacturer without&#xD;
           suturing. The mucoperiosteal flap was coronally positioned covering the entire membrane&#xD;
           and sutured with 5-0 non-resorbable suture .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No periodontal dressing was applied. OM and OFD sites were treated the same way except&#xD;
           for using occlusive membranes or defect closure without using membranes. All patients&#xD;
           received oral and written postoperative instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients were prescribed amoxicillin (500 mg)‡ every 8 hours for 1 week. Subjects with&#xD;
           allergies to amoxicillin and derivatives were prescribed Clindamycin (300 mg) every 8&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque control effort was supplemented by rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12%&#xD;
           chlorhexidine hydrochloride §) for one minute three times daily for 2 weeks. The&#xD;
           patients were instructed to refrain from tooth brushing and interdental cleaning was&#xD;
           avoided at the surgical areas during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sutures were removed 14 days postoperatively and recall appointments for observation of&#xD;
           any adverse tissue reaction and oral hygiene reinforcement were scheduled every second&#xD;
           week during the first 2 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One month after surgery, all patients were instructed to resume their normal mechanical&#xD;
           oral hygiene measures, which consisted of brushing using a soft toothbrush with a&#xD;
           roll-technique and flossing. Supportive periodontal maintenance including oral hygiene&#xD;
           reinforcement and supragingival scaling was performed during each recall appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid irritation, samples were obtained 1 day following surgery and after individuals had&#xD;
      fasted overnight and between 8:00AM and 10:00AM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using micropipettes (5 ul), GCF samples were collected 21 by a single examiner (MA) who&#xD;
           was masked to the attribution of the sites to groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the isolation and drying of the selected site with cotton rolls, a fisher&#xD;
           brand disposable micropipettes € was placed intrasulcularly at the mesiofacial line&#xD;
           angle of the selected site to a maximum depth of 2 mm below the gingival margin.&#xD;
           Micropipettes were left in place until 5 µl of fluid was collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GCF samples were collected at day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after therapy and diluted&#xD;
           in saline solution (50 µl) for evaluation of VEGF and PDGF-BB levels. Samples were&#xD;
           labeled, carried in a dark container and kept at -26 C until used.&#xD;

    <description>membrane perforations could provide more physiologic growth factors concentrations in the defect area for their optimal effects.
