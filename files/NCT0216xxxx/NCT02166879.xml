  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine whether patients with suspected OSAHS as predicted by the&#xD;
      STOP-BANG questionnaire will have an increased length of stay (LOS) in the postanesthesia&#xD;
      acute care unit (PACU) compared with those without suspected OSAHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim will be to determine the LOS in patients with known sleep apnea by history.&#xD;
      This length of stay will be compared with LOS in patient with an affirmative response to the&#xD;
      STOP-BANG questionnaire to determine if prior knowledge of diagnosed sleep apnea will be&#xD;
      associated with a lower LOS than in patients with suspected OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim will be to characterize the adverse clinical outcomes (respiratory,&#xD;
      cardiovascular, and neurological) associated with suspected OSAHS in patients who respond&#xD;
      affirmatively to the STOP-BANG questionnaire and in those patients with known OSA. These data&#xD;
      (including number of desaturations, bradypnea, brady- or tachycardia, and use of reversal&#xD;
      agents) will be recorded by the PACU nursing staff. Unexpected admissions to the hospital and&#xD;
      transfers to the intensive care units will also be measured. These data will help identify&#xD;
      the most critical determinants of length of stay.&#xD;

      The study will retrospectively review the anesthetic record, including both the preoperative&#xD;
      assessment records and the PACU flow sheets. The study will be conducted in the&#xD;
      Anesthesiology Assessment Center. PACU. The STOP-BANG questionnaire is administered as part&#xD;
      of the standard of care during the preoperative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia Assessment Center clinics assess approximately 500 patients a week, of which&#xD;
      approximately 25% are scheduled for ambulatory surgical procedures in the Mays clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are administered the STOP-BANG questionnaire as part of the standard of care while&#xD;
      in the perioperative center. This will be recorded on the Initial Anesthesia Assessment&#xD;
      Center Patient Record. This form is filled out by hand by the patients themselves and then&#xD;
      scanned into Clinic Station. The neck circumference portion of the Bang questionnaire is&#xD;
      assessed and recorded by the medical assistant with the use of a single use disposable paper&#xD;
      tape measure. The data are recorded along with basic demographic, historical, and&#xD;
      anthropometric data (including BMI) in a preoperative assessment record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to satisfy the first specific aim, length of stay in minutes as determined by the&#xD;
      PACU nursing record will be documented. Nurses charting the LOS will not be specifically made&#xD;
      aware of the STOP-BANG status of the subjects. Length of stay is charted in the PACU nursing&#xD;
      forms electronically in PICIS and relayed to Clinic Station as part of the standard of care&#xD;
      for all patients admitted to the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to satisfy the third specific aim, patients enrolled in the study will be monitored&#xD;
      for secondary outcomes via chart review of the PACU nursing record and electronic medical&#xD;
      record. These outcomes are charted in the PACU nursing forms electronically in PCIS and&#xD;
      relayed to Clinic Station as standard of care in all patients in the PACU.&#xD;
