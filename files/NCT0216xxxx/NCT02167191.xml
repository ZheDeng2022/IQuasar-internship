  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely known that exercise improves general fitness and that fitter patients recover&#xD;
      more easily from illness and surgery. Conversely, unfit patients have a significantly higher&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality after surgery and a longer inpatient stay. This will become&#xD;
      increasingly important in an aging population as baseline fitness generally declines with&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One method of improving cardiovascular fitness is by using low intensity endurance training&#xD;
      programmes, a disadvantage of these it that they can take several months to show improvement.&#xD;
      High intensity interval training (HIT) programmes that use short episodes of high intensity&#xD;
      exercise have also been shown to improve fitness. These HIT programmes have also shown&#xD;
      improvement in functional capacity and quality of life in patients with chronic disease. An&#xD;
      advantage of HIT is that improvements in fitness may occur in a shorter time than traditional&#xD;
      endurance training. It is also known that HIT can give superior gains over endurance&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether an improvement in aerobic fitness, as&#xD;
      judged by a 2ml/kg/min increase in VO2peak, can be achieved within 31 days via a HIT&#xD;
      programme, in a group of healthy elderly volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary aim we will assess whether this programme would be acceptable to the group&#xD;
      studied, through determination of subject compliance and adherence to the training programme.&#xD;
