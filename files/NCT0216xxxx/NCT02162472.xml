  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if videocapillaroscopy could be used as an objective&#xD;
      and reliable method to assess psoriasis severity and to document improvement during treatment&#xD;
      by measuring changes in vascular features.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, prospective, observational study that will recruit subjects from&#xD;
      Northwestern University to examine the degree of improvement of psoriatic plaques during&#xD;
      systemic therapy treatment. Thirty patients with a confirmed diagnosis of &quot;active&quot; psoriasis&#xD;
      treated with a single systemic agent will be recruited from the Northwestern Medical Faculty&#xD;
      Foundation Dermatology clinic. The study population will include 15 patients receiving&#xD;
      adalimumab and 15 patients receiving methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight visits will be completed for each subject: visit 0 (baseline) and visits 1-8 (week 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24). At the baseline visit, after informed consent is obtained, a&#xD;
      capillaroscopic examination will be performed to assess for evidence of characteristic&#xD;
      vascular alterations. If such changes are present, the remainder of the baseline visit will&#xD;
      be completed. This includes gathering personal information (age, race, gender etc.), clinical&#xD;
      history (time of first diagnosis, presentation site, treatment used, biopsy results if&#xD;
      previously performed, etc.) and past medical history (including current and previous&#xD;
      medications). At each of the subsequent visits (visit 1-8), any changes to medical history&#xD;
      and/or medications will be obtained and recorded. At each of the eight visits, a dermatologic&#xD;
      physical examination, including PASI and PGA scores will be performed.&#xD;
