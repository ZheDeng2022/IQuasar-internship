      Orthotopic heart transplantation is a well established therapeutic measure for end stage&#xD;
      heart failure, leading to significant improvements in survival and quality of life. In the&#xD;
      routine clinical practice, orthotopic heart transplantation patients receive periodic cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization for early detection of allograft vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coronary angiography of these patients is characterized for several technical&#xD;
      difficulties, generally related to the presence of the aortotomy with anomalous implantation&#xD;
      of the coronary ostia and to the orthotopic position of the allograft. For these reasons,&#xD;
      trans femoral approach is usually preferred. In the last two decades, trans radial approach&#xD;
      for coronary angiography emerged to be effective, safe and able to improve patient comfort.&#xD;
      However, there is no universal consensus on the optimal choice of radial access from either&#xD;
      the left or the right artery. Currently, this choice is largely dependent on the operator's&#xD;
      preference. The trans right radial approach is generally preferred in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice mainly due to its easier catheter manipulation for the operators from patient's&#xD;
      right side, and the current design of radial compression devices for the right wrist in&#xD;
      medical market. As such, a major barrier to prevent the wide adoption of the left radial&#xD;
      access lies in some difficulty to reach the left wrist leaning over the patient, particularly&#xD;
      for shorter operators or in obese patients. However, a great deal of attention has been&#xD;
      recently directed toward the trans left radial access, as it has an important anatomical&#xD;
      advantage due to the vascular anatomy of epiaortic vessels with a straighter route to the&#xD;
      left coronary ostium, which could also reduce the risk of cerebrovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no data are available about the performance of trans left radial or trans-right&#xD;
      radial approach in coronary angiography orthotopic heart transplantation patients. However,&#xD;
      in this particular setting of patients, the left radial approach might reduce the technical&#xD;
      difficulties related to the anatomical variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single centre, prospective, randomized study, we sought to compare trans right radial&#xD;
      versus trans left radial approach in terms of amount of contrast medium, radiation exposure,&#xD;
      number of catheters used, cross over to the other access site rate and local and systemic&#xD;
      complications in orthotopic heart transplantation patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Orthotopic heart transplantation is a well established therapeutic measure for end stage&#xD;
      heart failure, leading to significant improvements in survival and quality of life. Allograft&#xD;
      vascular disease remains the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality after orthotopic&#xD;
      heart transplantation, with angiographic evidence of allograft vascular disease around 50% of&#xD;
      patients at 5- to 15-year follow-up. In the routine clinical practice, orthotopic heart&#xD;
      transplantation patients receive periodic cardiac catheterization for early detection of&#xD;
      allograft vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coronary angiography of these patients is characterized for several technical&#xD;
      difficulties, generally related to the presence of the aortotomy with anomalous implantation&#xD;
      of the coronary ostia and to the orthotopic position of the allograft. For these reasons,&#xD;
      trans femoral approach is usually preferred. In the last two decades, trans radial approach&#xD;
      for coronary angiography emerged to be effective, safe and able to improve patient comfort.&#xD;
      However, there is no universal consensus about the optimal choice of radial access from&#xD;
      either the left or the right artery. Currently, this choice is largely dependent on the&#xD;
      operator's preference. The trans-right-radial approach is generally preferred in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice mainly due to its easier catheter manipulation for the operators from&#xD;
      patient's right side, and the current design of radial compression devices for the right&#xD;
      wrist in medical market. As such, a major barrier to prevent the wide adoption of the left&#xD;
      radial access lies in some difficulty to reach the left wrist leaning over the patient,&#xD;
      particularly for shorter operators or in obese patients. However, a great deal of attention&#xD;
      has been recently directed toward the trans-left-radial access, as it has an important&#xD;
      anatomical advantage due to the vascular anatomy of epiaortic vessels with a straighter route&#xD;
      to the left coronary ostium, which could also reduce the risk of cerebrovascular&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, a recent metanalysis demonstrated that trans left radial access is&#xD;
      preferable to trans-right-radial approach in terms of fluoroscopy time and contrast use for&#xD;
      the diagnostic or interventional coronary procedures. Moreover, as expected, there was an&#xD;
      indication of lowered failure rate of radial access from the left than the right. No data are&#xD;
      available about the performance of trans left radial access or trans right radial approach in&#xD;
      coronary angiography of orthotopic heart transplantation patients. However, in this&#xD;
      particular setting of patients, the trans-left-radial access might reduce the technical&#xD;
      difficulties related to the anatomical variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-centre, prospective, randomized study, we sought to compare trans right radial&#xD;
      approach versus trans-left-radial access in terms of amount of contrast medium, radiation&#xD;
      exposure, number of catheters used, cross-over to the other access site rate and local and&#xD;
      systemic complications in orthotopic heart transplantation patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate the superiority of trans left radial access, compared to trans right&#xD;
           radial approach during coronary angiography of orthotopic heart transplantation&#xD;
           patients, in terms of amount of contrast medium, radiation exposure, number of catheters&#xD;
           used, cross-over to other access site rate local and systemic complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the relationship of operator experience with radiation exposure to answer&#xD;
           the question that whether we can minimize fluoroscopy time with increased operator&#xD;
           experience (&quot;post-hoc analysis&quot;);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the cost effectiveness of coronary angiography performed by trans right radial&#xD;
           approach versus trans left radial access (&quot;post hoc analysis&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method section Clinical data A detailed anamnesis of each trial participant will be&#xD;
      collected: age, gender, weight, high, BMI, coronary risk factors (hypertension, dyslipemia,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity), cause of transplantation, date of&#xD;
      transplantation, current clinical status and therapy, ejection fraction, renal function and&#xD;
      complete blood count. In particular, creatinine values will be evaluated at baseline, 3-4&#xD;
      days after the interventional procedure and, if impaired, also at 7-10 days from the coronary&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Participating interventional cardiologists will be high-volume radial operators&#xD;
      (meeting minimal proficiency criteria of ≥50% interventional cases by radial approach per&#xD;
      year). Each variable will be analyzed separately in consultants, fellows, and post graduate&#xD;
      fellows (trainees). In particular, participating interventional cardiologists will be divided&#xD;
      in well experienced radial operators (defined as the person who has performed &gt;500 radial&#xD;
      procedures including &gt;200 procedures in a recent year), less experienced (the person who has&#xD;
      done 200-500 radial procedures in a recent year), and trainee (the person who has done &lt;200&#xD;
      radial procedures). The procedures will be performed according to current guidelines. At the&#xD;
      end of the coronary angiography, after introducer removal, a hand wrist compression device&#xD;
      (TR Band, Terumo) will be used in the both group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedural time was measured from the arterial puncture up to vascular hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiation exposure will be measured using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. dose area product meters, which reflects both the dose of radiation administered and the&#xD;
           area on the patient it is administered to. This is a continuous variable measured in&#xD;
           microgray meter squared (μGym2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. fluoroscopy time, which reflects the length of time the patient and operator are exposed&#xD;
           to radiation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. total dose, measured in milligray (mGy), administered from the angiography system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of contrast medium for each procedure will be recorded. The number and type of&#xD;
      catheters employed as well as the number and the type of wires used in the interventional&#xD;
      procedure will be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross-over to other access site were also collected. In addition, systemic and vascular&#xD;
      complications will be evaluated pre-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, vascular complications will be defined as haemoglobin loss at least 2 mmol/l,&#xD;
      necessity of a blood transfusion and vascular repair, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm and arterial&#xD;
      occlusion. The renal failure after procedure will be defined as a raise in serum values of&#xD;
      creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or ≥ 25% within 24-72 hours after the exposure to the contrast medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical and procedural characteristics will be summarized as mean ± Standard Deviation&#xD;
      for continuous variables with normal distribution, median (interquartile range) for those&#xD;
      continuous but with skewed distribution, and number (percentage) for categorical variables;&#xD;
      The Student t, Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact tests will be computed when appropriate for&#xD;
      bivariate analyses. Firstly, all analyses will be conducted on intention to treat basis,&#xD;
      regardless possible access site cross-over. Afterwards, efficacy subset analyses will be&#xD;
      performed. A two-tailed p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Data will&#xD;
      be analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 20.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, USA). The sample&#xD;
      size will be calculated in order to provide, with a 80% power, the difference of 20 ml with a&#xD;
      Standard Deviation of ± 30 of amount of contrast dose (alpha value=0.05) between&#xD;
      trans-left-radial access vs. trans-right-radial access.&#xD;
