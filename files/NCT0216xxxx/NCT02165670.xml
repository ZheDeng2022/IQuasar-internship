      BASIC VALIDATE is a coronary stent registry to obtain clinical follow-up information from&#xD;
      2000 patients treated with CE-marked stent (BioMatrix Flex™, Biosensors International) with&#xD;
      follow-up of endpoints via the Swedish angiography and angioplasty registry (SCAAR - part of&#xD;
      the national SWEDEHEART registry).&#xD;

      Purpose of the study The purpose of this registry is to capture clinical data of the&#xD;
      BioMatrix NeoFlex™ stent (an improved version of the delivery system of the Biolimus&#xD;
      A9™-eluting BioMatrix Flex stent) in relation to safety and effectiveness in the VALIDATE&#xD;
      SWEDEHEART trial and in a group of patients not taking part in VALIDATE SWEDEHEART in&#xD;
      addition to a group of patients with stable angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance The European Union has a focus on and encourages the conductance of post&#xD;
      marketing surveillance studies of medical devices 3. This focus should be seen in the light&#xD;
      of limitations to clinical data available in the pre-market phase owing to duration of&#xD;
      pre-market clinical investigations, the number of subjects and investigators involved in an&#xD;
      investigation, the relative heterogeneity of subjects and investigators and the controlled&#xD;
      setting of a clinical investigation versus the full range of clinical conditions encountered&#xD;
      in general medical practice. The extent of the data that can be gathered in the pre-market&#xD;
      phase does not necessarily enable detection of rare complications or problems that only&#xD;
      become apparent after widespread or long term use of the device. Because the study device&#xD;
      (BioMatrix NeoFlex™) is a CE-marked updated version of the BioMatrix Flex stent it is&#xD;
      important to document that the assumed improvements in delivery design also reflect&#xD;
      improvements in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients A total of 6000 patients will be included in the VALIDATE SWEDEHEART trial. 3000&#xD;
      STEMI and 3000 NSTEMI. The ambition is that approximately 1000 of these patients are also&#xD;
      included in the BASIC VALIDATE stent registry. In addition, and in order to achieve&#xD;
      post-market information from the entire spectrum of PCI, another 1000 patients with stable&#xD;
      angina pectoris, STEMI or NSTEMI will be included in the registry at VALIDATE SWEDEHEART&#xD;
      centers but unrelated to the VALIDATE SWEDEHEART trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment strategy During the index procedure, only BioMatrix NeoFlex™ stents will be&#xD;
      implanted. The investigator will choose the appropriate length and diameter of the stents to&#xD;
      be implanted by visual estimate. The choice of the length of the stent should ensure complete&#xD;
      coverage of the lesion. In case of insufficient stent expansion, post-dilatation is highly&#xD;
      recommended. In the event that a staged procedure is expected or planned it is recommended&#xD;
      NOT to include the patient in the BASIC VALIDATE registry because the nature of follow-up of&#xD;
      patients (registry only) means that staged procedures will be classified as events (&quot;repeat&quot;&#xD;
      revascularizations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the index PCI, lifelong acetylsalicylic acid in a dose of 75-160 mg per day will be&#xD;
      prescribed. Duration and choice of post-PCI P2Y12 inhibition is left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Primary endpoint A composite of time to death, myocardial infarction, stent&#xD;
      thrombosis or repeat revascularization at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to death at 1, 3 and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to myocardial infarction at 1, 3 and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to stent thrombosis at 1, 3 and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to repeat revascularization at 1, 3 and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of the primary endpoint in the NSTEMI and STEMI groups separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All endpoint results will be compared to matched populations of patients treated with&#xD;
      drug-eluting coronary stents as documented in the SCAAR/SWEDEHEART registries.&#xD;

    After critique raised by peers there was a risk that the study could be interpreted as a&#xD;
    marketing tool for a specific product more than a scientific study.&#xD;
