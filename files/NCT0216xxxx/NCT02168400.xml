  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term abstinence from alcohol is supported by a compensatory mechanism in functional&#xD;
      brain connectivity, a potential brain biomarker that could be an intervention target. These&#xD;
      findings provide a compelling case to explore whether this brain biomarker can be modulated&#xD;
      to enhance patients' ability to remain abstinent. There is a need to investigate methods that&#xD;
      can be used to increase functional brain connectivity. The overall objective of this proposal&#xD;
      is to enhance brain functional connectivity in short-term abstinent alcoholics as a&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention that supports abstinence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relapsing nature of alcoholism is a major obstacle to successful treatment. About 60% of&#xD;
      those entering treatment will relapse within one year. To improve treatment outcome, new&#xD;
      interventions targeting the underlying brain biomarkers of relapse vulnerability hold&#xD;
      significant promise in reducing this critical public health problem. Using resting functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the investigators have identified brain biomarkers that&#xD;
      support long-term abstinence. Cross-sectional and longitudinal findings provide evidence that&#xD;
      higher functional connectivity (FC), particularly between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), is a potential brain biomarker that supports&#xD;
      abstinence. Long-term abstinent alcoholics (7 years of abstinence) have higher resting FC&#xD;
      between NAcc and DLPFC when compared to controls. Short-term abstinent alcoholics (11 weeks&#xD;
      of abstinence) have intermediate FC (lower than long-term abstinent alcoholics and higher&#xD;
      than controls). Further, lower FC between NAcc and DLPFC at 11 weeks of abstinence can be a&#xD;
      predictor of subsequent relapse (with 74% accuracy). Moreover, in a pilot longitudinal FC&#xD;
      study examining resting FC of NAcc at 5 and 13 weeks of abstinence in individuals with&#xD;
      substance use disorder, the investigators found that FC between NAcc and DLPFC decreased from&#xD;
      5 to 13 weeks of abstinence in subsequent relapsers, while it increased in subsequent&#xD;
      abstainers. Based on the above, the investigators believe that long-term abstinence is&#xD;
      supported by a compensatory mechanism that mediates proper executive function over reward&#xD;
      (mediated by PFC-NAcc FC), a potential brain biomarker that could be an intervention target.&#xD;
      These findings provide a compelling case to explore whether this brain biomarker can be&#xD;
      modulated to enhance patients' ability to remain abstinent. There is a need to investigate&#xD;
      methods that can be used to increase FC between DLPFC and NAcc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive flexibility, the ability to change maladaptive behavior, depends on DLPFC input to&#xD;
      NAcc. DLPFC transmits reward representations to NAcc through glutamatergic projections that&#xD;
      guide goal-directed behavior. If DLPFC fails to activate when required, a common observation&#xD;
      in substance use disorder, target neurons in the NAcc core do not receive critical&#xD;
      information needed to select the appropriate outcome, causing acquired maladaptive response&#xD;
      patterns to persist (e.g. drug consumption). Higher FC between DLPFC and NAcc may be achieved&#xD;
      by stimulating DLPFC while subjects perform a task that requires cognitive flexibility, the&#xD;
      reversal learning task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique&#xD;
      that can modulate brain connectivity. DLPFC stimulation may increase input to NAcc to&#xD;
      facilitate proper selection of goal-directed behavior and may also decrease craving in&#xD;
      individuals with substance use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetics and treatment response: A source of treatment response variability could stem from&#xD;
      differences between participants in baseline genetic profiles or epigenetic changes over the&#xD;
      course of treatment. Genetic polymorphisms, especially in genes important for&#xD;
      neuroplasticity, may also mediate neuroplastic changes underlying the effects of tDCS, as has&#xD;
      been demonstrated with gene BDNF. In light of these genetic influences on key tenants of the&#xD;
      study - i.e. treatment response in alcohol use disorder and psychological effects of tDCS -&#xD;
      the investigators will collect genetic samples from participants to determine whether genetic&#xD;
      or epigenetic variations may affect response to the cognitive training and tDCS intervention.&#xD;
      As the secondary aim, participants will be given the choice in the consent form to opt in or&#xD;
      out of the genetic sampling procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a double-blind randomized design, up to 100 abstinent (2 weeks abstinent) individuals with&#xD;
      alcohol use disorder (AUD) recruited from Lodging Plus Program will receive 10 sessions (2&#xD;
      sessions per day for 5 days) of either (i) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to&#xD;
      PFC or (ii) sham-tDCS. All subjects will perform the reversal learning task during tDCS&#xD;
      intervention (active or sham) to prime the engagement of the NAcc-PFC brain circuit that&#xD;
      mediates cognitive flexibility. Rest fMRI and craving measures will be collected before the&#xD;
      first and after the last day of tDCS sessions. Monthly follow-up interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      for 6 months after study completion to query relapse status. Dependent variables will be (i)&#xD;
      change in NAcc-PFC FC between 2 and 3 weeks of abstinence, (ii) change in craving scores&#xD;
      between 2 and 3 weeks of abstinence and (iii) relapse status ~8 months after study&#xD;
      participation. Aim 1: To investigate whether NAcc-PFC FC can be modulated, the investigators&#xD;
      will compare magnitude and durability of change in NAcc-PFC FC between active-tDCS and&#xD;
      sham-tDCS groups. Aim 2: To determine if PFC stimulation has a short-term effect on behavior&#xD;
      related to clinical outcome, the investigators will compare change in craving scores&#xD;
      (difference in craving scores between 2 and 3 weeks of abstinence) between active-tDCS and&#xD;
      sham-tDCS groups. Aim 3: To correlate neuromodulation intervention with long-term clinical&#xD;
      outcome, the investigators will record craving and relapse status during the ~8 months&#xD;
      following treatment discharge. The investigators will examine the relationship between change&#xD;
      in NAcc-PFC FC between 2 and 3 weeks of abstinence and subsequent (i) monthly craving scores&#xD;
      and (ii) relapse status. Aim 4: Examine relationship between genetic variants, epigenetic&#xD;
      changes and treatment outcome (e.g. durability, functional connectivity).&#xD;

    <description>tDCS will be performed with Neuroelectrics Starstim Enobio 20, a non-invasive investigational device that has been labeled as a non-significant risk device by the FDA. This study is regulated by the FDA as an Abbreviated IDE. It has built-in safety mechanisms which allow for immediate cessation of stimulation if the subject becomes uncomfortable. The current will be administered via two electrode sponges for 25 mins with 1-2 milliamperes. These administration protocols are in line with protocols that have outlined safe administration (Nitsche 2007; 2008). No side-effects have been reported with the exception of slight itching under the electrode and occasional occurrence of headache, fatigue, or nausea (Poreisz 2007). Electrodes placement: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); cathode on left DLPFC, anode on right DLPFC.</description>
