    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the effects of colchicine on vascular inflammation&#xD;
      measured by (FDG)-PET imaging in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease. This effect&#xD;
      will also be measured by soluble plasma biomarkers. Finally, an optional pharmacogenomic&#xD;
      investigation will be performed to identify genetic biomarkers of patient response.&#xD;

      This is an interventional trial targetting patients 18 years old or older with a carotid&#xD;
      artery or an ascending aorta to background ration (TBR) of â‰¥1.6 as determined by 18&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake measured by positron emission tomography (PET) as&#xD;
      evidence of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization,patients will be followed over a period of 6 months (24 weeks),&#xD;
      through 2 phone contacts at 6 and 20 weeks and 2 on-site visits at 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each on-site visits will include blood draws to monitor routine chemistry and hematology,as&#xD;
      well as biomarkers and lipid profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each phone contacts will include monitoring of patient's general health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET imaging will be performed at baseline and at the 24-weeks visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety in this study will be assessed by clinical laboratory parameters, physical&#xD;
      examinations, ECGs, vital signs, and the frequency and intensity of clinical adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Montreal Health Innovations Coordinating Center (MHICC) will be responsible for&#xD;
      processing and quality control of the data. Project management will be carried out as&#xD;
      described in the MHICC standard operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical studies. The&#xD;
      handling of data, including data quality control, will comply with all applicable regulatory&#xD;
      guidelines, MHICC SOPs and the study Data Management Plan. As such, a MHICC medical monitor&#xD;
      will be appointed to the trial as the serious adverse event reporting contact (24/7).&#xD;
