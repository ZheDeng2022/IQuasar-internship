      This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance (MRI)-guided focal stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery (SRS) in treating patients with low- or intermediate-risk localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause&#xD;
      less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the correlation of histopathology findings in comparison to regions of the&#xD;
      prostate reported to be suspicious for harboring tumor burden on multiparametric MRI&#xD;
      report/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Demonstration of the dosimetric and radiobiological advantages of focal stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) versus whole-gland radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluation of clinical outcomes in focal SBRT for localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo 3 fractions of MRI-guided focal SRS every other day for 1 week. Patients&#xD;
      undergo additional MRI scans between the 2nd and 3rd fractionated treatments, at 6 months&#xD;
      following the end of radiation therapy, and at 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
