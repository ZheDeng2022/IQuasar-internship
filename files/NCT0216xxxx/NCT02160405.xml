  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional deficiencies can lead to a number of health problems in children. In Latin&#xD;
      America and the Caribbean countries, are registered so much problems of insufficient&#xD;
      ingestion of food as of imbalances in the composition of the diet. These latter are expressed&#xD;
      in the absence of micronutrients (iron, iodine, zinc, vitamin A), becoming a major health&#xD;
      burden in developing countries. Being the globally's leading risk factor for disease and&#xD;
      death, with hundreds of millions of pregnant women and young children particularly affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: In Nariño, Colombia higher levels of malnutrition are presented with respect&#xD;
      to country, just as micronutrient deficiency in children 1 to 4 years is higher than the&#xD;
      national average. Most of these households are poor families with restrictions on access to&#xD;
      food sources of these micronutrients, which is reported in a consumption of fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables, milk products and meat, less than the national average. In this place is&#xD;
      developing a project that aims to improve potato in higher yield, nutrition and resistance,&#xD;
      for contribute to increase food security of native communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluate the effect on iron levels generated by the inclusion of native potato in&#xD;
      the diet of children aged 2-5 years in institutional beneficiaries modality ICBF, in the&#xD;
      municipalities of Carlosama, Guachucal, Tuquerres, Cumbal and Pasto. Nariño. Colombia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A cluster randomized controlled trial. Open label Setting: 6 clusters, municipalities&#xD;
      of Carlosama, Guachucal, Tuquerres, Cumbal and Pasto (two towns), which will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to 2 groups: the treatment group that receives native potato, and the control group&#xD;
      that receives traditional potato, that will be include in the usual Institution meal&#xD;
      Participants: children from 2 to 5 years, beneficiaries of programs in institutional modality&#xD;
      of ICBF, in the municipalities of Carlosama, Guachucal, Tuquerres, Cumbal and Pasto.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: serum ferritin and transferrin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in the form of institutional programs ICBF, in the municipalities of&#xD;
      Carlosama, Guachucal, Túquerres, Cumbal and Pasto. Colombia. One hypothesis to a queue based&#xD;
      on the changes that occur over time after surgery in the mean values (μ) of serum ferritin in&#xD;
      the treatment group compared with the control group. A sample size of 212 children were&#xD;
      calculated. The study has been presented and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty&#xD;
      of Medicine of the National University of Colombia and the Institutional Review Board of the&#xD;
      participating institution. All parents of participating children must sign a written form to&#xD;
      accept the voluntary participation of their child in the study.&#xD;
