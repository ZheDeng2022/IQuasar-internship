  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a Pilot/Phase 1 trial of reduced intensity Haploidentical HSCT in&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia. The purpose of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and toxicity of reduced intensity conditioning haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research subjects will undergo reduced intensity conditioning (Hydroxyurea, ATG, Fludarabine,&#xD;
      Thiotepa, Melphalan) followed by infusion of a peripheral blood stem cell graft collected&#xD;
      from haploidentical family donors that are CD34+ positively selected using the CliniMACS&#xD;
      device. Sirolimus will be used for GVHD prophylaxis and given for 9 months post-transplant&#xD;
      and then tapered off by one year&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the CliniMACS device for CD34 selection will be performed at CNMC through&#xD;
      cross-reference of the master file for CliniMACS CD34+ Reagent by Milteyni Biotech (BB-MF&#xD;
      8061).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CliniMACs is an electromechanical device intended to isolate certain cell subsets from mixed&#xD;
      cell populations. When used in combination with the CliniMACs CD34 reagent, it is possible to&#xD;
      prepare extremely pure populations of CD34+ cells with upwards of 5 logs depletion of&#xD;
      contaminating T cells within a closed and sterile system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to use this system to select cells from HLA haploidentical related donors who have&#xD;
      been mobilized with G-CSF prior to stem cell collection. Since previous investigations of&#xD;
      this strategy in adult patients have not translated into enhanced long term survival, we&#xD;
      intend to limit this protocol to patients under the age of 22 as they have more rapid immune&#xD;
      reconstitution.&#xD;
