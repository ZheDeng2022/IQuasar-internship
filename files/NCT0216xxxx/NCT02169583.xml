  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first time GSK1325756 Solution for Infusion formulation that has been&#xD;
      administered to humans. Prior studies have been performed with oral GSK1325756. The primary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to obtain information on the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and twice daily intravenous (IV) administration of GSK1325756&#xD;
      in healthy subjects. In Part A, single, escalating doses will be given in the same cohort of&#xD;
      subjects after a seven day washout. In addition, the study will evaluate the absolute&#xD;
      bioavailability of a single dose of the current oral tablet formulation as compared to the IV&#xD;
      formulation in Part A. In Part B, twice daily (BID) intravenous dose administration will be&#xD;
      given for 5 days (9 total doses) in two separate cohorts of subjects. Data from this study&#xD;
      will provide understanding of the safety, tolerability, and PK of intravenously administered&#xD;
      GSK1325756 twice daily to guide dose selection in future clinical studies in patients with&#xD;
      viral respiratory tract infections&#xD;
