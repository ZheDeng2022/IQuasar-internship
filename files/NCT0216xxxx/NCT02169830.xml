  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' study plans to randomize treatment naive patients with vestibular migraine&#xD;
      to an 8 week trial of an escalating dose of either nortriptyline or topiramate followed by an&#xD;
      8 week crossover to the other drug if patient is willing, if patient wants to stay on first&#xD;
      medication we will just continue to follow. During the first 8 weeks if there is an&#xD;
      intolerance to the first drug they can be switched to the other drug at any point and then&#xD;
      followed on that medication for the remainder of the study. Response to therapy will be&#xD;
      quantified by the Migraine Specific Quality of Life (MSQ) and Dizziness Handicap Inventory&#xD;
      (DHI) administered at multiple time points during the study. Three groups of patients that&#xD;
      will be eligible for the study will include 1)Patients with Neuhauser dVM; 2)Patients with&#xD;
      pVM; and 3) Patients with dizziness that falls outside the Neuhauser criteria (non-Neuhauser&#xD;
      vestibular migraine or nNVM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that even patients with dizziness outside of the Neuhauser&#xD;
      dVM and pVM spectrum will respond to treatment for vestibular migraine, and thus likely have&#xD;
      migraine as a cause of their dizziness. Previous research by our group has suggested that&#xD;
      such patients do in fact respond to migraine therapy1. A second goal of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the comparative efficacy of nortriptyline and topiramate in the treatment of these&#xD;
      three subgroups of patients with vestibular migraine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After identification and trial entry, we will complete intake questionnaire to determine what&#xD;
      type of vestibular migraine category the patients qualify for, a standard of care office&#xD;
      visit with history and physical (Standard of Care) to review symptoms and previous treatment,&#xD;
      patients height and weight (standard of care) will be obtained. Patients will complete a&#xD;
      standard of care audiology assessment, and the following questionnaires: MSQ (Migraine&#xD;
      Symptom Questionnaire) Version 2.1, DHI (Dizziness Questionnaire) , C-SSRS (Columbia Suicide&#xD;
      Severity Rating Scale) and the MoSQ (Motion Sensitivity Questionnaire). All drug naive&#xD;
      patients will undergo a one month lead in of treatment involving dietary and behavioral&#xD;
      control of migraine. Emphasis will be given to cessation of known migraine triggers such as&#xD;
      caffeine, sodas, chocolates, alcohol (especially red wine) and aged cheeses. Patients who&#xD;
      have complete control of their symptoms with diet and behavior modification alone will be&#xD;
      followed for a total of 4 months to determine the durability of symptom relief. Patients who&#xD;
      fail behavior modification during the 2 to 4 month time point can chose to enter the drug&#xD;
      treatment portion of the study, as defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the one month point, patients will be brought into the clinic for a office visit with&#xD;
      history, physical, and weight checked and will complete MSQ V2.1, DHI, C-SSRS and the MoSQ,&#xD;
      then will be randomization to either nortriptyline or topiramate will occur. Randomization&#xD;
      will occur by opening the lowest numbered of a stack of envelopes which will contain a&#xD;
      randomly preselected card indicating which drug is to be used. The nortriptyline will be&#xD;
      given in an escalating fashion, starting at 25 mg PO qhs for 2 weeks, followed by 50 mg PO&#xD;
      qhs for 2 weeks, and finally 75 mg PO qhs. Patients will be encouraged to use the lowest&#xD;
      effective dose and to self-titrate their medication. Topiramate dosing will be 25 mg PO qhs&#xD;
      for 1 week, followed by 25 mg BID for 1 week, followed by 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg qhs&#xD;
      for 1 week, and finally 50 mg BID. Patients will be allowed considerable leeway in adjusting&#xD;
      their dosage and will be encouraged to stay on the lowest effective dose. Medication will be&#xD;
      provided open label to the patient and paid for through the patients' insurance, as this&#xD;
      intervention falls within current standard practice, and is not investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two, three and four months on drug patients will be brought into the clinic for a&#xD;
      office visit with history, physical, and weight checked and will complete MSQ V2.1, DHI,&#xD;
      C-SSRS and the MoSQ, then patients will be offered the opportunity to switch to the other&#xD;
      drug. Those patients who wish to switch drugs will first be weaned off their current drug&#xD;
      over a one week time period. Patients who elect to stay on their initial drug will be&#xD;
      followed for a total of four months. Patients who opt for trial of a second drug will then be&#xD;
      started on the second drug via a self-titrating protocol as described above and followed on&#xD;
      that drug for up to 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' clinical experience has shown that on occasion patients will refuse to&#xD;
      take more than a few doses of nortriptyline or topiramate due to intolerable side effects.&#xD;
      Such patients will be allowed to immediately initiate therapy with the other drug. The&#xD;
      medication change can be done with a phone call to their pharmacy without an office visit, as&#xD;
      is done in standard of care. Also, patients who already follow a rigorous migraine diet will&#xD;
      be allowed to enter the drug treatment phase immediately. In our experience, such patient&#xD;
      make up less than 5% of the population that presents for treatment of vestibular migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to therapy will be assessed during monthly visits with the use of the MSQ, DHI&#xD;
      and MoSQ questionnaires. Patients will be provided compensation for participating in the&#xD;
      study. $60 dollars will be paid to each patient for each month that they participate in the&#xD;
      study. Our goal is to recruit 100 patients over the span of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data which will be collected include age, sex, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), prior&#xD;
      head MRI or CT, results of vestibular testing, family history of migraine. A careful history&#xD;
      will focus on vestibular migraine comorbidities such as visual scotoma, ability to ride in&#xD;
      the back seat of a car, and history of &quot;sinus pain&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified as having one of three subtypes of vestibular migraine, based on&#xD;
      their symptoms and history as obtained during their initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Neuhauser definite vestibular migraine (dVM): (Neuhauser, 2009):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Episodic vestibular symptoms of at least moderate severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current of previous history of migraine according to the 2004 criteria of the&#xD;
           International Headache Society (IHS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. One of the following migrainous symptoms during 2 or more attacks of vertigo: migrainous&#xD;
           headache, photophobia, phonophobia, visual aura, or other aura&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other causes ruled out by appropriate investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for probable vestibular migraine (pVM):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Episodic vestibular symptoms of at least moderate severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One of the following A. current or previous history of migraine according to the 2004&#xD;
           criteria of the IHS B. migrainous symptoms during vestibular symptoms C. migraine&#xD;
           precipitants of vertigo in &gt; 50% of attacks: food triggers, sleep irregularities, or&#xD;
           hormonal change D. Response to migraine medications in more than 50% of attacks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other causes ruled out by appropriate investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for (non-Neuhauser vestibular migraine or nNVM) will include those patients who do&#xD;
      not fit the criteria for dVM and pVM but are felt by the investigator to have underlying&#xD;
      migraine as a possible cause of their dizziness. This includes patients with a remote history&#xD;
      of migraines, those with visual auras without headache, those with recurring self-described&#xD;
      &quot;sinus pain&quot; and those with significant motion intolerance, either to their own head motion&#xD;
      or motion in their surroundings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to know drug interactions, patients taking the following medications will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nortriptyline: monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO) such as phenelzine. Patients on oral&#xD;
      contraceptives will be asked to use a secondary method as nortriptyline can reduce the&#xD;
      effectiveness of oral contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topiramate: acetazolamide (kidney stones), digoxin&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic health record (EPIC) will be used for secure collection of all patient data.&#xD;
      Questionnaires filled out by patients will be scanned into EPIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 100, which nets 90 subjects into the randomized medication trial (two equal&#xD;
      groups of 45 subjects each), yields a power of 82% to detect a difference in patient-reported&#xD;
      effectiveness/acceptability between the nortriptyline and topiramate groups after two months&#xD;
      of medication use. This sample size estimate assumes 60% of subjects using nortriptyline&#xD;
      report it as effective/acceptable, in contrast to half as many subjects (or 30%) using&#xD;
      topiramate. The power calculation is based on a two-sized Z-test with pooled variance and&#xD;
      targeted significance level (alpha) of 0.05. The expected difference in outcome between the&#xD;
      two groups is based on our prior research (Mikulec, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects of the two drugs will be assessed. Specifically, the following known side&#xD;
      effects will be asked about and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nortriptyline: somnolence, weight gain, dry mouth, blurred vision Topiramate: Weight loss,&#xD;
      parasthesias, forgetfulness, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be allowed to maintain therapy or taper off the drugs. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that those that derive benefit from the drugs will choose to stay on them. All patients will&#xD;
      have the option of remaining under our care outside of the study.&#xD;
