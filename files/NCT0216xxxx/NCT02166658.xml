    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV lung or breast&#xD;
      cancer with progressive or recurrent brain metastases after prior external beam radiotherapy&#xD;
      will receive treatment with cabazitaxel until progression of brain metastases (BM) or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cabazitaxel is a new taxane compound that exhibited a broad spectrum of in vivo antitumor&#xD;
      activity, not only in docetaxel - sensitive tumor models, but also in tumors models in which&#xD;
      docetaxel was poorly or not active. In contrast to other taxanes, cabazitaxel has the ability&#xD;
      to cross the blood-brain-barrier. Marked antitumor activity was obtained in nude mice bearing&#xD;
      intracranial glioblastomas. Consequently, there is a good rationale to investigate&#xD;
      cabazitaxel in patients with breast or lung cancer and recurrent or progressive brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary object of the study is to measure objective tumor response of brain metastases&#xD;
      for patients with breast or lung cancer and recurrent or progressive brain metastases.&#xD;
