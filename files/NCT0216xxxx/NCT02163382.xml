  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation permits to support the work of breathing in case of respiratory&#xD;
      failure, but therapy also has many side effects. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which&#xD;
      delivers the ventilatory assist via a face mask or nasal canula, permits to decrease these&#xD;
      complications. However, NIV is not always successful and half of children in respiratory&#xD;
      failure finally require invasive ventilation. A major cause of NIV failure is the ventilator&#xD;
      inability to detect patient efforts. The new ventilatory mode NAVA (neurally adjusted&#xD;
      ventilatory assist) improves the detection of patient efforts during mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that NAVA improves synchrony during pediatric NIV and&#xD;
      therefore permits to unload the patient ventilatory efforts.&#xD;

      Nasogastric tube installation to monitor electrical activation of the diaphragm (EAdi):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific nasogastric tube equipped with an array of microelectrodes (Edi catheter, Maquet,&#xD;
      Solna, Sweden) will be installed after inclusion. This tube has an external aspect and size&#xD;
      (6F, 8F, or 12F depending on the patient size) similar to usual nasogastric tubes. The&#xD;
      gastric tube installation is extremely frequent in pediatric ICU, and systematic in patients&#xD;
      with ventilatory support, to empty the gastric gas and permit the feeding. The new tube will&#xD;
      stay in place after the study and could be used as a classic tube. The catheter position in&#xD;
      esophagus will be adjusted using a special window of the Servo i ventilator screen, which&#xD;
      permits to confirm the correct positioning close to the diaphragm [Barwing 2009]. It has&#xD;
      recently been confirmed that Edi catheter placement is not difficult and that the correct&#xD;
      placement of the nasogastric tube is actually facilitated by the possibility of activity&#xD;
      monitoring [Green 2011].&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIP jacket installation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A special jacket adapted to the patient size will be installed to monitor the lung volume&#xD;
      changes by impedance plethysmography (RIP). This sleeveless jacket is constituted of a large&#xD;
      band of distensible cloth in which 2 metallic coils are coated to record the impedance&#xD;
      changes created by the ventilation. The RIP coils will be connected to the RIP monitoring&#xD;
      module, and no volume calibration will be done to avoid the manipulation of patient airway.&#xD;
      RIP monitoring is completely non-invasive and no complications are expected [Emeriaud&#xD;
      2010][Emeriaud 2008].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Edi tube is connected to the Servo i to monitor EAdi, but the patient remains connected&#xD;
      to its usual ventilator with unmodified ventilator settings. Airway pressure, respiratory&#xD;
      volume and flow will be recorded simultaneously with EAdi during 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilator change:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a different ventilator was used prior to the study, the patient will be installed on a&#xD;
      Servo i ventilator, initially with the same ventilatory settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of NAVA parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) will not be modified. The NAVA level - the&#xD;
      proportionality factor that converts EAdi (microV) into pressure support (cmH2O) - will be&#xD;
      set using a specific window which simulates the pressure that would be delivered in NAVA. The&#xD;
      NAVA level will be initially adjusted to match the simulated pressure with the actual assist&#xD;
      pressure. If the patient is on CPAP (i.e. no assist pressure), the NAVA level will be&#xD;
      initially set to match an assist pressure of 5 cmH2O above PEEP. The maximal pressure alarm&#xD;
      will be set at 30 cmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAVA period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NAVA mode will be activated for one hour, under the continuous supervision by a physician&#xD;
      involved in the study, and with a continuous monitoring of vital signs including cardiac and&#xD;
      respiratory rate, SaO2, respiratory distress signs, patient agitation, and the normal&#xD;
      function of the ventilator. The NAVA level will be adjusted if the patient breathing&#xD;
      frequency is &gt; 40/min (progressive increase of NAVA level) or &lt; 12/min (decrease of NAVA&#xD;
      level), or if the delivered pressure is low (&lt;3 cmH2O) due to air leaks. Ventilatory&#xD;
      pressure, flow and volumes and EAdi will be continuously recorded during the last 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second period with conventional NIV settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be installed again with the ventilatory settings prescribed prior to the&#xD;
      study, and the ventilatory data will be recorded again for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire study, &quot;usual&quot; modifications of settings (e.g. adaptation of assist level,&#xD;
      FiO2, or PEEP) considered by the attending physician, the nurse, or a respiratory therapist,&#xD;
      will be permitted and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, if a clear clinical benefit of one mode or setting is observed&#xD;
      during the study, the attending physician will be informed to permit the optimal adaptation&#xD;
      of the ventilatory assist.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The inspiratory and expiratory times of the patient and of the ventilator will be identified cycle-by-cycle from the tracing of EAdi and airway pressure, respectively. The percentage of time spent in asynchrony (discordance between the patient and the ventilator actions) will be calculated [Beck 2004], as well as the delay to activate or inactivate the ventilatory support. The number of non-assisted breaths (increase in EAdi without pressure elevation) and of auto-triggered breaths (assist delivered in absence of EAdi activation) will also be counted [Thille 2006; Vignaux 2009].</description>
