      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together&#xD;
      with ibrutinib and rituximab in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma that has come back (relapsed), has not responded well to prior&#xD;
      treatments (refractory), has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic), or cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, use substances made from&#xD;
      living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop&#xD;
      cancer cells from growing. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide together with&#xD;
      ibrutinib and rituximab may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II doses of lenalidomide and ibrutinib for combination&#xD;
      with rituximab in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenalidomide, ibrutinib and&#xD;
      rituximab in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of the combination of&#xD;
      lenalidomide, rituximab and ibrutinib in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and&#xD;
      small lymphocytic lymphoma as defined by response rate, duration of response, and&#xD;
      progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 (up to 6 cycles), lenalidomide orally&#xD;
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (up to 12 cycles), and ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 6 months&#xD;
      for 10 years.&#xD;

             therapy until 6 months after the last rituximab dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be non-pregnant and non-nursing; the effects of ibrutinib on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and because B- cell receptor&#xD;
             kinase inhibitors agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are&#xD;
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             two forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation&#xD;
&#xD;

             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 3 days&#xD;
             after discontinuation of ibrutinib, 28 days after discontinuation of lenalidomide, and&#xD;
             12 months after discontinuation of rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;

             hours prior to starting cycle 1 of lenalidomide; further, they must either commit to&#xD;
             continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of&#xD;
             birth control: one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE&#xD;
             SAME TIME, at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; FCBP must also agree to&#xD;
             ongoing pregnancy testing; men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact&#xD;
             with a FCBP, even if they have had a successful vasectomy; a FCBP is a sexually mature&#xD;
             woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has&#xD;
             not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had&#xD;
             menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months); all patients must be&#xD;
             counseled by a trained counselor every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks&#xD;
             of fetal exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraception is recommended for 28 days prior to starting therapy, while&#xD;
             participating in this study, during dose interruptions, and for at least 3 days after&#xD;
             discontinuation of ibrutinib, 28 days after discontinuation of lenalidomide, and 12&#xD;
             months after discontinuation of rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of known human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) positivity; this does not have&#xD;
             to be checked prior to enrollment unless clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy must be greater than 60 days&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients should not receive growth factors or transfusions for at least 7 days prior&#xD;
             to first dose of study drug, with the exception of pegylated G-CSF (pegfilgrastim) and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study; pregnant women are&#xD;
             excluded in this study because ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with ibrutinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with ibrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)&#xD;
             resulting in (or as evidenced by) declining platelet or hemoglobin (Hgb) levels within&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring daily corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent of &gt;= 20 mg daily&#xD;
             should not be enrolled; if corticosteroids can be discontinued (or reduced to &lt; 20 mg&#xD;
             per day of prednisone or equivalent), the discontinuation or dose reduction should be&#xD;
             done at least 7 days prior to first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior malignancy, with the exception of the following:&#xD;

             disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or complete bowel obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection; patients that are&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresolved toxicities from prior anti-cancer therapy, defined as having not resolved&#xD;
