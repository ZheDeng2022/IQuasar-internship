  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a chemical marker in the blood,&#xD;
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1 alpha), can be used to predict subject's hospital outcomes&#xD;
      when the subject is diagnosed with sepsis. Sepsis is defined as either the presence of&#xD;
      pathogenic organisms or their toxins in the blood and tissues. Sepsis is one of the most&#xD;
      significant challenges in critical care medicine. The investigators propose that&#xD;
      hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1 alpha will correlate with the clinical features of Sepsis&#xD;
      and in the future, HIF-1 alpha may be used as a biomarker in Sepsis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sepsis is one of the most significant challenges in critical care. Septic shock (SS) is the&#xD;
      most severe form of sepsis and is associated with higher mortality, significant financial&#xD;
      expenses and longer lengths of stay. Pathophysiological mechanisms of SS include 3 key&#xD;
      components: 1) bacterial overgrowth, 2) spill of bacterial product into the blood causing&#xD;
      hemodynamic insufficiency, and 3) both lead to tissue hypoxia (TH). To date the biomarkers of&#xD;
      sepsis/SS are limited to hemodynamic parameters. However, aggressive fluid resuscitation does&#xD;
      not fully prevent development of tissue hypoxia (TH). To date the investigators are limited&#xD;
      in appreciating TH by measurement of lactic acid (LA), which is neither an early nor an&#xD;
      accurate marker. Unfortunately, LA has limited predictive value in SS due to its complex&#xD;
      metabolism. Thus, there is an acute need for biomarkers that would aid diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognosis of sepsis/septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular responses/adaptations to hypoxia rely on the transcription hypoxia-inducible factor&#xD;
      HIF, a heterodimeric protein composed of a constitutively expressed subunit and an inducible&#xD;
      (types 1, 2, and 3) subunit. More recently HIF was identified in diverse tissues including&#xD;
      blood; it has been also shown that HIF expression in blood cells is representative of&#xD;
      systemic tissues in hypoxic conditions.&#xD;
