  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label study that evaluates the safety and efficacy of IMMU-132 alone&#xD;
      and in combination with carboplatin in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. IMMU132&#xD;
      will be administered once-weekly for the first 2 weeks of 3-week treatment cycles. For those&#xD;
      patients assigned to also receive carboplatin, will receive it on the same schedules starting&#xD;
      30 minutes after the completion of IMMU-132 administration. Patients may receive up to a&#xD;
      maximum total of 8 cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMMU-132 alone and in&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin administered in 3-week treatment cycles for up to 8 cycles, in&#xD;
      patients with triple-negative breast cancer that have received at least two prior treatments.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to obtain data concerning pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center study. Eighty patients are planned to be enrolled, with an equal&#xD;
      distribution between the two groups. All patients will receive a starting dose of&#xD;
      IMMU-132administered once-weekly for the first 2 weeks of 3-week treatment cycles. For those&#xD;
      patients assigned to also receive carboplatin, carboplatin will also be administered on the&#xD;
      same schedules starting 30 minutes after the completion of IMMU-132 administration. Patients&#xD;
      may receive up to a maximum total of 8 cycles (16 doses), but patients with a complete&#xD;
      response, partial response or stable disease at that time, or patients who had achieved an&#xD;
      objective response, but relapsed after discontinuing treatment, may continue to be treated&#xD;
      based on physician discretion. Follow up is then required until resolution or stabilization&#xD;
      of any treatment-related toxicity, and patients with stable disease or objective responses&#xD;
      must also continue evaluations until survived.&#xD;
