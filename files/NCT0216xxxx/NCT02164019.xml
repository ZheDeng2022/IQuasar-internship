  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at two different types of surgeries regularly used for&#xD;
      treating cancer that has spread to and weakened the thigh bone (femur). Because it is not&#xD;
      known which of these surgeries is best, the investigators will compare the results of the two&#xD;
      procedures. They are looking to see if differences exist (after surgery) in function, quality&#xD;
      of life, pain control, and possible complications.&#xD;

    <description>(LSCH), &quot;Hip, Ball, Rod and Cement&quot; Replace the ball of the hip joint with a metal ball and a rod that is placed inside the thigh bone with cement to keep the implant in place. The study participation period for each patient is 360 days from the date of surgery and includes 5 defined timepoints that include the suture removal visit at 3 weeks and follow-up clinical visits for radiographs and rehabilitation progress checks at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. At each follow-up visit, a combination of questionnaires and physical tests will be administered to assess physical function, general health status, disability level, and pain control. Some patients may be in a rehabilitation center or on hospice care and will miss their follow-up appointments. To collect data for the primary endpoint, the 6 week and/or 12 week TESS can be done over phone if necessary.</description>

    <description>Intramedullary nailing (IMN), &quot;Rod and Screws&quot; A metal rod is placed inside your thigh bone and secured in place by metal screws just below the hip and above the knee. The study participation period for each patient is 360 days from the date of surgery and includes 5 defined timepoints that include the suture removal visit at 3 weeks and follow-up clinical visits for radiographs and rehabilitation progress checks at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgeon's estimated survival â‰¥ 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients presenting for orthopaedic evaluation with a painful impending pathologic&#xD;
             femur fracture or displaced pathologic femur fracture in the intertrochanteric,&#xD;
             pertrochanteric, or subtrochanteric region of the proximal femur. The anatomic region&#xD;
             of interest is defined by a line drawn from the base of the femoral neck to 5 cm below&#xD;
             the base of the lesser trochanter or 2 diaphyseal shaft widths, whichever is greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an impending fracture who have had bevacizumab are eligible provided&#xD;
             there will be a 3-week window between their last infusion and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of widespread visceral and/or osseous metastatic disease based on clinical&#xD;
             and radiographic evidence. (Patients may continue on study if surgery shows a&#xD;
             non-malignant process.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All cancer diagnoses, except lymphoma, will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated survival &lt;1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A large soft tissue mass or other disease involving an area outside of the defined&#xD;
             pertrochanteric anatomic region described above. (Patients excluded based on&#xD;
             intraoperative findings will be replaced on the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgical treatment of the area (i.e., revision cases). A biopsy does not&#xD;
             constitute prior surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic evidence of an intramedullary occlusion by blastic metastases that would&#xD;
             necessitate an alternative method of treatment, such as a plate/screw construct.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with advanced hip arthritis on radiographic imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous randomization for a contralateral procedure as part of this study&#xD;
