  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has documented serious health, mental health, and social-behavioral issues&#xD;
      among people living with HIV (PLH) in St. Petersburg. The investigators have established that&#xD;
      PLH are clustered in friendship groups with other HIV+ persons and that an intervention&#xD;
      delivered to groups composed of HIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM) who were friends in real&#xD;
      life reduced mental health distress more than individual counseling. Specific aims of the&#xD;
      collaborative mixed-methods, qualitative/ quantitative research are to: (1) identify&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers of medical care attendance and ART adherence among PLH in St.&#xD;
      Petersburg; (2) integrate these data into an intervention designed to increase HIV care&#xD;
      attendance, retention, and adherence; (3) carry out a test-of-concept pilot study that&#xD;
      recruits groups of PLH friends and delivers an intervention to intact PLH friendship groups&#xD;
      to encourage mutual social support for attending medical appointments and adhering to HIV&#xD;
      care; and (4) evaluate the effects of the intervention on both behavioral and biological&#xD;
      measures, including viral load. These specific aims will be achieved by research carried out&#xD;
      in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I, we will conduct in-depth interviews with 60 PLH and key informants in St.&#xD;
      Petersburg purposively selected to include HIV+ persons in and not in medical care, adherent&#xD;
      or not adherent to ART, and including men and women representing diverse exposure risks.&#xD;
      In-depth interviews will be analyzed to identify factors associated with attending or not&#xD;
      attending care and adhering or not adhering to ART, as well as identifying how HIV+ friends&#xD;
      can support one another in HIV care entry, retention, and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II, the investigators will undertake a randomized intervention pilot study in which&#xD;
      20 groups of PLH friends are recruited by enrolling a PLH seed who is not reliably in care or&#xD;
      is ART nonadherent and then recruiting all friends known by the seed to also be HIV+. A&#xD;
      7-session group intervention will be undertaken with all members of the friendship groups in&#xD;
      the experimental condition to increase care and adherence-related social support,&#xD;
      problem-solving, and mutual assistance for care. Baseline to 6-month followup data will&#xD;
      determine whether the intervention produces greater improvement than found in the comparison&#xD;
      group in care attendance and treatment adherence, improved mental health, lower substance&#xD;
      use, and lower HIV viral load.&#xD;
