      Background: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients are at risk to develop&#xD;
      periampullary and non-ampullary adenoma. Either a routine biopsy or an endoscopic removal of&#xD;
      the lesion is generally required to identify the presence of adenoma. However, the risk of&#xD;
      tissue sampling from the ampulla is high and non-ampullary polyps are sometimes numerous,&#xD;
      therefore resecting all the lesions is time consuming. To support the PIVI (Preservation and&#xD;
      Incorporation of Valuable endoscopic Innovations) initiative, a real-time diagnosis with NPV≥&#xD;
      90% is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic values of duodenal adenoma by dual focus NBI (dNBI) and&#xD;
      probe-based confocal endomicroscopy (pCLE) in FAP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Diagnostic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Single tertiary-care referral center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Twenty-six patients with previously diagnosed with FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Surveillance EGD with dNBI and pCLE. A real time adenoma reading was done by&#xD;
      two different endoscopists for each of the technique. Histology from the matched lesion was&#xD;
      used as the gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measurements: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and&#xD;
      accuracy. With the threshold for negative predictive value (NPV) ≥ 90%&#xD;

      Endoscopic procedure and criteria for adenoma diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The endoscopic diagnostic criteria to distinguish between adenoma and non-adenoma were&#xD;
           adopted from the previous studies by Uchiyama Y et al. in 2006. A real time adenoma&#xD;
           diagnosis was made by the two independent endoscopists (BI and RP) who are experienced&#xD;
           in dNBI and pCLE readings. Before entering into the study, they have experienced in&#xD;
           reviewing the images obtained by dNBI and pCLE and published the related results&#xD;
           elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study period, all 26 patients underwent the procedure under conscious&#xD;
           sedation with intravenous midazolam and meperidine. Ten milligrams of hyoscine was given&#xD;
           before the procedure to decrease intestinal peristalsis. At the beginning of the&#xD;
           procedure, the first endoscopist (BI) used an end-viewing HWE attached with an&#xD;
           endoscopic cap to examine the 1st and 2nd part of duodenum. The cap was used to&#xD;
           facilitate a proper enface view of the ampulla and surrounding area. All applicable&#xD;
           ampullary and non-ampullary (duodenal) polyps that larger than 1 millimeter would be&#xD;
           recruited in this study. Then dNBI mode was switched on for a real-time diagnosis by the&#xD;
           first endoscopist (BI). Subsequently, the second endoscopist (RP) who blinded to the NBI&#xD;
           reading would be called from another room to perform pCLE examination. Two and a half&#xD;
           milliliters of 10% fluorescein (Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation, Bangkok, Thailand)&#xD;
           was injected during pCLE evaluation. When there were more than one non-ampulary lesions,&#xD;
           the first endoscopist only navigated the lesions to study under pCLE to the second&#xD;
           endoscopist without telling the result of dNBI reading. Then, the matched polypectomy or&#xD;
           biopsy was performed by the second endoscopist. The duration of the entire procedure and&#xD;
           all complications related to the procedures were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological assessment - All polypectomy and biopsy specimens were immersed in formalin and&#xD;
      sent for histological examination. The specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin&#xD;
      (H&amp;E) and reviewed by an experienced GI pathologist (NW) blinded to the endoscopic diagnosis.&#xD;
      The definite diagnosis was based on the Vienna classification for differentiation between&#xD;
      adenoma and non-adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      -By using histology as the gold standard, the diagnostic values of dNBI and pCLE for&#xD;
      ampullary and non-ampullary polyp interpretation were assessed for sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. According to&#xD;
      PIVI recommendation for colonic adenoma diagnosis20, we used the 90% NPV readings as our cut&#xD;
      off. For numerical variables, the results were expressed as a mean ± SD, whereas other&#xD;
      quantitative variables are expressed as percentages. SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS (Thailand) Co.,&#xD;
      Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand) for Windows systems was used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
