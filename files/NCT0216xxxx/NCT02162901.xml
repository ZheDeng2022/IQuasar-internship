  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the reach, effectiveness, and costs of two&#xD;
      patient-centered, theory-based, technology-enhanced diabetes prevention programs to initiate&#xD;
      and sustain weight loss among pre-diabetic adults (i.e. impaired fasting glucose or impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance) within a health care setting. The overall aim is consistent with the&#xD;
      NIDDK's Behavioral/Prevention Research Program's focus on individual, family, and&#xD;
      community-based strategies for prevention of diabetes and its complications. While evidence&#xD;
      of lifestyle interventions that increase physical activity and improve eating habits to&#xD;
      achieve modest weight loss in delaying and preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes continues&#xD;
      to mount, the translation of these interventions into effective programs to health care&#xD;
      settings with modest resources remains a challenge. The proposed research project will&#xD;
      conduct a pragmatic clinical trial that employs a hybrid Preference/Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trial (RCT) designed to compare two technology-enhanced diabetes prevention programs in&#xD;
      achieving objectively verified weight loss relative to a standard care control at&#xD;
      comparatively lower costs. Adult patients (18 years of age and older) at risk for developing&#xD;
      diabetes will be randomized to either the Choice group or the Randomization group. Those&#xD;
      patients randomized to the Choice group (n=240) will have the opportunity to choose one of&#xD;
      two programs to participate in: 1. A 2-hour Small-Group (SG) session, with automated&#xD;
      interactive voice response (IVR) systems targeting personal action planning to support&#xD;
      lifestyle change and weight loss over a period of 12 months; or 2. A DVD-based intervention&#xD;
      with the same IVR follow-up. Those patients assigned to the RCT group (n=360) will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of three groups: 1. SG/IVR; 2. DVD/IVR; or 3. Enhanced standard-care (SC).&#xD;
      SC includes the referral to a currently offered pre-diabetes class. Primary outcome measures&#xD;
      include weight loss, cost, and reach of each program. Secondary outcome measures include&#xD;
      physical activity behavior; eating behavior; and process evaluation. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      both the SG/IVR and the DVD/IVR interventions will produce significantly greater amounts of&#xD;
      weight loss at 6, 12, and 18 months following program initiation than SC but will not differ&#xD;
      from one another. The investigators also hypothesize that the DVD/IVR will have broader reach&#xD;
      and may be more cost-effective than SG/IVR or SC.&#xD;
