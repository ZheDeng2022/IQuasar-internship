      The Mindfulness Training for Smokers Online Feasibility Study is a pilot study designed to&#xD;
      test Mindfulness Training for Smokers in an Internet format with phone counseling.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MTS Online Feasibility Study is funded for through a five-year K23 NIH training grant&#xD;
      awarded to Dr. James Davis, the Principal Investigator on this protocol. The study enrollment&#xD;
      goal is N=50 adult smokers. MTS Online is an Internet-based smoking cessation intervention&#xD;
      that provides access to video material and instructional support for 8 mindfulness classes&#xD;
      over a 6-week period. The MTS Online Feasibility Study aims to explore the feasibility of an&#xD;
      Internet-based version of MTS, specifically looking at issues of on-line participation and&#xD;
      Internet site use, adherence to instructed mindfulness practice regimen, and overall&#xD;
      acceptability of MTS Online to a smoking population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited for MTS Online through existing recruitment mechanisms already&#xD;
      in place for MTS. Specifically, participants who decline or are excluded from the MTS Study&#xD;
      due solely to scheduling conflicts will be offered participation in MTS Online. All other&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are identical to the MTS study and discussed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a decline or exclusion from the MTS Study due to scheduling and no other reason,&#xD;
      research assistant will ask the caller if they would like the phone number for the Wisconsin&#xD;
      Tobacco Quit Line and will ask the caller if they would like to hear about an online version&#xD;
      of the MTS program. If the participant says they are interested, the RA will read a&#xD;
      description of the online program and phone screening through the MTS Online Phone Screening&#xD;
      Script. This script includes all inclusion and exclusion criteria found in the MTS Study,&#xD;
      with the exception of the question on whether the caller can attend all the class meetings.&#xD;
      If at the end of the phone script, the caller decides that they would like to come in for an&#xD;
      Orientation Meeting, they will be sent an email providing instructions for scheduling their&#xD;
      Orientation Meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Orientation Meeting/Study Visit 1 MTS staff will provide a general description of&#xD;
      the study and review the study consent form. If potential participants choose to join the&#xD;
      study they will sign the consent form. After signing consent potential participants will be&#xD;
      provided instruction on the use of nicotine patches, smoking calendars and will be provided&#xD;
      with intervention materials. Research Assistants will assist participants as they log onto&#xD;
      the MTS Online website and create a unique user ID. This ID will be used for all MTS Online&#xD;
      features including communicating through the online forum and viewing instructional videos.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be given a course schedule with a &quot;class time&quot; for their first&#xD;
      class. After this, participants will fill out a Scan Form Questionnaire and proceed to&#xD;
      collection of clinical measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention/Study Sign Up: During the Orientation potential participants will be provided&#xD;
      with instructions on how to sign up for the intervention and study. This will include the&#xD;
      following steps that must be completed through the individual's own Internet access (i.e. not&#xD;
      completed at UW-CTRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sign on to the MTS Online Forum using the username and password provided during the&#xD;
           orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Respond to the question &quot;Do you want to join the MTS Online Study?&quot; with the answer&#xD;
           &quot;Yes.&quot; Participants will be asked to review Class 1 in the MTS Instructional Video and&#xD;
           MTS Manual before or during the time scheduled for Class 1. After this time,&#xD;
           participants will be asked begin using various mindfulness practices and answer some&#xD;
           questions provided by their instructor on how the practices went. This takes place&#xD;
           primarily on the MTS Forum where other class participants can benefit from the&#xD;
           interaction. Participants will, however, also have access to the instructors email&#xD;
           address for private interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT): All participants will receive two weeks of nicotine&#xD;
      patches to start on their Quit Day. Patches will be provided by the MTS Study and mailed&#xD;
      directly to PO Box or home address provided by participants approximately 10 days prior to&#xD;
      their Quit Day (to assure ample time for delivery). Patch dosing for all participants will be&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 mg patches for participants who smoke 10 or fewer cigarettes per day 21 mg patches for&#xD;
      participants who smoke over 10 cigarettes per day&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTS Online: Participants will have access to 8 classes over a 6-week period through the MTS&#xD;
      Online website - www.sittoquit.org. The first 5 classes include instruction through the MTS&#xD;
      Instructional Video and MTS Manual. The last 3 classes are provided through materials in the&#xD;
      MTS Manual alone. The MTS website contains forum designed specifically for the MTS Online&#xD;
      Participants. On this forum, MTS Online Feasibility Study participants can discuss topics&#xD;
      related to smoking and mindfulness in discussion groups moderated by MTS mindfulness&#xD;
      instructors. Participants will also be provided with the MTS Audio-CD that contains guided&#xD;
      mindfulness exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTS Online Classes: MTS Online classes are provided through the MTS Instructional Video and&#xD;
      MTS Manual. The classes provide instruction in mindfulness mediation, mindful walking,&#xD;
      mindful eating, and other mindfulness exercises. MTS Online classes provide instruction on&#xD;
      how to use mindfulness skills to manage relapse challenges such as smoking triggers, craving,&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, strong emotions, and stressful situations. The forum serves as a quit&#xD;
      smoking support group and provides a place for participants to learn from one another's&#xD;
      challenges and through the guidance of a mindfulness instructor. MTS Online classes are&#xD;
      available through the MTS Online website. The classes will follow a regular schedule in which&#xD;
      participants are to have watched the video material by a certain date (see course schedule&#xD;
      above). Following this time, a forum discussion will begin on the website, moderated by the&#xD;
      MTS Online mindfulness instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTS Online Quit Day: Guidelines will be provided to participants for conducting their own&#xD;
      personal Quit Day. Participants are encouraged to set aside additional time for mindfulness&#xD;
      practice during their Quit Day. Online forum discussion will also take place on the Quit Day.&#xD;
      Nicotine patches will be started on the Quit Day and will be continued for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTS Online Instructors: Five instructors will moderate various waves of MTS Online. These&#xD;
      five include the three instructors who have been trained to teach the Mindfulness Training&#xD;
      for Smokers Intervention (see Key Personnel). In addition, the study PI, Dr. James Davis, and&#xD;
      a graduate student working on the project, Simon Goldberg, will co-facilitate the early&#xD;
      waves. All five MTS Online instructors have completed UW IRB modules provided for Research on&#xD;
      Human Subjects. The three MTS instructors have been teaching the MTS course for the last 12&#xD;
      months. MTS Instructors have education the equivalent of a BA/BS or higher and have 2 or more&#xD;
      years experience teaching meditation and mindfulness practices. MTS Instructors have&#xD;
      completed the MTS Instructor Training Course provided over a weekend. MTS Instructor Training&#xD;
      includes standard methods normally provided at CTRI including HIPPA training and UW-IRB&#xD;
      training for individuals involved in research on human subjects. Instructor Training also&#xD;
      includes instruction on how to conduct MTS including training to familiarize instructors with&#xD;
      the MTS Instructional Video, MTS Audio CD and MTS Manual. The list of Key Personnel on the&#xD;
      IRB protocol will be updated as new instructors are trained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTS Instructional Video: The MTS Instructional Video is a 2-hour DVD course with interviews&#xD;
      provided by multiple nationally recognized experts on mindfulness and smoking addiction. It&#xD;
      describes how to apply mindfulness to overcome obstacles in smoking addiction. The video is&#xD;
      divided into five chapters, one chapter for each class prior to the Quit Day. Most chapters&#xD;
      are 15- 20 minutes long. The chapters will provide the primary course material for MTS&#xD;
      Online. Participants will be instructed to watch portions of the video on a pre-specified&#xD;
      schedule (see above) and participate in forum discussion on topics addressed in the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTS Manual: The MTS Manual contains organizational materials, conceptual information and&#xD;
      class exercises. It follows the format of the MTS Video but expands on the information. The&#xD;
      manual is intended to reinforce and expand participants understanding of how to use&#xD;
      mindfulness to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTS Website: The MTS website is available through the URL: www.sittoquit.org. The MTS website&#xD;
      contains a 2-minute video on the homepage that provides information on the study and&#xD;
      intervention. MTS Online participants will be able to gain access to other parts of the web&#xD;
      site by use of a unique login name and password created during the Orientation Meeting/Study&#xD;
      Visit 1. The MTS website contains a meeting calendar, the MTS Instructional Video, the MTS&#xD;
      Manual and the MTS Online Forum specially designed so that participants in the MTS Online&#xD;
      Feasibility Study can interact with MTS Instructors and other participants. An additional&#xD;
      forum exists for non-Online participants (i.e. participants in the non-online MTS study). The&#xD;
      website is maintained through University of Wisconsin information technology services.&#xD;
      Activity on the web site will be monitored by the PI and by a UW CTRI IT specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Meditation/MTS Audio CD: MTS Online participants will be asked to meditate each day&#xD;
      with the MTS Audio CD starting after their first mindfulness class and continuing until 1&#xD;
      month after their Quit Day, although participants will be encouraged to practice meditation&#xD;
      indefinitely. The MTS Audio-CD contains a 15-minute and a 30-minute guided meditation&#xD;
      practice. The CD was made by Dr. James Davis and provides instructions for mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation.&#xD;
