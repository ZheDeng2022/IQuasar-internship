  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies have demonstrated a very low prevalence of women meeting physical activity&#xD;
      and weight gain recommendations during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to provide a&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention to increase physical activity, reduce carbohydrate intake, prevent&#xD;
      excessive gestational weight gain, decrease postpartum weight retention, and improve mental&#xD;
      well-being compared to &quot;usual care&quot; using a randomized controlled design in pregnant women.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will receive behavioral lifestyle counseling and take&#xD;
      part in monthly one-on-one visits with a registered dietitian (RDN) from approximately week&#xD;
      14 of their pregnancy to child birth. Participants in the &quot;usual care&quot; group (control) will&#xD;
      not receive any lifestyle counseling. Data collected from this group will be used to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the lifestyle intervention. Unlike many studies examining diet and&#xD;
      physical activity factors alone, this study evaluates additional psychosocial factors such as&#xD;
      psychological health, self-efficacy, competence, motivation and barriers that may influence&#xD;
      excessive gestational weight gain. In addition, the Self-Determination Theory framework will&#xD;
      be used to measure how motivation and motivational interviewing strategies can help explain&#xD;
      changes in volitional behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women will be recruited using mass email recruitment, fliers posted at local&#xD;
      community settings, and at local OBGYN offices in Ames,IA. Pregnant women will be recruited&#xD;
      prior to their 14th week of gestation. Interested individuals will contact the Blossom&#xD;
      Project staff for further information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled design will be used. Following baseline data collection, women will&#xD;
      be randomized into the intervention group (n=30) or control (n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the goal is to have a total of 30 women in the intervention group and 30 in&#xD;
      the control. With an attrition rate of 20% investigators plan to enroll 37 women per group.&#xD;
      Furthermore, increased enrollment numbers will cover inconsistencies that may arise with&#xD;
      missing or uninterpretable data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who contact the Blossom Project will be screened for eligibility. Individuals&#xD;
      that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will meet with a Blossom Project staff member&#xD;
      to sign an informed consent form approved by the Iowa State University Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (ISU-IRB). A &quot;medical consent form&quot; (not the consent form for the study participant)&#xD;
      will be sent to the woman's primary obstetric provider asking to confirm qualification&#xD;
      criteria. Participants will then be asked to complete a medical history questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be asked to complete a maximum of four data collection periods.&#xD;
      Participants will report to the Nutrition Wellness Research Center (NWRC) either on campus&#xD;
      (HNSB 2021, 2022, 2023) or the facility located at 2325 North Loop Drive, Suite 6100, Ames,&#xD;
      Iowa 50010, at the beginning and end of each of the four data collection periods. A &quot;visit&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;data collection period&quot; is defined as 8 days. There are 3 data collection periods during&#xD;
      pregnancy (visits 1-3) and one post-partum visit (visit 4). Visit 4 is not an 8-day data&#xD;
      collection period and will take no more than 90 minutes at the NWRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that will be collected during each of the data collection periods will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Prior to 14-weeks of pregnancy (8-14 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent form: Participants will meet with a staff member to discuss the consent form and&#xD;
           requirements of the study. Signed informed consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
           participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical provider consent: Medical providers will confirm qualification criteria for each&#xD;
           participant. The medical provider consent must be received prior to a woman beginning&#xD;
           the walking program (intervention group). Participants will sign this form at visit 1 to&#xD;
           grant Blossom Project staff the permission to contact their medical provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history questionnaire: Each participant will fill out a medical history&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity assessment: Participants will receive verbal and written instructions&#xD;
           on how to collect data regarding their physical activity. Each participant will wear 2&#xD;
           activity monitors to assess physical activity patterns over the 8-day monitoring period&#xD;
           at weeks 8-14, 26-28 and 34-36 of their pregnancy. The sensors will be worn on the left&#xD;
           arm over the triceps muscle (SenseWear Mini armband) and on the right leg over the&#xD;
           quadriceps muscle (activPAL). All of these monitors have been used in our previous&#xD;
           pregnancy studies with minimal complaints. Participants are required to record all their&#xD;
           daily activities in a physical activity log that will be provided. The log is required&#xD;
           to be recorded over the same consecutive 8 days for 24 hours a day that the 2 activity&#xD;
           monitors are worn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary assessment: Participants will receive verbal instructions on how to collect data&#xD;
           regarding their dietary intake. Each woman will complete a 3-day weighed diet record&#xD;
           which requires her to weigh and record all food and beverages consumed for 2 weekdays&#xD;
           and 1 weekend day. Detailed written instructions will also be provided in a binder in a&#xD;
           data collection bag with a dietary scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental Well-being: Participants will complete the World Health Organization Quality of&#xD;
           Life questionnaire that measures physical health, psychological health, social&#xD;
           relationships and environment, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale, which has been&#xD;
           used for non-postnatal women as well as a screening scale for depression (pre-testing&#xD;
           for our study), and a battery of standardized questionnaires regarding perceived&#xD;
           self-efficacy, competence, motivation and barriers to control weight gain during&#xD;
           pregnancy, and exercise safety beliefs. It should take approximately 15 minutes at each&#xD;
           visit to complete these surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements: Height and weight will be measured. Body composition will&#xD;
           be assessed using the BodPod, an air displacement plethysmograph that uses whole body&#xD;
           densitometry to determine body composition using body mass and volume measures. We have&#xD;
           used this technique in previous Blossom Project studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scheduling of follow-up appointment: Participants will schedule a time to return to the&#xD;
           research facility the following week to return all monitors and materials (diet record,&#xD;
           data collection bag, dietary scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At enrollment, participants will fill out a Release of Medical Record form for their&#xD;
           delivering hospital, to allow a Blossom Project staff member the ability to attain birth&#xD;
           weight, birth length, head circumference, and APGAR scores at 1- and 5-minutes after the&#xD;
           child is born utilizing medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (weeks 26-28):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity assessment via two monitors: SenseWear armband and the activPAL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3-day weighed diet record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same battery of the psychological variables (as described earlier) will be measured&#xD;
           during this period. In addition a motivational interviewing fidelity checklist will be&#xD;
           collected (through observations of the counseling sessions and self-reports from the&#xD;
           counselor) to ensure that the motivational interviewing strategies were implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements: Weight 2-hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: The oral glucose&#xD;
           tolerance test will consist of providing a fasted blood sample (following an overnight&#xD;
           fast of 10-12 hours), consuming a 75-gram oral glucose solution and a blood sample at 60&#xD;
           minutes and 120 minutes following the consumption of the glucose solution. During this&#xD;
           2-hour period, the participant will be asked to remain seated at the research facility.&#xD;
           The blood draw will be conducted by an experienced phlebotomist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (weeks 34-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity assessment via two monitors: SenseWear armband and the activPAL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3-day weighed diet record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure of psychological variables (as described earlier) will be measured and a&#xD;
           motivational fidelity checklist (as described in visit 2). During this visit, perceived&#xD;
           support using the Health Care Climate questionnaire and psychological need satisfaction,&#xD;
           using the Activity Feeling Scale, will be used to measure whether an autonomy supportive&#xD;
           climate during the individualized lifestyle counseling was established for the&#xD;
           intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements: Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 (2 months post-partum):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements: Weight and maternal body composition using the BodPod.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infant Outcomes: birth outcomes; body composition using the PeaPod, air displacement&#xD;
           plethysmograph used to assess infant body composition. The infant will be placed in a&#xD;
           temperature-controlled test chamber of the PeaPod with a continuous outside air source&#xD;
           for a brief amount of time (approximately one minute or less) while the measurement is&#xD;
           taking place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental well-being: The Quality of Life scale, the postpartum depression scale and the&#xD;
           perceived motivation and self-efficacy to continue to be physically active will be&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to protect the privacy of participants within the study records identifying&#xD;
      participants will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by applicable laws and&#xD;
      regulations. Records will not be made publicly available. To ensure confidentiality to the&#xD;
      extent allowed by law, the following measures will be taken. Participants will be assigned a&#xD;
      unique code that will be used on forms instead of their name. The signed consent form,&#xD;
      medical provider consent form, and release of medical information forms will all need the&#xD;
      woman's full name to identify her to her prenatal clinic and delivering hospital. These forms&#xD;
      will be locked in a separate filing cabinet from the forms with the participant codes to&#xD;
      prevent identification of the participants. If the results are published, the identity will&#xD;
      remain confidential. The data obtained from the study will be regarded as privileged and&#xD;
      confidential. The privacy will be maintained in any future analysis and/or presentation of&#xD;
      the data with the use of coded identifications for each participant's data.Only members of&#xD;
      the Blossom Project lab staff will have access to the data and study records. All data will&#xD;
      be stored in a locked file cabinet with access only by the principal investigator and project&#xD;
      staff. This data will be kept on hand in a separate locked file in the PI's laboratory (HNSB&#xD;
      1109, Iowa State University) until the results of the study have been published. Identifiers&#xD;
      will be kept separate from the data. All electronic data is stored on a shared drive only&#xD;
      accessible to the principal investigator and project staff which requires a password to&#xD;
      access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis data will be presented as descriptive variables. These variables&#xD;
      will consist of diet, physical activity characteristics, adherence to daily step count&#xD;
      recommendations, and postpartum outcomes. Between group differences, time effects, and&#xD;
      corresponding interactions in the above variables will be assessed by a series of two-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance contrasts. When identified, such differences will be further explored,&#xD;
      in terms of relationships to the other measured characteristics of the study groups via&#xD;
      correlations and regression-based modeling procedures. Statistical significance will be set&#xD;
      at p &lt; 0.05 and adjusted for any multiple comparisons.&#xD;
