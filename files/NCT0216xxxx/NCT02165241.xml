  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly known that heart failure (HF) is the main cause of mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      which affects about 15 million people in the world and is the primary chronic cause of death.&#xD;
      In spite of the development of pharmacological therapies which have led to a good control of&#xD;
      the pathology, almost 50% of patients with advanced HF does not survive after the first year.&#xD;
      Heart failure consists of a deterioration of the cardiac pump, whose performance become&#xD;
      insufficient to satisfy the organism needs. HF can be the consequence of various pathologies,&#xD;
      such as ischemia, chronic hypertension, valvulopathies, pericarditis, etc. In conditions of&#xD;
      chronic overload, as the one induced by the cited pathologies, the cardiomyocytes reply with&#xD;
      hypertrophy and/or death due to necrosis or apoptosis. At the same time, there is a collagen&#xD;
      alteration which causes the substitution of the myocardial damaged portion with fibrotic&#xD;
      material, increasing in this way cardiac rigidity and reducing contractility. Finally, the&#xD;
      onset of inflammation, the activation of the immune system and of the inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      affect heart functionality. These phenomena are regulated by a complex interaction between&#xD;
      the cellular and molecular mechanisms, which moreover guarantee the homeostasis maintenance&#xD;
      in physiological conditions. Nevertheless, their imbalance activates a complex series of&#xD;
      events which have recently started to be recognized and studied. In effect, a recent work has&#xD;
      underlined the importance of the splenic monocytes in the cardiac response to acute heart&#xD;
      ischemia, changing our vision concerning the role of the immune system in heart&#xD;
      diseases.Historically, the term &quot;cardiac remodeling&quot; had been introduced to describe the&#xD;
      anatomical change of the heart which occurs after myocardial infarction. At a later stage, it&#xD;
      has been acknowledged that also other pathological conditions, such as chronic hypertension,&#xD;
      can be a cause of the myocardial remodeling. Physiologically, the immune system cells have&#xD;
      always been considered for their role of protection from infections. Recently, instead,&#xD;
      evidence have been showing that immune system cells might have far more complex functions in&#xD;
      the heart. The myocardial remodeling comes from modifications that may be adaptive to the&#xD;
      initial insult, but then this structural adjustment may become the activation of&#xD;
      structural/metabolic circles which can potentially culminate in the transition to HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will evaluate the immunological profile in relation to cardiac&#xD;
      geometry variations in hypertensive patients. Aim of this project is to characterize the&#xD;
      profile of immune system activation during the process of cardiac remodeling which is typical&#xD;
      of the cardiomyopathy of overload. The main goal will be reached through the characterization&#xD;
      of the circulating profile of immune system cells, in order to find a correlation with the&#xD;
      clinical phenotype.&#xD;

        Patients will be selected from the outpatient cardiac centre of the IRCCS Mediterranean&#xD;
        Neurological Institute Neuromed, according to specific inclusion criteria. Approximately&#xD;
        100 subjects aged between 30 and 65 years will be included in the study. At the present 30&#xD;
        subjects have been enrolled.&#xD;
