      Objectives:Physicians from the Shanghai Jiading community clinic were invited to attend the&#xD;
      study seminar. Those physicians who meet the criteria of the study plan were being selected&#xD;
      to participate voluntarily. From their patient's record, the physicians will recruit a total&#xD;
      of 1300 patients with type 2 diabetes who meet the criteria of the Jiading Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study utilizes the social learning theory that motivation and social support are&#xD;
      important to make behavioral change. The mechanism of providing incentive for patients and&#xD;
      physicians will be established after the permission from the Internal Review Board of the&#xD;
      hospital and will be approved by the hospital director. Physicians and their patients were&#xD;
      randomly divided into 4 groups: Group 1- Physicians only; Group 2 - Patients only; Group 3 -&#xD;
      Both Physicians and Patients, Group 4 - control. Groups 1-3 will receive incentives if they&#xD;
      can maintain the ideal level of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) during the 3-years study period. The&#xD;
      forth group serves as a control and will not receive any incentive but will be provided&#xD;
      diabetes education booklet and group education courses for DM control as usual. Based on the&#xD;
      annual evaluation of the level of improvement on HbA1c that is a joint effort of both&#xD;
      patients and physicians to achieve the targeted goal of adequate HBA1c level, the value of&#xD;
      incentives will be increased accordingly. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of incentive as an intervention tool to improve the health status of the diabetic patients.&#xD;

      Methods：&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open- label controlled randomized cluster trial and will invite eligible&#xD;
      physicians and their patients to attend the study. These physicians work in health community&#xD;
      center at Shanghai Jiading district and their patients are from the district community. Each&#xD;
      physician should care and monitor at least 20 of his or her patients. This serves as a&#xD;
      cluster randomized unit. The study size consists of 40 or more units within the Jiading&#xD;
      District of Shanghai. Samples will taken from these patients according to the preset schedule&#xD;
      and will measure patients' level of HbA1c accordingly. The physicians will recruit their&#xD;
      patients who meet the criterion of the Jiading Study Standard. All of these patients have&#xD;
      established their own health record by physicians in the community health center. To the&#xD;
      enrolled patients, the study will obtain the information such as demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment, complications , various of biochemical index, skill and capacity of&#xD;
      disease self-management, etc. Biomarkers and genetic risk factors will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      study subjects. The study also will give several training courses to the enrolled physicians&#xD;
      and the patients, all of them need to meet the study criteria and will sign the inform&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use the method of randomized complete block design to classify the enrolled&#xD;
      units into 4 groups. Group 1- Physicians only; Group 2 - Patients only; Group 3 - Both&#xD;
      Physicians and Patients, Group 4 - control. Groups 1-3 will receive incentives if they can&#xD;
      obtain or/and maintain the ideal level of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) during the 3-years study&#xD;
      period. We aim to achieve a target of HbA1c &lt; 7% or to reduce 0.5% HbA1c level annually&#xD;
      during 3 years study period. The incentive is in the form of cash or same value awards. The&#xD;
      amount of the incentives will increase annually depending upon the change of HbA1c. The award&#xD;
      is served as an motivation factor and token for rewarding the desire for self-discipline and&#xD;
      disease management to enhance self-efficacy. The control group will not receive any&#xD;
      incentives but will be provided diabetes education booklet and group education courses for DM&#xD;
      control as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use the existing tele-medicine system to monitor patients' blood pressure and&#xD;
      blood glucose remotely. The system of the telemedicine will also provide a series of diabetes&#xD;
      education and training courses to support the physicians and the patients about the diabetes&#xD;
      treatment, care and the self-management on the diseases. The study will document the changes&#xD;
      on the patients' blood pressure, biochemical index, medication, quality of life,&#xD;
      self-management skill of diabetes, life behavior, complications and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be ended in 36 months, endpoint measurement indicators are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Withdraw rate: Patient who drop out from the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diabetic complication rate: Patient with new complications, such as macro- or&#xD;
           micro-vascular complications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Admission rate due to diabetic related illness： Patient's diabetic condition worsen,&#xD;
           needs to be hospitalized or surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frequency of hypoglycemia incidences：Patient who has frequently severe hypoglycemia or&#xD;
           other complications that can not continue the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mortality rate among enrolled patients Death.&#xD;
