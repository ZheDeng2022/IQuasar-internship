      A randomized control trial investigating &quot;Biomechanical Correction of the Spine according to&#xD;
      Kozyavkin&quot; (BCSK) which is a part of the treatment concept &quot;Intensive Neurophysiological&#xD;
      Rehabilitation System&quot; (INRS). BCSK is used with the aims to reduce muscle tone and improve&#xD;
      gross and fine motor function in children with Spastic Bilateral Cerebral Palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a collaboration between the International Clinic of Rehabilitation (ICR) in&#xD;
      Ukraine and the Karolinska Institute (KI) in Sweden. The intervention and the assessments are&#xD;
      performed at ICR. The primary outcome measure, evaluation of gross motor function with the&#xD;
      test GMFM 66 is filmed and the recordings are transferred to KI together with all assessment&#xD;
      data. KI are responsible for study research design and collects, analyzes and processes all&#xD;
      data. It is a double blinded study. Only two persons will know to which group the subject&#xD;
      belongs, the person performing the randomization process in Sweden and the doctor performing&#xD;
      the spinal corrections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two aims of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of &quot;Biomechanical Correction of the Spine&quot; (BCSK) in children&#xD;
           with Spastic Bilateral Cerebral Palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of &quot;Intensive Neurophysiological Rehabilitation System&quot; (INRS) in&#xD;
           children with Spastic Bilateral Cerebral Palsy.&#xD;

    <description>The &quot;INRS&quot; is a treatment program developed at the International Clinic of Rehabilitation where the spinal manipulation is one of several components. There may be some variation in treatment depending on the clinical situation. All children receive the main treatment components which are massage, physical therapy, warm wax and paraffin applications and low electro stimulation with a special portable device as a part of treatment called &quot;Reflexotherapy&quot;.</description>
