  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Budesonide + Procaterol HFA MDI is a novel asthma product containing both budesonide and&#xD;
      procaterol in a single inhaler. Budesonide is a corticosteroid that treats underlying airway&#xD;
      inflammation in asthma. Procaterol is a direct acting sympathomimetic with predominantly&#xD;
      Beta-adrenoceptor stimulant activity selective to Beta-2 receptors (a Beta-2 agonist). It is&#xD;
      used as a bronchodilator in the management of reversible airways obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease. Budesonide and Procaterol therefore have complementary effects, treating two&#xD;
      different components of asthma.&#xD;
