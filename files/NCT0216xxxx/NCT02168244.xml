  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injectable biologic drugs are used as a treatment of psoriasis. These injections can&#xD;
      sometimes be associated with pain. In this study the investigators aim to reduce the pain by&#xD;
      applying heat or ice to the skin 2-3 minutes before injecting the drug, and to compare the&#xD;
      pain to injection without any heat or ice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of their therapy, some patients with psoriasis require treatment with biologic drugs,&#xD;
      which are injected into their skin. While these are very effective, patients may experience&#xD;
      some pain or discomfort associated with the injection of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study conducted at Mount Sinai hospital, the investigators aim to identify&#xD;
      whether this injection-related pain can be reduced if the area of skin to be injected with&#xD;
      the biologic drug is treated with either ice packs or heating for two to three minutes prior&#xD;
      to the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' aim is to include a total of 110 patients into this study, who have been&#xD;
      started by their physician on one of these biologic drugs, such as etanercept, adalimumab,&#xD;
      ustekinumab, or receiving secukinumab as part of a research study. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      at the Dermatology department. Patients who are receiving a biologic drug, which is injected&#xD;
      subcutaneously (into their skin) are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive his/her injection at our study site, by a study&#xD;
      doctor/investigator. The same designee should inject the subject all three times. Each&#xD;
      patient will receive a total of three of their biologic drug injections at the study site, so&#xD;
      he/she can receive the injection once following pre-treatment with ice, once following&#xD;
      pre-treatment with heating, and once without any pre-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be asked to mark the intensity of the pain associated with the injection&#xD;
      on a scale, consisting of a horizontal line, by placing a single mark on the scale. The order&#xD;
      of pre-treatment with ice or heat, or no pre-treatment will be randomized among all subjects&#xD;
      (1/3 will receive ice first, 1/3 will receive heat first, 1/3 will receive no treatment&#xD;
      first; the same randomization ratio will apply for the second and third injections).&#xD;
