  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral testing is the gold standard for diagnosing ASD. These tests, including ADOS and&#xD;
      ADI-R are subjective, require trained staff to administer, are time-consuming, and can only&#xD;
      be administered at a later age. Blood-, urine- or stool-based diagnostic biomarker test for&#xD;
      ASD would enable objective early diagnosis, potentially even before clinical symptoms are&#xD;
      present, hence early behavioral intervention, and potentially eliminating the need for&#xD;
      trained staff. Ideally, such a test would not only conserve money and time but would also&#xD;
      provide clues to ASD pathogenesis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence that at least a subset of children diagnosed with ASD also&#xD;
      have aberrant immune functions. This study will attempt to identify more specifically the&#xD;
      nature of the potential immune abnormalities in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow a case-control design. Only one blood drawing will be performed upon&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion criteria and completing a questionnaire that includes detailed&#xD;
      information regarding family history of immune aberrations. Five ml of venous blood will be&#xD;
      drawn from all subjects (ASD and controls) and shall be separated into 2 vials:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0.5 ml: for Complete Blood Count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4.5 ml for serum separation. The serum will be aliquoted (0.5 ml vials) and frozen at&#xD;
           -80º centigrade and sent to laboratory for detailed immune analysis. One aliquot will be&#xD;
           sent for analysis. The others will be kept for further testing (±backup).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events to blood drawing will be reported to the Data Coordinating Center using the&#xD;
      appropriate Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of adverse effects (AE) related to the drawing of blood or performance of&#xD;
      examination of patients in the course of standard examination procedures, the investigating&#xD;
      team will proceed in accordance with local guidelines (to be inserted by the PI), reporting&#xD;
      the incidents which occurred during the course of a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected by the investigator, or a person appointed and appropriately&#xD;
      trained by the investigator, and shall be entered into standardized CRFs and shared online&#xD;
      with the sponsor. Source data will be retained for all data entered in the CRFs. Progress&#xD;
      reports and the Final Report at the conclusion of the trial will be submitted to the&#xD;
      regulatory authority and the Ethics Committee, as required.&#xD;
