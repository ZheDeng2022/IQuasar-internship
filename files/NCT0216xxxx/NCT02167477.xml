  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An anaesthetist inserts a &quot;laryngoscope&quot; into the mouth to see the voice-box (larynx) for&#xD;
      &quot;tracheal intubation&quot;, when a tube is advanced into the windpipe (trachea) to protect the&#xD;
      airway and administer anaesthetic gases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare traditional (direct view) Macintosh (MAC) laryngoscopy with Storz&#xD;
      C-MAC videolaryngoscopes in subjects presenting for obesity reduction surgery using a novel&#xD;
      &quot;photographic overlay technique&quot; to analyse the basis for any differences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to have 40 patients complete the protocol. This number is based on a recent&#xD;
      similar study at Aintree hospital where this number of cases was successfully used to make&#xD;
      multiple parameter comparisons between different videolaryngoscope blades during Ear Nose and&#xD;
      Throat (ENT) procedures. Following the template of this earlier work all the patients will&#xD;
      have three laryngoscopy assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When seen in the preoperative clinic, patients will be informed about the study and given a&#xD;
      patient information sheet to take home. On the day of admission for surgery they will be&#xD;
      asked for their consent to be involved in the study by the study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to theatre, the research team will make a number of straightforward external&#xD;
      measurements. Various surface markings around the head and neck of the patients will be&#xD;
      applied immediately before proceeding to the operating theatre. In the anaesthetic room,&#xD;
      prior to induction of anaesthesia, the patients will have standard monitoring attached&#xD;
      (including oxygen saturations, electrocardiograph and non-invasive blood pressure). They will&#xD;
      be positioned as usual by the anaesthetist in charge of the case. The monitoring of the&#xD;
      laryngoscopy will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Video-camera recording one metre away from the side of the patient's head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Photographic still shots at the moment of laryngoscopy from the foot of the bed/trolley.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. View of laryngoscopy itself via the optical systems in the C-MAC® video laryngoscopes&#xD;
           The photographs taken from the foot of the bed/trolley are to note any lateral rotation&#xD;
           in the head position during laryngoscopy. Should this occur it may need to be allowed&#xD;
           for in the processing of the photographic overlay analysis during processing of the&#xD;
           lateral images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthetic technique will be standardised. After 3 mins of pre-oxygenation with a face&#xD;
      mask, anaesthesia is induced with Remifentanil (technique for administration will be decided&#xD;
      by the individual anaesthetist), Propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg and neuromuscular blockade with&#xD;
      Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg before airway manipulation. Bag mask ventilation with 100% oxygen and&#xD;
      volatile anaesthetic will be performed prior to and between each of the three laryngoscopy&#xD;
      assessments. The patient will be monitored closely for any adverse signs, if at any point the&#xD;
      oxygen saturations fall below 90% the patient will be withdrawn from the study and&#xD;
      anaesthesia continued as deemed appropriate by the responsible clinician. During each&#xD;
      laryngoscopy the anaesthetist will indicate when the moment of maximal laryngoscopic view is&#xD;
      obtained so that this can be recorded by the video devices. In the case of Macintosh, the&#xD;
      observed percentage of glottic opening or POGO score will be documented. If an inadequate&#xD;
      view is found the clinician may have one attempt at improving the view with cricoid pressure&#xD;
      which will again be recorded. The conventional Macintosh laryngoscope will always be used for&#xD;
      the first laryngoscopy. The sequence of the second and third laryngoscopies will be decided&#xD;
      by block randomisation. Tracheal intubation will be undertaken during the final laryngoscopy.&#xD;
      A shaped metallic stylet will be place within the tracheal tube as an intubation aid in all&#xD;
      patients intubated with the C-MAC® D-BLADE video laryngoscope. Following intubation, an&#xD;
      endoscopic examination of the posterior wall of the pharynx will be undertaken as the&#xD;
      videolaryngoscope is withdrawn to ensure no trauma has been caused by the intubation.&#xD;
      Following intubation, the patient will then continue with anaesthesia and surgery as planned.&#xD;
      There will be monitoring of the patient closely in recovery and post-operatively as part of&#xD;
      normal clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Off-line data analysis will consist of superposition of the videolaryngoscope blade shape&#xD;
      outlines on the lateral photographic images. The POGO scores will be compared with the&#xD;
      preoperative measurements and the relevant results from the overlay imaging analysis.&#xD;
