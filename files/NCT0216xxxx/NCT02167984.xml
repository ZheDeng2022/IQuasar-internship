  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal dysmotility due to immaturity could promote impaired bolus transit during&#xD;
      esophageal swallow events,thus influencing gastroesophageal reflux (GER) clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study was to describe esophageal bolus transit characteristics during swallow and&#xD;
      to evaluate the relationship between esophageal swallow (ES) and GER in newborns with&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms using multichannel intraluminal impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simultaneous analysis of swallow and GER events in newborns undergone MII/pH monitoring&#xD;
      could provide useful information to better understand the physiopathology of gastroesophageal&#xD;
      reflux disease (GERD) and could help clinicians to identify newborns with prolonged&#xD;
      esophageal clearance time, making the recommendations for further tests and the therapeutic&#xD;
      approach more accurate&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to evaluate esophageal swallow (ES) frequency and characteristics&#xD;
      in term and preterm newborns with GERD symptoms using MII and to investigate the possible&#xD;
      relationship between ES and GER events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MII tracings from the beginning of the second feeding up to 3 hours after the end of the&#xD;
      meal were visually analyzed by two independent investigators using Bioview Analysis software&#xD;
      (Sandhill Scientific Inc., Highlands Ranch, Colorado, USA) to identify and characterize ES&#xD;
      and GER events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ES events An ES event was identified as a rapid increase in impedance which precedes a drop&#xD;
      in impedance to 50% of baseline beginning in the proximal channel and preceding in an&#xD;
      anterograde direction to the most distal channel, followed by the recovery of baseline values&#xD;
      at each channel.13 The ES events detected by MII/pH were grouped into mealtime events (the&#xD;
      first nine consecutive ES events with no artifacts after the beginning of the meal) and&#xD;
      postprandial period events (all the ES events detected in the 3 hours following the end of&#xD;
      the meal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ES event frequency (ES events/hour) was measured, along with the following ES event&#xD;
      characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      bolus presence time (BPT): time between bolus entrance and exit recorded in the distal&#xD;
      channel, measured in seconds; bolus head advancing time (BHAT): time between the bolus&#xD;
      entrance recorded in the proximal channel and the bolus entrance recorded in the distal&#xD;
      channel, measured in seconds; bolus head advancing time corrected (BHATc): BHAT corrected for&#xD;
      esophageal length, expressed in seconds/cm. BHATc was calculated using the formula BHATc =&#xD;
      BHAT / esophageal length where esophageal length is the distance between proximal and distal&#xD;
      impedance channels, measured in cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GER events&#xD;
&#xD;
      A GER event was defined as a retrograde drop in impedance to 50% of baseline, beginning in&#xD;
      the most distal channel and proceding to one or more proximal channels, of at least 5&#xD;
      seconds, followed by an impedance recovery of baseline values.GER event frequency was&#xD;
      measured (GER events/hour), along with the following event characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      bolus reflux extent (BRE):the proximal extent reached by the refluxate, shown by the number&#xD;
      of channels sequentially involved in the impedance drop,measured in number of channels; bolus&#xD;
      clearance time (BCT):time from onset, at the 50% drop in impedance signal from baseline, to&#xD;
      the end of the event, at the 50% recovery point from nadir to baseline, recorded in the&#xD;
      distal impedance channel, measured in second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The distribution of all the continuous variables was assessed by the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. The differences in MII variables between different groups of infants were&#xD;
      evaluated with the Mann-Whitney test; the Wilcoxon test was used to compare paired data.&#xD;
      Group correlations were analyzedwith the Spearman correlation test. Statistical significance&#xD;
      was set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
