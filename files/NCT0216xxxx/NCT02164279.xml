  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 30 to 40% of patients suffering from type I diabetes are at risk of developing a&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy (DN) leading more or less rapidly to an end-stage renal disease.&#xD;
      Nowadays, the microalbuminuria is the most often used clinical parameter for possible onset&#xD;
      of DN. However, it is a late (because it permits to detect a renal disease already present),&#xD;
      non-specific and low sensitive biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the main objective of this study is to identify early urinary biomarkers predictive&#xD;
      of DN in children with type I diabetes, before the appearance of a microalbuminuria.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once the type I diabetes is diagnosed, the speed of progression to a DN is very variable.&#xD;
      Thus, the discovery of biomarkers able to distinguish progressor patients from non-progressor&#xD;
      since the appearance of a microalbuminuria, is crucial in order to take care of progressor&#xD;
      patients the earlier and to slow down the disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have shown that urine is a biological sample extremely well suited for&#xD;
      proteome analysis with the aim to identify biomarkers of renal damages. Indeed, they were the&#xD;
      first to analyze the urinary proteome of infant using capillary electrophoresis-coupled mass&#xD;
      spectrometry. This technic permits to analyse the entire urinary proteome of a person in one&#xD;
      hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several laboratories tried to identify other predictive urinary biomarkers of the development&#xD;
      of a DN in diabetic patients, but with limited success and nowadays in the clinical practice&#xD;
      they still use the measure of the microalbuminuria. Contrary to precedent studies, the&#xD;
      investigators develop an analysis without a priori and starting with early samples (without&#xD;
      any signs of DN) associating the urinary peptide profile with the DN progression over 9-10&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a nested case-control study in a cohort of 317 patients constituting the urinary&#xD;
      biological collection. (The urinary samples of a type I diabetic cohort of 317 patients seen&#xD;
      between 2004 and 2008 have been collected.) These patients will be contacted at the end of&#xD;
      2012 to obtain a number of participation of 180 patients authorizing the use aposteriori of&#xD;
      their urinary samples. Among this cohort, the investigators evaluate at 90 the number of&#xD;
      patients with a DN defined by a dosage of microalbuminuria higher than 100 mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is therefore the identification of urinary biomarkers&#xD;
      predictive of DN in type I diabetes pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The estimation of sensibility and specificity parameters, and the Area Under the Curve&#xD;
           (AUC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The identification of factors associated with the variability of biomarkers expression&#xD;
           such as the age at the moment of the diagnosis, the time between the diagnosis and the&#xD;
           urinary collection, the rate of microalbuminuria, and the type of insulin used by the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And in the subgroup of patients for whom two urinary samples have been collected, the&#xD;
           investigators want to study the urinary proteome stability in patients with no DN in&#xD;
           2013.&#xD;
