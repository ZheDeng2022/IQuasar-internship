  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by more than 200 species of&#xD;
      mushrooms, collectively known as psilocybin mushrooms. Psilocybin&#xD;
      (4-phosphoroyloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is a hallucinogenic tryptamine that was first&#xD;
      isolated from Psilocybe mushrooms in 1957. The objective of this Phase I clinical trial is to&#xD;
      determine the pharmacokinetics of oral doses of psilocybin in normal, healthy adults. The&#xD;
      study is performed in support of Phase II and Phase III studies of psilocybin for the&#xD;
      treatment of refractory anxiety associated with incurable cancer, as well as other possible&#xD;
      indications. Psilocybin is at present not an FDA-approved drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the pharmacokinetics of an&#xD;
      extemporaneous oral formulation of psilocybin in normal, healthy adults. This study is&#xD;
      intended to add to the existing body of modern clinical research on psilocybin to support&#xD;
      future multi-institutional Phase III clinical trials seeking to decrease anxiety and&#xD;
      depression in patients with incurable cancer. The long-term goal of this research is to&#xD;
      submit a successful new drug application for psilocybin to the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will initially take one 0.3 mg/kg (approximately 20mg/70kg) oral dose of psilocybin&#xD;
      to initiate an eight hour chaperoned outpatient experience. After eight hours of outpatient&#xD;
      sampling, the subject will be transported across the street to the UW Institute for Clinical&#xD;
      and Translational Research Clinical Research Unit (ICTR CRU) for an overnight stay and&#xD;
      additional blood and urine sampling. Pre- and post-treatment psychologic preparation and&#xD;
      debriefing interviews will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of four weeks after the first dose, the subject will receive a second oral dose of&#xD;
      psilocybin at the higher dose of 0.45 mg/kg (approximately 30 mg/70 kg). This dosing will&#xD;
      again take place in an attended, structured setting with timed blood and urine samples&#xD;
      obtained both in the School of Pharmacy (0-8 hours) and in the UW Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
      (8-24 hours). A minimum of four weeks after the second dose, the subject will receive a third&#xD;
      oral dose of psilocybin at the highest dose of 0.6 mg/kg (approximately 40 mg/70 kg). This&#xD;
      dose will again take place in an attended, structured setting with timed blood and urine&#xD;
      samples obtained both in the School of Pharmacy (0-8 hours) and in the UW Clinical Research&#xD;
      Unit (8-24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-lead ECGs will be obtained at specified time points before and during each treatment&#xD;
      period. Throughout the duration of drug action for each dose participants will be attended by&#xD;
      two trained monitors, and a physician will available during the entire 24 hour treatment and&#xD;
      sampling period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have been administered the first dose but decline to receive any subsequent&#xD;
      doses will remain evaluable. At that time their active study participation will end.&#xD;
