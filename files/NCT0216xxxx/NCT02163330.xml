  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an uncommon cause of dementia possibly reversible with&#xD;
      treatment. First described in 1965 it consists of a triad of gait disturbance, cognitive&#xD;
      deterioration, and urinary incontinence together with enlarged cerebral ventricles and normal&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Foregoing trauma and hemorrhage, infection, mass lesions,&#xD;
      or aqueductal stenosis can contribute to hydrocephalus. These symptomatic or secondary forms&#xD;
      of NPH are not considered here and the focus lies on the idiopathic type (iNPH). Prevalence&#xD;
      of iNPH increases significantly with age. General estimates range from 21.9 per 100,000 in&#xD;
      total population surveys but increase up to 181.7 per 100,000 for people 70 to 79 years of&#xD;
      age. The clinical presentation varies significantly in severity and progression of symptoms.&#xD;
      For diagnosis the entire triad does not have to be present. In typical cases gait and balance&#xD;
      disturbances appear either before or concurrently with urinary incontinence or the onset of&#xD;
      dementia. Current treatment recommendations are based on surgical diversion of CSF , with&#xD;
      shunts placed either into the ventricular system or the lumbar subarachnoid space to a distal&#xD;
      site, such as the peritoneal or the pleural cavity or the venous system, where the CSF can be&#xD;
      reabsorbed . Even though immediate response rate to shunt treatment might be favorable and&#xD;
      rates of 80% responders have been reported , the perioperative and long-term morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of CSF shunting procedures are significant. A meta-analysis of 44 articles found&#xD;
      that the pooled, mean rate of shunt complication was 38% . Even though acute surgical&#xD;
      complication rates are low, shunt dysfunctions and long-term complications are relatively&#xD;
      common. Shunt malfunction (20%), subdural hematoma (2-17%), seizure (3-11%), shunt infection&#xD;
      (3-6%) and intracerebral hematoma (3%) are the most common complications . In those with good&#xD;
      long-term survival, sustained improvement is possible, with a rate of 39% documented after 5&#xD;
      years .In view of the complication rates, the lack of alternative treatment options and&#xD;
      clinical studies is surprising. Even though iNPH per definition lacks raised intracranial&#xD;
      pressure on spinal tap, monitoring of ICP prior to surgery reveals an increased amount of&#xD;
      brief (usually 30 seconds to 1 minute) increases in the static ICP, called Lundberg B waves,&#xD;
      in patients which improve by shunt placements . When patients are scheduled for shunt&#xD;
      treatment there is a waiting period of several weeks between diagnosis and operation due to&#xD;
      congested waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetazolamide (Diamox) has been shown to reduce the production of CSF in clinical cases of&#xD;
      raised intracranial pressure . It is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of&#xD;
      idiopathic intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri). Intuitively a connection between&#xD;
      Acetazolamide as a treatment option in iNPH seems logical. Encouraging case studies have been&#xD;
      published previously showing a fascinating improvement and success of treating iNPH with&#xD;
      Acetazolamide. A systematic placebo controlled study concerning the use of Acetazolamide in&#xD;
      iNPH is missing and would possibly pave the way to an alternative treatment option avoiding&#xD;
      surgery and its complications.&#xD;

    <description>The effect of acetazolamide on motor and cognitive function in iNPH patients will be examined.&#xD;
Motor system investigations - Gait assessment using a quantified scale (Boon et al., 1997). Scores from this metric represent 3 summed subscores: 10-m step count, 10-m time, and the following 10 features: hesitation, wide and small steps, low clearance, impaired turning, sway, fall tendency, impaired tandem walking, and inability to walk with and without assistance. The summed score has a range from 2-40, with 2 representing unimpaired gait.</description>
