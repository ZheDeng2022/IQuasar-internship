      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a randomized controlled trial assessing the interventions of music, a patient&#xD;
      educational video, or usual care pre-test teaching practice and anxiety before patients&#xD;
      undergo urodynamic testing. This study enrolled women who were scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      urodynamic testing within the Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery clinic on&#xD;
      main campus and at Fairview Hospital. Consenting participants were randomized to receive&#xD;
      either usual practice pre-test teaching, usual practice pre-test teaching with soothing music&#xD;
      in the background and throughout the test, or usual practice pre-test teaching and watching&#xD;
      an educational video before the test was performed. The participants filled out a short&#xD;
      questionnaire before urodynamic testing was started with two VAS scales assessing anxiety and&#xD;
      pain and Likert Scale Questions, a second short questionnaire when the patient feels &quot;strong&#xD;
      urge&quot; with two VAS scales assessing anxiety and pain, and a third questionnaire once the&#xD;
      patient has completed the test again testing VAS anxiety and pain as well as some Likert&#xD;
      scale questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was to determine if pre-urodynamic testing anxiety was decreased after&#xD;
      watching a pre-test educational video, or by listening to music before and throughout the&#xD;
      procedure, or by receiving standard of care pre-test teaching. Secondary outcomes were to&#xD;
      determine baseline anxiety in our urodynamic patient population and to determine if there is&#xD;
      decreased discomfort due to the intervention as well as to evaluate if there were certain&#xD;
      patients that would benefit from increased information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment All patients undergoing urodynamic testing for the first time who are over the age&#xD;
      of 18 years old, female with presentation for urodynamics for urinary dysfunction, urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, prolapse, or presurgical evaluation of voiding function were screened for&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ongoing infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inability to cooperate&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inability to give consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Non-English speakers&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients who had undergone urodynamic testing in the past&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random treatment assignments were placed in advance in set of sealed envelopes by a person&#xD;
      who was not involved in opening the envelopes. Each envelope was numbered. When a patient was&#xD;
      randomized, the patients name and the number of the next unopened envelope were recorded in a&#xD;
      secure database. The envelope was then pened and the randomization was determined for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was incorporated into the patient's routine urodynamic testing. No additional&#xD;
      visits were necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data including patient's age, ethnicity, education, catheter history, mental&#xD;
      health history and medications were obtained, and patient satisfaction with care scores were&#xD;
      also be collected. Paper forms will be stored in the locked research office at the Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic. Questionnaires were then collected in REDcap, a secure, web-based application&#xD;
      designned to support data capture. We de-identified each patient and did not include their&#xD;
      name or Cleveland Clinic medical record number on our data collection sheet form or on the&#xD;
      questionnaires, or in the database. During abstraction, a separate log was kept with patient&#xD;
      identifying information and linking it to the database in case it was necessary to go back to&#xD;
      the medical record to clarify or complete data entry. This log will be destroyed after data&#xD;
      collection is complete and before data analysis. The database was kept on a password&#xD;
      protected Gynecology research drive accessible only by the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients randomized to the usual care arm woul have received mailings about urodynamic&#xD;
           testing prior to arriving to the urodynamic suite. They then entered the urodynamic&#xD;
           suite and the urodynamics provider discussed the information that was mailed to them.&#xD;
           They also discussed the overall test, placement of catheters, and filling of the bladder&#xD;
           with the patient before the provider began the test which is usual care. Once the&#xD;
           provider finished giving the information, the patient filled out the first pre-test&#xD;
           questionnaire which involved multiple Likert scale questions as well as Visual Analog&#xD;
           Scale questions. During the urodynamic testing when the patient reached the point of&#xD;
           &quot;strong urge,&quot; a two question visual analog scale was given to the patient measuring&#xD;
           anxiety and discomfort. Once the test has been concluded, the patient was given one&#xD;
           further short post-test questionnaire using the Likert scale and Visual Analog Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients randomized to the video arm arrived to their appointment having received the&#xD;
           mailed material (usual practice). Prior to watching the video, the patient was given the&#xD;
           pre-test questionnaire. While in the urodynamics suite the patient watched a short&#xD;
           patient informational video on urodynamics. Urodynamic testing was then performed and&#xD;
           when the patient noted &quot;strong urge&quot;during the testing period, a short, two question&#xD;
           visual analog scale questionnaire measuring anxiety and discomfort was given. Once the&#xD;
           urodynamic testing was completed, the patient will fill out an additional Likert scale&#xD;
           and Visual Analog Scale post-test questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients randomized to the music arm arrived to the appointment after having received&#xD;
           mailed information about the test. The patient enter the urodynamics suite, was&#xD;
           randomized and then slow music (tempo of 60 beats min) was started to play in the&#xD;
           background. Usual practice instructions were given. The music continued through the&#xD;
           urodynamic testing. Before the test and the usual practice instructions were given, the&#xD;
           patient was given the pre-test questionnaire. When the patient notified the test&#xD;
           provider that she had &quot;strong urge&quot; a second questionnaire with visual analog scales&#xD;
           measuring anxiety and discomfort were given. Once the urodynamic testing was concluded,&#xD;
           the patient was given the post-test questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is to determine if pre-urodynamic testing anxiety is decreased after watching a pre-test educational video, or by listening to music before and throughout the procedure, or by receiving standard of care pre-test teaching. For measurement of anxiety we used 100mm Visual analog scales. We used a questionnaire to obtain demographics. We used a five point Likert scale to ask questions about their use of the internet and information seeking behavior.</description>
