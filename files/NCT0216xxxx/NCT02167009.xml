      Study to evaluate Prostate Artery Embolization for the treatment of lower urinary track&#xD;
      symptoms due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Size Greater Than 90 Grams.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single center, prospective, single arm, investigational study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of prostate artery embolization (PAE) for treatment of severe lower&#xD;
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH in patients with prostate size greater than 90&#xD;
      grams that either refuse surgical treatment or are considered poor candidates for traditional&#xD;
      surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients will be enrolled in the single treatment arm with follow-up for no less than 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a screening period in which patient eligibility will be determined.&#xD;
      Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will receive PAE with Embosphere Microspheres within&#xD;
      4 weeks of screening and transrectal ultrasound. After treatment, patients will return for&#xD;
      follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post PAE. At each of these&#xD;
      visits, patients will complete IPSS and IIEF questionnaires, undergo a physical exam, and&#xD;
      perform a medication review. Repeat TRUS and urodynamic testing will be performed at the 6&#xD;
      month and 12 month post PAE follow-up visit.&#xD;
