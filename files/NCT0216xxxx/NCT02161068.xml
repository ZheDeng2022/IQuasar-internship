      This is a retrospective analysis to include demographic, clinical, biochemical, and genetic&#xD;
      data that will further explore the natural history of ADPKD and assess the factors that are&#xD;
      likely to be associated with the progression of disease and the incidence of complications&#xD;
      including progressive chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To explore questions regarding the natural history of PKD, as well as other, unforeseen&#xD;
      issues, a comprehensive database of demographic, clinical, biochemical, and genetic data is&#xD;
      required. This descriptive retrospective study can serve as a source of information regarding&#xD;
      either the entire ADPKD population, or subsets of patients with specifically targeted&#xD;
      characteristics. This will inform future prospective studies that will be designed to address&#xD;
      issues regarding the natural history and complications of ADPKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to collect data from a large population of patients with PKD.&#xD;
      Based upon the estimated prevalence of PKD (1:500 and 1:1000 live births), it is estimated&#xD;
      that there may be 10,000 PKD patients in the New York City area. This sample size far exceeds&#xD;
      any database established thus far. As many as 40% of affected PKD patients are reportedly&#xD;
      unaware of a family history of this disease, in part because many patients may go undiagnosed&#xD;
      until they present with a medical complication (e.g., hypertension, kidney failure).&#xD;
      Furthermore, this initiative will provide an opportunity to compare data from racially&#xD;
      diverse populations.&#xD;

      After informed consent is obtained, blood samples for PKD genotyping will be obtained from&#xD;
      the study patient. Genotype results will be made available to the patient and they will be&#xD;
      referred to a genetic counselor at their request. This service would not be a part of the&#xD;
      study and therefore, genetic counseling would be done at the patient's expense.&#xD;
