  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway management is one of the basic topics in anesthetic practice. Use of endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation and face mask are standard methods to maintain an open airway widely adopted for&#xD;
      many years. As a result of a search for more appropriate choices from the point of view of&#xD;
      effectiveness, reliability and side effects, supraglottic airway devices (SGAD) have been&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGAD's are used for thyroid surgery, ear surgery, carotid endarterectomy, adenotonsillectomy&#xD;
      and laser pharyngoplasty, which require a variety of head-neck positions. Changing the head&#xD;
      and neck position leads to changes in the shape of the pharynx, which causes variation in the&#xD;
      cuff pressure and oropharyngeal leak pressure. Oropharyngeal leak pressure values play a&#xD;
      determining role in protecting the airway from high cuff pressure. Additionally it shows that&#xD;
      the laryngeal mask is correctly placed and is a sign of the effectiveness of positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation. During surgery head-neck and trunk position may change. As a result&#xD;
      there is a need for research evaluating the effect of head and neck position on oropharyngeal&#xD;
      leak pressure during SGAD use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of different head and neck positions on the&#xD;
      oropharyngeal leak pressure in LMA-Unique and I-Gel applications. Additionally the placement&#xD;
      duration, ease and success of these two supraglottic airway devices will be compared.&#xD;

      This prospective, randomized, double-blind study will receive permission from the Local&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee and after obtaining patients' informed consent, 103 patients with&#xD;
      American society of anesthesiologists (ASA) classification group I-II, between 18-65 years,&#xD;
      undergoing elective surgery with indications for supraglottic airway device placement were&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients preoperatively evaluated and ASA and Mallampati classification recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SGAD's inserted by the same experienced researcher. After placement of laryngeal mask, to&#xD;
      standardize postoperative pharyngeal morbidity, cuff pressure (cuff pressure manometer, Ruch,&#xD;
      Germany) was monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any neck or upper respiratory pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those at risk of gastric content regurgitation/aspiration (previous upper&#xD;
           Gastro-intestinal surgery, known hiatus hernia, Gastroesophageal reflux, history of&#xD;
           peptic ulcer, full stomach, pregnancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possibility of and those with history of difficult intubation (history of impossible&#xD;
           intubation, Mallampati classification 3-4, sterno mental distance less than 12 cm,&#xD;
           thyromental distance less than 6 cm, head extension less than 90 degrees, mouth opening&#xD;
           less than 1.5 cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those with low pulmonary compliance or high airway resistance (morbid obesity, lung&#xD;
           disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Throat pain, dysphagia and dysphonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with cervical disc hernia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients taken to the operating room were given standard monitoring before anesthesia&#xD;
      induction. Patients were preoxygenated with 6 L/min oxygen for 3 minutes through a face mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia induction was provided by 0.02 mg/kg midazolam, 1-2 mcg/kg fentanyl, 1.5-2 mg/kg&#xD;
      propofol and 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have neuromuscular junction monitoring (TOF-GUARD, Biometer International A.S.&#xD;
      DENMARK) and when TOF is zero SGAD was inserted with the standard method according to the&#xD;
      firm's recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During SGAD placement, if necessary additional dose of 0.5 mg/kg propofol was given depending&#xD;
      on patient reaction. During this procedure cases were ventilated with 100% oxygen though a&#xD;
      mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GROUPS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group U (UNIQUE): LMA- UNIQUE, inserted according to described standard method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I (I-GEL ) : I-GEL, inserted with standard technique according to users manual&#xD;
&#xD;
      For LMA-U the laryngeal mask cuff was inflated so that cuff pressure is less than 60 cm H2O&#xD;
      with leak preventive volume. After the operation before the laryngeal mask was removed the&#xD;
      cuff pressure was measured again and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To check SGAD placement bilateral chest movement was observed and capnography be used to&#xD;
      confirm a square wave shape. After SGAD was placed oropharyngeal leak test was completed.&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal leak pressure were tested in both groups first in neutral head position, then&#xD;
      at maximum extension and with head at maximum rotation to the right. In every position the&#xD;
      leak measurement was made 60 seconds after position is changed. In order to prevent the SGAD&#xD;
      from being seen by the researcher during the tests the patient's head was covered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal leak pressure was measured with the ring system expiratory valve closed and 4&#xD;
      L/min flow. To prevent exposure of the lungs to barotrauma, when peak airway pressure reaches&#xD;
      40 cm H2O the expiratory valve was opened .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leak pressure was evaluated in two ways;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The stethoscope is placed above the patient's left thyroid part of the trachea and the&#xD;
           sound of a leak is listened for&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Checked when the aneroid manometer is held steady (manometer stability test)&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the sound of the leak is heard, the pressure on the manometer were recorded separately&#xD;
      in both situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was maintained with 5% O2/air mix with 1.5-2.5% sevoflurane. Systolic arterial&#xD;
      pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart&#xD;
      rate (HR) values were measured and recorded immediately before anesthesia induction,&#xD;
      immediately before airway device placement and at 1, 2, and 3 minutes after airway placement&#xD;
      is checked. The time for successful placement (duration from mouth opening to first&#xD;
      successful ventilation), number of attempts, and ease of placement were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ease of insertion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. no reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. straining, retching&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. alternative airway management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mallampati score, type of supraglottic airway device, type of operation and total&#xD;
      duration of anesthesia were recorded. Any problems occurring during head and neck positions&#xD;
      was noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cuff pressure was measured after surgery while the patient is still in deep anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is conscious the SGAD was removed and the duration of use was recorded (time&#xD;
      from insertion to removal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the SGAD is removed the presence of blood was evaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. no blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. trace amounts of blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. definite amount of blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients throat pain, voice loss and difficulty swallowing were evaluated when leaving&#xD;
      the recovery room and by telephone 24 hours later by a researcher blind to the insertion&#xD;
      technique. To evaluate throat pain the VAS 10 (verbal analogue scale) was used&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPULSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry values falling by 90% during airway insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases developing laryngospasm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases with incomplete records&#xD;
