      1. Target disease : Patients with combined dyslipidemia with adequately controlled LDL-C&#xD;
           but inadequately controlled triglyceride level by atorvastatin monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study objective : The objective of this study is to demonstrate that Pravafenix Cap. is&#xD;
           clinically superior to atorvastatin by evaluating a percent change in Non-HDL-C in each&#xD;
           group after 8 weeks treatment with atorvastatin or Pravafenix Cap. (pravastatin&#xD;
           sodium/fenofibrate) in patients with adequately controlled LDL-C but inadequately&#xD;
           controlled triglyceride level by atorvastatin monotherapy in a multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
           double blind setting.&#xD;

      This study is to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pravastatin/Fenofibrate Complex in&#xD;
      Patients With Combined Dyslipidemia With Adequately Controlled LDL-C But Inadequately&#xD;
      Controlled Triglyceride Level by Atorvastatin Monotherapy. After administrating the&#xD;
      atorvastatin or Pravafenix Cap. (pravastatin sodium/fenofibrate) for 8 weeks, evaluate the&#xD;
      variation of the Non-HDL-C for each arm. Ultimatly verificaite the Pravafenix Cap.&#xD;
      (pravastatin sodium/fenofibrate) have better effects than atorvastatin.&#xD;
