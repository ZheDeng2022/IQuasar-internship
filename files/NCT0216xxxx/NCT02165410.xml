      The purpose of this study is reproduce the individual detection results by PET with Arterial&#xD;
      Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI, to establish a biomarker useful in autism diagnosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anatomical and functional abnormalities have been identified in the superior temporal sulcus&#xD;
      (STS) in autism by brain imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET),&#xD;
      functional MRI and diffusion MRI. These results suggest that brain imaging abnormalities&#xD;
      within the STS could be the first step in the cascade of neuronal abnormalities found in&#xD;
      autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STS is known as a key area for social cognition and is involved in various stages of social&#xD;
      interaction, from visual and auditory perception (perception of eyes, facial and body&#xD;
      movements, and perception of human voice) to the more complex process of social cognition&#xD;
      (theory of mind, understanding emotions and mentalizing) The anatomical and functional&#xD;
      abnormalities within the STS described in autism could account for the social difficulties&#xD;
      experienced by persons with autism, both clinically observed and objectified by studies on&#xD;
      visual social perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual detection results found in PET, that is to say a reduction of rCBF in the&#xD;
      superior temporal sulcus (STS), could be reproduced with ASL and used to predict the&#xD;
      diagnosis of autism in children with the same level of sensitivity and specificity as with&#xD;
      PET. The individual detection of decreased rCBF in the STS could be a useful biomarker in&#xD;
      autism using MRI, a method more accessible and much less invasive than PET. A MRI biomarker&#xD;
      in autism could allow individual analysis, as well as contribute to early diagnosis and&#xD;
      objective evaluation of the efficacy of new therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rCBF data measured by MRI-ASL will also be correlated with both clinical (Autism&#xD;
      Diagnostic Interview - ADI-R) and behavioral data of the social perception measured by the&#xD;
      eye-tracking method. In addition, we will study the impact of these temporal anomalies on&#xD;
      brain connectivity MRI method of diffusion tensor. We will also describe the abnormalities&#xD;
      present in the very early development of autism.&#xD;
