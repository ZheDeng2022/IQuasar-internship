      TITLE: Randomized Controlled Evaluating the Role of Exercise in Women Undergoing Treatment&#xD;
      for Breast Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga and Quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga is based on the practice of physical postures, breathing techniques and meditation.&#xD;
      Philosophically, it aims at increasing the body's ability to master the mind with the goal of&#xD;
      spiritual awareness and connection. A randomized trial of yoga in women with breast cancer&#xD;
      undergoing radiation therapy demonstrated an improvement in impact of events scale at 3&#xD;
      months suggesting that the more intrusive thoughts at 1 month the greater the finding of&#xD;
      meaning in cancer by 3 months. Randomized studies have demonstrated evidence of yoga&#xD;
      improving the emotional well being of women with breast cancer and improving their distressed&#xD;
      mood, thus providing a buffering effect on QOL. The main beneficial effects demonstrated are&#xD;
      on social functioning. Among patients not receiving chemotherapy, yoga appears to enhance&#xD;
      emotional well-being and mood and may serve to buffer deterioration in both overall and&#xD;
      specific domains of QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION TOOLS- European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 &amp; BR-23) Brief Fatigue Inventory VAS (Pain score) Spirituality&#xD;
      Questionnaire Pulmonary function test Objective assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENDPOINTS- Primary end points- Disease free survival Secondary end points- Quality of&#xD;
      life &amp; Improvements in overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN TREATMENT PLAN - All newly diagnosed cases with stage I-III of breast cancer who&#xD;
      present to Tata Memorial Hospital will be randomly assigned to perform either a set of 'Yogic&#xD;
      and Routine Exercises (referred to as exercise I) or Routine Exercises'(referred to as&#xD;
      exercise II)./ Patients will begin the exercises within a week of starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms of the study will receive a training session one hour per day for the first week,&#xD;
      during which they will be instructed to practice daily and maintain a daily log. The other&#xD;
      evaluation tools will be used as per the assessment time line (enclosed).The exercises in the&#xD;
      Exercise I arm (Yoga and conventional exercises) will be upgraded within the next 2 days to&#xD;
      Phase II. Patients will be allowed to attend a minimum of four out of seven days in Phase I&#xD;
      and II. Patients will be assessed at 6 months for compliance to phase II exercises. Only if&#xD;
      patients are fulfilling the criteria for accuracy, sequence and duration of phase II&#xD;
      exercises, will they be taught phase III exercises. Patients who are unable to do phase II&#xD;
      exercises at 6 months will be re taught phase II exercises. These patients will then be re&#xD;
      assessed at 1 year for up gradation to phase III. Six months after completion of phase III&#xD;
      exercises, patients will be assessed for compliance to phase III exercises. Patients will&#xD;
      also undergo an objective assessment at 1 year. An additional up gradation will be after&#xD;
      completion of adjuvant therapy at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for a period of 5 years. DFS will be measured from the time of&#xD;
      randomization to either progression or death. Quality of life will be measured at baseline&#xD;
      and every six monthly using the functional assessment cancer therapy- quality of life.&#xD;
      Quality of Life analysis at 400 patients will be performed with appropriate correction for&#xD;
      multiple analyses applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS- For an expected 50% 5 year disease free survival (DFS) for the control&#xD;
      group, the expected 5 years DFS for the intervention group will be 60%. With a two-sided&#xD;
      analysis, and at 80% power and 95% confidence to detect a 10% difference between the arms,&#xD;
      the sample size would be 761 patients. Assuming a 10% loss to follow up, a total of 850&#xD;
      patients would be accrued. We expect to complete accrual in 3 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION AND STRATIFICATION- Randomization for intervention will be done centrally from&#xD;
      Clinical Research Secretariat and patient will be stratified by&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopausal status: Pre + Peri or Post Neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment Stage of disease:&#xD;
      I/II/III ANALYSIS- Disease Free Survival (DFS) will be calculated from the date of&#xD;
      randomization to the date of local, regional or distant relapse or death from any cause and&#xD;
      will be censored at the last date of follow up for the patients that are alive and disease&#xD;
      free or have been lost to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Survival (OS) will be calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death&#xD;
      or censored at the date of last follow up for the patients who are alive or lost to follow&#xD;
      up. DFS and OS will be evaluated using Kaplan Meier and compared by Log-rank test. The Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazard model will be used to assess the impact of intervention after correction&#xD;
      for stratification, menopausal status and age.&#xD;
