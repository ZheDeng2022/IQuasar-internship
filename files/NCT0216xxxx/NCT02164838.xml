  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be the first study of axitinib in children and adolescents. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this Phase 1 trial is to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of axitinib in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
      Additional objectives include measurement of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters,&#xD;
      description of the toxicity profile of this agent in children and adolescents, and assessment&#xD;
      of response within the confines of a Phase 1 trial. A standard rolling 6 design will be used&#xD;
      for dose escalation. Further development of axitinib will focus on development of a joint&#xD;
      cooperative group (COG/ECOG) Phase 2 study of axitinib in pediatric, adolescent and young&#xD;
      adult translocation renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
