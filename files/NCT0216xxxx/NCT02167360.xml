    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of CTL019 in adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL. The study will have the following&#xD;
      sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment, Treatment and Primary Follow-up, Secondary&#xD;
      Follow-up (Relapse Follow-up) and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the primary&#xD;
      follow-up is 1 year from cell infusion. Safety will be assessed until the end of the&#xD;
      treatment and primary follow-up phase.&#xD;
