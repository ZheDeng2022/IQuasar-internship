      The purpose of the study is to test the feasibility of culturally adaptive family&#xD;
      intervention for Psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test whether Pakistani families caring for someone with psychosis will engage with a&#xD;
           model of family intervention which has been culturally adapted to meet their needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the acceptability of the intervention to the families who receive it and to&#xD;
           gather feedback regarding any changes that might improve the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gain an impression of whether the intervention has the potential to address unmet&#xD;
           psychological and social needs of the families and how this affects their levels of&#xD;
           stress&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators will conduct a feasibility pilot study to test whether Pakistani families&#xD;
      offered the intervention will want to receive it. The Participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      psychiatric department of different hospitals. They will be randomly divided into two groups;&#xD;
      intervention group and treatment-as-usual group. A total of thirty six participants will be&#xD;
      recruited in the pilot study and divided equally into two arms. This will ensure that, even&#xD;
      after loss to follow-up, we will have at least 12 subjects per group for analysis (FDA&#xD;
      guidance http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/5356fnl.pdf).Randomization will be carried out by&#xD;
      the on offsite statistician. This will provide a reliable geographically remote service. For&#xD;
      intervention group ten sessions of family intervention will be provided by trained research&#xD;
      clinician during the period of three months. Relatives of Patients in the treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU) group will be given details of intervention at the end of the study and interested&#xD;
      families will be offered family intervention&#xD;
