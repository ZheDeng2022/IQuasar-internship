      The goal of this study is to compare the characteristics of echocardiography and different&#xD;
      monitoring devices in shock patients, the relationship of device parameters to biomarkers&#xD;
      associated with shock, and determine if these any of these add clinical utility when&#xD;
      predicting the cause of shock. We will perform a prospective, observational study of patients&#xD;
      found to have shock physiology in the ED and follow them to determine the final shock&#xD;
      category and ultimate outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shock is a common final pathway for many disease states, occurring when oxygen and nutrient&#xD;
      delivery are not sufficient to maintain normal cellular function. The incidence of shock in&#xD;
      the emergency department (ED) is approximated to be 1-3% of ED patients(1), and it carries a&#xD;
      high mortality, ranging from 20-50% depending on the underlying cause of shock(2). Early&#xD;
      recognition and treatment of shock significantly improves outcomes in critically ill&#xD;
      patients(2, 3), and so the majority of efforts to this point have focused on identifying&#xD;
      patients with shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The many etiologies of shock may be grouped into several broader categories: cardiogenic,&#xD;
      distributive, hemorrhagic, hypovolemic, anaphylactic, and neurogenic. These categories cause&#xD;
      shock through different mechanisms, but they have a significant amount of clinical overlap&#xD;
      (4-7), making differentiating the cause of shock challenging for the emergency provider.&#xD;
      While some overlap also exists between the treatments for these categories, several have&#xD;
      vastly different therapeutic approaches. Since the early treatment of shock influences&#xD;
      outcomes(2, 3, 8, 9), identifying the correct etiology to treat should logically impact&#xD;
      outcomes as well, although this has not been studied in shock patients. However, Moore, et&#xD;
      al., did show that physicians were only able to correctly identify the cause of hypotension&#xD;
      in 25% of hypotensive patients in the ED, speaking to both the difficulty in diagnosing shock&#xD;
      etiologies and the high percentage of patients with undifferentiated shock(10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a number of different devices and biomarkers have been suggested to have clinical&#xD;
      utility in differentiating shock and guiding resuscitation(11-13). These devices have&#xD;
      potential to aid in the differentiation of shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a prospective, observational study of patients found to have shock and&#xD;
      &quot;near-shock&quot; physiology in the emergency department. We will identify patients meeting our&#xD;
      inclusion criteria which will identify shock and &quot;near shock&quot; patients. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will include: HR &gt; 120, SBP &lt; 90, or a shock index (HR/SBP) &gt; 1 for at least five minutes.&#xD;
      Patients that do meet vital sign requirements, but have a lactate &gt; 4 mmol/L, will also be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will undergo physiologic assessments using echocardiography, Microscan,&#xD;
      Non-invasive cardiac output monitor (NICOM), and extremity temperature device, as well as a&#xD;
      blood draw for biomarker assessment.&#xD;
