    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if 1 large dose of radiation therapy is&#xD;
      better at controlling pain from cancer that has spread to the bones than 10 smaller doses of&#xD;
      radiation. Researchers also want to learn if 1 large dose of radiation therapy can help&#xD;
      decrease the use of drugs to control the pain, and if it can help to control the disease.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study&#xD;
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of&#xD;
      being assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will receive 1 radiation treatment a day for 10 days in a row (not&#xD;
      counting weekends or holidays). You will receive a higher total dose of radiation than Group&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will receive 1 radiation treatment given on 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will lie on a table for the radiation treatment(s). Each treatment will last about 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive 1 or 10 radiation treatments, depending on which group you are in. You will&#xD;
      no longer be able to receive radiation therapy if intolerable side effects occur or if you&#xD;
      are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Months 3, 6, 9, 12 and every 3 to 6 months after the start of radiation therapy, you will&#xD;
      have x-rays, a bone scan, CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Months 3, 4, and 6 and then every 3 months after that for at least 3 years, you will&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires about the pain, your pain relief, and your quality of life. The&#xD;
      questionnaires can be filled out at a clinic visit or sent back in the mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and&#xD;
      commercially available methods. It is investigational to compare the number and size of&#xD;
      radiation doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 300 participants will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 300 participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluate single fraction stereotactic regimen for pain response in terms of time to failure. Pain response was defined by international consensus criteria as a combination of pain score and analgesic use (daily morphine-equivalent dose). Pain failure (ie, lack of response) was defined as worsening pain score (2 points on a 0-to-10 scale), an increase in morphine-equivalent opioid dose of 50% or more, reirradiation, or pathologic fracture. Time to failure was defined as the first occurrence of any of the following events: worsening in pain score by at least 2 categories by MDASI survey. Statistical tests in treatment group were based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare changes in pain scores and analgesic use at each assessment point relative to baseline. Increases or decreases of 2 or more points on a scale of 0 to 10 indicated improving or worsening pain. Fisher exact tests were used to compare the distribution of pain responders (CR + PR) and nonresponders (PP + IR).</description>

Complete response (CR) is a pain score of 0 at the treated site and no increase in analgesic. Partial response (PR): reduction in pain score of 2 or more points above baseline with no increase in analgesic. Pain progression (PP): Increases of 2 or more points on a scale of 0 to 10 or worsening pain. indeterminate response (IR): were all other responses.</description>

        <description>Evaluate single fraction stereotactic regimen for pain response in terms of time to failure. Pain response was defined by international consensus criteria as a combination of pain score and analgesic use (daily morphine-equivalent dose). Pain failure (ie, lack of response) was defined as worsening pain score (2 points on a 0-to-10 scale), an increase in morphine-equivalent opioid dose of 50% or more, reirradiation, or pathologic fracture. Time to failure was defined as the first occurrence of any of the following events: worsening in pain score by at least 2 categories by MDASI survey. Statistical tests in treatment group were based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare changes in pain scores and analgesic use at each assessment point relative to baseline. Increases or decreases of 2 or more points on a scale of 0 to 10 indicated improving or worsening pain. Fisher exact tests were used to compare the distribution of pain responders (CR + PR) and nonresponders (PP + IR).</description>

        <description>Evaluate single fraction stereotactic regimen for pain response in terms of time to failure. Pain response was defined by international consensus criteria as a combination of pain score and analgesic use (daily morphine-equivalent dose). Pain failure (ie, lack of response) was defined as worsening pain score (2 points on a 0-to-10 scale), an increase in morphine-equivalent opioid dose of 50% or more, reirradiation, or pathologic fracture. Time to failure was defined as the first occurrence of any of the following events: worsening in pain score by at least 2 categories by MDASI survey. Complete response (CR) is a pain score of 0 at the treated site and no increase in analgesic. Partial response (PR): reduction in pain score of 2 or more points above baseline with no increase in analgesic. Pain progression (PP): Increases of 2 or more points on a scale of 0 to 10 or worsening pain. indeterminate response (IR): were all other responses.</description>

          <title>Number of Evaluable Participants With Pain Response by Treatment</title>
          <description>Evaluate single fraction stereotactic regimen for pain response in terms of time to failure. Pain response was defined by international consensus criteria as a combination of pain score and analgesic use (daily morphine-equivalent dose). Pain failure (ie, lack of response) was defined as worsening pain score (2 points on a 0-to-10 scale), an increase in morphine-equivalent opioid dose of 50% or more, reirradiation, or pathologic fracture. Time to failure was defined as the first occurrence of any of the following events: worsening in pain score by at least 2 categories by MDASI survey. Complete response (CR) is a pain score of 0 at the treated site and no increase in analgesic. Partial response (PR): reduction in pain score of 2 or more points above baseline with no increase in analgesic. Pain progression (PP): Increases of 2 or more points on a scale of 0 to 10 or worsening pain. indeterminate response (IR): were all other responses.</description>
