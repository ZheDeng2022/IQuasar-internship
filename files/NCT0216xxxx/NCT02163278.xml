    <textblock>
      This study represents the administration of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor DBPR108&#xD;
      to humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      (PD) properties following multiple oral doses in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPP4 is a validated drug target for the treatment of human type 2 diabetes. Objectives of the&#xD;
      study will be to assess the safety and tolerability, PKs and PDs of DBPR108 at steady state&#xD;
      after administration of multiple oral doses to healthy male subjects.&#xD;
