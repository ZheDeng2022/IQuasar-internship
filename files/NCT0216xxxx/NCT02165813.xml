      This is a multi-centre (RDH and ASH), phase IV, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      Bayesian adaptive trial of oral NTZ for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis requiring&#xD;
      admission to hospital. A maximum of 300 children aged between three months and less than five&#xD;
      years of age will be enrolled. Study participation is from the point of enrolment until 60&#xD;
      days after enrolment. Enrolment will occur within 48 hours of admission to hospital. Enrolled&#xD;
      participants will be randomised 1:1 to Nitazoxanide (NTZ) or placebo. Other treatment and&#xD;
      management will be as per the standard of care described in the admitting hospital's&#xD;
      guidelines and will be ultimately the decision and responsibility of the named medical&#xD;
      consultant. Stool samples will be collected at the point of admission. Solicitation of&#xD;
      symptoms will be by review of routinely collected medical data recorded in the participant's&#xD;
      medical record, and will be supplemented by completion of study specific diary cards after&#xD;
      discharge (for the first 210 enrolments). Attempts will be made to contact participants at&#xD;
      day 7 after enrolment (by telephone if already discharged) to ascertain symptoms occurring in&#xD;
      the intervening period. At days 30 and 60 (for first 210 enrolments ) and Day 60 (for&#xD;
      enrolment #211 onwards) after enrolment a clinical record review will be conducted for all&#xD;
      participants to ascertain health care attendances following discharge.&#xD;

      This is a multi-centre (RDH and ASH), phase IV, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled&#xD;

      admission to hospital. A maximum of 300 children aged between three months and less than five&#xD;
      years of age will be enrolled. Study participation is from the point of enrolment until 60&#xD;
      days after enrolment. Enrolment will occur within 48 hours of admission to hospital. Enrolled&#xD;

      medical record, and will be supplemented by completion of study specific diary cards until&#xD;
      discharge (for the first 210 enrolments). Attempts will be made to contact participants at&#xD;
      day 7 after enrolment (by telephone if already discharged) to ascertain symptoms occurring in&#xD;
      the intervening period. At days 30 and 60 (for first 210 enrolments ) and Day 60 (for&#xD;
      enrolment #211 onwards) after enrolment a clinical record review will be conducted for all&#xD;
      participants to ascertain health care attendances following discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the study is a maximum of 300 children, randomised on a 1:1 basis to the&#xD;
      two study treatment groups. The trial will stop recruiting when pre-specified decision&#xD;
      criteria are met based on treatment superiority or trial futilty or when 300 children have&#xD;
      been enrolled. Based on previously published data it is hypothesised that NTZ treatment will&#xD;
      result in a decrease in the median duration of medically significant illness by 1 day. A&#xD;
      decrease of one day is considered to be the minimum useful decrease of relevance to the study&#xD;
      setting. It is anticipated that there will be minimal lost to follow-up as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be available for the majority of participants in each arm due to the short&#xD;
      interval between enrolment and meeting the criteria for the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted as a fixed allocation Bayesian adaptive randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial. This statistical methods in the protocol are written to be practical and accessible to&#xD;
      individuals with an understanding of common clinical trial designs and classical frequentist&#xD;
      analytical methods but without training in Bayesian statistics. A formal description of the&#xD;
      interim Bayesian data analysis fundamental to this design, which assumes substantial&#xD;
      familiarity with Bayesian calculation of posterior distributions conditioned on observed&#xD;
      data, is documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan. There is overlap between the protocol&#xD;
      and statistical analysis plan so that each may serve an appropriate audience as a standalone&#xD;
      description of the statistical methods. Briefly, within the Bayesian framework, the&#xD;
      intervention arms are evaluated and sequential Bayesian statistical analyses are used over&#xD;
      time to incorporate new trial outcome information to determine if a treatment is superior,&#xD;
      inferior, or equivalent, with respect to the primary end-point. Every child will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned in a ratio 1:1 to placebo or nitazoxanide. Children will be classified by membership&#xD;
      in different strata, where membership will be defined by age and geographical region.&#xD;
      Whenever an interim analysis reports superiority, inferiority, or equivalence with respect to&#xD;
      the primary end-point this is termed a Statistical Trigger. At any given interim analysis, a&#xD;
      Statistical Trigger may be reached for all children or for one or more strata.&#xD;
