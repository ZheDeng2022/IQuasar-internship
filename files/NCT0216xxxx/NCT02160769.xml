      The investigators study aims to capture the objective effects of pterygium surgery on tear&#xD;
      layer lipid thickness and the tear layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous objective studies of the tear film has been limited to corneal staining grading,&#xD;
      tear break up time and Schirmer's test which have been shown to poor to moderate&#xD;
      repeatability. The effect of pterygiums on tear layer lipid thickness (LLT) has not&#xD;
      previously been explored. With the LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer, the investigators&#xD;
      have the ability to assess the optical coherence interference pattern produced by light&#xD;
      reflected off the tear film in a safe and non-invasive manner. Software analysis of the image&#xD;
      then measures the tear LLT which can be used to objectively quantify the diagnosis of&#xD;
      lipid-deficient dry eye.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium is a condition characterized by abnormal conjunctival growth on the cornea and is&#xD;
      particularly prevalent in tropical climates. In severe circumstances, it may lead to visual&#xD;
      loss by obscuration of the visual axis and inducing corneal astigmatism (1). It is often also&#xD;
      associated with dry eye symptoms and studies have previously shown some correlation with&#xD;
      shortened tear break up time (TBUT)(2) but not Schirmer's Test (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schirmer's Test, corneal staining and TBUT are often used to investigate symptoms of dry eyes&#xD;
      but the diagnosis and assessment is often difficult due to the poor repeatability of the&#xD;
      tests(4). Treatments for dry eyes often rely on patient's subjective symptomatic improvements&#xD;
      as a measure of outcome although no literature has been published of subjective symptoms for&#xD;
      pterygium patients. The effects of pterygium surgery and tear lipid layer thickness has also&#xD;
      not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer is a HSA-approved imaging device that allows&#xD;
      clinicians evaluate the characteristics and thickness of the tear lipid layer thickness (LLT)&#xD;
      in a safe and non-invasive manner. The device utilizes white light from a LED source that is&#xD;
      directed at the tear film over the inferior corneal region. Reflected light is captured by a&#xD;
      high resolution camera and the optical inference pattern is evaluated by software to&#xD;
      determine the LLT (5). It also was found to correlate with other dry eye diagnostic tests,&#xD;
      such as tear film break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer's test and corneal staining(6,7). LLT is&#xD;
      also reported to better correlate with symptoms than other objective dry eye tests(5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LipiView was also capable of detecting a significant change in longitudinal lipid thickness&#xD;
      in 10 patients one month after blepharoplasty. A similar result may be obtained from the&#xD;
      investigators patients post pterygium surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study aims to investigate the effects of pterygium surgery on tear lipid layer&#xD;
      thickness with LipiView. The results will be compared with the effects of pterygium surgery&#xD;
      on TBUT, and corneal staining. The subjective improvement in dry eye symptoms post pterygium&#xD;
      surgery will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical importance This study can provide further data to support pterygium surgery as a&#xD;
      role in dry eyes management in an objective and reproducible manner. New data on pterygium&#xD;
      and tear lipid layer thickness as well as subjective dry eye symptoms will also be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Purpose The Assesssment of Dry Eye Symptoms, Tear Layer and Tear Layer&#xD;
      Lipid Thickness Pre and 1month Post Pterygium Surgery using a LipiView Ocular Surface&#xD;
      Interferometer (LipiView)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and target sample size Target sample size: 80 40 patients who will be undergoing&#xD;
      pterygium surgery will be recruited for this study. Another 40 patients will be recruited&#xD;
      from the general ophthalmology (ECS) clinic. These patients are cleared to have no lid&#xD;
      disturbances in terms of function or anatomy, and will serve as the &quot;control&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permission will be sought from the junior ophthalmologists and the supervising&#xD;
      ophthalmologist (in the event of a training list) or from the senior ophthalmologist if he is&#xD;
      performing the surgery himself. These patients would have been diagnosed with pterygium and&#xD;
      opted for surgical excision and conjunctival autograft. Pre operatively they will complete a&#xD;
      simple questionnaire to evaluate any dry eye symptoms. Participants will be examined under&#xD;
      the slit lamp for fluorescein dye corneal staining and fluorescein dye tear break up time.&#xD;
      The patients will then undergo a LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer Measurement of Tear&#xD;
      lipid layer thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedules Two/Three visits is required for paticipants who are undergoing pterygium&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one visit is required for normal controls who are recruited from general ophthalmology&#xD;
      (ECS) clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of Dry Eye Symptoms (SANDE) Participants will be asked to score and fill up a&#xD;
           dry eye questionnaire that assesses the symptomatic severity and frequency of dry eyes&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ SANDE Questionnaire Consists of 3 questions on frequency and severity. VAS will be&#xD;
           applied to evaluate dry eye symptoms as described by Schaumberg et al. (Schaumberg,&#xD;
           Gulati et al. 2007). The scores will be recorded separately for frequency and severity&#xD;
           of dry eye symptoms. Patients will be asked to mark &quot;X&quot; on a 100mm line that corresponds&#xD;
           to the degree of the symptom. A global score will be calculated by multiplying the&#xD;
           frequency score by the severity score and taking the square root of the result (to&#xD;
           transform back to the original scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Basic biodata such as age, race, gender will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer Measurement of Tear lipid Layer Thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior measuring the tear lipid layer thickness, participants are advised not to:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. instill any eye ointment for at least 24 hours, or ii. instill eye drops or wear&#xD;
           contact lenses for 4 hours, or iii. swim in a chlorinated pool, rub their eyes or put on&#xD;
           eye cosmetics on the day of the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the measurement of each eye, the participants place their chins on a chin rest&#xD;
           and look at a single white light source for 30 seconds. During this period, participants&#xD;
           are encouraged to blink freely at a comfortable rate which the assessor measures the&#xD;
           LLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Similar steps would be taken for the other eye as a control eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of fluorescein tear break up time and corneal staining will be conducted only&#xD;
           after LipiView LLT measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fluorescein Dye Tear Break-up Time (TBUT) Fluorescein dye is introduced onto the lower&#xD;
           eyelid by a wetted fluorescein strip. The tear film will then be observed with blue&#xD;
           light using a slit lamp to the point where it breaks. The time from the previous blink&#xD;
           to the breaking of the tear film will be recorded to the nearest second.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fluorescein Dye Corneal Staining After fluorescein dye is introduced, the cornea will be&#xD;
           examined for green stains indicating epithelial erosion, a sign of damage due to&#xD;
           dryness. The number of green stains and their location on the cornea (superior, central,&#xD;
           inferior, temporal, nasal fields) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient will undergo pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft on the prearranged&#xD;
           surgery date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Steps 1-4 will be repeated 1 month post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increase in tear lipid layer thickness 1 month post pterygium surgery in the operated eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no interim analysis. Analysis will be performed after all the subjects have&#xD;
      completed the required visits or have withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed for sample mean of pre and post-operative questionnaire score, tear&#xD;
      break up time, corneal staining and tear lipid layer thickness in both the operated and&#xD;
      un-operated eye. The confidence intervals of the pre and post-operative in both the operated&#xD;
      and un-operated will be calculated with T-test analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There should be decreased dry eye symptoms in the operated pterygium eye with a improvement&#xD;
      in tear break up time, decreased corneal staining and increase tear lipid layer thickness&#xD;
      when compared to pre operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
