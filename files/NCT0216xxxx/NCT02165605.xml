  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double blind, vehicle-controlled evaluation of the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of HylaCareTM. The study will employ the patient as her own control, a commonly&#xD;
      used method for the evaluation of topical dermatologic agents. Each patient will be&#xD;
      randomized blindly as to whether the study serum will be applied to the medial or lateral&#xD;
      portion of the treated breast, using the nipple as the dividing line. The product and placebo&#xD;
      will also be applied to the contra-lateral breast in the same fashion, as a further control.&#xD;
      The study drug and placebo will be applied three (3) times daily.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be allocated to the treatment using a randomized permuted block. There will be&#xD;
      no stratification. Patients will be randomized to receive the investigational product to be&#xD;
      applied to either the medial (inside) or lateral (outside) portion of the breast, a placebo&#xD;
      product will be used on the other side. Patients and clinical investigators will be blinded&#xD;
      to the treatment assignments.&#xD;
