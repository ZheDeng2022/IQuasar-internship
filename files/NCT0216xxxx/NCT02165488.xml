  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30% of ketamine users complain of abdominal discomfort. Long-term ketamine use is associated&#xD;
      with hepatotoxicity and pathologic changes to the biliary tract. Yet the prevalence of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary pathologies in ketamine users has not been well-described.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit a large number of ketamine users based on referrals from&#xD;
      different Psychiatry clusters in Hong Kong and to investigate the underlying cause of&#xD;
      abdominal discomfort, describe the prevalence of different gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary&#xD;
      pathologies and describe their long-term outcome.&#xD;

      The recreational use of psychotropic drugs has been increasing over the past 2 decades in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. Ketamine hydrochloride is currently one of the most popular recreational drugs in&#xD;
      Hong Kong, and its recreational use is also increasing in the United Kingdom and Europe.&#xD;
      Inhalation of ketamine could result in hallucinations, out-of-the-body experiences and&#xD;
      psychological dissociation, making it popular among young adults. One of the well-known side&#xD;
      effects of ketamine is bladder dysfunction, which is seen in one-quarter of chronic ketamine&#xD;
      users .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine has also been known to be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. Colicky&#xD;
      epigastric / abdominal discomfort in ketamine users, known as &quot;K-cramps&quot;, has been reported&#xD;
      in 33.3% of frequent ketamine users, and is the second-most common symptom of presentation&#xD;
      (21%) among ketamine users in the emergency department . Nonetheless, the underlying etiology&#xD;
      resulting in this abdominal discomfort remains poorly defined. A possible etiology is&#xD;
      intestinal motility disorders, since ketamine interferes with gastric motility. Another&#xD;
      possible cause could be ketamine-related cholangiopathy, which has been described in both&#xD;
      Asia and Western countries. Another possible cause could be ketamine-related liver&#xD;
      dysfunction, which is seen in 16% of ketamine users. Chronic ketamine hepatotoxicity is&#xD;
      associated with mitochondrial liver injury , and could result in bridging liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit subjects from ketamine users seeking medical attention at substance abuse&#xD;
      clinics in different psychiatric clusters in Hong Kong. A screening log will be kept on the&#xD;
      total number of ketamine users attending different substance abuse clinics and the number of&#xD;
      potential subjects referred to our center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline sociodemographic information will be obtained. A standardized method will be used to&#xD;
      assess and quantify the degree of ketamine use, as well as the recreational use of other&#xD;
      psychotropic drugs (e.g. ecstasy, methamphetamine, marijuana etc.) and alcohol intake.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be assessed for the presence or absence of dyspepsia, biliary-type&#xD;
      abdominal painï¼Œ gastroparesis or other abdominal symptoms following standard criteria.&#xD;
