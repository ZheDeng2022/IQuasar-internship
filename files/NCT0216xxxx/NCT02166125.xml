      The purpose of this prospective registry is to assess long term data on efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      clinical outcome of endoscopic placement of suture(s) and approximation of soft tissue within&#xD;
      the Gastrointestinal tract for various GI tract disorders. The registry will evaluate&#xD;
      technical feasibility, clinical outcome, safety profile and overall clinical management&#xD;
      through medical chart review. The procedures the investigators are evaluating are all&#xD;
      clinically indicated and will not be prescribed to someone to participate in this research&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our institution performs therapeutic Interventional Endoscopy in around 500-1000 patients a&#xD;
      year. We come across several gastrointestinal disorders such as fistula or leak repairs,&#xD;
      gastric outlet revisions, (dilated anastomoses), stent migrations, gastric wall defects or&#xD;
      perforation, ulcer repairs, closure of transgastric entrance after a NOTES procedure (Natural&#xD;
      orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery) that require placement of sutures and/or&#xD;
      approximation of soft tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventionally, surgery or other endoscopic alternatives are used to resolve or mitigate&#xD;
      these issues. However, surgery had higher morbidity and mortality rates, and other endoscopic&#xD;
      alternatives may not be successful either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of endoscopic suture systems such as the Apollo Endosurgery OverStitch™&#xD;
      Endoscopic Suture System (ESS) (or Endo Stitch™ , the SILS™ Stitch), advanced endoscopists&#xD;
      can place endoscopic sutures by deploying multiple running and interrupted stitches with a&#xD;
      single insertion of the endoscope within the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the endoscopy unit uses the Apollo Endosurgery OverStitch™ Endoscopic Suture&#xD;
      System (ESS) for suture placement in various gastrointestinal disorders; including suturing&#xD;
      stents to prevent stent migration in the esophagus. Even though several case reports and&#xD;
      animal studies have been published reporting the clinical success of endoscopic suturing,&#xD;
      there have been hardly any large sample size studies to verify the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      endoscopic suturing. Our own study reported 12 cases with promising results for esophageal&#xD;
      stent subjects. 1-16 We lack enough data evaluate and verify technical feasibility, clinical&#xD;
      success and safety of endoscopic suturing in specific gastrointestinal disorders.1-16&#xD;
      Evaluation of these factors would help us compare them to conventional treatment modalities;&#xD;
      and consequently help us identify appropriate treatment techniques and improve clinical&#xD;
      management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective registry is to assess long term data on efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      clinical outcome of endoscopic placement of suture(s) and approximation of soft tissue within&#xD;
      the Gastrointestinal tract for various GI tract disorders. The registry will evaluate&#xD;
      technical feasibility, clinical outcome, safety profile and overall clinical management&#xD;
      through medical chart review. The procedures we are evaluating are all clinically indicated&#xD;
      and will not be prescribed to someone to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, observational, medical chart review for at least 6 standard of&#xD;
      care visits up to 1 year after subject consents for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Participation: Subject's participation in this study will allow us to collect data&#xD;
      for at least 6 standard of care visits up to 1 year after consenting to participating in this&#xD;
      registry study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will undergo a standard of care or clinically indicated Endoscopic procedure and&#xD;
      subsequent follow up clinic visits as part of their standard medical care. Subject will sign&#xD;
      a separate clinical consent for the Endoscopic procedure and placement of the sutures(s).&#xD;
      That consent form will explain the procedure as well as the risks involved with the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will undergo endoscopic suturing and subsequent follow up clinic visits regardless of&#xD;
      their participation in this study. Subject will undergo no additional tests and procedures as&#xD;
      part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry study allows for the prospective review and collection of clinical data related&#xD;
      to endoscopic suturing for safety and efficacy assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: At least 6 standard of care visits up to 1 year for each subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the subject consents, data will be collected for their clinically indicated or&#xD;
           standard of care procedure visit and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of care follow up visits for endoscopic suturing are usually 1 month, 3 months&#xD;
           and 6 months post procedure. No additional research related visits will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All data will be collected from Medical charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No subject surveys or questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
