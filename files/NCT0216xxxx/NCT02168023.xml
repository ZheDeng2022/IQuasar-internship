  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) constitute an important medical and socioeconomic problem&#xD;
      worldwide. Despite the fact that the risk factors for SSIs were identified and the&#xD;
      continuously increasing medical knowledge in the fields of tissue engineering, molecular&#xD;
      biology and microbiology facilitated the development of numerous new recommendations and&#xD;
      methods for management, in many cases the available options for successful treatment of&#xD;
      post-operative wound infections remain limited. Non-treated or inappropriately treated SSIs&#xD;
      often lead to necrosis of the surrounding tissues, wound dehiscence, formation of fistulas,&#xD;
      or become sites of origin for systemic infections. Patients are exposed to risk of further&#xD;
      complications and hospitalization time extends resulting in increased total treatment costs.&#xD;
      Treatment prolongation affects also the quality of life and psychosocial functioning of&#xD;
      patients with impaired wound healing. Considering the arguments above, appropriate prevention&#xD;
      and management of infected post-surgical wounds is currently one of the priorities for the&#xD;
      majority of invasive medical disciplines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstetrics constitute a field of medicine in which the issues associated with wound healing&#xD;
      are particularly relevant. According to the literature data wound infections occur in&#xD;
      approximately 1.8-11.3% of women undergoing caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC) is a fatty acid derivative that irreversibly binds&#xD;
      microorganisms to the dressing fibres as a result of hydrophobic interaction. As the&#xD;
      mechanism of DACC action is solely physical no chemical agents are released into the wound&#xD;
      bed and the dressing could be safely used by women during puerperal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to compare the effect of DACC impregnated&#xD;
      dressing and standard surgical dressing in the prevention of SSIs in adult women following&#xD;
      caesarean section. This study will also evaluate pre-, peri- and postoperative risk factors&#xD;
      of SSIs and analyze health economics of DACC impregnated dressings for prevention of&#xD;
      post-cesarean wound infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial performed at the Department of&#xD;
      Obstetrics and Gynecology of Medical University of Warsaw. The study will involve 518&#xD;
      patients undergoing caesarean section who after giving their informed consent will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups: study (n=259) and control group (n=259). The study group&#xD;
      will receive DACC impregnated dressing - Sorbact Surgical Dressing ® (ABIGO Medical AB,&#xD;
      Sweden) and the control group will receive standard surgical dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all participants transverse skin incision and low transverse uterine incision will be&#xD;
      performed during caesarean section procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive prophylactic dose of antibiotics prior to the start of surgery&#xD;
      (1g cefazolin intravenously 0-30 minutes before surgery) and wound irrigation with octenidine&#xD;
      prior to the subcutaneous tissue closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For fascial incision, subcutaneous tissue and skin incision closure continuous antibacterial&#xD;
      braided absorbable suture, single monofilament absorbable suture and subcuticular continuous&#xD;
      monofilament non-absorbable suture will be used, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dressing will be left in place for the first 48 hours post caesarean section unless clinical&#xD;
      reason exists to replace it. After the first 48 hours postoperatively all of the dressings&#xD;
      will be removed and first wound evaluation will be performed. On post-operative day 3&#xD;
      patients will be discharged and indicated to revisit on post-operative day 7 to remove the&#xD;
      skin suture. During this follow-up visit second wound review will be performed for any signs&#xD;
      of infection. Third, and final wound assessment will take place on post-operative day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze overall treatment costs patients with SSI will be followed up until the end of&#xD;
      treatment, up to 8 weeks post surgery.&#xD;
