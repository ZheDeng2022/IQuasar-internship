      Prospective, randomized, unblinded, multi-center investigational study with enrollment at up&#xD;
      to 45 investigational sites. The study is designed to compare the study device (Direct Flow&#xD;
      Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System) composite event rate to a blended commercial&#xD;
      comparator (using approved Medtronic self-expanding bioprosthesis or Edwards&#xD;
      balloon-expandable bioprosthesis) in high and extreme risk Subjects with severe symptomatic&#xD;
      aortic stenosis. Subjects will be followed through the index procedure, hospital discharge,&#xD;
      and at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year for the primary endpoint analysis. Thereafter, annual&#xD;
      follow-up at 2 through 5 years will be conducted and analyzed separately.&#xD;

      Prospective, randomized, unblinded, multi-center investigational study with enrollment at up&#xD;
      to 45 investigational sites. The study is designed to compare the study device (Direct Flow&#xD;
      Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System) composite event rate to a blended commercial&#xD;
      comparator (using approved Medtronic self-expanding bioprosthesis or Edwards&#xD;
      balloon-expandable bioprosthesis) in high and extreme risk Subjects with severe symptomatic&#xD;
      aortic stenosis. Subjects will be followed through the index procedure, hospital discharge,&#xD;
      and at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year for the primary endpoint analysis. Thereafter, annual&#xD;
      follow-up at 2 through 5 years will be conducted and analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint is a composite of all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, or&#xD;
      moderate or greater residual aortic regurgitation (based on core lab assessment) at 1 year.&#xD;
      All primary endpoint events will be evaluated by a CEC using the definitions located in this&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 648 subjects (432 subjects in Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve&#xD;
      System cohort + 216 subjects in blended control cohort) will provide at least 85% power to&#xD;
      test that the study device is non-inferior to the comparator with non-inferiority margin of&#xD;
      10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must meet the fundamental enrollment criteria of severe symptomatic, calcific aortic&#xD;
      stenosis with quantifiable and documented source records.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has severe senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis determined by&#xD;
             echocardiogram and Doppler, or simultaneous pressure recordings at cardiac&#xD;
             catheterization defined as: mean aortic gradient ≥40 mmHg, or an aortic valve area&#xD;
             ≤1.0 cm2 or aortic valve area index ≤0.6 cm2/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has moderate to severe symptoms from aortic valve stenosis (NYHA&#xD;
             Functional Class ≥II).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a documented aortic annulus size of ≥22 mm and &lt;29 mm based on the&#xD;
             center's assessment of pre-procedure diagnostic imaging (and confirmed by the Patient&#xD;
             Review Committee [PRC]) and is deemed treatable with an available size of both test&#xD;
             and control device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. There is agreement by the heart team (which must include a site cardiac&#xD;
             interventionalist and two cardiac surgeons which can be either two cardiac surgeon&#xD;
             staff members at the hospital where the procedure is to be performed or one surgeon&#xD;
             from the hospital where the procedure is to be performed and a surgeon from the&#xD;
             referring institution or practice) that subject is at high operative risk or greater&#xD;
             of serious morbidity or mortality with surgical valve replacement (see note below for&#xD;
             definitions of extreme and high risk, the required level of surgical assessment, and&#xD;
             PRC confirmation) and that TAVR is appropriate. Subjects will be designated either&#xD;
             extreme risk (defined as a mortality or irreversible morbidity 50% or great at 30&#xD;
             days) or high risk (i.e., Society of Thoracic Surgeons operative risk score &gt;8% or at&#xD;
             a &gt; 15% risk of surgical mortality at 30 days but not extreme risk). This conclusion&#xD;
             shall be based on consensus of one cardiac interventionalist and two cardiac surgeons&#xD;
             that have reviewed the case after careful consideration of the Subject's STS risk&#xD;
             score and co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures, and provides&#xD;
             written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject agrees and is capable of returning to the study hospital for all required&#xD;
             scheduled follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;20% determined by resting echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with an acute STEMI within 30 days preceding the index procedure.&#xD;

          3. Chronic kidney disease with creatinine clearance &lt; 20 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with a platelet count of &lt;50,000 cells/mm³ or a WBC &lt; 1000 cells/mm³ within 7&#xD;
             days prior to index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a known contraindication or hypersensitivity to all antithrombin regimens&#xD;
             (aspirin, all P2Y12 inhibitors) that cannot be adequately pretreated, or inability to&#xD;
             be anti-coagulated for the study procedure. Note: Subjects who require chronic&#xD;
             anticoagulation must be able to be treated additionally with either aspirin or&#xD;
             clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any subject with a balloon valvuloplasty (BAV) within 72 hours prior to the index&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Subject has known hypersensitivity to contrast agents that cannot be adequately&#xD;
             pre-medicated, or has known hypersensitivity to nickel, tantalum, titanium, or&#xD;
             polyurethanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with a history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within previous&#xD;
             60 days of index procedure.&#xD;
