  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators long-term goal is to increase the number of Summer Day Camps (SDC) that&#xD;
      meet the National Afterschool Association Healthy Eating and Physical Activity (HEPA)&#xD;
      Standards. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention&#xD;
      designed to increase children's PA levels and improve the quality of lunches and snacks&#xD;
      children consume in SDCs. The HEPA intervention is designed to target children, parents,&#xD;
      staff, program leaders, and the SDC environment and uses a train-the-trainer model with SDC&#xD;
      leaders to train their staff to deliver and integrate the intervention into routine practice.&#xD;
      In the proposed study, the investigators will evaluate these HEPA strategies, using a 4-year&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with 20 SDCs. An important feature of the study will be the&#xD;
      evaluation of maintenance of the intervention after the removal of research support (e.g.,&#xD;
      training, boosters) during the final year, as well as costs associated with implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that intervention SDCs will achieve significantly greater&#xD;
      increases in HEPA, compared to control SDCs. The investigators expect the study to support&#xD;
      the cost-effectiveness and maintenance of our strategies for promoting HEPA that will&#xD;
      facilitate SDCs meeting newly-established HEPA standards for this setting.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the impact of the HEPA interventions on: 1.) The proportion of children meeting the&#xD;
      PA Standard (i.e., â‰¥60min MVPA/d) while attending summer day camp; 2.) The proportion of&#xD;
      foods (e.g., fruit, vegetable, water) children and staff bring and consume at the summer day&#xD;
      camp that meet the HE Standards; and 3/) Changes in children's age-sex specific BMI&#xD;
      percentile from the start to end of summer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HEPA intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the maintenance of the HEPA intervention in summer day camps&#xD;

    <description>The Healthy Eating and Physical Activity (HEPA) intervention aims to increase the quality of foods and beverages and physical activity opportunities in summer day camps. Through staff-level training, physical activity opportunities are modified to provide children with a substantial amount of meaningful physical activity. Through working with foods service providers, changes to the types of foods and beverages served will be made.</description>
