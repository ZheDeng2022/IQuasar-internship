    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, single center, randomized, parallel, double-blind placebo- and&#xD;
      active-controlled trial in adult males ages 18 to 35 years of age who have male infertility&#xD;
      of unknown cause. Approximately 50 men will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups according to a 1:1 ratio. About half of the men will receive 25mg Androxal and half of&#xD;
      the men will receive a placebo (non-active pill) for 16 weeks. This study will last&#xD;
      approximately 4 months and involve up to 7 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect the Androxal on sperm production.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been estimated that 4 to 5 million men in the United States are testosterone&#xD;
      deficient, but fewer than 10% currently receive testosterone replacement therapy. There are&#xD;
      many reasons for the low number of men receiving testosterone replacement therapy, one of&#xD;
      which is the route of administration. The currently approved androgen therapies are oral&#xD;
      products, injectables, patches, buccal systems, and gels, and each has disadvantages. Oral&#xD;
      preparations may be associated with hepatotoxicity and produce unfavorable effects on serum&#xD;
      lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism. Injectables are associated with uneven levels of&#xD;
      serum testosterone leading to fluctuations in mood, libido, and energy levels. Patches may&#xD;
      require intrusive preparation, cause skin irritation or not adhere properly. A testosterone&#xD;
      gel has overcome some of the above problems and has gained acceptance, but there are&#xD;
      indications that men do not apply the gel correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that Androxal significantly increases total testosterone levels in&#xD;
      men with low values at baseline. Additional studies found not only was Androxal non inferior&#xD;
      to a topical gel, it was found to maintain sperm counts in the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms, using a block size of 4. The&#xD;
      order in which the treatments are assigned in each block is randomized and this process is&#xD;
      repeated for consecutive blocks of subjects until all subjects are randomized. This process&#xD;
      ensures that after every fourth randomized subject, the number of subjects in each treatment&#xD;
      group is equal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow subjects in screening once the target 50 subjects have been enrolled and to account&#xD;
      for dropouts, 75 randomization codes will be generated. As subjects are enrolled in the&#xD;
      study, they will be assigned unique consecutive numbers starting at 001. At least 50 subjects&#xD;
      who meet all the entry criteria will be randomized 1:1 such that approximately 25 subjects&#xD;
      are assigned to the Androxal treatment arm and approximately 25 subjects are assigned to the&#xD;
      placebo arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo controlled studies are the gold standard of clinical trials and should be attempted&#xD;
      whenever the indication and current medical practice will allow. This study is investigating&#xD;
      a product to increase sperm concentration in subjects with idiopathic male infertility and&#xD;
      secondary hypogonadism, low testosterone. Subjects with idiopathic male infertility do not&#xD;
      require treatment to be healthy and approximately 18 weeks on a placebo is unlikely to harm&#xD;
      the subjects in any way. Standard of care for idiopathic male infertility today allows&#xD;
      subjects and physicians the option to not medically treat the disease. Therefore, the use of&#xD;
      a placebo control in this study is well justified and will provide the best mechanism to&#xD;
      assess treatment effect.&#xD;
