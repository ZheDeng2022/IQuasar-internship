  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum or carinatum are the most common congenital deformations of the ventral&#xD;
      thoracic wall. Several different surgical methods with different techniques to correct these&#xD;
      deformations have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some clinicians recommend a correction of the deformation to improve the cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      efficiency. Other think that the correction has a more an aesthetic than a physiological&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our prospective study is to evaluate whether patients with PE or PC are suffering&#xD;
      preoperatively from a cardiopulmonary limitation at rest and under physical stress and if&#xD;
      there is a change of cardiopulmonary function after the surgical correction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum (PE) and pectus carinatum (PC) are the most common anterior chest wall&#xD;
      deformities. Pectus excavatum, also known as funnel chest, is characterised by a deep&#xD;
      depression usually involving the lower one-half to two-thirds of the sternum. PE is the most&#xD;
      common congenital chest deformity and has a reported incidence of between 1:1000 and 8:1000&#xD;
      live births, with a male-to-female ratio of 3:1. Pectus carinatum, or pigeon breast, refers&#xD;
      to protrusion of the sternum and is approximately seven times less frequent than PE,&#xD;
      affecting 1:1000 to 1:10,000 live births. More than 26% have familial occurrence. The&#xD;
      anatomic deformity is believed by many to be caused by a disproportionate growth of the&#xD;
      costal cartilages as compared with the remainder of the bony thoracic skeleton, which exerts&#xD;
      pressure on the sternum to cause depression (PE) and protrusion (PC). Although the majority&#xD;
      of patients with PE are recognized during the first year of life, the depression usually&#xD;
      becomes much more severe during childhood and adolescence; PC usually manifests itself at the&#xD;
      time of a growth spurt in the early teenage years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deformities frequently present not only as an aesthetic disturbance, but also in&#xD;
      association with mild limitation of activity, obstructive pulmonary mechanics, slight&#xD;
      dyspnea, asthma, palpitations and abnormal cardiac physiology. Symptoms in PC patients remain&#xD;
      often vague. PC patients usually complain more about the appearance of their chest rather&#xD;
      than any functional difficulties. Chest wall deformities cause great social timidity, a sense&#xD;
      of shame and often a feeling of limited self-worth and inferiority, depressive mood and&#xD;
      inadequate social behaviour due to their disturbed body perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results the investigators want to achieve with postoperative PFTs will demonstrate an&#xD;
      improvement in total lung capacity and improved exercise performance and will show that both&#xD;
      the restricted cardiac stroke volume and the increased work of breathing that have been&#xD;
      described in PE patients can be ameliorated by operative intervention. These results will&#xD;
      also contribute establish the criteria for the indication for surgery. The significant&#xD;
      quality-of-life improvements perceived in psychosocial and physical functioning will&#xD;
      encourage physicians to approach PE repair in the same manner as physicians do treatment of&#xD;
      other deformities that have a deleterious impact on the psychological and physical well-being&#xD;
      of the individual. Systematic evaluation of body image should become a diagnostic standard in&#xD;
      the assessment of patients presenting themselves for correction of thoracic wall deformities.&#xD;
