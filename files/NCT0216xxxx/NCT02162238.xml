    <textblock>
      Introduction: The prevalence of low serum zinc in children under 5 in East Seme, Kisumu is&#xD;
      73.5% and this is likely due at least in part to low bioavailable zinc from the local&#xD;
      cereal-based diet. Interventions that will increase zinc intake could prove useful in the&#xD;
      effort to control zinc deficiency. A potential strategy is to increase zinc intake through&#xD;
      enriched or fortified water. The Life Straw Family filter (LSF, Verstergaard Frandsen S.A,&#xD;
      Switzerland) is capable of purifying water and at the same time enriching it with zinc at a&#xD;
      variable concentration with mean delivery of approximately 1-4mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study: The primary aim of this study will be to quantify in under 5 year old&#xD;
      children the contribution of the household LSF device to zinc intake and dietary zinc&#xD;
      bioavailability in participating households. Secondary objectives are; 1) to assess change in&#xD;
      serum zinc levels, growth, morbidity in the intervention group compared to control; 2) to&#xD;
      characterize composition of the intestinal flora of children in the intervention group&#xD;
      compared to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting households from East Seme, Kisumu, Kenya will be randomly allocated to 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms in an effectiveness study (90 under-five's per treatment arm). Group one will receive&#xD;
      the LSF device with the zinc delivery system; group 2 will receive a LSF without the zinc&#xD;
      delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc intake will be assessed in a subsample of the under 5 year old children enrolled in the&#xD;
      effectiveness trial (n=100). This will be estimated by 24 hr recalls administered on 2&#xD;
      non-consecutive days in the dry and wet season. Selected food samples will be collected for&#xD;
      direct analysis of zinc and phytic acid content, to supplement data from food composition&#xD;
      tables (FCT's). The dietary assessment data will be used to estimate the distribution of zinc&#xD;
      intakes in this age group and the EAR cut-off method will be used to estimate the proportion&#xD;
      at risk of inadequate intakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on water intake from the LSF device will be obtained by personal diaries and tally&#xD;
      counters. The Zn concentration of the filtered water will be measured weekly. Using these&#xD;
      data and the data from the dietary assessment, the contribution of the LSF zinc delivery to&#xD;
      the overall dietary zinc intake will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness study will be conducted as a 6-month double blind randomised trial with 3&#xD;
      assessment time points (baseline, midpoint and endpoint). Three ml (3ml) whole blood will be&#xD;
      collected from under 5 year old children enrolled in the households for determination of&#xD;
      serum zinc (SZn), C-reactive protein (CRP), Alpha-1- acid glycoprotein (AGP) and hemoglobin&#xD;
      (Hb). Stool samples will be collected from a subsample at baseline, midpoint and endpoint in&#xD;
      the intervention and control group to assess the composition of the gut microflora and gut&#xD;
      inflammation. Anthropometrics (weight and height) will be measured at baseline, midpoint and&#xD;
      endpoint of the study. Weekly active surveillance for incidence and severity of malaria,&#xD;
      diarrhea and other infectious diseases will be done by questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>Device: LSF-filtering device LifeStraw Family is a water purification device that by means of hollow fibres removes solid particles (&lt;0.5 Nephelometric Turbidity units turbidity reduction), bacteria (&gt;Log 6 reduction), viruses (&gt;Log 4 reduction) and cysts (&gt;Log 3 reduction). Zinc enrichment is provided by a chamber housing a zinc releasing glass-plate that is placed annexed to the hollow fibre column. It is estimated that the LSF can provide about 5 mg of zinc/l of filtered water. By consuming daily a portion of 0.6 litres of enriched water, &gt;100% of the age-specific estimated physiologic requirement would be covered, assuming a fractional absorption of 40%.</description>
