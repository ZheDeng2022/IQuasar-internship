      Although major surgery is often required to treat abdominal problems, there is a significant&#xD;
      risk of death or complication following these operations. By using ultrasound the amount and&#xD;
      timing of fluid patients receive during operations can be optimised and the risk of surgery&#xD;
      reduced. However, little is known about the exact changes in blood flow in the small vessels&#xD;
      of the body in response to fluid. A greater understanding of this may allow for more&#xD;
      appropriate care of patients undergoing this type of surgery in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study of healthy volunteers we will attempt to better understand how fluid&#xD;
      administration guided by ultrasound effects blood flow in large and small vessels, by using&#xD;
      two different techniques of ultrasound imaging. A narrow bore (approximately 4-5mm diameter)&#xD;
      ultrasound probe will be passed through the nostril and mouth to rest within the oesophagus&#xD;
      allowing measurement of blood flow in the main artery, while a second probe will be rested on&#xD;
      the volunteer's abdomen and used to record changes in blood flow in small liver blood&#xD;
      vessels. Comparison of these two techniques during the administration of fluid will allow us&#xD;
      to better understand the relationship between large and small vessel blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because different types of fluid may behave in different ways, we will test the effect of two&#xD;
      types of fluid commonly used in clinical practice; 'normal' saline solution and gelofusine.&#xD;

      Optimizing intravascular volume and cardiac output are essential to ensure adequate organ&#xD;
      perfusion in patients who are undergoing major surgery. To enable this cardiac output is&#xD;
      frequently monitored during operation using a variety of techniques; one such technique is&#xD;
      trans-oesophageal Doppler ultrasound also known as oesophageal Doppler monitoring (ODM). ODM&#xD;
      measurement of cardiac output is a less invasive technique than many currently used methods,&#xD;
      and has recently been recommended by NICE for adoption in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The matching of microvascular blood flow, cardiac output and fluid administration is&#xD;
      advantageous for visceral organs, in marrying demands for oxygen and nutrients to their&#xD;
      delivery. However, although there is evidence to suggest that intraoperative ODM directed&#xD;
      fluid administration can improve outcomes in the perioperative period, reducing hospital stay&#xD;
      and complications, there is little direct evidence that optimization of cardiac output via&#xD;
      ODM improves the microvascular blood flow to the visceral organs which are frequently&#xD;
      compromised by major surgical interventions. A greater appreciation of the effect of ODM&#xD;
      guided fluid replacement on the delivery of blood and hence oxygen and nutrients to these&#xD;
      vital organs could help with the development of more refined algorithms for fluid&#xD;
      administration in a clinical setting in the future. In our clinical physiology laboratories&#xD;
      we regularly employ contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using a Phillips iU22, to visualize&#xD;
      microvascular blood flow in healthy young and elderly men following a variety of&#xD;
      physiological challenges. This minimally invasive ultrasound based imaging technique is ideal&#xD;
      for gaining an insight into the effect various physiological interventions have on tissue&#xD;
      blood flow and could be readily used to chart changes in visceral microvascular flow&#xD;
      following ODM guided fluid optimization. Transference of this investigative approach to a&#xD;
      clinical setting has the potential to greatly improve the care of the surgical patient&#xD;
      requiring fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different types of intravenous fluids are used in clinical practice. These are primarily&#xD;
      crystalloid solutions, such as 0.9% sodium chloride ('normal' saline), or colloidal&#xD;
      suspensions, such as gelofusine. There is good experimental evidence that the colloid&#xD;
      gelofusine produces a greater effect on cardiac output than an equivalent volume of of&#xD;
      saline, but it is unclear if this effect is replicated in the microvasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypotheses: (1) cardiac output and stroke volume as measured by ODM are&#xD;
      determinants of visceral microvascular blood flow (2) visceral microvascular blood flow in&#xD;
      elderly individuals is more closely determined by stroke volume (3) gelofusine produces a&#xD;
      greater increase in microvascular blood flow than the same volume of normal saline.&#xD;
