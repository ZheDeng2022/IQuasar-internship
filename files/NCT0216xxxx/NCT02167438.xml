    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate an FDA approved device called the HEM-AVERT®&#xD;
      Perianal Stabilizer and the efficacy in reducing the C-section rate and/or reducing the&#xD;
      second stage of labor times.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women may sometimes be reluctant to push resulting in a prolonged second stage labor, which&#xD;
      could lead to a Cesarean section. This study will record the frequency of Cesarean sections&#xD;
      in two groups to determine if there are any measurable differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational device in this study is the HEM-AVERT® Perianal Stabilizer manufactured&#xD;
      by Stetrix, Inc. This device has received previous FDA clearance as a Class II device to&#xD;
      prevent hemorrhoids during childbirth. This study is being conducted by Stetrix, Inc. and&#xD;
      falls within the guidelines set forth by the Food and Drug Administration in 21 CFR Section&#xD;
      812.2 as a non-significant risk study. The HEM-AVERT® Perianal Stabilizer is a Class II&#xD;
      device in accordance with FDA regulation 21 CFR 890.5765. The Class II version of the device&#xD;
      and the investigational device are identical in terms of materials, design, intended&#xD;
      population and area used. The sole difference is that data will be collected in order to&#xD;
      support an application to the FDA to obtain clearance of the device for the specific claim of&#xD;
      reducing the C-section rate and/or reducing the second stage of labor times. This difference&#xD;
      in data collection may be viewed as off-label use of the device although there is no new risk&#xD;
      to the subject in the use of this device as an investigational device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to reduce the C-section rate and/or the second stage&#xD;
      of labor times while using this device. For patients scheduled for a vaginal delivery,&#xD;
      success is defined as completing the vaginal delivery process.&#xD;
