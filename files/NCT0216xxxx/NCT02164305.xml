      Dynamic control of the rotator cuff muscles plays an important role in stabilizing the&#xD;
      shoulder during motion. Impairment in the neuromuscular control of these muscles may to lead&#xD;
      to injury and pain. Rehabilitation programs have moderate success in decreasing pain and&#xD;
      improving shoulder function. While most of these programs target the rotator cuff, it is&#xD;
      still unknown if they serve to improve the neuromuscular control of the rotator cuff muscles.&#xD;
      The rehabilitation may induce neurological and physiologic changes in neuromuscular&#xD;
      structures and thus alter the neuromuscular control of the entire shoulder complex.&#xD;
      Kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activities have been widely used to study&#xD;
      neuromuscular control. However, corticospinal excitability, which has been widely examined in&#xD;
      the patients with neurological disorders, provides a more detailed account of central control&#xD;
      from the primary motor cortex through the spinal cord to the muscles. This assessment of&#xD;
      neuromuscular control will serve to illuminate the ability of the shoulder muscles to handle&#xD;
      the stress from activities such as overhead sports activities and carrying or lifting heavy&#xD;
      objects. This approach could be used to help design efficient training program for athletes&#xD;
      and effective rehabilitation program for patients with shoulder injuries. The purpose of the&#xD;
      proposed study is to investigate the effect of exercise treatment effect on the&#xD;
      proprioception, kinematics, EMG and corticospinal excitability of shoulder muscles, including&#xD;
      the deltoid and rotator cuff muscles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human shoulder complex sacrifices stability in exchange for a large range of motion&#xD;
      necessary for hand manipulation. Due to the inherent instability of the bony congruence and&#xD;
      ligament constraint, dynamic control of the muscles plays an important role in stabilizing&#xD;
      the shoulder during motion. The rotator cuff muscles serve as the chief stabilizer of the&#xD;
      shoulder joint, while the deltoid provides most of the torque necessary for motion.&#xD;
      Therefore, the coordination of the deltoid and the rotator cuff muscles is essential for&#xD;
      smooth and efficient shoulder function. Impairment in the neuromuscular control of these&#xD;
      muscles may to lead to injury and pain. Consequently, rehabilitation programs aim to restore&#xD;
      the normal neuromuscular control of these shoulder muscles in order to help decrease pain and&#xD;
      improve shoulder function. Although rehabilitation programs have demonstrated positive&#xD;
      effects on pain decrease and functional improvement, it is still unknown if they serve to&#xD;
      improve the neuromuscular control of the shoulder muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the deltoid provides most of the torque necessary to elevation the shoulder, it can&#xD;
      also produce a superiorly directly force on the glenoid. This shear force tends to pull the&#xD;
      humeral head superiorly, which can result in a decrease in the subacromial space. When the&#xD;
      rotator cuff muscles function properly, the line of action of the rotator cuff muscles result&#xD;
      in a centering force, which can help maintain the humeral head in the center of the glenoid&#xD;
      fossa. However, it has been hypothesized that if the rotator cuff muscles are not able to&#xD;
      produce sufficient force during arm movement, the superior shear force produced by the&#xD;
      deltoid results in humeral head superior translation. This abnormal displacement can result&#xD;
      in impingement of subacromial tissues and ultimately leading to tissue injury and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, shoulder rehabilitation programs focus on strengthening the rotator cuff&#xD;
      muscles by using shoulder movement in which the rotator cuff muscles show high muscle&#xD;
      activity. However, although these activities lead to a strengthening of the rotator cuff,&#xD;
      what is unknown is whether the repetitive stress imposed on the rotator cuff results in&#xD;
      neuromuscular adaptations that will help counteract the deltoid shear force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stress of rehabilitation may induce the neurological and physiologic changes in&#xD;
      neuromuscular structures and thus alters the neuromuscular control of the entire shoulder&#xD;
      complex. Kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) measurements have been widely used to study&#xD;
      neuromuscular control. While kinematic measures show movement patterns, EMG demonstrates the&#xD;
      timing, sequence, and magnitude of the muscle firing. Abnormal kinematics and EMG patterns&#xD;
      have been demonstrated in patients with shoulder impingement. Measuring parameters of&#xD;
      neuromuscular control can lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of&#xD;
      shoulder exercise training and how the neuromuscular structures adapt to the stress of the&#xD;
      exercise training. More specifically, these assessments can be used to assess whether a&#xD;
      rehabilitation program results in a positive adaptation that can help the shoulder muscles&#xD;
      handle the stress from activities such as overhead sports activities and carrying or lifting&#xD;
      heavy objects. Ultimately, this could be used to design more efficient training program for&#xD;
      athletes and effective rehabilitation program for patients with shoulder injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation&#xD;
&#xD;
      When shoulder neuromuscular control is investigated in the fields of biomechanics,&#xD;
      orthopaedic rehabilitation, and sports, the focus is generally on kinematics and EMG. These&#xD;
      kinematics and EMG parameters represent how the shoulder complex is controlled during&#xD;
      movement as the result of motor command execution. Corticospinal excitability, which has been&#xD;
      widely examined in patients with neurological disorders, has also been recently applied in&#xD;
      biomechanics, orthopaedic rehabilitation, and sports fields. Corticospinal excitability&#xD;
      represents the efficacy of neural transmission along the corticospinal pathway. In addition&#xD;
      to neurological impairment, orthopaedic injury and pain can also affect corticospinal&#xD;
      excitability. For example, in subjects with non-traumatic shoulder instability, the lower&#xD;
      trapezius demonstrates decreased excitability. Also, experimental tonic muscle pain over the&#xD;
      first dorsal interosseous results in inhibition of cortical and spinal excitability.&#xD;
      Similarly, experimentally-induced acute low lumbar pain is associated with different effects&#xD;
      on trunk muscles. The deep abdominal muscles, such as the transversus abdominis, showed&#xD;
      reduced corticospinal excitability. In contract, more superficial muscles, such as the lumbar&#xD;
      erector spinae and external oblique abdominis, demonstrated increased excitability. In&#xD;
      addition to kinematics and EMG measurements, which demonstrate the overall motor strategy,&#xD;
      the corticospinal excitability is another promising parameter to investigate the details&#xD;
      about how the deltoid and rotator cuff muscles are controlled from the primary motor cortex&#xD;
      through the spinal cord to the muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While consistent evidence suggests that motor skill training is associated with increased&#xD;
      excitability, the effects of strength training on corticospinal excitability are still not&#xD;
      well known and may depend on the muscles and training task. The training of neuromuscular&#xD;
      control may be associated with both motor learning and strength training. The control and&#xD;
      firing pattern may be directly re-learned consciously, which involves increases in strength&#xD;
      and motor learning. Since it is associated with a learning process, excitability may increase&#xD;
      after training. It has been shown that changes in the excitability are correlated with a&#xD;
      motor learning effect, so that changes in excitability after training may be correlated with&#xD;
      changes of rotator cuff EMG. After repetitive practice, the conscious movement patterns may&#xD;
      become automatic thus changing the EMG pattern of rotator cuff activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of the study are to (1) investigate the effect of exercise training on the&#xD;
      neuromuscular control of shoulder complex in healthy subjects, including kinematics, EMG and&#xD;
      corticospinal excitability, and (2) to examine the relationship between the corticospinal&#xD;
      excitability, EMG and force measures. The results of the study may help to understand the&#xD;
      underlying neurological and biomechanic mechanism of exercise training and help to design the&#xD;
      training or rehabilitation protocols for the athletes or the patient with shoulder injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled experimental design will be used to investigate the effect of rotator&#xD;
      cuff exercise. Healthy subjects will be recruited and randomly assigned to two groups,&#xD;
      exercise and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measures will be made twice, before and after a four-week treatment. Fine-wire&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) electrodes will be inserted into the supraspinatus and infraspinatus&#xD;
      muscles of the rotator cuff. Surface EMG electrodes will be used for the middle deltoid and&#xD;
      scapular muscles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used to assess the&#xD;
      corticospinal excitability of the deltoid and rotator cuff muscles. A flat double-coil&#xD;
      stimulation coil will be used to provide a single-pulse stimulus over the motor cortex,&#xD;
      approximately 4 cm lateral of the bisection of the mid line and the biauricular line.&#xD;
      Electromagnetic tracking sensors will be attached to the arm, scapula and thorax to measure&#xD;
      shoulder kinematics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters of corticospinal excitability will also measured when the arm is at 90° of&#xD;
      elevation with a baseline muscle contraction level of 10% maximum voluntary contraction&#xD;
      (MVC). TMS stimulation intensity will be set at 10% below threshold and increased in 5%&#xD;
      increments until the response saturates. Five stimuli will be delivered at each intensity of&#xD;
      stimulation. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) will be measured&#xD;
      and averaged across the five trials at each intensity. The curve of the relationship between&#xD;
      stimulation intensity and the MEP amplitude is sigmoidal and will be fit with the Boltzmann&#xD;
      equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEP(s) = MEPmax/(1+ e^(m(S - 50s)))&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this equation, MEP(s) is the amplitude of motor evoked potential, MEPmax is the maximum&#xD;
      MEP amplitude, m is the slope of the function, and S50 is the stimulus intensity at which the&#xD;
      MEP is 50% of MEPmax. The peak slope of the function occurs at S50. The threshold of the&#xD;
      curve is the x-intercept of the tangent to the function at the point of maximal slope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three parameters, MEPmax, m, and x-intercept threshold, will be used to model the&#xD;
      corticospinal excitability, which provides a more details of the excitability of the&#xD;
      corticospinal tract. The value of x-intercept threshold is similar to the motor threshold and&#xD;
      represents the stimulus intensity needed to activate the most excitable corticospinal&#xD;
      elements and motoneurons. The slope indicates the recruitment efficiency (gain) of the&#xD;
      corticospinal tract. The MEPmax reflects the balance between excitatory and inhibitory&#xD;
      components of the corticospinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scapular and humeral kinematics and the dynamic EMG of rotator cuff and deltoid muscles will&#xD;
      be recorded during three trials of arm elevation at scapular plane. The root mean square EMG&#xD;
      data will be calculated over four 30° increments of motion during arm elevation from 0° to&#xD;
      120°. Scapular kinematics will be presented at 30°, 60°, 90° and 120° of humeral elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be tested the shoulder proprioception. They will wear a goggle, which will&#xD;
      give the visual cues to guide them to reach the target. Three target positions will be&#xD;
      presented: humerothoracic elevation angles of 50°, 70°, and 90° in the scapular plane. The&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to reach the target again without any visual cues after relaxing&#xD;
      their arms at the side. The errors between the target angle and the angle they returned will&#xD;
      be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatment programs will last four weeks. The subjects in the exercise group will have&#xD;
      standard rehabilitation exercise for the shoulder impingement syndrome. The exercise will be&#xD;
      based on a previous treatment study conducted by Dr. Karduna and will be modified to&#xD;
      emphasize on facilitation and strengthening the rotator cuff muscles. The subjects in the&#xD;
      control group will receive no exercise. The control subjects will be asked to maintain their&#xD;
      regular activities and only have two assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-way mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to examine the differences&#xD;
      in neuromuscular control following the treatment between the control and exercise groups. The&#xD;
      dependent variables will be the changes of kinematics, EMG and excitability following the&#xD;
      treatment. The independent variables will be humeral elevation angles and groups. The&#xD;
      correlation between changes of TMS measures, the EMG measures, and the forces will be&#xD;
      examined by with a correlation analysis.&#xD;
