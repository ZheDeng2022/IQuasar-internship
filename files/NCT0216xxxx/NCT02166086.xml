  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to record information and evaluate the impact of advanced&#xD;
      imaging techniques on the management of pancreatico-biliary disorders. The registry will&#xD;
      evaluate diagnostic performance and overall clinical management impacted by advanced imaging&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced imaging techniques such as SpyGlass or pCLE (probe-based Confocal laser&#xD;
      endomicroscopy) using Cellvizio probes enable high sensitive and specific diagnosis of&#xD;
      strictures or tumors in bile and pancreatic ducts. However, advanced endoscopists have only&#xD;
      recently started to employ such techniques for diagnostic purposes. Hence we lack enough data&#xD;
      to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, technical feasibility and safety of such&#xD;
      imaging devices. Evaluation of these factors would help us compare them to conventional&#xD;
      diagnostic options; and consequently help us identify appropriate advanced imaging techniques&#xD;
      for biliary and pancreatic disorders and improve clinical management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this registry is to record information and evaluate the impact of advanced&#xD;
      imaging techniques on the management of pancreatico-biliary disorders. The registry will&#xD;
      evaluate diagnostic performance and overall clinical management impacted by advanced imaging&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center registry has been initiated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the impact of advanced imaging techniques in pancreatico-biliary disorders&#xD;
           on the clinical management of pancreatico-biliary disorders including malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, technical feasibility and safety of&#xD;
           advanced imaging techniques in pancreatico-biliary disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will review and document:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients who have had advanced imaging done for pancreatico-biliary disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No subject intervention is involved in this study. Subject contact is not needed for&#xD;
           database review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design at Secondary sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other sites must have either a database review protocol and/or a clinical trial that&#xD;
           would collect data on advanced imaging done for pancreatico-biliary disorders prior to&#xD;
           participating in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These sites would have IRB approved protocols to collect and send advanced imaging&#xD;
           procedure data to the primary site (WCMC). Additionally, the secondary study sites would&#xD;
           mention WCMC as an entity that could receive PHI in their respective protocols and&#xD;
           consent/HIPAA forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All secondary study sites' IRB approvals will be sent to the primary/coordinating study&#xD;
           center at WCMC. The primary center will then forward these IRB approvals to WCMC IRB as&#xD;
           soon as they are received from the secondary study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relevant IRB documentation will be maintained at both primary and secondary sites.&#xD;
