  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, newborn babies with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), receiving oxygen via&#xD;
      nasal continuous airway pressure (CPAP) modalities, and needing surfactant treatment will be&#xD;
      randomized to standard delivery of surfactant via and endotracheal tube airway (inserted&#xD;
      after pre-medication for pain with a short-acting narcotic), or to surfactant delivery via&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airway (LMA). The intent is to remove the airways and return babies to&#xD;
      non-invasive CPAP support, after surfactant is given. The primary outcome measure is the rate&#xD;
      of failure of initial surfactant therapy. Standardized failure criteria are reached: a)&#xD;
      early, if the baby is unable to be placed back on non-invasive CPAP (i.e., needs tracheal&#xD;
      intubation and mechanical ventilation) or, b) late, if the baby requires ventilation,&#xD;
      retreatment with surfactant within 8 hours or more than 2 doses of surfactant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to reduce the need for endotracheal intubation and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in preterm neonates with RDS needing rescue surfactant therapy by&#xD;
      instilling surfactant though an LMA, while achieving comparable efficacy of surfactant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that surfactant treatment through an LMA will decrease the proportion of&#xD;
      babies with RDS who require mechanical ventilation or subsequent intubation, when compared to&#xD;
      standard surfactant treatment following endotracheal intubation with sedation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) due to deficiency of pulmonary surfactant is common in&#xD;
      preterm newborns. Early treatment with surfactant improves oxygenation, reduces the need for&#xD;
      subsequent mechanical ventilation, decreases the incidence of pulmonary air leaks and chronic&#xD;
      lung disease and it also reduces mortality in extremely premature newborns. Optimal treatment&#xD;
      of RDS includes surfactant therapy and avoidance of invasive mechanical ventilation by using&#xD;
      nasal continuous positive airway pressure modes (NCPAP or NIPPV). The current standard method&#xD;
      of surfactant delivery requires tracheal intubation and at least brief positive-pressure&#xD;
      ventilation, as in the INSURE (Intubation-Surfactant-Extubation) approach. Because tracheal&#xD;
      intubation causes pain and vagal-mediated physiologic instability in neonates, premedication&#xD;
      with atropine and a narcotic is recommended. However, narcotic premedication increases&#xD;
      respiratory depression, which may require sustained mechanical ventilation, thus contributing&#xD;
      to the failure of INSURE. In a recent trial at our center, standard pretreatment with&#xD;
      morphine and atropine was associated with failure of INSURE in more than 2/3 of patients.&#xD;
      Consequently, we have recently changed our standard premedication for INSURE to the&#xD;
      combination of atropine and remifentanil (a rapid onset, short-acting narcotic). The&#xD;
      Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) is a commercially available, less invasive artificial airway that&#xD;
      does not need to be inserted into the trachea; it is FDA-approved for use in neonates;&#xD;
      preliminary data suggest that it can be used for surfactant administration, which in our&#xD;
      trial was associated with a lower failure rate than the morphine plus INSURE approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study protocol is reduce the need for endotracheal intubation and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in preterm neonates with mild to moderate RDS needing rescue&#xD;
      surfactant therapy by instilling surfactant though an LMA. A second objective is to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of surfactant administered via LMA versus endotracheal tube (ETT) in decreasing&#xD;
      the severity of RDS. Additionally, we will further evaluate the safety of surfactant&#xD;
      administration via LMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that surfactant therapy delivered via LMA is not inferior to&#xD;
      surfactant therapy delivered via transient intubation (INSURE technique) with short-acting&#xD;
      narcotic premedication for mild to moderate RDS in preterm neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will include babies with mild-to-moderate RDS, less than 48&#xD;
      hours of age, with gestational age 27 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks, treated with NCPAP (or other NIPPV&#xD;
      modality) ≥ 5 cm H2O and FiO2 between 0.30 and 0.60 for at least 2 hours to maintain oxygen&#xD;
      saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) 90-95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, babies are randomly assigned (from sealed, opaque,&#xD;
      consecutively numbered envelopes), to &quot;ETT&quot; or &quot;LMA&quot; groups. The &quot;ETT&quot; group is managed&#xD;
      according to our current INSURE approach to surfactant therapy (endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      following premedication with atropine + remifentanil), whereas the &quot;LMA&quot; group will be&#xD;
      pre-medicated with atropine before LMA insertion for surfactant administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive Infasurf (3mL/kg) instilled in 2 aliquots via their respective&#xD;
      airway, followed by PPV for at least 5 minutes. The artificial airway will be removed and the&#xD;
      patient returned to NCPAP/NIPPV by 15 minutes, if spontaneous respirations are adequate.&#xD;
      Indications for surfactant re-dosing and mechanical ventilation will be equivalent for both&#xD;
      groups. Babies will continue or initiate assisted ventilation via ETT if any of the following&#xD;
      occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent apnea;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe retractions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to wean FiO2 &lt; 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for re-dosing with surfactant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Within 8 hours after first dose of surfactant:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • FiO2 20% higher than the baseline FiO2, after excluding other obvious causes of&#xD;
           respiratory insufficiency such as pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If early re-dosing of surfactant is needed in patients of either group, it will be&#xD;
           administered via ETT (i.e., LMA patients will be intubated, and will receive the dose of&#xD;
           surfactant via ETT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Beyond 8 hours of the first dose of surfactant:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FiO2 is ≥ 60%, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FiO2 is ≥ 30% associated with worsening clinical signs of RDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If late re-dosing is needed in patients of the LMA group, use of the LMA is permitted for the&#xD;
      second dose. In the ETT group, all doses are given via the ETT.&#xD;
