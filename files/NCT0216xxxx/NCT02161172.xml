  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with traumatic brain injury are likely to present with cognitive, psychological,&#xD;
      emotional and behavioral problems during different periods, all of which affect patients'&#xD;
      life quality seriously. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive and psychosocial&#xD;
      outcome in patients with mild traumatic brain injury, and to determine the risk factors&#xD;
      associated with cognitive and psychological outcome. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE),&#xD;
      activities of daily living scale (ADL), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and&#xD;
      mental health symptom checklist (SCL-90) were used to assess the cognitive performance and&#xD;
      psychological outcomes in 360 patients with mild traumatic brain injury. Chi-square, Fisher's&#xD;
      exact tests and Logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the risk factors.&#xD;

    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>MMSE includes seven factors, namely: the time orientation factor (5 points), place orientation (5 points), immediate memory (3 points), short-term memory (3 points), calculation capabilities (5 points), verbal expression, naming and repetition (4 points), speech reading and understanding (4 points), graphic depiction (1 points). The scales for the description of cognitive function impairment were grouped into three levels of education: illiteracy (17 points), primary school (20 points) and middle school (24 points). The one with score below average was considered with cognitive function impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity of daily living scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is divided into two parts: physical self-care ability, instrumental activities of daily living. 1 point for each option means normal; If 2~4 points for one option, he or she probably had ability decline; If two or more parts ≥3 points or total score≥ 22 points (14 questions), he or she exhibited living ability decline clearly.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital anxiety and depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale includes 14 items and each has 0-3 points. The score of the former seven items &gt; 7, indicating depression symptom; the later seven items &gt; 7, indicating anxiety symptom.</description>

    <description>This scale has been widely used to patients with neurosis, adjustment disorder and other slight mental psychological disorder. According to the national norm results, if the total score &gt; 160, or the number of positive items &gt; 43, or one factor score &gt;2, we consider the positive screening.</description>

        360 patients with mild traumatic brain injury were enrolled in this study. Their age ranged&#xD;
        from 18 to 60 years, with mean age of 54.3 years. Types of trauma included scalp hematoma,&#xD;
        scalp laceration, cerebral contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral concussion,&#xD;
        epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma and skull fracture. Mechanisms of injury contained&#xD;
        traffic accident, fall, industrial accident, etc. Occupation of patients included cadres,&#xD;
        workers, farmers, individual, unemployed. Education: college or above, middle school,&#xD;
