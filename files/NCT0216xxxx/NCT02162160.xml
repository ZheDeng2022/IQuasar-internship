      Generate more information on the use of the Probiotic Intimate Crème regarding feeling of&#xD;
      dryness and freshness in the intimate area, as well as to evaluate the Lactobacillus flora&#xD;
      and presence of coliform bacteria in respect to E. coli in the intimate area of women before&#xD;
      use of the crème and at the end of a 10 days crème-usage (day 8-10), as well as 10 days after&#xD;
      (9-11 days) finished crème-usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that lactobacilli can survive in the intimate area of postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with use of a probiotic creme.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rational for using probiotics is that the humans are colonized by a numbers of&#xD;
      microorganisms from birth. These microorganisms are the natural flora of the human body. This&#xD;
      bacterial ecology may be imbalanced due different circumstances: excessive hygiene, use of&#xD;
      antibiotics or other drugs, use of alcohol, smoking, stress, diabetes and many other factors.&#xD;
      The natural bacterial flora in the external part of the genital tract might be promoted by&#xD;
      help of intimate products containing probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives Generate more information on the use of the Probiotic Intimate Crème&#xD;
      regarding feeling of dryness and freshness in the intimate area, as well as to evaluate the&#xD;
      Lactobacillus flora and presence of coliform bacteria in respect to E. coli in the intimate&#xD;
      area of women before and at the end of a 10 days crème-usage (day 8-10), as well as 10 (9-11)&#xD;
      days after finished crème-usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study Presence of at least one LN bacteria strain in the intimate&#xD;
      area of women in the intervention group compared to the intimate area of women in the control&#xD;
      group at the end of a 10 days crème-usage (Day 8-10), as well as 10 (9-11) days after&#xD;
      finished crème-usage. The primary endpint will be measured by bacterial Culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None-parametric statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints Obtain information about the coliform bacteria flora in respect to E.&#xD;
      coli flora in the external intimate area before and at the end of the 10 days crème-usage&#xD;
      (Day 8-10), as well as 10 days after finished crème-usage (9-11 days after).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtain information about the subjective feeling of dryness and freshness in the intimate of&#xD;
      women before and at the end of the 10 days crème-usage (Day 8-10), as well as 10 days after&#xD;
      finished crème-usage (9-11 days after).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The active and comparative test product will be filled into white tubes with&#xD;
      identical appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted with double-blind design when neither the personnel at the clinic&#xD;
      and the participants knows which product they are submitted/received. The study will also be&#xD;
      blinded for the laboratory personnel analyzing the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure The women will be randomly assigned to active or comparative test&#xD;
      products. Based on a computer-generated list, before start of the study, nine tubes&#xD;
      containing Probiotic Intimate Crème (the active product) and 9 tubes containing Soothing&#xD;
      crème (the control product) will be randomly assigned to a number between 1 to 18, and the&#xD;
      tubes labeled with the numbers. The numbered but otherwise visually identical tubes will&#xD;
      delivered to the clinic before start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, the participants will receive a tube consecutively in numerical&#xD;
      order, as they are included in the study, i.e. according to their participant number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer-generated randomization list and the product labeling will be carried out by&#xD;
      people who don't have direct contact with the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be taken by rolling sterile swabs over the upper third part of the lateral&#xD;
      vaginal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labial samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For labial sampling, on the left side of the vulva near the vaginal orifice, the labia minor&#xD;
      and major will be held apart and a sterile swab will be gently rubbed back and forth five&#xD;
      times during rotation. The labial examination area will be approximately 2 cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The swabs will then be placed in a prepared transport medium and sent to laboratory for&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.12. Study outline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women visiting the clinic will be recruited to the study. After obtained information&#xD;
           (Appendix 1) and signed informed consent the women will be clinically examined for any&#xD;
           clinical symptoms of Candida vaginitis (ocular examination) and bacterial vaginosis&#xD;
           (Amsel's criteria). The dryness of the mucus membranes will be also examined and the&#xD;
           vaginal pH measured using a pH-stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomized to 10 days use of test&#xD;
           product (Probiotic Intimate Crème) or control product (Soothing Cream, ACO); 2 times&#xD;
           daily, every morning and evening at bed time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The women will receive detailed instructions about how to use the study products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. They will also asked to return the empty tube or remaining product at the end of study&#xD;
           (Visit 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The women will answer a questioner regarding their subjective feeling of dryness and&#xD;
           freshness in their intimate are and rate their feeling on a ten-point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Samples with sterile swabs will be collected from vagina, labia and perineum (Sample&#xD;
           1-L, Sample 1-V) and sent to an independent laboratory for analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The 8th-10th day of the intimate crème-usage period, the women will return to the&#xD;
           clinic. The dryness of their mucus membranes will be clinically examined and the vaginal&#xD;
           pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They will answer a questioner regarding their subjective feeling of dryness and&#xD;
           freshness in their intimate are and rate their feeling on a on a ten-point scale. They&#xD;
           will also answer questions regarding their purchase intentions and intentions to&#xD;
           recommend the product to other women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vaginal and labial swabs will be collected (Sample 2-L, Sample 2-V) and send to an&#xD;
           independent laboratory for analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 9-11 days after the 10 days crème-usage period, the women will return to the clinic. The&#xD;
           dryness of their mucus membranes will be clinically examined and the vaginal pH&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They will answer a questioner regarding their subjective feeling of dryness and&#xD;
           freshness in their intimate are and rate their feeling on a ten-point scale. They will&#xD;
           also answer questions regarding their purchase intentions and intentions to recommend&#xD;
           the product to other women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vaginal and labial swabs will be collected. (Sample 3-L, Sample 3-V) and sent to an&#xD;
           independent laboratory for analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each visit, data will be recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
