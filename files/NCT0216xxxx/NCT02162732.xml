    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility (ability to be done) of experimental&#xD;
      technologies to determine a tumor's molecular makeup. This technology includes a genomic&#xD;
      report based on DNA exomes and RNA sequencing that will be used to discover new ways to&#xD;
      understand cancers and potentially predict the best treatments for patients with cancer in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
