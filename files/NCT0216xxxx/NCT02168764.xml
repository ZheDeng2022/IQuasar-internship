             headache laterality. Subjects who report more than 8 attacks per day or attack&#xD;
             duration of less than 30 minutes (untreated or unsuccessfully treated) must have been&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Both subject and physician judge previously or currently used preventive and/or acute&#xD;
             cluster headache treatment to be inadequate.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to maintain current preventive headache medication regimens (no change&#xD;
             in type, frequency, or dose) - except to manage tolerability - from Study Enrollment&#xD;
             through the Experimental Period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees not to use any acute medications, including oxygen therapy, for their&#xD;
             treatable cluster attacks during the Experimental Period until after they have used&#xD;
             SPG stimulation therapy for at least 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a dental examination and cleaning in the past six (6) months.&#xD;

             complications from surgery and/or general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a change in type, dosage or dose frequency of preventive headache&#xD;
             medications &lt; one (1) month prior to study enrollment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has undergone facial surgery in the area of the pterygopalatine fossa or&#xD;
             zygomaticomaxillary buttress ipsilateral to the planned implant site that, in the&#xD;

             Neurostimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject currently has an active oral or dental abscess or an active maxillary sinus&#xD;
