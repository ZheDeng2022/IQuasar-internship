    <textblock>
      Corpus callosum agenesis or dysgenesis (CCA) is a major brain malformation (˜1/4000 births)&#xD;
      presently diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography. In about half of the cases, CCA is&#xD;
      associated with other anomalies (complex CCA), which usually leads to medical abortion.&#xD;
      Syndromes including a CCA are many (hundreds), most of which are also associated with&#xD;
      intellectual deficiency (ID). Several genes are involved in such complex CCA. On the other&#xD;
      hand, several studies pointed to the favorable cognitive outcome of individuals/fetuses with&#xD;
      an apparently isolated CCA (ICCA) during pregnancy in about 70% of cases. However, there are&#xD;
      still 30% of cases with ID or developmental delay. The precise incidence and severity of&#xD;
      these disorders are presently unclear. Therefore, prenatal counseling of couples facing a&#xD;
      prenatal diagnosis of ICCA is still elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aims are to unravel the genetic causes of CCA by combining phenotypic and genetic&#xD;
      analyses in a prospective cohort of patients with CCA and intellectual disability, in order&#xD;
      to improve prenatal information.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Corpus callosum is the main midline brain structure connecting homologous cortical areas of&#xD;
      both hemispheres. Corpus callosum agenesis or dysgenesis (CCA) can be diagnosed antenatally,&#xD;
      either isolated or associated with other cerebral or extra-cerebral malformations. With an&#xD;
      incidence of 1.8/10,000 newborn, CCA is often associated with chromosomal anomalies and&#xD;
      mendelian syndromes. Even when CCA appears to be isolated, the neuro-developmental outcome is&#xD;
      uncertain, with many children developing normally, and others having moderate learning&#xD;
      disabilities or even severe ID. The genetic heterogeneity of complex CCA is large (CCA can be&#xD;
      observed in more than 300 entities), but for many patients, no etiological diagnosis is&#xD;
      known. Therefore, genetic counselling remains challenging in many cases. Recurrence is&#xD;
      observed in almost 5% of cases, and for most patients with no etiological diagnosis, the&#xD;
      disease is sporadic. These data suggest both recessive and dominant de novo inheritance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims, in a prospective cohort of 120 patients with CCA and intellectual&#xD;
      disability:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the nature and the frequency of characterized genetic abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the phenotypic spectrum of complex CCA&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To perform SNP-array analyses (i) for patients without etiological diagnosis and (ii)&#xD;
           for patients with an identified syndrome without molecular basis to clarify the genetic&#xD;
           basis of CCA and to evaluate the contribution of this technique in these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe new clinical- genetic entities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are recruited through pediatric neurology and genetics consultations in the&#xD;
      reference and competence centers &quot; intellectual disabilities of rare cause&quot; and associated&#xD;
      network called &quot;DéfiSciences&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The workup will include for all patients :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a clinical examination by a neurologist and a clinical geneticist, and a child&#xD;
           psychiatric care if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a blood sample for patient and his parents 2.3. a neuropsychological assessment if&#xD;
           needed 3.4. Cerebral MRI using new technologies (diffusion, tracking fiber spectroscopy&#xD;
           ... ) , if not available Central reviews of brain MRI are performed by a referent&#xD;
           neuroradiologist in order to classify the type of CCA, morphological features and&#xD;
           associated brain abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5. Several additional tests could be performed if necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. in search of associated malformations i. renal ultrasound ii. echocardiogram iii. bone&#xD;
      x-rays iv. ophthalmological examination b. in search of neurological/sensorial dysfunction:&#xD;
      neurophysiological assessment (electroencephalogram, brainstem evoked auditory potentials,&#xD;
      somatosensory evoked potentials, electroretinogram and visual evoked potentials) c. Karyotype&#xD;
      d. Molecular biology: ARX(for boys) XFRA e. Metabolic tests comprising at least plasma CK,&#xD;
      chromatography of plasma amino acids, chromatography of urine organic acids, a redox cycle,&#xD;
      urinary creatine and guanidinoacetic acid assay and a Bratton-Marshall test ;&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this initial assessment, investigators of the core clinical/research team will discuss&#xD;
      all cases to validate proposed diagnoses and to determine whether a secondary assessment or&#xD;
      complementary genetic studies are needed. Patients without established diagnosis will benefit&#xD;
      from a study using whole genome chips (Illumina SNP-array) to be conducted at the end of the&#xD;
      recruitment period for the second year of the project. This work will improve the essential&#xD;
      clinical and genetic knowledge of CCA, which is necessary to improve the assessment of the&#xD;
      prognosis in prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling. It is also expected to expand the&#xD;
      understanding of the complex development of the corpus callosum and its function.&#xD;
