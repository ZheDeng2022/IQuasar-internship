  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a proven strategy for preventing type 2 diabetes. Traditionally individuals have&#xD;
      been prescribed moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise but adherence to this standard&#xD;
      exercise program is dismal. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a novel form of&#xD;
      exercise that involves brief, repeated bursts of vigorous exercise separated by periods of&#xD;
      recovery. HIIT elicits many favourable cardiometabolic adaptations that are similar to&#xD;
      traditional exercise but does so with a lower amount of exercise and in substantially less&#xD;
      time than moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Therefore, HIIT has been touted as a&#xD;
      &quot;time-efficient&quot; exercise strategy for improving health. Whether overweight individuals at&#xD;
      risk for pre diabetes will show greater adherence to HIIT than moderate-intensity continuous&#xD;
      exercise over the long-term (12-months) has not been tested. Because exercise adherence&#xD;
      requires complex self-regulation, interventions designed to improve adherence should include&#xD;
      a behavioural component. The investigators will assess adherence to HIIT and&#xD;
      moderate-intensity continuous exercise over 12 months following a short-term (2 week)&#xD;
      intervention of either HIIT or moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Both conditions will&#xD;
      include a self-regulatory component targeted to increase participants' confidence to engage&#xD;
      in regular, independent exercise. The results will help determine whether HIIT is a more&#xD;
      feasible option for promoting exercise adherence for pre diabetes prevention than the&#xD;
      traditional moderate-intensity continuous exercise. The investigators hypothesize that a)&#xD;
      over the 12 months follow-up subjects randomized to the HIIT will be more likely to adhere&#xD;
      when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise, b) over the 12 months follow-up&#xD;
      subjects randomized to HIIT will have higher rates of adherence and levels of total physical&#xD;
      activity, c) greater increases in self-regulation (including goal setting, self-monitoring,&#xD;
      and self-regulatory efficacy) following HIIT will mediate higher rates of adherence, d)&#xD;
      10-days of HIIT and moderate-intensity continuous exercise will improve cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness, increase insulin sensitivity, reduce circulating inflammatory markers, and improve&#xD;
      glucose control and e) Improvements in cardiometabolic health factors will be greater&#xD;
      following HIIT compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomized to the HIIT or moderate-intensity continuous&#xD;
      exercise conditions. Each condition will involve a two-week supervised exercise period&#xD;
      consisting of ten sessions. Exercise prescriptions for each condition will be progressive in&#xD;
      nature over the two week supervised period and will be matched for external work.&#xD;
      Specifically, individuals randomized to HIIT will begin with four intervals lasting 1-minute&#xD;
      each at ~85-90% peak oxygen uptake [VO2peak] and increased to 10 X 1-min intervals by day 10.&#xD;
      Individuals randomized to moderate-intensity exercise condition will begin with 20 minutes of&#xD;
      continuous activity at ~55-60% V02peak and gradually increase the duration to 50 minutes by&#xD;
      day 10. Participants will self-select exercise modality (walking outdoors, elliptical&#xD;
      machine, treadmill walking, or stationary cycling). One trainer will supervise participants&#xD;
      during the 2-week training program. Participants will complete 3 of the 10 training days (day&#xD;
      4, 7 and 9) at home unsupervised. Participants will wear a heart rate monitor during each&#xD;
      exercise session (supervised and unsupervised) to monitor exercise intensity and ensure&#xD;
      compliance. In addition, participants will record their exercise bouts in a logbook on both&#xD;
      lab and home training days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both conditions received 10 minutes of behavioural counseling each day they&#xD;
      trained in the lab (for a total of 70 minutes). Following the supervised training,&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to maintain HIIT or moderate-intensity continuous exercise&#xD;
      three days per week independently. Specifically, individuals randomized to HIIT will be&#xD;
      prescribed three exercise sessions per week involving 10 X 1-minute intervals at ~85-90%&#xD;
      VO2peak, while participants randomized to moderate-intensity continuous exercise will be&#xD;
      prescribed three session per week of 50-minute continuous exercise at ~55-60% VO2peak.&#xD;
      Training logs will be provided and participants will be instructed to estimate exercise&#xD;
      intensity based on physiological cues taught during supervised training days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak), an objective measure of fitness and habitual activity, will be used as an integrative measure of exercise adherence (and overall health) at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Specifically, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) will be assessed by a maximal cycling exercise test. Power output will begin at 30 W and increase by 15 W/min until volitional exhaustion. Expired gas samples will be collected continuously and VO2 measured by a metabolic cart (Parvomedics TrueOne 2400). The mean of the two highest 30 s average values will define VO2peak. VO2peak will be confirmed using standard criteria110. A Polar chest strap, which is integrated to the metabolic cart and cycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur), will capture Heart Rate. Peak power output will be recorded as the highest value attained.</description>

    <measure>Changes in insulin sensitivity and inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in insulin sensitivity and inflammation will be examined. Specifically fasting blooding samples will be taken to assess markers of insulin sensitivity (glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR) and inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in acute affect during exercise sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Repeated measurements on Day 1, Day 6 and Day 9 of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The acute affective response to exercise will be assessed using the 1-item Feeling Scale (FS). The FS is the most frequently used measure of in-task exercise feelings of pleasure/displeasure. Consistent with our established laboratory protocol for assessing and comparing affect in intermittent and continuous exercise bouts, feeling scale will be assessed immediately pre- and post-exercise, and at the beginning (2.5%), middle (42.5%), and end (92.5%) of workout completion. These time points correspond to the midpoint of the first, fifth, and tenth interval within the HIIT protocol. Measurements of affect will be taken in Day 1, Day 6 and Day 9 of the 10-day intervention.</description>

    <measure>Changes in exercise enjoyment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) will be used to assess perceived enjoyment at baseline and post intervention. This 18-item measure is scored on a 7-point bipolar scale based on the instruction; &quot;Please rate how you feel at the moment about the physical activity you have been doing:&quot;. Example items are &quot;it's not very refreshing/It's very refreshing&quot; and &quot;I would rather be doing something else/there is nothing else I would rather be doing&quot;. Items are summed to produce an overall enjoyment score out of 126.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in average blood glucose at day 9 of the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Intervention day 9</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in average blood glucose from baseline to day 9 of the intervention will be measured using the CGMS iPro2 (Medtronic, Northridge, CA). The CGM records glucose values in a blinded fashion using a small microneedle inserted into the subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue that is connected to a recorder that quantifies interstitial glucose values every 5 minutes for up to three days. Finger stick blood glucose samples, taken four times per day, are used as calibrators to create a 24-hr blood glucose curve, which are downloaded upon device removal and analyzed for: i) average blood glucose, ii) 2 hr postprandial area under the glucose curve, iii) post-meal spikes, and iv) overall glycemic stability. Participants wearing the CGM will be provided a standardized diet (~24 kcal/kg, 60% carbohydrates, 27% fat, 13% protein) to consume during each 24 hr monitoring period. CGM data will be collected at baseline and day 9 of training.</description>

    <measure>Change in Affective and Instrumental Attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, intervention day 6, post-intervention, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Affective attitudes towards physical activity will be assessed using the procedures outlined by Ajzen (2002). Specifically, a 7-point semantic differential scale will be used, with anchors including &quot;Enjoyable-Unenjoyable&quot;, &quot;Pleasant-Unpleasant&quot;, &quot;Interesting-Boring&quot;. Previous research has found support for both the internal consistency and predictive utility of scores derived from this instrument.</description>
