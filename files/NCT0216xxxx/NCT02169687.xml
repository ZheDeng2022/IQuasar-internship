    <textblock>
      Hyperthyroidism is defined by a decrease in thyrotropin (TSH) level associated with elevated&#xD;
      or normal free T4 and T3 (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The most frequent etiology in the&#xD;
      older population is toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter. Several studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that such hyperthyroid status was associated with an increase in cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation) and an increase in cardiovascular mortality. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      the management of patients presenting with subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is indicated in case of large toxic adenomas especially in young patients. In&#xD;
      European countries, radioiodine treatment is indicated in older patients, especially&#xD;
      presenting with cardiothyreosis or when surgery is contraindicated. Radioiodine is a simple,&#xD;
      cost-effective, and safe procedure in the treatment of autonomously hyperfunctioning thyroid&#xD;
      nodule. In a prospective study [Nygaard, 1999], there was a 45% decrease in the total thyroid&#xD;
      volume within 3 months after radio-iodine treatment, and 75% of patients with no previous&#xD;
      anti-thyroid drug treatment normalized for thyroid function within 3 months. In another&#xD;
      recently published prospective study [Endorgan, 2004], there was a decrease in hot nodules&#xD;
      volume assessed by US of 28.8% 3 months, 46.2% 6 months and 54% 12 months after radioiodine&#xD;
      treatment, and 66.7% of patients were euthyroid at 3 months, 71.8% at 6 months, 76.9% at 12&#xD;
      months. The AACE guidelines for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules [Feld, 1996]&#xD;
      recommend that all patients with toxic autonomous thyroid nodules require treatment and&#xD;
      remind that radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice for most patients with toxic&#xD;
      nodules. Nevertheless, at the present time there are no published data that demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of radioiodine treatment on the prevention of cardiac complications in case of&#xD;
      subclinical hyperthyroidism. When radioiodine treatment is proposed, physicians must follow&#xD;
      regulations and policies on 131I in Europe and US. The European Union recently adopted the&#xD;
      main international commission on radiological protection (ICRP) recommendations on radiation&#xD;
      protection. Such regulation may raise a number of practical problems for 131I treated&#xD;
      patients. With the exception of a few countries as Germany and Switzerland, there often is no&#xD;
      legislation defining the maximal dose of radioiodine that can be administered on an&#xD;
      ambulatory basis. Policies and recommendations have been proposed to reduce the radiation&#xD;
      hazards for the public or the family leaving around the radioiodine treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, because of these radioprotection recommendations, and because of contraindication&#xD;
      to surgery and to radioiodine in some cases, an alternative treatment for toxic nodular&#xD;
      nodules, HIFU, may be suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of HIFU treatment for autonomous&#xD;
      hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules. The main objective of the study is to assess the rate of&#xD;
      patients with TSH normalization (or increase). US changes of treated nodules, especially the&#xD;
      nodule volume, will be evaluated.&#xD;
