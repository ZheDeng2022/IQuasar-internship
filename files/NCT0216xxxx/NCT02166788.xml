      BACKGROUND: Spread of metastatic melanoma to the groin lymph nodes (LN) is a common event&#xD;
      affecting about 350 people a year in Australia. Globally it has been shown that patients with&#xD;
      involved groin LN, without proven pelvic LN disease on imaging receive 1 of 3 management&#xD;
      strategies in equal proportions - inguinal lymphadenectomy (IL); ilio-inguinal&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy (I-IL); or variable use of either depending on circumstances. Different&#xD;
      experts have strong and polarised opinions favouring either IL or more extensive I-IL with&#xD;
      existing cases series reporting conflicting data on best cancer outcomes. No high level&#xD;
      evidence proves which operation is best. HYPOTHESIS: There will be no significant difference&#xD;
      in DFS between patients having IL or I-IL, conditional on PET/CT scan showing no evidence of&#xD;
      pelvic disease at the time of diagnosis of groin LN metastatic melanoma. AIMS: To provide a&#xD;
      rational evidence base for management for melanoma to the groin LNs by randomly assessing the&#xD;
      effect of each operation on DFS, distant DFS, overall survival (OS), morbidity - including&#xD;
      early complications and longer-term rates of lymphedema as well as comprehensively assessed&#xD;
      QOL. Also to clarify the reliability of PET/CT scans for staging pelvic LNs and evaluate any&#xD;
      health economic benefits of I-IL over IL. TARGET POPULATION: To recruit 634 patients in 5&#xD;
      years. DESIGN: An Australian led, international, multi-centre, non-inferiority, phase III,&#xD;
      prospective, randomised clinical trial comparing IL or I-IL for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma to groin LNs and no evidence of pelvic disease on PET/CT. ENDPOINTS: DFS, Distant&#xD;
      DFS, OS and QOL at 5 years. Accuracy of PET/CT for pelvic LN metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: International standardization of care, improved cancer outcomes, improved QOL for&#xD;
      patients with groin metastatic melanoma. Proof of principle about extent of surgery when&#xD;
      PET/CT is clear in adjacent LN areas, leading to clinical trials investigating management of&#xD;
      other lymph node fields.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spread of metastatic melanoma to the groin lymph nodes (LN) is a common event for patients&#xD;
      with melanoma. In melanoma treatment centres around the world, patients without demonstrated&#xD;
      pelvic LN disease receive 1 of 3 strategies of management in relatively equal proportions&#xD;
      (Pasquali, Spillane et al. 2012):&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Inguinal Lymphadenectomy (IL) ii. Ilio-inguinal Lymphadenectomy (I-IL) iii. Variable use&#xD;
      of either IL or I-IL surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some larger melanoma centres have an institutional policy that all patients have either IL or&#xD;
      I-IL for metastatic inguinal node involvement. Nearly all centres would agree that patients&#xD;
      with pelvic LN involvement without distant metastatic disease should have I-IL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives This study aims to provide a more rational evidence base for appropriate&#xD;
      management for metastatic melanoma in the groin LNs, through assessing the effect of the&#xD;
      addition of ipsilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy on patient disease-free survival (DFS),&#xD;
      distant disease-free survival (DDFS), overall survival (OS), morbidity, and quality of life.&#xD;
      In addition, the study will clarify the reliability of PET (Positron Emission Tomography) /&#xD;
      CT (Computed Tomography) scans for staging pelvic LNs, clarify morbidity differences between&#xD;
      the operations in a balanced cohort, evaluate any health economic benefits of I-IL over IL&#xD;
      and provide a tissue and serum resource to be used to identify biological markers of&#xD;
      recurrence and progression after inguinal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis There will be no significant difference in DFS between patients having IL or&#xD;
      I-IL, conditional on PET/CT scan showing no evidence of pelvic disease at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis of groin LN metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The aim is to recruit 634 patients in 5 years who are 15 years or older with&#xD;
      cytologically or histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma in inguinal LNs (H&amp;E &amp; IHC);&#xD;
      specifically with no evidence of pelvic node involvement or distant spread of melanoma&#xD;
      clinically or on PET/CT staging scans. To be eligible patients must have an Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2 at randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatments Eligible patients will be randomised 1:1 to undergo an IL or I-IL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is an international, multi-centre, phase III, non-inferiority, prospective,&#xD;
      randomised clinical trial.&#xD;
