      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of a&#xD;
      dice) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better,&#xD;
      the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to&#xD;
      Group 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive varenicline and a placebo patch. A placebo is&#xD;
           not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or&#xD;
           illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has&#xD;
           any real effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive an active nicotine patch and a placebo tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither you nor the study doctor will know which group you are assigned to. However, if&#xD;
      needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving&#xD;
      (called &quot;unblinding&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the study has ended and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) at MD Anderson has&#xD;
      granted approval, you may be unblinded at your request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will start taking your assigned study drug(s) the day after Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should take varenicline/placebo tablets by mouth with a cup (8 ounces) of water after&#xD;
      eating a full meal. On Days 1-3, you will take 1 dose of the study drug each morning.&#xD;
      Starting on Day 4, and then every day after that, you will take 1 dose in the morning and 1&#xD;
      dose in the evening (for a total of 2 doses of the study drug each day). You must return any&#xD;
      study drug bottles as well as any unused study drug to the study staff at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should apply the nicotine/placebo patch to the upper arm. You should put it in a slightly&#xD;
      different place each day to avoid skin irritation. You may take the patch off at night to&#xD;
      avoid sleeping problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a study diary to record how many cigarettes you smoke (if any) each day&#xD;
      while you are on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You must return your study diary and any unused study drugs, patches, and/or containers at&#xD;
      each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits (Visits 1-7):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires about several topics, including depression, suicide,&#xD;
           your smoking behavior, and any effects from the study drug. These questionnaires should&#xD;
           take about 30-45 minutes in total to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be giving the opportunity to complete the questionnaires verbally with a study&#xD;
           staff member (either on phone or in person depending on the visit number) or&#xD;
           electronically on your computer using a website administered by an online survey&#xD;
           development company called Qualtrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive counseling about quitting smoking, where you will talk about possible&#xD;
           &quot;triggers&quot; for smoking and strategies for dealing with quitting smoking. These sessions&#xD;
           will take about 15 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visits 1, 4 and 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine or saliva will be collected for a routine test to check your cotinine, nicotine,&#xD;
           and anabasine levels. Cotinine is a chemical released in your body when it breaks down&#xD;
           nicotine and will show whether and how much you have recently smoked. Anabasine is used&#xD;
           to show if nicotine is found in the blood due to a nicotine replacement therapy or from&#xD;
           tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your CO level and weight. will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you did not have one during screening, you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you did not complete at one during screening or before Visit 1, you will complete the&#xD;
           EEG/lab session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At V1, if your CO machine tests results are unclear, and the study staff thinks it is&#xD;
           appropriate, a NicAlert test will be performed. Urine will be collected for the NicAlert&#xD;
           test, which is more sensitive at detecting levels of smoking than the CO machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During counseling on Day 8, you will set a &quot;quit date&quot; for stopping smoking for about 1 week&#xD;
      after you start taking the study drug/placebo. You should not quit smoking before the quit&#xD;
      date. You may also set goals to reduce smoking. You should try to stay smoke-free after the&#xD;
      quit date. You will also be given a drug instruction sheet, a card with emergency contact&#xD;
      information, and a participant manual to help you follow along with the topics discussed&#xD;
      during counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2, 3, 5 and 7 will be conducted over the phone. You will complete questionnaires about&#xD;
      several topics (either on the phone or electronically), including depression, mood, your&#xD;
      smoking behavior, and any effects from the study drug. You will also be asked about any drugs&#xD;
      you may be taking. Each call should take about 25-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will call you 1 day before your quit date and 3 days after your quit date to&#xD;
      check on your progress in quitting smoking. Each call should take about 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab Session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take part in a lab session at or before Visit 1 to test your brain activity. You&#xD;
      will be asked to watch slides. The slides will include pictures of people, nature, and&#xD;
      artwork. Slides showing nude people, medical procedures, and victims of car crashes will also&#xD;
      be shown. You will be shown examples of these slides before beginning the procedure and given&#xD;
      the opportunity to withdraw from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the lab session, your brain electrical activity will be checked with an&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, small sensors will be placed on your scalp and face.&#xD;
      You should not drink more than 2 cups of coffee or other caffeinated drinks for at least 2Â½&#xD;
      hours before the session. At the lab session, you may be asked to smoke a cigarette if the&#xD;
      doctor thinks it is needed for you to show your normal smoking behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also complete computer tasks, including questionnaires that will measure your&#xD;
      emotions and attention level. These tasks should take about 90 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lab session may last up to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMA are used to gather information about your mood and cravings as they happen in your&#xD;
      day-to-day life. At your randomization visit, you will be loaned a smart phone device, and&#xD;
      will be asked to complete questionnaires on the device at different times everyday throughout&#xD;
      the active treatment phase (12 weeks). In these questionnaires, you will be asked about&#xD;
      events from the previous day, such as cigarettes per day, alcohol intake, mood, sleep,&#xD;
      motivation, and whether you took your prescribed drugs on time. These questionnaires should&#xD;
      take up to about 20 minutes per day to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive the study drug/placebo for up to 12 weeks. You will be taken off study early&#xD;
      if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest or if you are unable to follow study&#xD;
      directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit (Visit 8):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have finished taking the study drug/placebo, the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your CO level will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check your liver and kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine or saliva will be collected to measure your nicotine, anabasine, and cotinine&#xD;
           level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the same questionnaires you completed at the regular study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive counseling about quitting smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits (Visits 9 and 10):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 3 and 6 months after you have stopped smoking, the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your CO level will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine or saliva will be collected to measure your nicotine, anabasine, and cotinine&#xD;
           level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the same questionnaires you completed at the regular study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Varenicline and the nicotine patch are both FDA approved&#xD;
      and commercially available to help people stop smoking. The study doctor can explain how the&#xD;
      study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 160 participants will be enrolled in this portion of the study. All will take part at&#xD;
      MD Anderson.&#xD;
