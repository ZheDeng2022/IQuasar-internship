    <textblock>
      Acute severe disease is a major public health challenge that often affects young adults.In&#xD;
      past decade, there are lot of new techniques have been developed that aim to improve the&#xD;
      outcome of acute severe disease, But few of these works success. According to recently&#xD;
      studies, the mortality of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome（MODS) that is the major&#xD;
      cause of death in patients who suffering from acute severe disease, is not improved. On the&#xD;
      contrary, if MODS be predicted in early stage of acute severe disease, the death can be&#xD;
      prevented. Because acute severe disease poses complex injury that involves multiple&#xD;
      pathological processes, understanding the cellular and metabolic network malfunction during&#xD;
      acute severe disease is crucial for clinical monitoring and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human metabolism is a complex network with hundreds of cross-linked paths. During critical&#xD;
      illness, the metabolic network is dynamically disturbed at multiple points. Classical&#xD;
      research typically isolates a small part of this network to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      pathological physiology molecular mechanisms on clinical outcome. In particular, researchers&#xD;
      have examined metabolic disturbances such as cytokine network dysfunction, skeletal muscle&#xD;
      breakdown, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, testosterone and growth hormone/Insulin like&#xD;
      growth factor （IGF）dysfunctions, low thyroxine syndrome, and deficiency of vitamin D and&#xD;
      calcium with secondary hyperparathyroidism. These complex metabolic disturbances appear and&#xD;
      interact at different stages during the pathological process after acute severe illness.&#xD;
      Therefore, an integrated approach that combines the biochemical/molecular changes with&#xD;
      network disturbances is the key to understanding acute severe illness at the systems biology&#xD;
      level and establishing an accurate quantitative model for clinical monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interdisciplinary method that includes high-throughput quantitative techniques and&#xD;
      effective mathematical and visualization tools is necessary. Furthermore, interdisciplinary&#xD;
      methods present the opportunity to develop innovative clinical diagnosis and monitoring&#xD;
      methods for severe injuries. The aim of this study is to provide a novel high-throughput&#xD;
      method that integrated proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic fingerprinting and&#xD;
      High Performance Liquid Chromatography with advance mathematics tools to modeling metabolic&#xD;
      dynamics after acute severe disease.&#xD;
