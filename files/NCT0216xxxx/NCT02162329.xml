    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to test Tibetan meditation as a therapy to teach cancer&#xD;
      patients to change their brain functioning and to improve quality of life. Researchers want&#xD;
      to compare the cancer patients' outcomes to people who have never had cancer.&#xD;

      Tibetan Meditation Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the meditation program, you will learn several concepts such as focus, visualization,&#xD;
      and sound. You will have up to 16 classes for 8 weeks. They should take about 60 minutes&#xD;
      each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to take part in this study, you will be asked to fill out several&#xD;
      questionnaires. You will be asked questions about your memory and concentration, mood,&#xD;
      fatigue, how you have been feeling, and your general quality of life. The forms should take&#xD;
      about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete some computer tests to check your memory and concentration. For example,&#xD;
      you will be asked to remember a list of words and then be asked to recall them later. These&#xD;
      tests should take about 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then have an electroencephalography (EEG) done. An EEG checks a person's brainwaves.&#xD;
      During the EEG, a snug cap which contains small electrodes will be placed on your head to&#xD;
      measure the electrical patterns coming from the brain. This is like the way a doctor listens&#xD;
      to your heart from the surface of your skin. During recording of the EEG, you will be asked&#xD;
      to complete 3 tests to check your attention, short-term memory, and levels of emotions. For&#xD;
      example, for one test you will use a use a keypad to choose a word's name that is a color&#xD;
      (such as if the word &quot;blue&quot; written in the color red, the correct answer would be red).The&#xD;
      EEG and tests will take about 45 minutes to one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan of your brain. During&#xD;
      the scan, you will lie down on your back with both arms extended by your sides. You will be&#xD;
      fitted with earplugs and/or headphones to help dampen the noise caused by the scanner. The&#xD;
      lights will also be dimmed. You will then lie still until the scan is over. The scan will&#xD;
      take about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests, EEG, and fMRI should take a total of about 90 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tests to measure hormones and your immune system&#xD;
      responses. This should take about 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments will be performed at baseline and after the completion of classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first study visit, you will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study groups. You will&#xD;
      have about a 1 out of 2 chance of being assigned to each group. The groups are randomly&#xD;
      assigned, but it is also based on other factors such as your age and the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the first group will take part in a meditation program. You will take part in&#xD;
      up to 16 meditation classes for a total of 8 weeks. The meditation sessions may take place on&#xD;
      any 2 days of the week at MD Anderson. During the meditation sessions, you will do deep&#xD;
      breathing and visualization exercises and produce some sounds like &quot;Ah.&quot; Each session will&#xD;
      last about 60 minutes. A trained meditation instructor will teach the meditation sessions.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to continue daily meditation practice at home outside of the&#xD;
      classes and will be given a CD to guide home practice. All sessions will be videotaped. This&#xD;
      is so the researchers can keep track of the quality of the sessions. The audio and video&#xD;
      files are digital and will be deleted after all the data are studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the second group will be in a wait-list group. You will continue to receive&#xD;
      the standard of care for cancer patients, but you will not take part in the meditation&#xD;
      program. You will be given the opportunity to take part in the meditation program and similar&#xD;
      measures will be collected from you at similar times as that described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants must agree not to take part in any other meditation programs for as long as&#xD;
      you take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a week after the last meditation session (8 weeks after baseline), all participants&#xD;
      will be asked to fill out a packet of questionnaires (like the ones at the first visit). It&#xD;
      should take about 50 minutes to complete all of the questionnaires. You will have some tests&#xD;
      to check your memory and concentration, similar to the tests you took at your initial visit.&#xD;
      You will have another EEG and fMRI. You will have blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 8 week follow-up, if you were in the meditation group your participation on this&#xD;
      study will be over. If you were in the wait-list group you will be offered the meditation&#xD;
      program and you will complete the same questionnaires as before. You will not have any more&#xD;
      EEG or fMRI measurements or blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive reminder calls for each session and the follow-up study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the treatment group, you will be on study for up to 8 weeks. If you are in the&#xD;
      waitlist group and decide to take meditation classes after the first 8 weeks, you may be on&#xD;
      study for up to 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 140 participants will take part in this study. Up to 10 pilot participants without&#xD;
      cancer will be take part in this study. Up to 40 participants without cancer and up to 80&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
