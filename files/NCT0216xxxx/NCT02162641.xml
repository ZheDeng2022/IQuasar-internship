  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is assess the technical and operational feasibility of a&#xD;
      specialised biopsy technique, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), in patients with anal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SLNB is based on the premise that lymphatic dissemination from a tumour occurs in a stepwise&#xD;
      fashion, with initial involvement of a primary node, called the sentinel node, before&#xD;
      dissemination to the remainder of the lymphatic chain. If the sentinel node is histologically&#xD;
      negative, then the remainder of the nodes in the same anatomic region will be at a lower&#xD;
      (assumed to be minimal) risk of containing metastases. SLNB is part of standard care for&#xD;
      patients with malignant melanoma and with breast cancer but has yet to be prospectively&#xD;
      evaluated in patients with anal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the standard way to treat patients with anal cancer is to deliver a combination of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation to the tumour at the anus together with 'preventative'&#xD;
      (prophylactic) radiotherapy to the lymph glands of the groin and pelvis. There is a growing&#xD;
      perception for the need to reduce the morbidity of radiotherapy i.e. current regimens&#xD;
      over-treat the patient and one approach is to reduce radiotherapy volume and/or dose where&#xD;
      there is an absence or very low risk of nodal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study is a vital first step in informing the design of a larger study&#xD;
      examining the role of SLNB in clinical decision-making and outcomes for patients with anal&#xD;
      cancer. In this trial eligible patients will attend for lymphoscintigraphy, to locate the&#xD;
      lymph node, before sentinel lymph node removal by surgery. Detection rate of the sentinel&#xD;
      node(s) will be the key outcome for the study.&#xD;
