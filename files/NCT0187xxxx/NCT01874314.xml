  <brief_summary>

      This will be a single center, open label, crossover study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of multiple dose levels of SQ109.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, single-center, clinical study of SQ109 to evaluate the&#xD;
      potential for this drug to produce QTc prolongation. The study population is healthy male and&#xD;
      female subjects, aged 18-45 years. Pharmacokinetics of SQ109 will be measured using interval&#xD;
      plasma samples.The overall study design will incorporate within it a four-period&#xD;
      investigation suitable for the QT evaluation of an active study treatment. The primary goal&#xD;
      of the sample size considerations will be to ensure that the sample size employed during this&#xD;
      phase of the study will be adequate to ensure a high likelihood of a successful demonstration&#xD;
      of the QT safety of 300 and 450 mg/day SQ109. All subjects will be randomized to a sequence&#xD;
      of three seven-day dosing periods, with each dosing period occurring once per subject. The&#xD;
      final seven-day dosing period will occur after the first sequence of three dosing periods is&#xD;
      completed. A washout period of at least seven days will occur between all dosing periods, and&#xD;
      a follow-up visit will occur.&#xD;
