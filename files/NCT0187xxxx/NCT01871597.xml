    <textblock>
      Video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) anatomical lung resections (lobectomy or&#xD;
      pneumonectomy) provide an effective minimally invasive treatment for stage 1 lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, a minority of anatomical pulmonary resections are being performed by VATS (15%)&#xD;
      (6). The technical difficulty and danger of VATS lobectomy is related to pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      branch manipulation and this is the main limitation of many thoracic surgeons regarding the&#xD;
      adoption of VATS lobectomy. We believe that if we can decrease the manipulation required by&#xD;
      the surgeon on the pulmonary arterial branch, we can make these procedures safe and therefore&#xD;
      more prevalent for anatomical pulmonary resections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We believe that most of the stress (patient and surgeon) during VATS anatomical lung&#xD;
      resection originates from manipulation of the pulmonary arteries. Endostaplers utilized&#xD;
      during VATS to seal the pulmonary arteries require a lot of space and manipulation of these&#xD;
      fragile vessels. Furthermore, the arteries must be completely dissected from the surrounding&#xD;
      tissues. This increases manipulations of pulmonary arteries during the procedure. Energy&#xD;
      sealing devices require much less space and dissection due to their size and sealing of the&#xD;
      arteries can be performed without complete dissection from the surrounding tissues. Thus, the&#xD;
      utilization of energy sealing devices will decrease excessive manipulations on the pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial branches during VATS anatomical lung resections which can render these procedures&#xD;
      easier and safer. This will not only decrease the stress on the patient, but also on the&#xD;
      surgeon and will hopefully allow more surgeons to adopt these minimally invasive techniques&#xD;
      which have been proven to be superior (length of stay, cost of care, pain, morbidity post-op,&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, quality of life, systemic inflammation, ability to receive adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy) to open thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative techniques will not differ and blood vessel ligation will be performed&#xD;
      according to standard operative procedures either using staplers or direct ligation of the&#xD;
      pulmonary vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After resection and delivery of the resected specimen out of the patient, the specimen will&#xD;
      be examined in vitro out of the operative field in a non-sterile field in the operative room.&#xD;
      The lobar pulmonary artery and its main segmental branches will be dissected. Canulation of a&#xD;
      major segmental branch will be performed using an arterial pressure monitoring catheter. The&#xD;
      canulation will be secured with ligation of 2-0 silk suture. A three way valve will be&#xD;
      attached directly to the arterial catheter. One branch of the three way valve will be&#xD;
      attached to a controlled pressure syringe pump and the other branch will be attached to a&#xD;
      digital manometer. All other segmental branches of the pulmonary artery will be ligated to&#xD;
      maintain the pressure throughout the catheterized segmental branch. Normal 25 mmHg pressure&#xD;
      will be obtained by inflating with normal saline. The lobar pulmonary artery and the main&#xD;
      segmental branches' diameters will be measured using a digital caliper from the adventitia to&#xD;
      the adventitia in the inflated portion with normal saline of pressure 25 mmHg. The lobar&#xD;
      pulmonary artery and the main segmental arteries will be sealed using one of the main energy&#xD;
      seals (Ligasure, Harmonic scalpel, Enseal, Thunderbeat, unipolar or conventional bipolar&#xD;
      cautery or application of metal or Hem-o-lok clips). The sealing will be performed with a&#xD;
      normal 25 mmHg intra-arterial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In bipolar sealing, the arterial wall will be compressed between the energy device jaws until&#xD;
      complete sealing is achieved. The artery will then be divided utilizing fine scissors. In&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial branches sealed with Harmonic scalpel, Thunderbeat and Enseal, the&#xD;
      arterial wall sealed will be divided in the same sealing step. In the Unipolar cautery&#xD;
      arterial sealing, a DeBakey forceps will be utilized to compress the arterial walls together&#xD;
      and then sealing will be performed with direct application of the unipolar cautery to the&#xD;
      forceps. Complete sealing achieved by complete carbonization of the arterial walls. The&#xD;
      artery will be divided with scissors after sealing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After division of the pulmonary artery, normal saline solution will be injected through the&#xD;
      controlled pressure syringe pump to achieve an intraluminal pressure until the bursting&#xD;
      pressure is reached. Intraluminal pressure will be recorded and the bursting pressure will be&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resected specimens will be divided into 8 groups according to the type of sealing&#xD;
      performed; (Ligasure, Harmonic scalpel, Enseal, Thunderbeat, Unipolar and conventional&#xD;
      bipolar cautery, Metal clip, and Hem-o-lok clip)&#xD;
