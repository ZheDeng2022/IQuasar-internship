    <textblock>
      PCR detection of HSV DNA shedding in the female genital tract using the GeneXpert system&#xD;
      (Cepheid, Sunnyvale CA) will be compared with traditional (routine) PCR (pregnant and&#xD;
      nonpregnant women) and with HSV culture (nonpregnant women). The GeneXpert system performs&#xD;
      all sample-processing steps and real-time PCR in a single integrated cartridge. The standard&#xD;
      cartridge is an inexpensive disposable plastic cartridge with filtration and ultrasonic lysis&#xD;
      capabilities. It consists chiefly of several combined molded plastic components: a cartridge&#xD;
      body containing eleven fluid reservoirs or chambers along with an attached PCR tube, a&#xD;
      specialized valve body with an ultrasonic interface containing a sub-micron filter and glass&#xD;
      lysis beads, and a rotary valve with an axial syringe barrel. The operation of the cartridge&#xD;
      is simple. The rotary valve contains an inlet and an outlet port. Fluid such as a sample&#xD;
      buffer can be drawn up into a syringe drive through the inlet port of the rotary valve and&#xD;
      then dispensed into any other chamber within the cartridge by rotating the valve and&#xD;
      expelling the fluid through the outlet port. The fluid can either be passed through a filter&#xD;
      contained within the valve assembly or it can be passed directly into the next chamber&#xD;
      without filtration, depending on the path that is chosen. The cartridge fluidics and&#xD;
      subsequent real-time PCR all are performed within the GeneXpert instrument. The GeneXpert&#xD;
      contains multiple modules (ICORE units) that can be independently programmed to drive the&#xD;
      syringe/rotary valve, and to perform four-color real-time PCR. Each cartridge fits inside one&#xD;
      module, and all processing, PCR, and analysis steps are performed automatically. Each ICORE&#xD;
      module can be run and analyzed independently, so batching of samples is unnecessary.&#xD;

      The GeneXpert HSV PCR test will be validated against HSV viral cultures and routine&#xD;
      quantitative PCR. Validation will occur in two populations: 1) nonpregnant women in STI&#xD;
      clinics with clinically-apparent HSV lesions (Group 1, n=300), and 2) pregnant women in&#xD;
      active labor with no visible evidence of HSV infection (Group 2, n=12,500). All testing of&#xD;
      samples on the GeneXpert platform, routine quantitative PCR, and viral culture will be done&#xD;
      at the UAB Central Laboratory. Women in each group will have specimens obtained from genital&#xD;
      lesions (Group 1) or vaginal swabs (Group 2). Specimens from all women in Group 1 will be&#xD;
      evaluated by HSV culture, routine HSV PCR, and GeneXpert HSV PCR. Approximately half of the&#xD;
      women in Group 2 will be tested by routine HSV PCR and GeneXpert HSV PCR; specimens from the&#xD;
      rest of the women in Group 2 will be stored for possible testing in the future by routine HSV&#xD;
      PCR and GeneXpert HSV PCR. In this manner, we will maximize the data from which to compare&#xD;
      GeneXpert PCR results with routine PCR, while maintaining flexibility to ensure an adequate&#xD;
      number of specimens are positive for HSV DNA by routine PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swabs from pregnant women in labor will be placed in viral transport media, frozen at -20°C,&#xD;
      and batch-shipped to the UAB Central Laboratory for analysis on the GeneXpert instrument and&#xD;
      by routine HSV quantitative PCR. Swabs from nonpregnant women in STI clinics will be placed&#xD;
      in viral transport media, refrigerated at 4°C, and shipped to the UAB Central Laboratory for&#xD;
      real time analysis on the GeneXpert instrument and by HSV culture and routine quantitative&#xD;
      HSV PCR. Specimens from the first 300 women enrolled in Group 2 will be run as individual&#xD;
      routine PCRs and in batches of 5 samples per PCR run. In this manner, we will validate that&#xD;
      the level of detection from batching of samples for routine PCR is acceptable. Once this&#xD;
      validation occurs, specimens from the approximately half of remaining Group 2 women will be&#xD;
      batched for real-time routine PCR analysis. If a batch run of 5 specimens is negative, no&#xD;
      further testing will be performed. If a batch run of 5 specimens is positive, all of the&#xD;
      specimens will be separated out for re-running as individual PCRs. All specimens evaluated by&#xD;
      routine PCR will also be evaluated by GeneXpert PCR; in this manner, we will have individual&#xD;
      routine PCR results results for comparison against GeneXpert PCR results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood specimen will be obtained from each nonpregnant (Group 1) and pregnant (Group 2)&#xD;
      woman at the time of enrollment, and if she is determined to be shedding HSV by routine PCR,&#xD;
      GeneXpert PCR, or culture then type-specific serologic testing will be performed. Correlation&#xD;
      of viral typing from the virologic sampling with HSV-1 and HSV-2 serostatus will allow for&#xD;
      categorization of infection (first-episode primary, first-episode nonprimary, or recurrent&#xD;
      infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those women in Group 1 who have a positive HSV culture will be contacted directly when the&#xD;
      result is known. Women in Group 2 with a positive HSV PCR result will not be contacted&#xD;
      because routine HSV PCR and GeneXpert PCR are not FDA-cleared tests in this population; thus,&#xD;
      we will not know the test performance characteristics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, etc.)&#xD;
      until completion of the trial. All pregnant women in Group 2 will receive written materials&#xD;
      at the time of enrollment educating them on signs and symptoms of neonatal HSV disease. All&#xD;
      postpartum women will be contacted by telephone 60-90 days post-delivery and an inquiry will&#xD;
      be made to determine if their babies developed neonatal HSV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the incidence of neonatal HSV disease among babies delivered to women in Group 2 will&#xD;
      be compared with the incidence data from Brown et al.1 In their study of almost 60,000 women&#xD;
      conducted over a 20 year period, this group of researchers has reported an incidence rate for&#xD;
      neonatal HSV disease of 1 in 3,200 live births.&#xD;
