  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are very sedentary and efforts to&#xD;
      establish an active lifestyle are challenging because of periodic acute exacerbations of COPD&#xD;
      that interrupt physical activity patterns and contribute to further decline in physical&#xD;
      activity. The purpose of this preliminary research is to learn more about the experience of&#xD;
      acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) from the perspective of the patient and his/her family&#xD;
      and to learn how AECOPDs affect physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are very sedentary and their&#xD;
      physical activity is often interrupted by acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). Little is&#xD;
      known about the expectations had by individuals with COPD and the effects of these&#xD;
      expectations on their physical activity. To increase the understanding of these expectations&#xD;
      in people with COPD, a study is proposed to explore their experience of daily fluctuations in&#xD;
      symptoms and AECOPDs, focusing on how these experiences influence health promoting behaviors,&#xD;
      especially physical activity (PA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve an enrollment visit during which consent will be obtained, survey&#xD;
      data will be administered (that they may take home), spirometry testing will be conducted,&#xD;
      and a physical activity monitor (ActivPAL device) will be applied to be worn one week to&#xD;
      allow us to understand their usual PA. A clinical ethnographic interview will then be&#xD;
      conducted one week following enrollment, at which point the questionnaires and ActivPAL&#xD;
      device will be collected. A second clinical ethnographic interview will be conducted one week&#xD;
      following the first. Survey data will again collected at week 15 by mail.&#xD;
