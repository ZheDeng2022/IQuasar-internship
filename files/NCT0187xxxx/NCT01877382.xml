  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label study of milademetan to assess its safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/tentative recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D), and assess its pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PDy) properties in participants&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 5 US sites are planned for Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose&#xD;
      Expansion). The same sites are planned to participate for both parts.&#xD;
