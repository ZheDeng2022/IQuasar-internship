  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory Phase 1 randomized, double-blind (Investigator and study subject&#xD;
      and 2-D echo endpoint assessor), placebo-controlled single IV infusion dose escalation study&#xD;
      that will enroll up to approximately 32 subjects with stage 1 or 2 essential hypertension.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: For the initial evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetic exposure and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      response, subjects will be tapered off antihypertensive background therapy.The initial&#xD;
      starting dose will be a sub-therapeutic dose. Dose escalation will continue with a maximum of&#xD;
      a doubling of the previous dose until either 1) a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identified&#xD;
      or 2) modeling of the pharmacokinetic (PK) data indicate that maximum exposure (Cmax) at the&#xD;
      next planned dose level would exceed a maximum drug concentration (Cmax) which was the&#xD;
      maximum observed drug concentration following a single subcutaneous administration in Study&#xD;
      PB1046-PT-CL-0001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: The dose group which is capable of providing a Cmax exposure which is capable of&#xD;
      eliciting a clinically relevant hemodynamic response, will be expanded to enroll an&#xD;
      additional 12 subjects (6 active and 6 placebo).&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
