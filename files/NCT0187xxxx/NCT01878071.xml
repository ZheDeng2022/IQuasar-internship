  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on the link between oral and systemic&#xD;
      health. Obesity, a growing medical problem worldwide, has been associated with multiple&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. With&#xD;
      respect to the effect of obesity on periodontal health, it has been shown that obese subjects&#xD;
      exhibit higher inflammation around natural teeth and are at increased risk of tooth loss than&#xD;
      individuals with normal weight. Peri-implantitis, an inflammatory condition of bacterial&#xD;
      origin that occurs around oral implants and resembles periodontal disease, has become a&#xD;
      serious concern for the dental profession given its increasing prevalence and challenging&#xD;
      treatment. There is also strong evidence that individuals with a history of periodontitis are&#xD;
      also at risk for peri-implantitis. However, knowledge about the pathogenesis and treatment of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis is scarce. Hence, it is extremely important to understand the implications&#xD;
      of excessive body fat on peri-implant health. Based on the current understanding on the&#xD;
      effect of obesity on systemic and local inflammation around natural teeth, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that obesity will have a significant impact on peri-implant health by inducing an&#xD;
      increased inflammatory response as measured by clinical as well as molecular markers of&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
