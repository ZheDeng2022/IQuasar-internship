  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable and fatal disorder characterised by progressive&#xD;
      degeneration of the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex. Contrary to earlier thinking, HD&#xD;
      is associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues which might even contribute to brain&#xD;
      pathology including muscle wasting, mitochondrial abnormalities, and impaired muscle energy&#xD;
      metabolism. Mitochondrial impairment and muscle atrophy in human HD patients and murine&#xD;
      models of HD are associated with altered expression of PGC-1a, a transcriptional cofactor&#xD;
      that seems to regulate many, if not all of the adaptations of muscle fibres to chronic&#xD;
      endurance training, and induces improved exercise performance and increased peak oxygen&#xD;
      uptake. We aim at investigating whether endurance exercise has the capability of stabilizing&#xD;
      and / or reversing PGC-1a dependent alterations of muscle function and structure in HD&#xD;
      patients, and whether muscle training ameliorates musculoskeletal and cardiovascular&#xD;
      function, as well as motor and cognitive symptoms in HD patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Huntington disease (HD) is an incurable and fatal disorder that affects muscle function and&#xD;
      leads to cognitive decline and dementia. HD was long considered a brain disorder but&#xD;
      meanwhile it was shown that HD also affects other tissues such as muscle, leading to muscle&#xD;
      wasting. Previous studies suggested that the muscle disorder might be caused by an impaired&#xD;
      energy metabolism through mitochondrial dysfunction, which also might also contribute to&#xD;
      brain pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In muscle tissue of healthy persons, a protein named PGC 1- α seems to regulate many, if not&#xD;
      all of the adaptations of muscle metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis to chronic endurance&#xD;
      training. It was shown that PGC 1- α is reduced in muscle tissue of human HD patients and&#xD;
      animal models of HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim investigating whether endurance exercise has the capability of stabilizing and / or&#xD;
      reversing PGC-1α dependent decline of muscle function and structure in HD patients, and&#xD;
      whether muscle training ameliorates muscular and cardiovascular function, as well as&#xD;
      coordination and cognitive decline in HD. To this end, we will train 20 male HD patients&#xD;
      using a 6 months progressive endurance exercise program. In order to compare the size effect&#xD;
      of exercise between HD patients and healthy individuals, 20 age-matched healthy males will&#xD;
      perform the identical exercise regimen as HD patients. Within one week before the training&#xD;
      period starts and within one week after it has ended, we will assess metabolic and functional&#xD;
      data. In addition, we will analyze muscle tissue samples for muscle fiber structure,&#xD;
      metabolic phenotype and cellular pathology. Finally, gene and protein expression analyses&#xD;
      will be performed on muscle tissue extracts to gain insights into the molecular regulation of&#xD;
      training adaptations in HD.&#xD;
