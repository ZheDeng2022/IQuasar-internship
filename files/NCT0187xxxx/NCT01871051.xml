      This project was aimed to identify the risk factors associated with the occurrence of&#xD;
      respiratory complications in post anesthesia care unit. The primary outcome was the composite&#xD;
      measure of occurrence of complications in PACU. The components were apnea or hypopnea,&#xD;
      laryngospasm, bronchospasm and prolonged oxygen requirement.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective project. Data will be used from Quality Improvement database for&#xD;
      publication purpose. Data was collected from a prospectively collected database that was done&#xD;
      as a Quality Improvement Project. The study sites included post anesthesia care units (PACU)&#xD;
      of the main and ambulatory campuses of our hospital. The data was collected from surgical and&#xD;
      radiology PACU's. Data was collected each quarter for 2 weeks in the surgical PACU, and for 1&#xD;
      month in Radiology PACU, from Sep 2007 through Mar 2012. Trained perioperative nurses and&#xD;
      Certified Registered Nurse Anesthesiologist did data collection. This ensured a sample&#xD;
      representative of at least 10% of patients anesthetized for surgical and radiological&#xD;
      procedures. The independent variables (risk factors) collected included age, American Society&#xD;
      of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status, obesity, preexisting airway or lung disease,&#xD;
      preexisting neuromuscular disease or hypotonia, morbid obesity, intraoperative bronchospasm&#xD;
      and intraoperative laryngospasm. The primary outcome variables collected were Apnea or&#xD;
      hypopnea, Laryngospasm, Bronchospasm, and prolonged Oxygen requirement. Apnea or hypopnea was&#xD;
      defined by the need for bag mask ventilation, Laryngospasm by the requirement of a positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation of &gt; 20 cmH2O or administration of succinylcholine, Bronchospasm by use&#xD;
      of albuterol, and Oxygen requirement by continued oxygen administration to maintain SpO2&gt;92%&#xD;
      for 2 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
