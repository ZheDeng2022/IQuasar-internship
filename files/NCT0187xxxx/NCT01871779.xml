      Cardiovascular disease remain one of the leading causes of death in Australia, accounting for&#xD;
      47637 (36%) of deaths in 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a category of cardiovascular disease, characterised by&#xD;
      intermittent claudication. This is defined as walking induced pain, cramping, aching,&#xD;
      tiredness or heaviness in one or both legs that does not go away with continued walking and&#xD;
      is relieved with rest. It is estimated that between 5-10% of individuals aged over 50 years&#xD;
      suffer from claudication. The primary and most effective treatment for these patients is&#xD;
      focused on improving walking ability and functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research has shown that approximately 30% of patients improve with exercise, while&#xD;
      30% continue to deteriorate and the rest show no change. The changes produced at a&#xD;
      biochemical and cellular level due to exercise are unknown. To help better understand this,&#xD;
      our study will assess the entire range of proteins expressed before and after exercise in the&#xD;
      skeletal muscle tissue of patients with intermittent claudication. This will help to&#xD;
      identifying key proteins that have a role in improving patient symptoms and outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Why is this clinical problem important?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a major health problem in Australia, with a prevalence&#xD;
      of 15% in males aged over 65 years. The direct health care cost of PAD in Australia was $180m&#xD;
      in 1994, of which 78% was associated with hospitalisations. PAD is also a marker for advanced&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) involving coronary, cerebral, renal and aortic vessels; with a&#xD;
      2-3 fold increased risk of CVD-related mortality. In 2006-2007, 25,813 hospitalizations and&#xD;
      2,163 deaths were a result of PAD (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2009). The&#xD;
      ageing Australian population and the prevalence of PAD increases (Australian Institute of&#xD;
      Health and Welfare 2009), the national annual health expenditure on cardiovascular disease is&#xD;
      likely to increase, greatly exceeding the 5.4 billion dollars spent in 2000-01 (Australian&#xD;
      Bureau of Statistics 2006). The most frequent symptom of mild to moderate PAD is intermittent&#xD;
      claudication (IC), defined as walking-induced pain and cramping in one or both legs (most&#xD;
      often calves) that is relieved with rest. The primary and most effective treatment for people&#xD;
      with intermittent claudication is focused on improving walking ability and functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is already known about the effect of exercise in intermittent claudication?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beneficial effects of exercise training as a treatment have been confirmed in several&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials. The optimum form of exercise still hasn't been elucidated. The&#xD;
      mechanisms of improvement of claudication with exercise are largely unknown. Although&#xD;
      exercise stimulates an ischaemic-reperfusion (I-R) insult, repetitive exercise may produce an&#xD;
      adaptive response to this I-R insult. Other potential themes include effect of exercise on&#xD;
      stimulating or inhibiting angiogenesis and/or muscle protein synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the principal cause of IC is reduced blood flow to the lower limbs relative to&#xD;
      increased demand during exercise, the pathophysiology of IC is not completely understood. For&#xD;
      example, limb haemodynamics does not closely correlate with clinical presentation or the&#xD;
      limitations in peak exercise performance. Haemodynamic measures of the severity of PAD, such&#xD;
      as the ankle-brachial systolic blood pressure index (ABI) and blood flow by strain gauge&#xD;
      plethysmography, are poor predictors of exercise capacity in patients with IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional studies indicate that inflammation is associated with the presence,&#xD;
      progression and severity of PAD. This may explain the excess cardiovascular mortality, (at&#xD;
      least 50% at 10 years), seen in these patients. The effect of exercise on claudication has&#xD;
      been most studied with inflammatory markers in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the importance of measuring protein expression in muscle tissue?&#xD;
&#xD;
      While peripheral blood bio-markers help in understanding the systemic manifestations of&#xD;
      claudication, it does not reflect what is happening in the muscles and microcirculation. Most&#xD;
      of the changes in protein expression are too subtle to be detected in peripheral blood. The&#xD;
      ease of acquisition does not correspond to ease of interrogation. The dynamic range of&#xD;
      proteins in serum makes analysis very challenging because high abundance proteins tend to&#xD;
      mask those of lower abundance; whilst a small number of proteins including albumin, Beta&#xD;
      2-macroglobulin, transferrin, and immunoglobulins may represent over 90% of serum proteins11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protein complement of a cell or tissue is dynamic and reflects the age, life-cycle, and&#xD;
      conditions the cell is subjected to or a specific disease state. It is clear that in most&#xD;
      diseases, proteins are subjected to numerous changes including post-translational&#xD;
      modifications and/or proteolytic cleavage; equally in certain diseases, there is alteration&#xD;
      of protein expression. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is the molecule encoding the&#xD;
      chemical blueprint for a protein. Yet the micro arrays examining differential expression of&#xD;
      mRNA will not provide information on post-translational modification, therefore the only way&#xD;
      to assess the impact of the proteins is at the protein level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have investigated the difference in histochemical and biochemical&#xD;
      characteristics of skeletal muscle between patients with PAD and healthy age-matched&#xD;
      subjects. Most of the studies into muscle biopsy from patients with PAD have demonstrated&#xD;
      alterations in muscle fibre type distribution, denervation and alterations in muscle&#xD;
      metabolism with no insight into protein expression12, 13, 14. There is considerable evidence&#xD;
      that the metabolic status of skeletal muscle is perturbed in patients with PAD as compared&#xD;
      with age-matched healthy controls. Amongst the earliest observations was the unexpected&#xD;
      finding that the expression and activity of several mitochondrial enzymes are increased in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle from limbs with PAD. The skeletal muscles in patients with IC, do change with&#xD;
      exercise but the current evidence does not shed light on the mechanisms of change or if the&#xD;
      change is the same in all patients. We do already know that some patients improve with&#xD;
      exercise while others do not. A question thus arises as to whether there exists a&#xD;
      bio-diversity in these patients' response to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Armstrong et al studied disturbances in calcium homeostasis of skeletal muscle and suggested&#xD;
      that they might play a key role in the development of exercise-induced muscle damage. Some of&#xD;
      the immediate muscle changes after exercise have been attributed to protein degradation is&#xD;
      initiated by non-lysosomal cysteine proteases, such as calpain. The elevation in&#xD;
      intracellular calcium post-exercise can activate the calpains. Muscle tissue expresses three&#xD;
      distinct calpains, including the well-characterized ubiquitous calpains - m- calpain,&#xD;
      Î¼-calpain and n-calpain. Wang et al have concluded, in animal studies, that the increased&#xD;
      levels of the protease m-calpain, promotes muscle injury whereas the calpastatin protein&#xD;
      expression might execute a protective function for muscle injury. This has not yet been&#xD;
      investigated in human studies. It can be hypothesised that the levels of calpastatin and&#xD;
      m-calpain are important in explaining the variable response to exercise in IC and why some&#xD;
      patients improve and others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some conflicting evidence on the benefit of exercise. Tsai et al have found that the&#xD;
      normal training effect on the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) gene expression was completely&#xD;
      eliminated by both acute and chronic ischemia at the pre-translational level. In addition,&#xD;
      the chronic ischemia-induced muscle atrophy was seen to be more severe in the&#xD;
      exercise-trained rats than in the untrained rats. This result suggests that for individuals&#xD;
      with impaired microvascular conditions, exercise training might not be beneficial in&#xD;
      maintaining muscle mass. Thus the effect of exercise training in human subjects with IC&#xD;
      (ischaemia) is yet to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that all subjects differ in their capacity for exercise and patients with&#xD;
      intermittent claudication are no different. Patients undergoing exercise for intermittent&#xD;
      claudication, would be different in terms of their expression of proteins due to exercise.&#xD;
      For this reason, patients would act as their own controls by means of a biopsy from an&#xD;
      unaffected muscle of each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open ended mass spectroscopy examination of proteins in the exercising skeletal muscle&#xD;
      would give an insight into the mechanistic pathway of the exercise effect in intermittent&#xD;
      claudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the relation between protein expression and inflammation in the exercise with&#xD;
      intermittent claudication?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical model of exercise inducing an ischaemia-reperfusion type injury has been&#xD;
      substantiated by evidence of markers of inflammation. Neutrophils are the first cells to&#xD;
      begin accumulating in the tissue at the injury site, destroying necrotic tissue through&#xD;
      phagocytosis while working in conjunction with resident macrophages from the muscle tissue&#xD;
      itself. Neutrophil presence has been documented in muscle after various types of eccentric&#xD;
      exercise. A study looking at neutrophil function in exercising claudicants showed increased&#xD;
      neutrophil activation manifest by increased expression of the neutrophil adhesion receptor&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation antigen IIb (CD11b) and degranulation manifest by an increase in&#xD;
      plasma neutrophil elastase. This occurred immediately after exercise in these patients with&#xD;
      intermittent claudication. Whether this equates to a trend to predict outcomes is still not&#xD;
      clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protease m-Calpain is chemotactic factor for neutrophils and may play a role in the local&#xD;
      and systemic inflammatory response. Such adaptations in cellular inflammatory responses have&#xD;
      been reported earlier by Kunimatsu et al. Together with Calpastatin, these proteins may hold&#xD;
      a key in the link between local muscle damage, repair and inducing a systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical modification of proteins may play a role in the pathogenesis of disorders ranging&#xD;
      from diabetes to atherosclerosis and ischemia-reperfusion injury and perhaps to the aging&#xD;
      process itself. Advanced Glycosylation End products (AGEs) are the end products of&#xD;
      glycosylation reactions in which a sugar molecule bonds to either a protein or lipid molecule&#xD;
      without an enzyme to control the reaction. The formation and accumulation of AGEs has been&#xD;
      implicated in the progression of age related disease, in particular cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      They have a range of pathological effects, including inhibition of vascular dilatation by&#xD;
      interfering with nitric oxide (Endothelium Derived Relaxation factor), binding macrophage and&#xD;
      endothelial cells to induce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and enhancing oxidative&#xD;
      stress. We hypothesise that exercise stimulates glucose uptake by the endothelial cells&#xD;
      increasing the synthesis of AGE's. It remains to be determined whether exercise again&#xD;
      enhances or reduces this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine inflammatory biomarkers, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6),&#xD;
      Neutrophil elastase and Advanced Glycated End-products with proteins known to influence&#xD;
      tissue damage or repair (Calpains and Calpastatin) to determine the effect of different forms&#xD;
      of exercise on this process, in order to determine&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is exercise appropriate for all patients? i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Do all patients respond with a pro inflammatory response? and&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Does exercise produce an adaptive response to this in all patients? or&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Does exercise stimulate an I-R insult in some patients that is not reduced by&#xD;
                exercise training?&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. What is the local tissue response to exercise in terms of tissue damage or repair&#xD;
                (as measured by protein analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the best form of exercise for these suitable patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there a biodiversity in patients' response to exercise in terms of&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Systemic inflammatory response (based on IL-6, Neutrophil Elastase &amp; AGE's)?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Local response (based on protein analysis)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does the physiological response to exercise in these patients reduce the risk of CVD&#xD;
           related morbidity/mortality?&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. As evidenced by changes in cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) outcome parameters&#xD;
           and endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is impaired endothelial function reversible? a. As measured by flow-mediated dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined use of data from systemic blood and local muscle tissue would help to&#xD;
      characterise the metabolic and functional consequences of age associated PAD changes in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle. It would also help to identify a mechanistic pathway by which exercise&#xD;
      exerts its effect on the patient with intermittent claudication.&#xD;
