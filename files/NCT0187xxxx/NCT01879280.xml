  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific objectives of this study are to systematically study the problems that are&#xD;
      created by incising the attachment of the temporalis muscle in a randomized group of&#xD;
      patients, and to determine whether another approach that does not detach the temporalis&#xD;
      muscle results in less post-operative morbidity. Cutting through the attachment of the&#xD;
      temporalis muscle to the skull is a widely-accepted procedure used to gain access to the&#xD;
      skull prior to the drilling used for a pterional craniotomy (one of the most frequent types&#xD;
      of surgeries used in neurosurgical practice). Despite the frequent use of this maneuver and&#xD;
      the known sequelae of temporalis mobilization (e.g. post-operative myofascial pain,&#xD;
      temporalis weakness, and pain with mastication), very little is known about the true&#xD;
      incidence of these post-operative symptoms. Furthermore, there is very little objective&#xD;
      evidence at the present time to support the claim that the incidence and severity of these&#xD;
      post-operative phenomena can be decreased with use of an osteoplastic craniotomy (a procedure&#xD;
      where the temporalis is left attached to the bony calvarium). The investigators would like to&#xD;
      evaluate whether this slightly more time-consuming and technically demanding approach is less&#xD;
      morbid in this respect than the contemporary pterional approach. Special note is made that&#xD;
      the osteoplastic approach has been used in standard neurosurgical practice for quite some&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In contemporary neurosurgery, when performing a pterional craniotomy, neurosurgeons have been&#xD;
      taught to cut through and detach the temporalis before drilling the skull to &quot;turn a bone&#xD;
      flap&quot;. While there are ways to turn a bone flap with the temporalis still attached (i.e., an&#xD;
      &quot;osteoplastic craniotomy&quot;), this is thought to be slightly more time-consuming and is used&#xD;
      less often in many centers. Additionally, there is a common misconception that osteoplastic&#xD;
      craniotomy does not allow an equivalent view, although recent evidence suggests that the&#xD;
      surgical exposure in the two approaches is no different. Aside from the extra time involved,&#xD;
      we do not feel that leaving the temporalis attached to the bony calvarium disadvantages the&#xD;
      patient in any fashion (and-in fact-may result in less post-operative morbidity). We are&#xD;
      interested in this project because there is actually very little objective data regarding the&#xD;
      morbidity people experience when the temporalis muscle is cut and mobilized prior to drilling&#xD;
      the skull. If, in this study, we find that the group randomized to traditional pterional&#xD;
      craniotomy experiences significantly more morbidity than the group randomized to osteoplastic&#xD;
      craniotomy, this may justify conversion to an osteoplastic craniotomy in many or all&#xD;
      instances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to quantify the morbidity that is associated with the specific methods used to detach&#xD;
      the temporalis muscle from the skull. Many variables regarding the way the temporalis is&#xD;
      detached will be recorded and assessed in the group randomized to traditional pterional&#xD;
      craniotomy. Additionally, many methods will be used to measure post-operative temporalis&#xD;
      atrophy and/or dysfunction in the two randomized groups. After post-operative morbidity has&#xD;
      been quantified, we plan to compare the traditional pterional group to the osteoplastic group&#xD;
      and assess for significance.&#xD;
