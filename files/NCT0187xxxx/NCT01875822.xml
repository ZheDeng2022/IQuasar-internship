    <textblock>
      Current evidence suggests that schizophrenia as a serious and complex psychiatric disorder,&#xD;
      continues to challenge mental health professionals in their search for better treatment&#xD;
      options in the community. In the present study, the investigators hypothesized that in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed as schizophrenia, adjunct treatment with Curry extract from the plant&#xD;
      labeled by botanists as Curcuma Longata, formulated as Super-Curcumin@ , would bring about&#xD;
      :1)positive behavioral changes in areas of socialization, emotional well-being, verbal&#xD;
      communication and motivation; 2)improvement in measures of memory. Throughout the study, the&#xD;
      proprietary product, Super-Curcumin@ consisting of Curcumin C-3 complex combined with the&#xD;
      black pepper extract Bioperine to boost the effects of Curcumin. The study was developed to&#xD;
      examine whether Curcumin's interaction with the two major signal pathways in the brain&#xD;
      regulating brain-behavior: the epigenetic signal (histone modification) and the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory signal (inducible nitric oxide synthetase)in preclinical models is&#xD;
      translated to beneficial effects in the treatment of schizophrenia.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: The overall objective of the study was to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      standardized proprietary formulation of curcumin [Super Curcumin@ :C-3 Complex@ with&#xD;
      Bioperine@) manufactured by American Finest Inc. NJ USA ] extracted from the curry plant&#xD;
      (Curcuma Longata) , can improve the negative symptoms and cognitive impairments in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed as schizophrenia and to determine the response rate in negative symptoms at 16&#xD;
      weeks. Response rate was defined as the positive change of minimum 30% or higher from&#xD;
      baseline to the score measured at 16 weeks. Negative symptoms refer to the cluster of&#xD;
      symptoms of apathy, alogia, blunted affect and lack of motivation affecting severely the ways&#xD;
      the individual functions in the community at large. In the study, the investigators proposed&#xD;
      to test the hypothesize that Super curcumin@ is efficacious and safe when combined with&#xD;
      standard antipsychotic drugs in the cohort of patients diagnosed as schizophrenia. Throughout&#xD;
      the study, the proprietary product(Super curcumin@) was used. Supercurcumin@ consisted of the&#xD;
      primary medicinally active ingredient, Curcumin C-3 Complex, in combination with Bioperine@,&#xD;
      the metabolic enhancer extracted from black pepper, in order to increase the systemic&#xD;
      bioavailability of curcumin C-3 complex. For the oral formulation of Super- curcumin@: 1&#xD;
      gm-capsule has 1 gm of curcumin C-3 complex and 5 mg of Bioperine@ . The study protocol&#xD;
      consisted of recruiting subjects with diagnosed as schizophrenia who would be receiving&#xD;
      either 1 gm or 4 gm of Super-Curcumin@ given orally once daily for 16 weeks, on negative&#xD;
      symptoms and cognition. For assessing the safety and tolerability of Supercurcumin@ , the&#xD;
      study protocol required that the patients would be monitored regularly for vital signs:blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse,body weight, routine blood chemistry and comprehensive adverse events profile&#xD;
      (Treatment Emergent Adverse Events checklist) including the AIMS (Abnormal Involuntary&#xD;
      Movement Scale). At baseline and at regular intervals throughout the 16-week treatment&#xD;
      period, standardized measures of negative and positive symptoms and neurocognition would be&#xD;
      administered to examine the efficacy of Curcumin C-3 complex in schizophrenia. For analysing&#xD;
      the results, within-subject pre- and post-treatment responses would be subject to statistical&#xD;
      procedures to evaluate whether Super-Curcumin@ can ameliorate the persistent negative&#xD;
      symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.&#xD;
