  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preparation of patients for discharge is a primary function of hospital-based nursing care&#xD;
      and readiness for discharge is an important outcome of hospital care. Inadequacies in&#xD;
      discharge preparation have been well-documented and linked to difficulty with self-management&#xD;
      after hospital discharge and with increased likelihood of emergency department (ED) use and&#xD;
      readmission. Prior studies by the research team have led to recommendations for&#xD;
      implementation of discharge readiness assessment as a standard nursing practice for hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a multi-site study to determine the impact on post-discharge&#xD;
      utilization (readmission and ED visits) and costs of implementing discharge readiness&#xD;
      assessment as a standard nursing practice for adult medical-surgical patients discharged to&#xD;
      home. The study tests, in a stepped approach, the impact of implementing discharge readiness&#xD;
      assessment by the discharging nurse as standard nursing practice (RN-RHDS protocol), the&#xD;
      incremental value of informing the nurse assessment with the patient's perspective&#xD;
      (RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS protocol), and of requiring that the nurse initiates and documents&#xD;
      risk-mitigating actions for patients with low readiness scores (RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS+NIAF&#xD;
      protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS 1: Patients discharged using the RN-RHDS protocol will have fewer hospital&#xD;
      readmissions and ED visits within 30 days post-discharge compared to patients discharged&#xD;
      under usual care conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS 2: Patients discharged using the RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS protocol will have fewer hospital&#xD;
      readmissions and ED visits within 30 days post-discharge compared to patients discharged&#xD;
      using the RN-RHDS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS 3: Patients discharged by nurses using the RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS protocol plus a&#xD;
      Nurse-Initiated Action Form [NIAF] (RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS+NIAF protocol) will have fewer&#xD;
      post-discharge readmissions and ED visits than patients discharged using the RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS&#xD;
      protocol; the effect will be strongest for patients with low RHDS scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Conduct cost-benefit analysis of implementing discharge readiness assessment as&#xD;
      standard practice, by comparing cost-savings from reduced post-discharge utilization against&#xD;
      implementation costs.&#xD;
