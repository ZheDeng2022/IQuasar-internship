    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Small differences in genes may alter responses to drugs. One gene that has different forms&#xD;
      is the mu opioid receptor gene. People with one form of this gene are more sensitive to&#xD;
      alcohol. People with a different form are sometimes more sensitive to pain. Morphine and&#xD;
      other prescription pain pills produce pain relief by acting at the mu opioid receptor.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see the effect of morphine on brain reward and subjective effects.&#xD;
      Morphine is a strong but short-acting pain medication that is sometimes used for anesthesia&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the effect of morphine on brain measures of dopamine release using imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 21 and 55 years of age who have previously taken pain pills prescribed&#xD;
      to treat pain from a medical or dental procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study has a screening phase and a study phase. The screening phase involves one or&#xD;
           two visits of 5 to 6 hours. The study phase consists of 4 study visits. Each study visit&#xD;
           will take about 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric history and physical exam.&#xD;
           They will be asked about drinking and drug-taking history, and any family history of&#xD;
           alcoholism or drug abuse. Blood, urine, and breath samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first study visit, an MRI scan may be performed, questionnaires completed,&#xD;
           and a blood sample collected for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During study visit 2, participants will test their pain sensitivity by placing one hand&#xD;
           in cold water. Pupil diameter will be measured after the sensitivity test. After a blood&#xD;
           sample is taken, participants will receive the morphine or a salt solution. The&#xD;
           sensitivity test and pupil diameter test will be repeated. Final blood samples will be&#xD;
           collected. A brief physical exam will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During study visits 3 and 4, participants will receive morphine or a salt solution&#xD;
           during a PET scan. Questionnaires to assess subjective effects will be administered.&#xD;
           Final blood samples will be collected. A brief physical exam will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will stay in the clinic until the effects of the drug have worn off after&#xD;
           study visits 2, 3, and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 1 week after the study session, participants will have a follow-up phone call.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) release is a key signal for drug reward, and endogenous opioids are&#xD;
      thought to exert their effects in part by modulating the activity of this system. A&#xD;
      functional Âµ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been&#xD;
      associated with increased risk for heroin addiction in some studies. This polymorphism has&#xD;
      been shown to confer differential pain sensitivity and to alter the release of DA following&#xD;
      an alcohol challenge. The objective of this study is to examine the role of the A118G OPRM1&#xD;
      polymorphism for responses to a challenge of an opiate (morphine) with regard to&#xD;
      psycho-physiological variables measured in the laboratory and for brain dopamine release&#xD;
      measured by [11C]raclopride PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy male participants who have had experience with oral prescription analgesics (e.g.,&#xD;
      Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet, oxycodone) will be recruited for the study. These volunteers&#xD;
      will be screened to obtain samples of two groups of subjects: 1) persons homozygous for the&#xD;
      major 118A allele (118AA genotype); 2) persons carrying one or two copies of the variant 118G&#xD;
      allele (118AG or 118GG genotype, hereafter called 118GX). We will recruit up to 120&#xD;
      participants to obtain 40 completers per genotype for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the response of these groups to a challenge with morphine given&#xD;
      intravenously. Participants will receive a standardized IV challenge of morphine (10.0 mg/70&#xD;
      kg over 1 minute; morphine concentration 2 mg/ml). Pre and post injection measures will be&#xD;
      made in two areas: 1) subjective response as measured by standardized questionnaires, and 2)&#xD;
      measures of physiological response, including pupil response to light, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and a pain rating from putting a hand in cold water and blood chemistries.&#xD;
      In addition, during this visit, participants will wear the AutoSense mobile physiological&#xD;
      monitor; parameters measured by AutoSense include respiration rate, heart rate, heart-rate&#xD;
      variability, skin conductance, and activity level. The injection will be repeated in all&#xD;
      participants in the PET scanner, once with morphine and once with normal saline. Dopamine&#xD;
      release will be assessed by determining the difference between the binding potential for&#xD;
      [11C]raclopride, a positron emitter labeled ligand which binds preferentially to D2 receptors&#xD;
      during saline administration and its binding potential during morphine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that 118GX subjects will have significantly different subjective response to&#xD;
      the challenge than 118AA subjects as observed in participants receiving alcohol in a similar&#xD;
      study (Ramchandani et al. 2011). However, the genotype effect on the response may be opposite&#xD;
      from the effect of genotype on the alcohol response. We also hypothesize that the PET studies&#xD;
      with [11C]raclopride will show that 118GX subjects have less dopamine release during morphine&#xD;
      administration than 118 AA subjects.&#xD;

    <measure>11C Raclopride Binding Potential in Caudate</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes following injection</time_frame>
    <description>Binding potential measured using regions-of-interest analysis of PET data. Parametric Binding Potential (BPND) images were obtained using the Simple Reference Tissue Model 2 (SRTM2), with cerebellum as the reference region. BPND is computed in units of mCi/ml reflecting the radioactivity (milliCuries or mCi) per unit volume (milliliters or ml) in specific brain regions. Reduction in raclopride binding is attributed to competition with endogenous dopamine, and has been shown to be proportional to the magnitude of Dopamine (DA) release.</description>

             respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, or reproductive disorders,&#xD;
             or a positive hepatitis or HIV test at screening, disorders that could make&#xD;
             administration of an opiate more risky (e.g., asthma, COPD, sleep apnea, or other&#xD;
             breathing disorders; liver or kidney disease; thyroid disorder; trouble swallowing, or&#xD;
             a blockage in the digestive tract (stomach or intestines); neurologic disorders (e.g.,&#xD;
             a history of head injury or brain tumor, epilepsy or other seizure disorder, CVA,&#xD;
             migraine in treatment, etc.); low blood pressure; hypertension; neuromuscular&#xD;

                  prescription or OTC medications known to interact with dopamine receptors within&#xD;
                  2 weeks of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Drugs known to inhibit or induce enzymes that metabolize opiates should not be&#xD;
                  used for 4 weeks prior to the study. These include chlorzoxazone, isoniazid,&#xD;
                  metronidazole and disulfiram.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Cough-and-cold preparations that contain anti-histamines or opiate pain medicines&#xD;
                  will be withheld for at least 72 hours prior to each study session.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Drugs that may interfere with the BOLD MRI signal within 2 weeks of the study.&#xD;
                  These include, but may not be limited to: muscle relaxants or respiratory,&#xD;
                  cardiovascular or anticonvulsant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Morbid obesity (BMI &gt;40 kg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous negative effects of opioid administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence of certain implanted devices (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some&#xD;
             artificial joints, metal pins, surgical clips or other implanted metal parts), body&#xD;
             morphology, or claustrophobia. Justification: Implanted devices may increase the risk&#xD;
             of MRI scanning and/or adversely affect the quality of the data; body morphology may&#xD;
             prevent optimal positioning in the scanner and thus affect the quality of the data;&#xD;
             participants with claustrophobia may find the MRI scan too unpleasant and may exhibit&#xD;
             excess movement that will adversely affect the quality of the data. Assessment&#xD;
             tool(s): Prospective participants will fill out an MRI screening questionnaire and&#xD;
             undergo an interview with an MR technologist. Questions concerning suitability for&#xD;
             scanning will be referred to the Medical Advisory Investigator. Prospective&#xD;
             participants will be questioned about symptoms of claustrophobia and placed in the&#xD;
             mock scanner during their first visit to assess for possible difficulty tolerating the&#xD;
             confinement of the scanner and for ability to fit into the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Conditions restricting participant's ability to lie flat for up to two hours (such as&#xD;
             coagulopathies, superficial or deep vein thrombosis, or musculoskeletal&#xD;
             abnormalities). Justification: PET scanning sessions require participants to lie flat&#xD;
             on their backs and remain perfectly still for approximately two hours. Therefore,&#xD;
             conditions that would make that difficult (e.g., chronic back pain, significant&#xD;
             scoliosis) or dangerous (e.g., familial hypercoagulability syndrome, history of&#xD;
             thrombosis) will be exclusionary. Assessment tool(s): History and physical examination&#xD;
             by a qualified IRP clinician, supplemented with a trial of lying in the mock scanner&#xD;
             to assess comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Head trauma leading to loss of consciousness for more than 5 min or hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Exposure to ionizing radiation from research studies that, in combination with the&#xD;
             study tracer, would result in cumulative exposure of &gt;5 rem within the previous 12&#xD;
             month period&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Self-reported and/or observed signs, symptoms, or diagnosis of Raynaud's or Buerger's&#xD;
             disease (e.g., pain in hands or feet at times of rest, during/following cold exposure&#xD;
             or stress, any significant color changes in hands or toes). Additionally, medical&#xD;
             staff will be present to watch for these symptoms during the actual cold pressor test.&#xD;

        <title>11C Raclopride Binding Potential in Caudate</title>
        <description>Binding potential measured using regions-of-interest analysis of PET data. Parametric Binding Potential (BPND) images were obtained using the Simple Reference Tissue Model 2 (SRTM2), with cerebellum as the reference region. BPND is computed in units of mCi/ml reflecting the radioactivity (milliCuries or mCi) per unit volume (milliliters or ml) in specific brain regions. Reduction in raclopride binding is attributed to competition with endogenous dopamine, and has been shown to be proportional to the magnitude of Dopamine (DA) release.</description>

        <title>11C Raclopride Binding Potential in Putamen</title>
        <description>Binding potential measured using regions-of-interest analysis of PET data. Parametric Binding Potential (BPND) images were obtained using the Simple Reference Tissue Model 2 (SRTM2), with cerebellum as the reference region. BPND is computed in units of mCi/ml reflecting the radioactivity (milliCuries or mCi) per unit volume (milliliters or ml) in specific brain regions. Reduction in raclopride binding is attributed to competition with endogenous dopamine, and has been shown to be proportional to the magnitude of Dopamine (DA) release.</description>

        <title>Subjective Perception of Morphine Effect - Feel Drug</title>
        <description>Area under the curve of the subjective perception-time course - Feel Drug. Subjective responses as measured by the Drug Effects Questionnaire [DEQ]. The DEQ consists of simple, face-valid, visual analog scale (VAS) questions on which people report their subjective states after ingesting a substance. The analog scale of responses ranges from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;, and the numeric scale ranges from 0 to 100. Due to skewness of individual time points; areas under the curve (AUC) for these ratings across individual time points (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min) were compared. AUC is computed using the trapezoidal rule and has a range of values from 0 to 5500, where 0 reflects no subjective perception at any time point and 5500 reflects maximal subjective perception (score of 100) at all time points after drug administration.</description>
