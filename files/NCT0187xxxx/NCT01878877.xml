    <textblock>
      Background Chronic pain is one of the major health problems among Western countries. It is&#xD;
      also one of the most frequent reasons for seeking medical care. Chronic pain is also an&#xD;
      important problem in Hong Kong. A study conducted in our institution in 2002 discovered that&#xD;
      the prevalence of chronic pain among Hong Kong adult population was 10.8%. This is expected&#xD;
      to be higher after a decade as the population is aging because old age is one of the risk&#xD;
      factors of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in prevalence, pattern, severity and help seeking behavior should be explored in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the attitude toward chronic pain and the efficacy of chronic pain&#xD;
      treatment. A local study reported the prevalence of chronic pain in 2007 in Hong Kong was as&#xD;
      high as 34.9%. The reported rate was much higher than that of Ng et al. However, the&#xD;
      difference in methodology produced different results even though they were done in the same&#xD;
      population, which make the comparison difficult. Besides, the treatment efficacy and help&#xD;
      seeking behavior were not studied in this study. The differences in mode of data collection,&#xD;
      the wording of the questionnaire and the grouping of categories also influence the results of&#xD;
      the study. It is also desirable to have the update information of chronic pain in Hong Kong&#xD;
      regularly (i.e. every 5 years) in view of the rapid increase in prevalence of chronic pain in&#xD;
      Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the changes in chronic pain prevalence and related outcomes, this study design is&#xD;
      similar to the previous study done in our institution in 2002. The definition of chronic pain&#xD;
      is the same as the previous study, which is pain persistence for 3 months or more. The mode&#xD;
      of conducting the interview and the questionnaire used will be grossly similar to the&#xD;
      previous study. Because chronic neuropathic pain is common and sometimes difficult to be&#xD;
      managed, questions about the incidence of chronic neuropathic pain will also be sought. This&#xD;
      important information has not been reported in Hong Kong before. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to obtain the update cross-sectional prevalence and demographic information of chronic pain&#xD;
      among Hong Kong adult population. The data will be compared with a similar study 4 done 10&#xD;
      years ago at our center in order to assess the change of chronic pain over the past decade.&#xD;
      Treatment seeking preference will also be assessed. We hypothesize that the prevalence of&#xD;
      chronic pain is increased when compare that of a decade ago.&#xD;

      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the update prevalence, nature and intensity of chronic pain among Hong Kong&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the help seeking behavior, the efficacy of treatment and the impact on daily&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the change in chronic pain outcomes over the last decade by comparing a study&#xD;
           conducted at the same center 10 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To find out the incidence of neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining the approval from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong&#xD;
      Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (HKU/HA HKW IRB), the study will be conducted&#xD;
      according to a similar study conducted at Department of Anaesthesiology, the University of&#xD;
      Hong Kong 10 years ago. The Cantonese version of the attached questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered over the telephone. The telephone interview will be conducted every weekday&#xD;
      evening between 6pm and 9 pm by trained interviewers from Public Opinion Programme (POP) of&#xD;
      the University of Hong Kong. Telephone number will be selected randomly from all households&#xD;
      in Hong Kong. Verbal consent will be obtained. Only subjects aged 18 or above and speak&#xD;
      Cantonese will be interviewed. Each interview will take about 15 minutes. Base on a 40%&#xD;
      prevalence rate and a target 95% confidence interval of +/- 2.5%, 1500 successful interviews&#xD;
      are required to complete this study 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data; Location of pain; Type of pain present; Severity of pain; Duration of pain&#xD;
      present; Impact on daily life; Pain treatment and efficacy; Incidence of neuropathic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will be analysed using the same method as previous study. Statistical software&#xD;
      SAS version 6.12 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) will be used to perform the analysis.&#xD;
      Parametric data will be presented as mean (SD) and non parametric data will be presented as&#xD;
      median (range) or actual count or percentages. These results will then be compared with those&#xD;
      from the previous study. Differences between groups will be compared using Mann-Whitney U or&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Total duration: 18 months Training of interviewers: 3 month Data collection:&#xD;
      6 months Data analysis: 3 months Research conclusion and report generation: 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing facilities Information and questionnaire of the study had been sent to POP (A&#xD;
      investigating center at the Unviersity of Hong Kong helping for the telephone interview) for&#xD;
      comment. POP has agreed to participate in this study. Recruitment and training of&#xD;
      interviewers will be provided by POP. The phone interviews will be done and monitored by POP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have the computer system and software to analyze the data and for recording. Professional&#xD;
      statistician is available to perform the analysis. Research assistant will be recruited to&#xD;
      help for conducting this study and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our institute had completed the previous study on chronic pain prevalence successfully and we&#xD;
      are experienced in conducting this type of study. The POP of the University of Hong Kong is&#xD;
      experienced in conducting similar survey and questionnaire interviews. They have the manpower&#xD;
      and training for the interview of this study. The questionnaire will be delivered by trained&#xD;
      interviewers from their department. An experienced research assistant is mandatory in&#xD;
      analysis of the data by comparing the change of outcomes in two time points, drafting the&#xD;
      reports, coordinating the study, following up the program, retrieving data in 2002, which can&#xD;
      give valuable information on the change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential hazards:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal/ sensitive information will not be asked and the data will be kept in password&#xD;
      guarded computer. The interviewees can withdraw from the study or refuse to answer any&#xD;
      question during the telephone interview. The interviewees will not be exposed to any&#xD;
      additional risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and potential for implementation of results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to obtain detailed information of chronic pain in Hong Kong. The&#xD;
      pattern, locations, nature and severity of chronic pain will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained will also be used to evaluate the efficiency of current treatments in&#xD;
      chronic pain in Hong Kong. The help seeking preference will be explored to provide&#xD;
      information for planning and allocation of resources. All the information is important in&#xD;
      improving the pain management service in Hong Kong. The awareness of chronic pain can also be&#xD;
      promoted and enhanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: Verbal consent will be obtained.&#xD;
