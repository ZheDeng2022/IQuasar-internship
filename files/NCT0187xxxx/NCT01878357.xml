    <textblock>
      Mass Drug Administration (MDA) and Mass Screening and Selective Treatment (MST) might be&#xD;
      applied as strategies for eliminating malaria when focusing on transmission stages. Many&#xD;
      studies either with MDA or MST has been done in low transmission areas demonstrated the&#xD;
      impact of those activities to reduce malaria transmission. However, in high transmission such&#xD;
      study is still very limited which is becoming the reason behind this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized cluster trial of MST study using dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine&#xD;
      (DHP + PQ) will be conducted in some villages at the Belu regency, Nusa Tenggara TImur&#xD;
      province, Central Indonesia. There will be three arms in the study, i.e. (1) intervention arm&#xD;
      of mass screening and treatment with interval of 6 weeks; (2) intervention arm of mass&#xD;
      screening and treatment with interval of 3 months and (3) control arm without mass screening&#xD;
      and treatment. The intervention arm with 6 weeks interval represents a new proposed method to&#xD;
      detection malaria infections, while the intervention arm with 3 month interval represents the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health current policy of active case detection in Indonesia, and the third arm&#xD;
      will serve as the control for Ministry of Health's policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 6 months period and evaluate various parameters including&#xD;
      malaria incidence and proportion of anemia in monthly cohort school children (in arm1, 2 and&#xD;
      3), in addition to malaria prevalence in the community (only in arm 1 and arm 2). All&#xD;
      positive subject in all arms will receive supervised treatment. Secondary objectives are the&#xD;
      proportion of gametocytemia in the community, the proportion of malaria antibody of various&#xD;
      age groups, population genetic of local parasite, submicroscopic incidence based polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction and the proportion of infective mosquitoes. Data analysis will be performed&#xD;
      according to the method for cluster randomized trial evaluation.&#xD;

      Study Site&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at Belu regency (south latitude 90 - 100; east longitude 1240-&#xD;
      1260) which located in the Nusa Tenggara Timur province, central part of Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atambua District Health Office reported that most of high endemic malaria areas were situated&#xD;
      in the southern part of the regency in 2011. The highest Annual Parasite Incidence (API)&#xD;
      reported was in the subdistrict of Wewiku (72.1 cases/1,000 people). Therefore, this study&#xD;
      will focus in high case incidence of villages in Wewiku sub-districts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design overview and demographic census&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is &quot;randomized cluster trial&quot; by microscopic malaria screening at high&#xD;
      malaria incidence at village level. Two-four villages with malaria prevalence of &gt;8% or&#xD;
      sub-villages with malaria prevalence &gt; 10% in school children will be selected as study&#xD;
      villages or sub-villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Census visit will be performed in all target villages. All clusters will be then listed and&#xD;
      randomized to one of study arm using generated randomization softwares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 study arms, i.e. (1) 6 weeks interval of MST, (2) 3 months interval of MST;&#xD;
      and (3) control without MST. Each MST should cover at least 80% of the villagers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given to all malaria-positive individuals on microscopic examination. The&#xD;
      treatment will be provided based on suitable dose for body weight as recommended by the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia (Table 1). The drug that will be given is 3-day&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) treatment and 1-day primaquine (PQ) treatment for P.&#xD;
      falciparum. For patients who are infected by P. vivax and P. ovale,PQ will be given for 14&#xD;
      days; while the dose of DHP is equal to the dose for P. falciparum infection. Treatment for&#xD;
      P.malariae infected subjects is similar with that for P. falciparum but without PQ. For&#xD;
      individuals in all arms, the drug will be given by health care personnel at their houses&#xD;
      assisted by health care volunteers of the integrated health post (Posyandu cadre).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Consideration&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent will be collected from every head of families or their representative.&#xD;
      They have 1 week to consider whether they will participate in our study or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be identified and recorded in Case Report Form by field team in&#xD;
      collaboration with cadres and primary health center attendants. These subjects will be given&#xD;
      symptomatic treatment at the village/sub-village level or at the local health center.&#xD;
      Relationship between adverse event and study drug will be determined by Data Safety and&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (Prof Rianto Setiabudy, dr Erni Juwita Nelwan and dr Hasan Basri) who will&#xD;
      also decide how often the data will be sent to Jakarta. Specific Adverse Event are black&#xD;
      urine, gastro intestinal disturbances, blue lips and breathless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse events is an adverse event which becomes serious and could endanger the life&#xD;
      of subjects, cause prolonged hospitalization and disability to conduct normal life. The Data&#xD;
      Safety and Monitoring Board will be recorded in Severe Adverse Event form and reported to&#xD;
      Principal Investigator, sponsors, Ethic Committee, Regulatory and Data Safety and Monitoring&#xD;
      Board within 24 hours. Severe Adverse Event subjects will be treated in Atambua Hospital&#xD;
      until recover completely. All expenses will be paid by sponsor. Complete Severe Adverse Event&#xD;
      report will be distributed within one month after the occurrence of Severe Adverse Event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Malaria incidence Inclusion Criteria Children at elementary school (6-12 year old)&#xD;
      of the all selected clusters despite of random allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size is calculated based on the differences of malaria incidence between&#xD;
      before and after intervention in each arm. Baseline incidence is determined from&#xD;
      positive-malaria children in monthly cohort between MST1 and MST3 in arm 1 or MST1 until MST3&#xD;
      in arm 2. Malaria incidence in the arm 2 is assumed to remains constant at 0.7 new&#xD;
      cases/person-year during study(unpublished data). The impact of the intervention arm is&#xD;
      expected to reduce malaria incidence maximum by 50% to 0.35 new cases/person-year. With the&#xD;
      proposed sample size of 70 children per arm, we will have a power of 82% to detect a&#xD;
      significant difference. Considering a 10% of loss to follow-up and a design effect of&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial 1.5, we will recruit 115 children per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All school-age children who participate in the study and have malaria-positive blood smears&#xD;
      will receive complete treatment as previously mentioned. The antimalaria drug will be given&#xD;
      by direct observation treatment (DOT) technique or under supervision performed by school&#xD;
      teachers with the assistance of the health care volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples drawn by pricking the finger tip in school-age children are used for&#xD;
      microscopic examination, Polymerase Chain Reaction assay, hemoglobin measurement, serological&#xD;
      examination for malaria antibody and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia in malaria infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Elementary school children aged 6-12 years who participate in cohort&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size calculation is performed by WinPepi software with the assumed anemia&#xD;
      proportion of 25% and 50% in arm 1 and arm 2, respectively (5% significance level, 80% power,&#xD;
      and 1:1 sample size ratio). Required sample size would be 58 school-age children per arm. We&#xD;
      will recruit115 school children after considering design effect of 1.5,and drop out level of&#xD;
      10% and sample size for malaria incidence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are drawn by pricking the finger tip of the elementary school children using&#xD;
      microtainer as much as 0.25 ml. Simultaneously, the thick and thin blood smears are made for&#xD;
      microscopic examination of malaria and hemoglobin level measurement. The collected blood&#xD;
      samples in the tube containers are delivered to the laboratory for distribution of above&#xD;
      mentioned assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria prevalence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All villagers of the selected clusters ( arm 1: MST1, 2, 3 and arm 2:&#xD;
      MST1, MST3), except elementary school children who participated in cohort study. Cluster&#xD;
      chosen should be located in villages with endemicity of more than 8% or sub-villages of more&#xD;
      than 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size is calculated based on the differences of malaria prevalence before&#xD;
      and after treatment in the arm 1 and arm2. The malaria prevalence used in the study is 15%,&#xD;
      which is expected to decrease by 30% in arm 1 and persistent in arm 2. Sample size&#xD;
      calculation is performed by WinPepi software with the assumed probability proportion of 10%&#xD;
      and 15% in arm 1 and arm 2, respectively (5% significance level, 80% power, and 1:1 sample&#xD;
      size ratio). Required sample size would be 686 subjects. We will recruit 1029 subject after&#xD;
      considering design effect of 1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All villagers participated in both arms who have malaria-positive blood smears will be&#xD;
      treated completely as previously described. The antimalaria drug will be given by direct&#xD;
      observation treatment (DOT) technique or under supervision performed by health care personnel&#xD;
      with the assistance of the health care volunteers to ensure that the treatment coverage would&#xD;
      reach 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are drawn by pricking the finger tip of the individuals in the community using&#xD;
      microtainer as much as 0.25 ml for &gt; 1 year-old children and adults or 0.1 ml for infants&#xD;
      (the blood samples are drawn by pricking the finger tip of their toes). Simultaneously, the&#xD;
      thick and thin blood smears are made for microscopic examination of malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change of malaria antibody in population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All villagers of the selected clusters ( arm 1: MST1 &amp; 3 and arm 2: MST1&#xD;
      &amp;3) and children enrolled in cohort study from all arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size is calculated based on the proportion of altered malaria antibody&#xD;
      before and after intervention in arm 1 and arm 2. The seropositive prevalence rate used in&#xD;
      the study is 50% (unpublished data), which is expected to be seronegative as much as 25% in&#xD;
      arm 1; while the change in the arm 2 would be 10%. Sample size calculation is performed by&#xD;
      WinPepi software assuming that the proportion of seroconversion (from + to -) is 25% in arm 1&#xD;
      and 10% in arm 2 (5% significance level, 80% power, and 1:1 sample size ratio). Required&#xD;
      sample size would be 321 subjects. After considering design effect of 1.5, we will recruit&#xD;
      482 subjects per arm and this will be randomized from community blood collected sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gametocyte carriage in the population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All villagers of the selected clusters ( arm 1: MST1, 2, 3 and arm 2: MST&#xD;
      1 &amp;3) but not included elementary school children who participated in cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size is calculated based on the proportion of gametocyte carriages before&#xD;
      and after intervention in both arm.The assumption of gametocyte proportion rate used in the&#xD;
      study is 20%, which is expected to decrease by 40% in arm 1 and decrease by 10% in the arm 2.&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is performed by WinPepi software by assuming that the reduced&#xD;
      proportion of gametocyte carriage of 40% in arm 1 and 10% in arm 2 (5% significance level,&#xD;
      80% power, and 1:1 sample size ratio). Required sample size would be 338subjects. After&#xD;
      considering design effect of 1.5, we will recruit 507 subjects per arm that will be&#xD;
      randomized from 1029 community participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence based on molecular characterization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All children in cohort study (arm 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Blood samples are taken from all school-age children enrolled in cohort study or&#xD;
      children per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyst and sporozoite rate in vector mosquitoes Oocyst and sporozoite rate in mosquitoes will&#xD;
      be determined at three points: baseline, week 6, and month 3. Mosquitoes will be collected&#xD;
      within a week before nearest MST carried out. All collected mosquitoes in the period of study&#xD;
      as mentioned before will be subjected to the laboratory examination.&#xD;
