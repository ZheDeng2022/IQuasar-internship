  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare, slow growing, and diagnosis is often delayed with&#xD;
      advanced metastases at presentation. In select patient populations, radioisotope therapy with&#xD;
      Lutetium-177 (Lu-DOTA-TATE) has been shown to be a safe and effective palliative therapy, and&#xD;
      has been widely used by research groups in Europe. A brand of Lu-DOTA-TATE (Lutathera(R)) is&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs in Europe, the U.S., and more&#xD;
      recently in Canada. While Lutathera(R) is approved in Canada, it is not publicly funded in&#xD;
      Alberta. Lu-DOTA-TATE has been used at the Cross Cancer Institute to treat more than 300&#xD;
      patients with NETs since August, 2010. Our Lu-DOTA-TATE treatment was initially given under&#xD;
      Health Canada's Special Access Programme (SAP), with each individual treatment requiring&#xD;
      separate approval. In 2014, Health Canada requested we conduct a clinical trial with&#xD;
      Lu-DOTA-TATE instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to: 1) assess the efficacy of Lu-DOTA-TATE treatment in patients&#xD;
      with somatostatin receptor positive tumours; 2) assess the safety of Lu-DOTA-TATE; 3) assess&#xD;
      the effect of Lu-DOTA-TATE on Quality of Life and survival.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will be a Phase II, open label, single site study in subjects&#xD;
      with somatostatin receptor positive tumours. Radioactive Lu-DOTA-TATE doses are fixed within&#xD;
      a range of 1.85 - 5.55 GBq ± 10%, with individual doses based on specified risk factors.&#xD;
      There will be two groups of subjects enrolled in this study. Group A subjects (primary&#xD;
      therapy) will have progressive somatostatin receptor positive tumours and have never received&#xD;
      Lu-DOTA-TATE. Group B subjects (maintenance therapy) will be those subjects who have&#xD;
      previously received Lu-DOTA-TATE under the Special Access Programme (SAP) and will maintain&#xD;
      their treatment schedule when they are entered into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in Group A will be treated in an induction stage using 10-14 week dosing for up&#xD;
      to 4 treatments. If an individual patient shows stable or improving disease status with no&#xD;
      significant toxicities after the 4 induction treatments, they will be assessed 12-20 weeks&#xD;
      after the last therapeutic treatment for entry into the maintenance stage. Patients will be&#xD;
      re-assessed for stable or improving disease status with no significant toxicities 12-20 weeks&#xD;
      after every other treatment of the maintenance stage for consideration of further maintenance&#xD;
      treatments (re-evaluations), up to a maximum of 8 treatments per patient if there have been&#xD;
      no significant toxicities or progression. At each treatment, an amino acid solution is&#xD;
      infused prior to and during the Lu-DOTA-TATE infusion to protect the kidneys. Subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for 6 months and 1 year (± 4 weeks) following their last treatment dose to&#xD;
      determine progression-free survival, and for 2, 3, and 5 years (± 4 weeks) following their&#xD;
      last treatment dose to determine overall survival. All subjects meeting evaluation criteria&#xD;
      will be analysed for safety, and all Group A subjects who have received at least two&#xD;
      treatments of Lu-DOTA-TATE will be evaluated for efficacy. Those Group B subjects with&#xD;
      adequate baseline data for comparison collected retrospectively from a chart review study&#xD;
      (REV-LUT-001) may also be evaluated for safety and efficacy. Additional optional&#xD;
      characterization of tumour samples from subjects who have had surgery before or during the&#xD;
      study may be performed to characterize NET tumour biology changes following Lu-DOTA-TATE&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
