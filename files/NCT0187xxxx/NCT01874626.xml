  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose,&#xD;
      parallel-group study. Approximately 300 subjects (150 per group) 16 years of age and older&#xD;
      with a current (within 24 hours from Visit 1) Grade I or II ankle sprain, and who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, will be randomized into the study and will receive either the active&#xD;
      treatment (SST-0225 ibuprofen cream), or matching placebo. Subjects will apply an amount&#xD;
      equivalent to a 4 inch line of investigational product to the affected ankle approximately&#xD;
      every 4-6 hours. At Visit 1 two doses will be applied at the site. All subsequent doses of&#xD;
      the investigational product will be applied every 4 to 6 hours with a total of 4 doses in a&#xD;
      24 hour period. Duration of treatment with the investigational product is 7 days.&#xD;

                  ligaments, primarily the anterior talofibular and possibly the calcaneofibular&#xD;
                  ligament. Ligamentous laxity may be present and there is moderate swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At screening (Visit 1), subject reported pain intensity score upon movement of ≥ 5 on&#xD;
