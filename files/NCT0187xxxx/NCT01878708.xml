  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm pilot study of Oncaspar® with dexamethasone for patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), excluding extranodal NK/T cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (ENKTL). Patients will receive up to 8 courses of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, investigator-initiated, single-arm pilot study. Patients with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory (R/R) peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) will receive Oncaspar® every 3 weeks up&#xD;
      to a maximum of 8 courses or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. They will&#xD;
      also receive dexamethasone 40mg daily for 4 days with every cycle. They will be restaged&#xD;
      after 2 courses (6 weeks) and after 8 courses (24 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Oncaspar and dexamethasone have been used together to treat ALL and ENKTL, which is&#xD;
      another subtype of T cell lymphoma. The combination may provide a collaborative attack&#xD;
      against the cancer cell; moreover, the dexamethasone could also prevent some of the side&#xD;
      effects of Oncaspar; especially allergic reactions. This study will test these two drugs&#xD;
      together to determine if they are an effective treatment for T-Cell Lymphoma. Each drug is&#xD;
      commercially available to the drug market.&#xD;
