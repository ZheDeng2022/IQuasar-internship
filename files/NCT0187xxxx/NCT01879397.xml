      Pilot prospective two group observational study to create a model of the carotid plaque&#xD;
      composition based on ultrasonic backscattered signals and select clinical data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      and the major cause of long-term disability in the United States. Current imaging modalities&#xD;
      can determine the severity of luminal stenosis resulting from plaque, as in the carotid&#xD;
      arteries. However, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) are often associated with the rupture of&#xD;
      unstable plaques located in regions with a non-significant degree of luminal stenosis. Thus&#xD;
      up to 50% of high-risk atherosclerotic plaques may go undetected and untreated. Plaque&#xD;
      composition is an additional and perhaps, more important risk factor for CVA rather than&#xD;
      stenosis severity alone. Accurate identification of these high-risk, rupture-prone plaques&#xD;
      may potentially prevent CVAs in a significant number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected during this study (ultrasonic backscatter and histologically processed&#xD;
      carotid plaque) will provide the basis for a novel algorithm to add plaque composition&#xD;
      information to the plaque size and location information that is currently provided by&#xD;
      standard ultrasound imaging. The input parameters for the algorithm are derived from two&#xD;
      types of non-invasive ultrasound data: spectral parameters and acoustic radiation force&#xD;
      impulse (ARFI) data. Spectral parameters are extracted from the frequency content of the&#xD;
      backscattered diagnostic ultrasound signals. These are the same signals currently used for&#xD;
      imaging, however, imaging relies solely on the strength of the signal to form the image and&#xD;
      ignores the spectral information. Thus spectral analysis is an approach to use the&#xD;
      information which is sensitive to the number and nature of the scatterers. In contrast ARFI&#xD;
      techniques provide information on the stiffness of the tissue. ARFI is based on using a&#xD;
      ultrasonic push pulse to slightly move the tissue (displacement on the order of microns) and&#xD;
      an image of the relative displacements of the tissue (ARFI image) is created. The ARFI&#xD;
      derived data and the spectral parameters will be combined with clinically available measures&#xD;
      currently used for diagnosis of carotid stenosis to form the input parameters for the&#xD;
      algorithm. In order to train and test the algorithm the plaque removed during surgery will be&#xD;
      collected and the histology slides prepared from these plaques. This histology review&#xD;
      provides the 'gold' standard for training and testing the algorithm. The majority of these&#xD;
      matched sets (67%) will be used for training the algorithm. While the remainder (33%) will&#xD;
      provide a test of the accuracy of the algorithm for these types of matched data. The&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity for each tissue type defined during the histology review will be&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;

    <description>Classification of carotid artery plaque is produced by an algorithm that uses the QUS and ARFI derived parameters corresponding to a given region in the plaque to produce a classification of the plaque region into one of the following: calcium, fibrous, necrotic, or hemorrhagic. Error rates from both the training and test data sets will be reported.</description>
