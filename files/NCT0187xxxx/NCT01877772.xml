    <textblock>
      This Clinical Trial is being conducted to study an adjunctive treatment for rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair; bone trephination.&quot;Trephination&quot; is a procedure that involves making small&#xD;
      perforations in the bone that the tendon is repaired to.The rotator cuff is repaired by&#xD;
      sewing the tendon down to the bone in the shoulder. Trephination is a new technique that is&#xD;
      used in addition to the standard method of repairing the rotator cuff tendon. The control&#xD;
      group will undergo the standard repair for rotator cuff tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the investigators' hypothesis that healing rates in patients who undergo bone&#xD;
      trephination will be higher compared with surgery without trephination in arthroscopic&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair at 24 months post-operatively.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff repair carried out with current techniques has shown favourable results in terms&#xD;
      of pain relief. However the re-tear rates remain high and are associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity in terms of functional outcome and shoulder strength. As rotator cuff disease&#xD;
      becomes ever more prevalent with our aging population, it is imperative to determine if&#xD;
      healing rates can be improved with autologous stem cell enhancement with pre-surgical&#xD;
      preparation of the tendon insertion site through trephination. This trial is necessary both&#xD;
      to provide optimal care of our patients, and to do so in a fiscally responsible fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure the re-tear rate as measured by ultrasound at 24 months&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures are Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC), Constant Score,&#xD;
      and the American Shoulder and Elbow surgeons standardized assessment of shoulder function&#xD;
      (ASES).&#xD;

    <description>High-resolution ultrasound will be used as the primary outcome measure to determine the re-tear rate at 6 and 24 months following repair. Ultrasound was chosen as it has been shown to have a high degree of accuracy for the diagnosis of rotator tears that is equivalent but less expensive than MRI.&#xD;
The interpretation of the high-resolution ultrasound is based on healing status and will be carried out by a trained MSK radiologist. Healing status will be documented at both 6 and 24 months as either completely healed, partially healed, or not healed. For tendons partially healed or not healed, the size of the defect will be compared with the size of the tear pre-operatively.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have failed standard non-surgical management of their rotator cuff tear,&#xD;
             and who would benefit from a surgical repair of the cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Failed medical management will be defined as persistent pain and disability despite&#xD;
             adequate standard non-operative management for 6 months. Medical management will be&#xD;
             defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
