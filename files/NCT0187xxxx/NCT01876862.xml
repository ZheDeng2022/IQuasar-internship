  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the ERAMUNE-01 and -02 studies, the HIV-DNA quantification in the PBMCs (Peripheral&#xD;
      Blood Mononuclear Cells) showed showed that some patients had a very low or undetectable&#xD;
      reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed that a low reservoir is associated to a spontaneous virologic control&#xD;
      in three specific categories of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Elite Controllers&quot;: these rare patients are able to spontaneously maintain an HIV-RNA&#xD;
           viral load below 50 copies/mL and elevated CD4 counts without any treatment. These&#xD;
           patients belong to the B27/B57 haplotypes associated to a reduced risk of HIV&#xD;
           contamination but these haplotypes are very rare in the global population (0,3 %)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Visconti&quot; patients: early-treated patients, during the primo-infection stage. After 3&#xD;
           to 5 years of treatment, these patients are able to maintain an undetectable HIV-RNA&#xD;
           viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Salto&quot; patients: these patients are treated a bit later compared to the Visconti&#xD;
           cohort, when their CD4 count was above 350 cells/mm3 and their HIV-RNA viral load below&#xD;
           50 000 copies/mL. The follow-up of these patients showed the same capacity of control of&#xD;
           the HIV infection for at least 2 years following treatment interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account these 3 categories of patients which common characteristics is a low&#xD;
      reservoir, our objective is to answer the 2 following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is it possible to discontinue the treatment in chronically-infected patients with a&#xD;
           &quot;normal&quot; immune system and with an undetectable HIV-DNA reservoir?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is a low viral reservoir predictive of a treatment-free remission of the HIV infection&#xD;
           in chronically-infected patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the proof-of-concept ERAMUNE-03 trial is to evaluate the proportion of&#xD;
      patients in success (i.e. able to maintain a virologic and an immunologic control of the&#xD;
      infection) after treatment discontinuation, failure is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An HIV-RNA viral load &gt; 400 copies/mL on 2 consecutive tests starting from Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Or CD4 count &lt; 400 cells/mm3 on 2 consecutive measures starting from Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Or the onset of an AIDS-related event&#xD;
