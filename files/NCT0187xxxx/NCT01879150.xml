      Single center, open-label, single arm, pilot study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy of CYCLAPLEX device, a minimal invasive enhanced suture and button implant and&#xD;
      surgery tools for correction of inter-metatarsal angle in subjects suffering from mild to&#xD;
      moderate Hallux Valgus deformity&#xD;

      INVESTIGATIONAL THERAPY Cycla Orthopedics Ltd has developed the CYCLAPLEX , a minimally&#xD;
      invasive enhanced type of Suture and Button implant. It is intended to: (a) reduce the&#xD;
      intermetatarsal angle (IMA) between 1MT and 2MT without osteotomy osteotomy b) reduce the&#xD;
      risk of 2MT fractures (d) perform the implantation procedure in an easy and safe way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CYCLAPLEX predicated device is the &quot;Suture and Button&quot; type MiniTightrope. It is based on&#xD;
      Mini Tightrope clinical experience, however with additional features to increase safety and&#xD;
      functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CyclaPlex device comprise of two bone holders ('Anchors ') connected by a metal cord. The&#xD;
      cord is connected to the buttons by crimp method as part of the surgery procedures The bone&#xD;
      holders are T shape screws that are screwed into the bones after drilling holes across the 2&#xD;
      metatarsals. The gap in the bone as a result of the drilling is filled by the enhanced T&#xD;
      shape buttons (screws). A nut is residing internally as part of the 1st met anchor structure.&#xD;
      The IMA is reduced using specially designed tensioning tool CyclaPlex device is indicated for&#xD;
      reducing intermetatarsal angles in cases where IMA is less than 200 eliminating the need for&#xD;
      the traditional 1st metatarsal osteotomy. It used in conjunction with traditional release of&#xD;
      the lateral MTP joint capsular structures and removal of the medial eminence as well as&#xD;
      regular HVA reduction procedures such as AKIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2nd Metatarsal fracture risk is reduced due multiple/ accumulated factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) The hole drilled at 2nd metatarsal had been reduced significantly (ii) The hole is filled&#xD;
      by conical screw and head. This firm anchoring method enable to distribute the horizontal&#xD;
      forces applied during gate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) The metal screw type device enables bone growth over it and strengthen the bone at that&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) The connecting cord is housed inside the screw and has no direct touch with the bone, in&#xD;
      both, 2nd and 1st metatarsals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is delivered sterilized ( steam sterilization) double bag residing in cardboard&#xD;
      box.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dedicated assistive tools for multiple use are provided as well housed in a special tray&#xD;
      intended for surgery room steam sterilization. The tools comprise of Aiming Drilling Guide,,&#xD;
      screw driver for anchors insertion, Tensioning tool for reduction of the IMA, Crimping tool,&#xD;
      cutter, single use drill bits&#xD;
