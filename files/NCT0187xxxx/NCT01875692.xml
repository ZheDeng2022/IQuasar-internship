  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathogens of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) come from colonizers of the trachea. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of the investigators is that during the first days of intubation, independently of&#xD;
      the use of antibiotics, there is a change in the oro-pharyngeal flora leading to the&#xD;
      selection of one pathogen in the trachea, that will finally be the cause of VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a prospective study including 300 patients intubated for more than&#xD;
      3 days, with daily analysis of oro-pharyngeal juice and tracheal aspirate by culture and&#xD;
      metagenomics, in order to determine if this microbiological surveillance permits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To predict a high risk to develop a VAP in the next 48h and even to predict its agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To better understand the development of VAP by studying the evolution of the&#xD;
           &quot;respiratory flora&quot; in the context of intubation&#xD;

      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is responsible for almost half of infections&#xD;
      acquired in intensive care, affecting up to 28% of mechanically ventilated patients with a&#xD;
      mortality rate ranging from 25 to 50%. The majority of these VAP originate in the sub-glottic&#xD;
      juice that accumulates just above the endotracheal tube cuff. Many preventive measures exist&#xD;
      and are applied in this institution, including oropharyngeal aspiration every 4 hours and&#xD;
      tracheal aspirates every 8 hours. Currently, these aspirates are simply discarded. However, a&#xD;
      French study evaluating the colonization and infection of the respiratory tract of patients&#xD;
      with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has highlighted that the causative agent of&#xD;
      VAP is selected in more than 2/3 of the cases in tracheal aspirates several days before the&#xD;
      VAP. This suggest that &quot;microbiological surveillance&quot; of daily aspirates may permit the&#xD;
      identification of a selected respiratory pathogen later responsible of VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel to this, the rapid development of genomics has highlighted the role of flora&#xD;
      (microbiota) and its link with disease (eg, colitis and intestinal microbiota inflammatory).&#xD;
      This area is also emerging in the field of respiratory tract infections, for example in&#xD;
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. There is no description&#xD;
      yet of metagenomics changes in respiratory flora of patients intubated with or without VAP,&#xD;
      neither evaluation of the benefits of such an approach in relation to classical microbiology.&#xD;
      The investigators believe that studying the respiratory flora of ventilated patients could&#xD;
      provide clues to better understand the development of VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY (plan, inclusion and objectives):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study of 300 intubated patients recruited during a period of 2 years, in whom&#xD;
      tracheal aspirates and oropharyngeal juice collected daily will be analyzed by culture and&#xD;
      metagenomics, instead of being simply discarded. The results of these analyzes will be used&#xD;
      only for research purposes (culture and metagenomics in parallel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to determine whether daily monitoring of oropharyngeal juice and&#xD;
      tracheal aspirates by culture identifies the selection of a pathogen among the colonizing&#xD;
      flora, which would be predictive of the onset of VAP in 48-72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to obtain new knowledge on the kinetics of colonization and&#xD;
      respiratory infections in intubated patients, compare the advantages and disadvantages of a&#xD;
      metagenomic approach compared to culture in this context, and study the influence of&#xD;
      antibiotherapy in this context.&#xD;
