      Background and Purposes: Orthognathic surgery is necessary in more than 25% of patients with&#xD;
      cleft lip and palate (CLP) to correct skeletal discrepancy and to obtain harmonious facial&#xD;
      esthetics in the final phase treatment. A setback of mandible by bilateral sagittal split&#xD;
      osteotomy (BSSO) along with maxillary osteotomy is usually performed when large skeletal&#xD;
      discrepancies or associated mandibular deformities (e.g., asymmetries, canting of the&#xD;
      mandibular occlusal plane) are present. Although the surgical technique of BSSO is&#xD;
      well-developed, the neurosensory disturbances of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) remain one&#xD;
      of the major postoperative complications. The purpose of this study is to identify the risk&#xD;
      factors of IAN disturbances after BSSO and in turn to help clinicians to avoid such&#xD;
      complication and to raise the satisfaction level of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective prognosis study. Setting: Chang Gung Craniofacial Center, Taoyuan.&#xD;
      Patients: Two hundred Taiwanese patients with nonsyndromic CLP (age, &gt;16 for females, &gt;18 for&#xD;
      males), who will undergo a BSSO as a part of the correction of their dentofacial deformities&#xD;
      Measurements: All patients will undergo subjective (e.g., questionnaire) and objective (e.g.,&#xD;
      2-point discrimination, light touch detection, and sharp/blunt detection) neurosensory&#xD;
      assessments before surgery, and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Cone beam computed&#xD;
      tomography is performed before surgery and 1 week after surgery. Peri-operative factors&#xD;
      including type of BSSO, extent of surgical correction, extent of split and fixation screws,&#xD;
      concomitant genioplasty or third molar extraction are assessed. Patient-related factors&#xD;
      including age, gender, bone quality of inferior alveolar canal are recorded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed. Statistical&#xD;
      significance is assumed for a p value of less than 0.05.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery is usually the final phase of treatment for patients with cleft lip and&#xD;
      palate (CLP). More than 25% of patients with CLP develop a significant maxillary hypoplasia&#xD;
      that requires surgical intervention, and maxillary osteotomy is, therefore, most commonly&#xD;
      performed for these patients. If the sagittal discrepancy is too large or if there are&#xD;
      associated mandibular deformities (e.g., asymmetries, canting of the mandibular occlusal&#xD;
      plane), a simultaneous setback of the mandible is performed. The bilateral sagittal split&#xD;
      osteotomy (BSSO) has become the preferred mandibular osteotomy in many centers for the&#xD;
      treatment of mandibular deformities. Nevertheless, this treatment is known to give rise to&#xD;
      various complications; sensory disturbance of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) is probably&#xD;
      the most common one with the incidence ranging from 8% to 85%. Such sensory disturbances may&#xD;
      affect patients' quality of life due to the difficulties in speech, eating and drinking.&#xD;
      Patients may also complain about the inability to assess tactile stimuli such as putting on&#xD;
      lipstick, shaving or kissing, which may lead to psychological and social issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IAN disturbance is believed to be caused by iatrogenic injury to the nerve including&#xD;
      excessive nerve manipulation, nerve laceration, fixation of segments by incorrect placement&#xD;
      of position screws, large mandibular movement and bad splits. Identification of risk factors&#xD;
      for IAN disturbance after BSSO can help clinician to prevent it and raise the satisfaction&#xD;
      level of patients. It is generally thought that the injury to IAN inside the mandibular ramus&#xD;
      and body during surgery are highly correlated to variations in preoperative anatomy (ie,&#xD;
      patient-related factors). Previous computed tomography (CT) studies have reported the&#xD;
      anatomical variations including the thickness and length of ramus, the position and bone&#xD;
      density of inferior alveolar nerve canal (IAC) and thickness of buccal and lingual cortical&#xD;
      plate. However, few studies tried to identify surgery-related factors such as types of BSSO,&#xD;
      extent of surgical correction, extent of split, concomitant genioplasty or third molar&#xD;
      extraction. Furthermore, most of the studies were retrospective in design or had limited&#xD;
      number of patients to conduct multivariate analysis to recognize the influences of patient-&#xD;
      and surgery-related risk factors on IAN disturbance. Moreover, heterogeneity of the&#xD;
      assessment timing and methods for IAN disturbance in previous studies prevented from overall&#xD;
      assessment of the degree of IAN recovery. We therefore aim to (1) determine the incidence of&#xD;
      IAN injury after BSSO, (2) identify the risk factors associated with such injuries, and (3)&#xD;
      understand the consequences of such injuries including the degree of neurologic recovery by&#xD;
      performing a prospective, longitudinal study.&#xD;
