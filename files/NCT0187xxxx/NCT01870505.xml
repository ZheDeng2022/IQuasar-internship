  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a drug called BYL719 at different dose&#xD;
      levels. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, BYL719 has on the&#xD;
      patient and breast cancer. BYL719 will be given with either letrozole or exemestane to&#xD;
      patients with HR+ locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer. When the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose of BYL719 in combination with letrozole or exemestane has been determined in the&#xD;
      dose-finding phase, an additional 10 patients will be enrolled onto each arm in an expansion&#xD;
      phase of the study. The purpose of the expansion phase is to further define the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of BYL719 in combination with letrozole or exemestane at the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose, and to estimate efficacy.&#xD;
