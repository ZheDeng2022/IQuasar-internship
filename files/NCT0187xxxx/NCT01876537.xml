      THEME RELEVANCE. Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease (SPD) is a congenital disease that's&#xD;
      well spread and constitutes 1-2% of all surgical pathologies. In all Coloproctological&#xD;
      pathologies, the disease composes 14-20% (G.I. Vorobjov, 2006; V.D. Fedorov, 2005; Gupta P.J.&#xD;
      et al., 2005). Clinical manifestations of pilonidal sinus disease mainly due to the&#xD;
      appearance of inflammation in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main approach in the complex treatment of this group of patients is to execute radical&#xD;
      surgery. The guiding principles in it are adequate sanation and drainage of purulent focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that this disease is the subject of numerous medical journals, monographs,&#xD;
      research works, masters and doctoral theses, frequency of unsatisfactory outcomes remains&#xD;
      high (recurrence - from 10% to 19%, wound inflammation - 20-30%). In this case terms of&#xD;
      stationary and out-patient treatment increase till 30-70 days (G.I. Vorobjov, 2006; B.M.&#xD;
      Dacenko et al., 2004; Cubukcu А., 2001, Perruchoud С, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of unsatisfactory results after excision of SPD directly depends on the kind of&#xD;
      surgery. After palliative surgery (incision and drainage of abscess) in 11.7 - 25.2% of&#xD;
      patients occurs recurrence of the disease (McCallum I., King P.M., Bruce J., 2007;), for the&#xD;
      open wound healing recurrence occur in 3-8% of the operated. For primary wound healing in&#xD;
      7,5-9,7% required re-surgery (V.K. An, 2003; A.A. Kartashev, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease overwhelmingly affects people, mostly young working&#xD;
      age, and treatment failure leads to long-term temporary disability of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years continue to discuss methods of one-time or multi-stage radical surgical&#xD;
      treatment of pilonidal sinus, but to date there is no single approach to the choice of&#xD;
      surgical treatment for this disease (V.L. Denisenko, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success of surgical treatment of SPD depends on the development and introduction of new&#xD;
      devices and techniques exist to produce convergence and immobilization of the wound edges,&#xD;
      thereby obtaining its primary healing and a significant reduction of wound surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high frequency of the disease and postoperative complications, as well as long-term&#xD;
      temporary disability of patients demonstrates the relevance of the development of modern&#xD;
      methods of radical surgery of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease (V.I. Pomazkin, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF RESEARCH. The aim of our research is to improve the results of complex radical&#xD;
      surgical treatment of patients of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease through the&#xD;
      development and introduction of new devices and techniques for convergence and immobilization&#xD;
      wound edges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TASKS OF RESEARCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a comparative analysis the most common surgical treatment of SPD in the&#xD;
           frequency of complications in the intra- and postoperative periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop a device for convergence and immobilization wound edges in patients with SPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze the effectiveness of the developed techniques and devices in comparison with&#xD;
           traditional surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To make practical recommendations on the options and methods of using the developed&#xD;
           methods and devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOVELTY OF RESEARCH. For the first time, based on the design and creation of an&#xD;
      approximation-immobilization device (RU Patent № 112020, Bull. № 1, 01.10.2012) will be&#xD;
      improved the surgical treatment of patients with this pathology, clinical and anatomical&#xD;
      study of the proposed device for different configurations of gluteal-sacrococcygeal region,&#xD;
      as well as the analysis and justification of the basic parameters of wound (length, depth and&#xD;
      width of the wound, the number of stitches, the complication rate , the area of the wound).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developed a method of closure of the wound defect after radical excision of pilonidal sinus&#xD;
      by Krivonosov-Brezhnev (RU Patent № 2,464,943, Bull. № 30 from 10.27.12.), that significantly&#xD;
      reduces the risk of postoperative complications in patients with acute inflammation of the&#xD;
      SPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first time an analysis of postoperative period in patients operated with the proposed&#xD;
      methods compared with traditional methods of surgery was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSSIBLE APPLICATION AREAS. Results of the research designed for use in the treatment process&#xD;
      of coloproctological departments at all levels, as well as the learning process of medical&#xD;
      schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED EFFECTIVENESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Scientific and technical effect: developed new techniques and devices for convergence&#xD;
           and immobilization wound edges used for the treatment patients with SPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical and social effects: the introduction into clinical practice of the developed&#xD;
           techniques and devices will improve the results of surgical treatment of patients with&#xD;
           SPD by rigid fixation of wound edges, by reducing the time of postoperative wound&#xD;
           healing, by decreasing the risk of complications in the early postoperative period.&#xD;
