    <textblock>
      Resect and discard (RD) is a new paradigm for management of diminutive colorectal polyps&#xD;
      wherein histology is determined by real-time endoscopic imaging; polyps are then resected and&#xD;
      discarded rather than sent for histopathological review. The aims of this study were to&#xD;
      compare the surveillance recommendations between RD and the standard of care where polyps are&#xD;
      sent for histopathological review in a mixed setting of academic and community&#xD;
      gastroenterologists and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an RD program for&#xD;
      management of diminutive polyps.&#xD;

      Introduction: Diminutive (≤5 mm) colorectal polyps are prevalent in the screening population&#xD;
      but have low risk for harboring advanced villous or dysplastic components and for developing&#xD;
      into colorectal cancer. &quot;Resect and discard&quot; (RD) is a new paradigm for management of these&#xD;
      diminutive polyps wherein histology is determined by real-time endoscopic imaging; polyps are&#xD;
      then resected and discarded rather than sent for histopathological review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study were to compare the surveillance recommendations between RD and&#xD;
      the standard of care where polyps are sent for histopathological review in a mixed setting of&#xD;
      academic and community gastroenterologists and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an&#xD;
      RD program for management of diminutive polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective, observational study conducted in a single outpatient&#xD;
      endoscopy center over 12 months. Screening and surveillance colonoscopies were performed by&#xD;
      four academic and two community gastroenterologists. All diminutive polyps (defined as ≤5 mm)&#xD;
      were endoscopically imaged and histology predictions (adenoma vs. non-adenomatous polyp) were&#xD;
      made using high-definition white light (HDWL) with/without narrow band imaging (NBI) at the&#xD;
      discretion of the endoscopist. Diagnostic performance and accordance of recommended&#xD;
      surveillance intervals from endoscopic imaging were compared to histopathological review of&#xD;
      the polyps.&#xD;
