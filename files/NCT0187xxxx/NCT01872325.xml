  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to help 9-1-1 emergency medical dispatchers save the lives&#xD;
      of more cardiac arrest victims. The investigators will develop teaching tools to help the&#xD;
      dispatchers recognize abnormal breathing that may indicate a victim as having a cardiac&#xD;
      arrest. After training sessions, the investigators will see if dispatchers can get better at&#xD;
      recognizing abnormal breathing, how often they give CPR instructions, and if use of the&#xD;
      teaching tool will increase bystander CPR and the number of victims leaving the hospital&#xD;
      alive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in Canada; it is defined as the sudden cessation&#xD;
      of cardiac mechanical activity. It is uniformly fatal if not treated within minutes. More&#xD;
      than 85% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) occur in residential locations so public&#xD;
      access to automatic external defibrillators, to restart the heart, are not helpful. The&#xD;
      overall rate of survival for OOHCA rarely exceeds 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is chest compression and ventilations provided&#xD;
      by someone not on the emergency response team. A victim or cardiac arrest is almost 4 times&#xD;
      more likely to survive when receiving bystander CPR. However, despite various attempts to&#xD;
      improve bystander rates they have remained low, not exceeding 15% in Ontario. It has been&#xD;
      shown that since the ambulance dispatch centres in Ontario implemented dispatch-assisted CPR&#xD;
      instructions (given to callers while emergency vehicles were on the way), there was a&#xD;
      significant increase in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency medical dispatchers can identify about 70% of OOHCA cases over the phone. Agonal&#xD;
      breathing (laboured breathing preceding death) may be misinterpreted as a sign of life, and&#xD;
      is responsible for as much as 50% of missed diagnoses. There is no specific training on the&#xD;
      significance of this sign, and minimal information about recognizing cardiac arrest. An&#xD;
      educational intervention designed to better understand the significance of agonal breathing&#xD;
      and to clarify the existing CPR instruction protocol will most likely increase the frequency&#xD;
      of CPR instructions, bystander CPR rates, and potentially survival of victims of cardiac&#xD;
      arrest.&#xD;
