  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glutathione is an important antioxidant protein which protects cells from harmful oxidative&#xD;
      stress. Elderly humans are known to have elevated oxidative stress and deficiency of&#xD;
      glutathione, but it is not known whether there is deficient synthesis of glutathione in&#xD;
      muscle tissue of elderly humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondria are engines of cells where food consumed is burned to make energy. Under normal&#xD;
      conditions the fuel of choice in the fasted state is fat, but fasted elderly humans are not&#xD;
      able to oxidize fat as well as healthy young humans. Elderly humans also have the highest&#xD;
      incidence and prevalence of being overweight and obese, and have increased storage of fat in&#xD;
      liver and muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help determine whether&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. elderly humans have diminished synthesis of glutathione in the skeletal muscle, and&#xD;
           whether this can be improved by supplementing cysteine and glycine (and not an&#xD;
           isonitrogenous placebo) in the diet;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improving muscle glutathione concentrations can also improve fuel oxidation in aging;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. improvement of intracellular glutathione concentrations will be associated with a change&#xD;
           in total body fat content&#xD;

      Subjects will be recruited by written informed consent on forms approved by the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board of Baylor College of Medicine at the time of approval of the full protocol.&#xD;
      Subjects taking an nonvitamin supplements or lipid lowering medications will stop this 4&#xD;
      weeks before the screening labs and for the entire duration of the study. Fasted subjects&#xD;
      will have screening labs (blood count, HbA1c, lipid profile, liver profile, blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen, Creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone, free t4, cortisol) followed by an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test, measures of muscle strength by dynamometry, tests of function&#xD;
      (including a 6-min walk test) and body composition scans to measure total body fat. On&#xD;
      another occasion, fasted subjects will be undergo stable isotope infusions and other studies&#xD;
      in the metabolic research unit to measure concentrations of amino-acids and glutathione in&#xD;
      red blood cells and muscle tissue, glutathione synthesis rates in muscle and red cells,&#xD;
      plasma and whole-body mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation, Kreb's cycle function, urine urea&#xD;
      nitrogen, plasma reactive oxygen species and F2-isoprostanes, genes of glutathione synthesis&#xD;
      and fuel oxidation. Elderly subjects will also have magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan for&#xD;
      liver and muscle fat content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young subjects will be given dietary cysteine and glycine for 2-weeks and be restudied&#xD;
      2-weeks later. They are then released from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly subjects will be studied for 16 weeks. They will be assigned to receive either&#xD;
      cysteine plus glycine, or alanine in a randomized, double-blinded study design. The studies&#xD;
      described above will be repeated after 2 weeks and 16 weeks. Subjects will have monthly&#xD;
      measures of liver profile, lipid profiles, BUN and creatinine and glutathione.&#xD;
