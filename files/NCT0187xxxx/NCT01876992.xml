    <textblock>
      The investigators know that metformin works at the level of the cells in the body by acting&#xD;
      on a protein called Cyclic amine monophosphate- Response Binding Elements (CREB) binding&#xD;
      protein or Constitutive Reverter of eIF2α Phosphorylation (CREP) Binding Protein (CBP). What&#xD;
      the investigators do not know is how this process is affected when the dose of the metformin&#xD;
      is increased or changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the same doses of metformin are often used in both children and adults, but it is&#xD;
      possible that the dose of metformin should be based on age and weight. Understanding how CBP&#xD;
      works could potentially help us to tailor metformin treatment individually for patients based&#xD;
      on their age, weight and CBP response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our studies have shown that metformin acts at the cellular level by acting on a target&#xD;
      protein, Cyclic amine monophosphate-Response Binding Elements (CREB) binding protein or CREP&#xD;
      Binding Protein (CBP). Patients are treated with many different doses of metformin, some&#xD;
      patients respond well to low doses while others require much higher doses. The investigators&#xD;
      do not understand why this may be and are interested in knowing if the investigators can&#xD;
      treat patents effectively with low doses. What the investigators do not know is how this&#xD;
      process is affected when the dose of the metformin is increased or changed. Changes in&#xD;
      metformin's target protein will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, currently the same doses of metformin are often used in both children and adults, but&#xD;
      it is possible that the dose of metformin should be based on age and weight. Understanding&#xD;
      how CBP works could potentially help us to tailor metformin treatment individually for&#xD;
      patients based on their age, weight and CBP response.&#xD;

    <description>The BMI is an index measure of body weight and is used to define states of obesity. Height ( in meters) and weight (in Kilograms) are used to calculate a BMI (kg/m2).</description>

    <measure>Fasting Blood Glucose.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. If a subject has a blood sugar of 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests, they are diagnosed with diabetes. Metformin decreases fasting blood sugar.</description>

    <measure>Effect of Dose Escalation</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the effect of dose escalation of metformin on CBP phosphorylation in white blood cells in both in vivo and ex vivo assays to subsequent physiological changes in vivo for adults and children. CBP phosphorylation will be measured by western blot analysis using a probe that is specific for the phosphorylated CBP protein. The outcome will be the % difference between the patient before starting metformin and at each dose increment.</description>

          <description>Doses will be increased incrementally. Decisions to escalate the metformin dose will be made based upon tolerability of side effects as described in the schedule of evaluations to follow. All subjects will be monitored for safety while receiving metformin. Any participant with blood glucose of &lt;60mg/dl at any time while receiving metformin will have therapy stopped and will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;

          <title>Obese Controls</title>
          <description>Three obese but otherwise healthy adult participants will be recruited into the study as controls. These will be individuals who are not currently (or previously) on any diabetic medication including metformin.&#xD;
There will be a single study visit and no medication will be administered. They will be administered a meal and pre and post-prandial blood samples will be drawn.</description>
