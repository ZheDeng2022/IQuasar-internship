    <textblock>
      Little is known on the prevalence of sleep disorders and their role in the increased&#xD;
      prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in the developing world. We To assess the prevalence of&#xD;
      major sleep disorders in a rural South American population, and to determine whether these&#xD;
      conditions are associated with a poor cardiovascular health or with the occurrence of stroke&#xD;
      or ischemic heart disease. This is a three-phase, population-based, door-to-door survey in&#xD;
      Atahualpa. During phase I, all residents aged ≥40 years will be screened with validated&#xD;
      Spanish versions of five questionnaires to evaluate major sleep disorders. In phase II,&#xD;
      neurologists will examine persons suspected of having a sleep disorder and a random sample of&#xD;
      negative individuals to assess the prevalence of these conditions and to validate the&#xD;
      accuracy of questionnaires. In phase III, patients with a confirmed sleep disorder will&#xD;
      undergo nocturnal polysomnography for achieving a more specific diagnosis. The occurrence of&#xD;
      sleep disorders will be correlated with the cardiovascular health of the population as well&#xD;
      as with the presence of stroke and ischemic heart disease. This epidemiological study may&#xD;
      prove cost-effective in improving sleep conditions of people living in rural areas of&#xD;
      developing countries, and may be used as a model for the evaluation of sleep disorders and&#xD;
      their cardiovascular correlates in these populations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For the purposes of the present part of the Atahualpa Project, field personnel were trained&#xD;
      to achieve expertise with the use of the screening questionnaires, and to assure uniformity&#xD;
      in data collection. The independent review board of Hospital-Clínica Kennedy (Guayaquil,&#xD;
      Ecuador) approved the study design and the informed consent form that has to be signed by all&#xD;
      Atahualpa residents aged ≥40 years before enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field workers will perform a census of the population to detect all Atahualpa residents aged&#xD;
      ≥40 years (including those who were not living at the village by the time of our previous&#xD;
      census). Those &quot;new&quot; persons will be interviewed to assess their social and demographic&#xD;
      characteristics and to evaluate their CVH status in the same way as it was done with the rest&#xD;
      of the population in our most recent survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the current survey, all consented persons will undergo a physical examination with&#xD;
      attention to the measurement of the neck circumference, as well as the evaluation of facial&#xD;
      characteristics relevant to the coexistence of sleep disorders, including retrognathia, nasal&#xD;
      septum deviation, asymmetry of the nares, and palate position. The latter will be evaluated&#xD;
      with the tongue resting inside the mouth (using the Friedman classification) and categorized&#xD;
      into four classes according to which structures are visible: Grade I allows visualization of&#xD;
      the entire uvula and tonsils/pillars, Grade II allows visualization of the uvula but not the&#xD;
      tonsils/pillars, Grade III allows visualization of the soft palate but not the uvula, and&#xD;
      Grade IV allows visualization of the hard palate only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the many questionnaires available for the detection of persons with suspected sleep&#xD;
      disorders, our panel agreed to choose those that have been more widely used and have shown to&#xD;
      be time-efficient, consistent and reliable for prediction of major sleep disorders. Field&#xD;
      instruments include validated Spanish versions of the insomnia severity index, the Pittsburgh&#xD;
      sleep quality index, the Epworth sleepiness scale, the Berlin questionnaire, and the four&#xD;
      minimal diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insomnia severity index consists of seven questions evaluating nighttime sleep&#xD;
      difficulties, sleep dissatisfaction, and impact of insomnia on the quality of life.&#xD;
      Time-frame of such evaluation is in the two weeks before the test. Each question is rated on&#xD;
      a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) with a maximum total&#xD;
      score of 28. Scores from 0 to 7 mean no clinically significant insomnia, 8 to 14 mean&#xD;
      subthreshold insomnia, 15 to 21 mean moderate clinical insomnia, and 22 to 28 mean severe&#xD;
      clinical insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pittsburgh sleep quality index basically discriminates between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor&quot;&#xD;
      sleepers. Time-frame of such evaluation is in the month before the test. It consists of 18&#xD;
      questions grouped into seven component scores, each weighted on a 0 to 3 scale, for a total&#xD;
      score of 21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality. Components include&#xD;
      assessment of sleep duration (total sleep time), sleep disturbances, sleep latency, day&#xD;
      dysfunction due to sleepiness, sleep efficiency, overall sleep quality, and medications&#xD;
      needed to sleep. Total sleep time will be categorized as follows: &lt;6 hours, 6 to 7 hours, 7&#xD;
      to 8 hours (referent category), 8 to 9 hours, and &gt;9 hours. The original instrument also&#xD;
      includes five additional questions that should be directed to bedpartners or roommates. Such&#xD;
      questions will not be used in the present survey as they are not included in the scoring and&#xD;
      have not been validated in the Spanish language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Epworth sleepiness scale originally evaluates the level of a person's daytime sleepiness&#xD;
      based on the likelihood of dozing in eight different sedentary situations, and is used to&#xD;
      help diagnose hypersomnia or sleep-disordered breathing such as obstructive sleep apnea. Each&#xD;
      of the eight questions is rated on a four point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no chance of&#xD;
      falling asleep) to 3 (high chance of falling asleep) with a maximum total score of 24. While&#xD;
      there has been noted a considerable overlap among scores and the chance of sleep-disordered&#xD;
      breathing, it has been shown that a score of ≥10 highly correlates with the presence of&#xD;
      severe obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Berlin questionnaire mainly evaluates sleep-disordered breathing (obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea), but also assess waketime sleepiness or fatigue and the presence of obesity or&#xD;
      arterial hypertension. It consists of 10 questions, divided in three categories. The first&#xD;
      five questions are included into category 1, questions from six to eight into category 2, and&#xD;
      question 10 in category 3 (question nine is evaluated separately). A positive response to two&#xD;
      questions of the first 2 categories, or to the single question of category 3, marks the&#xD;
      corresponding category as &quot;positive&quot;, and positivity of two or more categories classifies the&#xD;
      person as at &quot;high risk&quot; for having obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four minimal diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome were developed to facilitate&#xD;
      the recognition of this sleep-related movement disorder. All four questions must be positive&#xD;
      to establish the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of this epidemiological survey, a board-certified sleep neurologist&#xD;
      (P.R.C.) will provisionally move to Atahualpa to examine all persons who screened as&#xD;
      suspected cases of having a sleep disorder (in one or more of the field instruments used). In&#xD;
      addition, a random sample of 2% of individuals who were considered negative during the&#xD;
      screening phase (matched by age and gender to suspected cases) will also undergo a&#xD;
      specialized examination to assess possible false negative cases during the survey.&#xD;
      Neurologists will be blinded as to whether the individual was positive or negative during the&#xD;
      screening phase. All these persons will be evaluated with a unified sleep history focusing on&#xD;
      sleep-related symptoms, associated nocturnal symptoms, time during the sleep period that&#xD;
      symptoms occur, daytime functioning, sleep schedule, and the use of sleep medications; in&#xD;
      addition, a complete physical and neurological examination will be performed. For persons&#xD;
      with suspected restless legs syndrome, questions will be directed to assess frequency and&#xD;
      severity of symptoms, age of symptoms onset, and family history of restless legs syndrome. In&#xD;
      additions, mimics of this condition will be ruled out (leg cramps, positional discomfort,&#xD;
      fibromyalgia, arthritis, neuropathies, claudication, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation of the presence of specific sleep disorders with the CVH status as well as with&#xD;
      history of stroke or ischemic heart disease will be noted. Procedures that will be used for&#xD;
      evaluation of the CVH status and for the diagnosis of stroke and ischemic heart disease will&#xD;
      be the same that have been previously used during step one of the Atahualpa Project. In&#xD;
      brief, CVH status will be evaluated using the seven metrics proposed by the American Heart&#xD;
      Association, stroke will be diagnosed in patients who had experienced a rapidly developing&#xD;
      event characterized by clinical signs of focal or global disturbance of cerebral function,&#xD;
      lasting ≥ 24 hours, with no apparent cause other than vascular, and ischemic heart disease&#xD;
      will be diagnosed if the person is positive by clinical judgment or ECG findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third phase, all patients with a confirmed diagnosed of a sleep disorder will be&#xD;
      invited to undergo an attended nocturnal polysomnography that will objectively evaluate the&#xD;
      presence of sleep-disordered breathing, as well as well as other sleep disorders. EEG&#xD;
      activity, nocturnal movements, cardiac rhythm, and oxygen saturation. Studies will be&#xD;
      performed in the Community Center of The Atahualpa Project, with multiple channel recordings,&#xD;
      including: electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, electromyogram on chin and legs,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, body position sensors, nasal and oral airflow, oxygen saturation, video&#xD;
      and audio recording, and may involve trials of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or&#xD;
      other investigations.&#xD;
