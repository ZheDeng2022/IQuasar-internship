    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is evaluating if a patient-specific experimental therapy for metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma will lengthen survival with minimal harmful effects. It is called an experimental&#xD;
      therapy (or &quot;study therapy&quot;) because it is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA). This research study will use the patient's own tumor cells,the&#xD;
      patient's own dendritic cells (a type of immune cell), and a granulocyte-macrophage colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF, a type of growth factor). GM-CSF is a natural growth factor that&#xD;
      stimulates growth of white blood cells in the body. Since 1991, GM-CSF has been used as a&#xD;
      standard treatment to help increase the number of white blood cells after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's dendritic cells are grown in a test-tube with the patient's tumor cells and the&#xD;
      growth factor. The resulting solution is called the study therapy. The intent of the study&#xD;
      therapy is to make the dendritic cells more effective at fighting the tumor when they are&#xD;
      injected back into the patient.&#xD;

             antibiotics (patients are eligible after antibiotics have been discontinued for at&#xD;

             stereotactic radiotherapy are considered controlled, unless patient requires&#xD;
             pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids. It is recognized that tumor necrosis may be&#xD;
             confused with tumor progression in interpretation of Brain MRI.&#xD;
