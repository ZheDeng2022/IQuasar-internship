  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) is one of the most severe rare inherited&#xD;
      skin disorders affecting children and adults. Current medical care protocols for RDEB&#xD;
      patients are limited to palliative procedures to treat blistering and erosive lesions,&#xD;
      wounds, and severe local and systemic complications such as fusion and contracture of the&#xD;
      digits, skin cancer, esophageal stricture, severe anemia, infections, malnutrition and growth&#xD;
      retardation. However, current medical treatments still cannot prevent the recurrence of the&#xD;
      lesions arising from defective expression of type VII collagen (COL7A1), the main constituent&#xD;
      of anchoring fibrils which form essential structures for dermal-epidermal adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the capacity of keratinocytes and fibroblasts to&#xD;
      repair skin wounds in patients suffering from Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa&#xD;
      (RDEB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the perspective of future therapeutic interventions, which could involve protein, cellular&#xD;
      and/or gene therapy, it is essential to investigate RDEB patients with regards to their&#xD;
      immune tolerance to type VII collagen and their capacity of their cells for tissue&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;

      All patients will have a blood sample of 5 ml on EDTA, 10 ml on heparin and 5 ml on dry tube&#xD;
      collected for genomic DNA extraction to identify or verify COL7A1 mutations: mutation&#xD;
      screening of the patients will be performed to identify COL7A1 mutations on both alleles. 2)&#xD;
      HLA genotyping: patients selected on the clinical and molecular criteria will be&#xD;
      HLA-genotyped by PCR to determine the likelihood of an immune response to the type VII&#xD;
      collagen wild-type protein. A 5-mm punch skin biopsy performed under local anaesthesic will&#xD;
      be undertaken during visit 1 for diagnostic purposes .The consequences of COL7A1 mutations on&#xD;
      collagen VII protein expression will be determined, if not performed previously. Two&#xD;
      additional 5-mm punch skin biopsies will be taken from different areas from up to 10 patients&#xD;
      during the second visit. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts will be expanded and stored in&#xD;
      vapor-phase liquid-nitrogen.&#xD;
