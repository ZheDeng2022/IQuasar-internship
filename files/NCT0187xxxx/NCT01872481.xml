    <textblock>
      Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) is a neuropathic chronic syndrome, characterized by a painful&#xD;
      sensation in a body part that has been amputated. The incidence of phantom limb pain is&#xD;
      between 50-80% of all amputees, however, additional risk factors as psychological trauma,&#xD;
      blood loss, and infection increases its incidence after a traumatic amputation in landmine&#xD;
      victims. Satisfactory management is often difficult to achieve and different clinical trials&#xD;
      with medical and surgical measures have yielded unsatisfactory results. The response rate&#xD;
      with pharmacologic treatment is around 30% using conventional medication as opiates and&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, which is not significantly different from&#xD;
      response rates with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent case series have shown that repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) of the&#xD;
      motor cortex can display an effectiveness that goes from 52% to 88% in the treatment of some&#xD;
      refractory neurogenic pain cases which is quite superior to conventional management. However,&#xD;
      the use of this type of treatment has not been studied in patients with phantom limb pain&#xD;
      secondary to landmine injuries. The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of rTMS in the treatment of phantom limb pain in landmine victims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, including 54 landmine victims&#xD;
      with PLP will be performed. At the time of enrollment, a complete medical evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed and those patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two groups, to receive rTMS in series of 20 trains of 6 s in duration (54-s intertrain&#xD;
      interval) at a stimulation rate of 10 Hz (1200 pulses) and an intensity of 90% rest motor&#xD;
      threshold using an &quot;active&quot; coil or a &quot;sham&quot; coil. Sessions will be administered 5 days a&#xD;
      week (Monday to Friday) during two consecutive weeks. The stimulation will be directed to the&#xD;
      primary motor cortex contralateral to the amputated limb. Response will be evaluated by&#xD;
      measuring the pain intensity at baseline and after each session using a visual analog scale.&#xD;
      These measurements will be repeated 2 weeks after the end of the treatment scheme, in order&#xD;
      to determine the duration of the analgesic effect of rTMS&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background In 2007 Colombia was one of the five countries in the world with the highest&#xD;
      number of anti-personnel landmine victims [1]. These are small devices designed to injure or&#xD;
      kill people and animals by exploding when a minimum pressure is exerted on them&#xD;
      (approximately 6 Force-Kg) [2]. Between 1999 and 2008 there were 6696 reported incidents with&#xD;
      these artifacts in Colombia, partly due to an intensified civil war conflict in this period&#xD;
      of time, however, it is estimated that the number of affected subjects might be higher due to&#xD;
      underreporting [1]. This problem has had an enormous impact on Public Health in Colombia,&#xD;
      aggravated by the fact that victims, often children or young adults, frequently suffer&#xD;
      significant degrees of physical and psychological disabilities, leading to an increase in the&#xD;
      number of healthy life years (DALYs) lost in our population, together with important&#xD;
      secondary economic impacts [1-5]. Anderson et al [3] estimated that the quality of life is&#xD;
      affected in 25 to 87% of families with a relative victim of a landmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the multiple physical and psychological disabilities and sequels derived from landmines&#xD;
      [6-8], one of the most important consequences is the chronic neuropathic pain secondary to&#xD;
      amputation. Ketz conducted a retrospective study among 30 soldiers wounded in combat, finding&#xD;
      a prevalence of 77% of Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) after traumatic amputation [9]. The factors&#xD;
      associated with development of neuropathic pain in these patients include central and&#xD;
      peripheral phenomena [10-12]. The direct damage to the involved tissue produces inflammation,&#xD;
      and in some cases infection which induces the release of several molecules, such as hydrogen,&#xD;
      potassium and arachidonic acid, which in turn, activate and sensitize pain receptors, leading&#xD;
      to exaggerated responses to any minimal painful stimuli [11]. Another proposed mechanism for&#xD;
      the development of PLP is the fact that damaged peripheral nerve tissues grows into so-called&#xD;
      &quot;neuromas&quot; [13, 14]. These have shown to express a greater density of sodium channels in&#xD;
      their cell membranes, increasing the activity of peripheral nociceptors [15]. This increased&#xD;
      activity leads to changes in the synaptic structure of neurons located in the dorsal horn of&#xD;
      the spinal cord, increasing their excitability as well as reducing the frequency and&#xD;
      intensity of their inhibitory processes [11, 16]. Besides spinal and peripheral changes,&#xD;
      encephalic alterations have also been found [17-24]. Melzack introduced the neuromatrix&#xD;
      theory, which suggested that pain is a multidimensional experience, which involves a large&#xD;
      neural network that enables the integration and simultaneous processing of information from&#xD;
      multiple peripheral receptors with the processed information permanently in these neural&#xD;
      circuits, emphasizing the importance of central structures in all aspects of pain [25]. In&#xD;
      addition, Merzenich et al [26] conducted a study in adult monkeys, finding that after&#xD;
      amputation of a limb, the primary somatosensory cortex seems to rearrange itself in the&#xD;
      cortical areas representing the amputated limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high prevalence of PLP after amputation has led to major efforts in order to lessen the&#xD;
      pain in affected patients. However, results using conventional medical treatment, including&#xD;
      opiates, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and surgery, are poor, with an&#xD;
      general efficacy rate of about 30%, not statistically better than placebo [20, 27-33].&#xD;
      Recently, it has been proposed that repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) can&#xD;
      be an effective alternative in the treatment of neuropathic pain [34].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rTMS is a non-invasive stimulation technique of the human brain that generates a small&#xD;
      magnetic field of high intensity through a brief electrical current generated by a magnetic&#xD;
      coil placed over the head of the individual [35, 36]. The electric currents induced in the&#xD;
      cerebral cortex run in a parallel plane to the plane of the stimulation, in such a way that&#xD;
      this stimulation affects mainly those brain elements of the cerebral cortex activating the&#xD;
      pyramidal cells transinaptically (37). The use of high frequency rTMS (&gt; 1Hz) raises the&#xD;
      blood flow in the stimulated area, inducing an increased brain activity. On the other hand,&#xD;
      low-frequency stimulation (&lt;1 Hz) reduces brain activity [38, 39]. In addition to vascular&#xD;
      changes, the rTMS may induce modifications in several hormonal axes and even in the&#xD;
      production of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine serotonin, arginine, NMDA, taurine and&#xD;
      aspartate [40-43]. Additionally it was found that rTMS may regulate the expression of some&#xD;
      genes including c-fos and c-jun, which are vital structural components of the activator&#xD;
      protein 1, a special transcription factor that helps to regulate cellular processes including&#xD;
      differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The rTMS also helps to modulate some peptide&#xD;
      biosynthetic pathways, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial fibrillary&#xD;
      acidic protein (GFAP), important molecules for neuronal plasticity processes [42-44]. Using&#xD;
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Li et al [45], observed that stimulation with&#xD;
      1Hz rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex induced an immediate increase in the&#xD;
      local blood flow, followed by perfusion of the bilateral middle prefrontal cortex, right&#xD;
      orbital frontal cortex, left hippocampus, middorsal nucleus of the thalamus, bilateral&#xD;
      putamen, pulvinar and insula. These previous observations suggest that in addition to&#xD;
      producing local changes in the stimulated cerebral cortex, rTMS might also influence the&#xD;
      activity of other cortical and sub-cortical regions through different brain circuits and&#xD;
      connections [46, 47].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported side effects of rTMS are minor events, mainly related with cephalagia, changes in&#xD;
      the stimulation threshold of hearing, tinnitus, local erythema, syncopal episodes and in some&#xD;
      cases mild and transient cognitive disorders related to the area stimulated [48-51]. The most&#xD;
      important complication described has been possible induction of seizures (&lt;0.1%); however&#xD;
      these seizures have not been associated with sequels or with development of epilepsy [52-54].&#xD;
      There are some medical and non-medical contraindications to its use, such as, the presence of&#xD;
      metal endo-cranial, cardiac pacemakers or hearing, as well as cardiac arrhythmias,&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension, use of medications that lower the seizures threshold and personal&#xD;
      or family history of epilepsy [55].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rTMS was first used on small groups of patients suffering of chronic neuropathic pain&#xD;
      secondary to trigeminal neuralgia or brachial plexus injury [56-58]. Lefaucheur et al [56]&#xD;
      conducted a study in 18 patients with an average age of 54 years, presenting chronic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain of one hand, resistant to drug treatment. The patients were randomized for&#xD;
      three twenty minute sessions of rTMS, one with a low frequency (0.5 Hz) magnetic stimulation,&#xD;
      other with high frequency (10 Hz) and the other with sham coil to evaluate the placebo&#xD;
      effect. The level of pain before and after each session was evaluated by using the Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS). In this study it was determined that patients undergoing a 10-Hz rTMS&#xD;
      perceived a more significant reduction of the pain compared with subjects who received a&#xD;
      stimulation with 0.5 Hz rTMS or with those who only received placebo treatment. Subsequently,&#xD;
      Lefaucheur et al [57] replicated these results in a group of 60 patients with neuropathic&#xD;
      pain secondary to thalamic infarction, brachial plexus injury or trigeminal nerve injury, who&#xD;
      underwent two sessions of high frequency rTMS separated by three weeks, concluding that 65%&#xD;
      of the patients reported some improvement of their symptoms. The same author conducted a&#xD;
      study that included 36 patients with neuropathic pain secondary to either brachial plexus or&#xD;
      trigeminal nerve injuries. All of them received high frequency rTMS. The first one during two&#xD;
      sessions and the latter received three sessions. As in the previous studies the level of pain&#xD;
      was evaluated, before each session and one week after, using the VAS. The best response to&#xD;
      pain was obtained between the second and fourth day after the initial treatment and this&#xD;
      improvement was maintained for a period of seven days [59].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;

      who have had one of their lower limbs amputated and display classical symptoms of PLP. The&#xD;
      patients will be recruited from the physical rehabilitation service at the Hospital&#xD;
      Universitario de Santander (HUS), Bucaramanga, Colombia and local Non-Governmental&#xD;
      Organizations (NGOs). Those who consent to participate, fulfill screening criteria and don't&#xD;
      present any exclusion criteria will be included in the study.&#xD;

           their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study development&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will include the following activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acquisition of the materials required for the development of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Elaboration of flyers, promotional and educative material, manual of procedures and Case&#xD;
           Report Format (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Training of personnel that will participate in the study 5. Randomization of treatment&#xD;
      Randomization of the treatment will be performed by an epidemiologist of the Fundación&#xD;
      Cardiovascular de Colombia (FCV). It will be done in blocks, in order to avoid long sequences&#xD;
      of patients assigned to the same group and to reduce some of the bias inherent to the simple&#xD;
      randomization process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Phase Patients will attend the screening visit at the FCV or at offices of the&#xD;
      physicians involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit During this visit a complete medical check-up, based on universally accepted&#xD;
      techniques, will evaluate neuropathic compromise, medications and other therapies used for&#xD;
      the treatment of PLP. The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be applied by a neurologist and&#xD;
      the selected candidates will be informed about the study. It will be asked to patients to&#xD;
      avoid consumption of new analgesic medications during the study development. If one patient&#xD;
      requires the introduction of a new analgesic treatment for increased pain or concept of the&#xD;
      physician, this will be recorded and taken into consideration in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial and Follow-up Visits The selected patients will be scheduled for the initial visit.&#xD;
      In this visit, information about the patient's medical history, educational level,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status and general condition will be collected by a physician. In addition, a&#xD;
      physical therapist will perform a baseline assessment of neuropathic pain using a VAS. Each&#xD;
      patient will be randomized to receive rTMS, using a biphasic pulse stimulator (Magstim&#xD;
      Company Ltd, Whitland, UK), in series of 20 trains of 6 s in duration (54-s intertrain&#xD;
      interval) at a stimulation rate of 10 Hz (1200 pulses) at an intensity of 90% rest motor&#xD;
      threshold using an &quot;active&quot; coil or a &quot;sham&quot; coil. Sessions will be administered five days a&#xD;
      week during two consecutive weeks. The stimulation will be directed to the primary motor&#xD;
      cortex contralateral to the amputated limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluators and those responsible for applying the pain evaluation scales will be&#xD;
      blind to the assigned group. The rTMS will be performed by a non-blinded member of the&#xD;
      research group. The patients included in the study should not have prior knowledge of the&#xD;
      technical details of rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be evaluated by measuring the pain intensity at baseline and after each session&#xD;
      using a VAS. These measurements will be repeated 2 weeks after the ending of the treatment&#xD;
      scheme, in order to determine the duration of the analgesic effect of rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data base depuration phase Each patient will be identified using an internal code. The study&#xD;
      coordinator will monitor the proper collection of data, taking into account that the&#xD;
      information contained on the forms is complete and accurate. Also, he/she will keep a record&#xD;
      of the visits performed during the study and verify that the data collection is performed in&#xD;
      a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing all the data entry to the CRF the results will be audited and the detected&#xD;
      errors evaluated and corrected. The information will be entered in two different databases by&#xD;
      two different people and the records compared to detect any discrepancy. The mistakes will be&#xD;
      corrected according to the CRF, and the corrections registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis For the statistical analysis, Stata 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station,&#xD;
      TX, USA) will be used. The descriptive analysis will be composed of medians and proportions&#xD;
      according to the nature of the variables, with their respective 95% confidence intervals. As&#xD;
      a dispersion measurement the Standard Deviation will be calculated. The distribution of the&#xD;
      variables will be studied using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the homoscedasticity of the&#xD;
      variances with the Levene test. To detect any difference between the groups, a T-test or a&#xD;
      Mann Whitney test will be performed according to the distribution of the variables. The&#xD;
      categorical variables will be compared using the Chi Squared test or the exact Fisher's test.&#xD;
      If required, a multiple logistic regression or a covariance analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment the following endpoints will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percentage reduction in the intensity of neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presence of adverse events related to the administration of rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Report The results of the study will be evaluated and discussed and a final report&#xD;
      presented to the Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation&#xD;
      (COLCIENCIAS), entity that is sponsoring the project. The results will be submitted for&#xD;
      publication and presented in scientific meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      and the Colombian legislation, following the Ministry Of Health resolution No. 8430/93. Prior&#xD;
      to the admission of the patients in the study, the objectives and the methodology will be&#xD;
      explained and a written informed consent obtained. The present study has been approved by the&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee of the FCV (Act # 197/June 19/2009). The patients' right to&#xD;
      confidentiality will be kept in all the phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation and management of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visits the patients will be asked about the presence of any adverse events. These&#xD;
      will be classified by the physician as serious or non-serious adverse events. A serious&#xD;
      adverse event should meet one or more of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospitalization or prolongation of a current hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Persistent or significant disability&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of a serious adverse event that represents any hazard for the patient and/or&#xD;
      requires immediate medical or surgical intervention will force the discontinuation of the&#xD;
      treatment and initiation of pertinent medical management. The research staff will notify the&#xD;
      Adverse Event Committee (AEC) of the FCV of any serious adverse event within 24 hours of its&#xD;
      documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-serious adverse event will be classified as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild: The patient is aware of his/her symptoms, but those are tolerable. Medical&#xD;
           intervention or specific treatment is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate: The patient presents troubles that interfere with his/her daily activity.&#xD;
           Medical intervention or specific treatment is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe: The patient is unable to work or attend his/her daily activities. Medical&#xD;
           intervention or specific treatment is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible relationship between the adverse events and the tested medication will be&#xD;
      classified by the research staff on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following&#xD;
      definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Definitely related: The event can be fully explained by the administration of the tested&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Probably related: The event is most likely to be explained by the administration of the&#xD;
           tested medication, rather than other medications or the patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Possibly related: The event may be explained by the administration of the tested&#xD;
           medication or other medications, as well as the patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Not related: The event is most likely to be explained by either the patient's condition&#xD;
           or the use of other medications, rather than the one tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All events will be reported to the AEC. Although the project has been designed to minimize&#xD;
      the inherent risks, any adverse event related to the study procedures will be carefully&#xD;
      evaluated by the AEC and the costs generated by its treatment covered by the study's&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
