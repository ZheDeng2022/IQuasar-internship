    <textblock>
      An investigator-initiated, prospective, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized single&#xD;
      institution clinical evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of branched and&#xD;
      fenestrated-branched endovascular stent grafts to preserve branch vessels when used in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms. The study evaluates&#xD;
      non-FDA-approved off the shelf and custom made branched and fenestrated-branched stent grafts&#xD;
      manufactured by Cook Medical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether fenestrated-branched and&#xD;
      branched endovascular grafts are a safe and effective method of treating patients with&#xD;
      thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A branched thoracic endograft is a commercially manufactured endograft that has reinforced&#xD;
      fenestrations or branches in the graft through which covered stent grafts can be deployed to&#xD;
      preserve blood flow into visceral branch vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The branched stent graft is deployed to reline the peri-visceral abdominal aorta. Proximal&#xD;
      and distal fixation and seal can be achieved using the branched device, additional Cook Alpha&#xD;
      Thoracic devices and/or the Cook Zenith® Flex® device depending on the aortic anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the aortic stent grafts are deployed, the branches are then created. Wires and catheters&#xD;
      are used to cross through the reinforced fenestrations into the target visceral arteries.&#xD;
      Covered stents are then deployed to extend from the modified aortic graft to the target&#xD;
      vessel. The branch stents must create a hemostatic seal with the main endograft as these&#xD;
      branches will be constructed within the aneurysm sac. Single or multiple stents may be&#xD;
      required for any given branch.&#xD;

             repair due to one or more major medical co-morbidities (i.e. CAD, CHF, COPD, CRI,&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. The patient has a life expectancy of greater than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has a thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm where necessary visceral branch&#xD;
             vessels (i.e. the celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, renal and/or&#xD;
             dominant spinal arteries) arise from the aneurysm or seal zones necessary for on-label&#xD;
             thoracic endovascular repair&#xD;
