  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal malignancy during pregnancy is estimated to occur in 1 out of 1000 pregnancies.&#xD;
      Controversy exists regarding the effect of pregnancy on cancer prognosis. Gestational&#xD;
      hormones and pregnancy-related growth factors may induce a more aggressive behavior in&#xD;
      malignant cells. However, metastasis to the products of conception is rare. In the current&#xD;
      study investigators wish to analyze the effect of placental explants on cancer cells&#xD;
      (cervical, ovarian, thyroid, melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia and breast)phenotype (cell death,&#xD;
      proliferation, migration , invasion), signaling pathway, mRNA, miRNA and protein expression.&#xD;

      In the Oncogenetic laboratory cancer cells will be exposed to first trimester human placental&#xD;
      explants or to serum collected from pregnant women. As a control cancer cells will be&#xD;
      cultured alone or in the presence of sera collected from young (18-45) non pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placentae, 6-9 weeks gestational age, will be retrieved from terminated normal pregnancies.&#xD;
      The placenta will be taken after pregnancy termination, thus, no harm will be caused for the&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sera will be collected from the women by an authorized physician. It will be taken from:&#xD;
      1. the vein of the non pregnant women and volunteered pregnant women. 2. from the same&#xD;
      branula that will be introduced into the pregnant women as a routine during pregnancy&#xD;
      termination procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following culture investigators will analyze the cancer cells phenotype (cell death,&#xD;
      proliferation, migration, and invasion), signaling pathway, mRNA, miRNA and protein&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sera will be collected from 50 pregnant women and 50 non pregnant women. Placentae will be&#xD;
      collected from 50 pregnant women.&#xD;
