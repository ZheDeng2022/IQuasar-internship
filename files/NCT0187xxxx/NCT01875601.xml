      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite progress, some children and young adults with solid tumors still experience poor&#xD;
           survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activated NK cells potently kill autologous pediatric solid tumors, and clinical grade&#xD;
           procedures are available to generate large numbers of activated NK cells for adoptive&#xD;
           cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objectives are: 1) to assess the feasibility of harvesting and expanding&#xD;
           activated NK cells to meet escalating dose goals in Cohort A, 2) to assess the toxicity&#xD;
           of infusing escalating doses of activated NK cells following lymphodepleting&#xD;
           chemotherapy without rhIL15 (cohort A), and 3) to assess the toxicity of infusing NK&#xD;
           activated cells with escalating doses of rhIL15 (cohort B) in pediatric patients with&#xD;
           refractory malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives are: 1) to identify biologically active doses of activated&#xD;
           autologous NK cells plus or minus rhIL15 by monitoring changes in NK cell number,&#xD;
           phenotype and function, 2) to assess pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of rhIL15 in a&#xD;
           pediatric population, and 3) assess antitumor effects and changes in FDG-PET following&#xD;
           administration of activated NK cells to lymphopenic hosts plus or minus rhIL15. 4) to&#xD;
           evaluate saftey and efficacy of subsequent cycles of autologous NK cell infusions in&#xD;
           patients in cohort A who received benefit from the first NK cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in Cohort A: 2-29 years with with refractory pediatric malignant solid tumors,&#xD;
           Patients in Cohort B: 2-25 years with refractory pediatric malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate performance status and organ function, recovered from toxic effects of prior&#xD;
           therapy, no requirement for systemic corticosteroids and no history of allogeneic stem&#xD;
           cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients receive pre-NK lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A receives escalating doses of activated autologous NK cells to identify&#xD;
           feasibility of generating cells and tolerability, and potentially identify an MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A1: 1x10(6) NK cells/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A2: 1 x 10(7) NK cells/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A3: 1 x 10(8) NK cells/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If feasibility and acceptable toxicity is demonstrated for all doses in Cohort A,&#xD;
           patients enrolled on cohort B will receive activated autologous NK cells plus escalating&#xD;
           doses of rhIL15 using the following schema:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B1: 1 x 10(7) NK cells/kg + rhIL15 0.25 mcg/kg/d IV x 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B2: 1 x 10(7) NK cells/kg + rhIL15 0.5 mcg/kg/d IV x 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B3: 1 x 10(7) NK cells/kg + rhIL15 1 mcg/kg/d IV x 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B4: 1 x 10(7) NK cells/kg + rhIL15 2 mcg/kg/d IV x 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three patients will be enrolled at each dose level, with the dose level expanded to 6 if&#xD;
           dose-limiting toxicity occurs. An expanded group of 12 patients will be treated at the&#xD;
           highest tolerable dose level. DLT toxicity monitoring will continue for 21 days after&#xD;
           the NK infusion, or 14 days after the last rhIL15 dose in Cohort B (whichever is later).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age: Cohort A: 2 to less than or equal to 29 years old at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
             Cohort B: 2 to less than or equal to 25 years old at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evaluable or measurable malignant disease at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient s malignancy must have relapsed after or failed to respond to frontline&#xD;
             curative therapy and/or there must not be any potentially curative treatment options&#xD;
             available at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens. However, patients must&#xD;
             have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to study enrollment. Acute toxicity of any&#xD;
             previous therapy must have resolved to grade 1 or less, unless specified elsewhere.&#xD;
             Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Patients must not have received myelosuppressive&#xD;
             chemotherapy within 3 weeks of enrollment (6 weeks if prior nitrosourea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 7 days must have elapsed since the completion&#xD;
             of therapy with a growth factor. At least 14 days must have elapsed after receiving&#xD;
             pegfilgrastim.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent) or metronomic non-myelosuppressive chemotherapy: At&#xD;
             least 7 days must have elapsed since the completion of therapy with a biologic agent.&#xD;
             For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after&#xD;
             administration, this period prior to enrollment must be extended beyond the time&#xD;
             during which adverse events are known to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Monoclonal antibodies: At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since prior therapy that&#xD;
             included a monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy: 3 weeks must have elapsed since XRT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status: ECOG 0, 1 or 2, or for children less than or equal to10 years of&#xD;
             age, Lansky greater than or equal to 60. Note: Patients who are unable to walk because&#xD;
             of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the&#xD;
             purpose of assessing the performance score.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac function: Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45% or&#xD;
             fractional shortening greater than or equal to28%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver function: Serum total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl, serum AST and ALT less than or equal&#xD;
             to 3 x upper limit of normal. Patients with Gilbert syndrome are excluded from the&#xD;
             requirement of a normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        bilirubin. (Gilbert syndrome is found in 3-10% of the general population, and is&#xD;
        characterized by mild, chronic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver&#xD;
        disease or overt hemolysis). On cohort B, patients with liver involvement by tumor will not&#xD;
        be eligible due to potential confounding risk for hepatotoxicity when rhIL15 is&#xD;
        administered. NOTE: adult values will be used for calculating hepatic toxicity on this&#xD;
        trial, as is standard on POB phase I trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Renal function: Age-adjusted normal serum creatinine according to the following table or&#xD;
        a creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age (years) &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;Maximum serum creatinine (mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
        less than or equal to5 &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;0.8&#xD;
&#xD;
        &gt;5 less than or equal to 10 &lt;TAB&gt; 1.0&#xD;

        &gt;10 less than or equal to 15 &lt;TAB&gt;1.2&#xD;
&#xD;
        &gt; 15 &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Marrow function: ANC must be &gt; 750/mm(3) (unless due to underlying disease in which&#xD;
             case there is no grade restriction), platelet count must be greater than or equal to&#xD;
             75,000/mm(3) (not achieved by transfusion). Lymphopenia, CD4 lymphopenia, leukopenia,&#xD;
             and anemia will not render patients ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients (and when relevant their male partners) must be willing to practice&#xD;
             birth control (including abstinence) during and for two months after treatment, if of&#xD;
             childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to give informed consent. For patients &lt;18 years of age their legal guardian&#xD;
             must give informed consent. Pediatric patients will be included in age-appropriate&#xD;
             discussion in order to obtain verbal assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Durable power of attorney form offered (patients greater than or equal to18 years of&#xD;
             age only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated CNS metastatic disease as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Solid Tumors: History of untreated metastatic CNS tumor involvement. Extradural masses&#xD;
             which have not invaded the brain parenchyma or parameningeal tumors without evidence&#xD;
             for leptomeningeal spread will not render the patient ineligible. Patients with&#xD;
             previous CNS tumor involvement are eligible IF the CNS tumor(s) has been treated and&#xD;
             has been stable or resolving for at least 4 weeks; and if the patient does not&#xD;
             currently require steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast feeding or pregnant females (due to risk to fetus or newborn).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV or HTLV-I/II (due to unacceptable risk associated with severe immune suppression&#xD;
             and risk associated with cell products).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or hepatitis C antibody positive with&#xD;
             elevated liver transaminases. All patients with chronic active hepatitis (including&#xD;
             those on antiviral therapy) are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require systemic corticosteroid or other systemic immunosuppressive&#xD;
             therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy must be stopped at least 28 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Topical agents and/or inhaled corticosteroids are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High risk of inability to comply with therapy in the estimation of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant systemic illness (e.g. serious active infections or significant&#xD;
             vital other organ dysfunction), that in the judgment of the PI would likely compromise&#xD;
             the patient s ability to tolerate protocol therapy or significantly increase the risk&#xD;
             of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of pericarditis or pericardial effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
