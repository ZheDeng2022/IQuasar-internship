  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will test alternative methods of ensuring compliance with recommended&#xD;
      preparation and targeting of supplementary foods for malnourished children under five years&#xD;
      of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses that the proposed study intends to test are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. With appropriate behavior change communication (BCC) and social support, and with&#xD;
           provision of CSB and FVO in the correct proportions, it is possible to get women to&#xD;
           prepare CSB with oil in the recommended ratio of 100:30, and in quantities just&#xD;
           sufficient for the target child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Providing CSB to Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers pre-packaged bags of 2 kg with&#xD;
           appropriate messaging and with instructions to direct the food to children and to&#xD;
           prepare the CSB with oil in the recommended ratio and feed as instructed will result in&#xD;
           better compliance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first stage of the study involves working with the procurement and program staff to&#xD;
      ensure that oil and CSB will be available at the same time in sufficient quantities and can&#xD;
      be distributed together. We will work with program staff and outside consultants (if needed)&#xD;
      to develop locally acceptable recipes for CSB plus oil. A sample of communities with MCHN&#xD;
      programs will be chosen, and the intervention (consistent provision of CSB with oil, teaching&#xD;
      of recipes using CSB with oil, appropriate behavioral support) implemented. Tufts and locally&#xD;
      contracted researchers will interview program staff involved in procurement and supply chain&#xD;
      management as well as program staff, and beneficiaries, to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the provision of CSB with oil, and identify barriers and problems. This&#xD;
      stage is expected to take six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage of the study, the CSB will be distributed in new, smaller packages in&#xD;
      half the sample communities, with the other half continuing with their normal distribution.&#xD;
      In preparation for this stage, during the first stage, Tufts researchers will arrange for the&#xD;
      production/packaging of a sufficient supply of CSB in the new packages, and will contract&#xD;
      with local communications specialists to develop appropriate messages, so these will be&#xD;
      available in time for the second stage of the study. Tufts and locally contracted researchers&#xD;
      will collect information from program staff on their perception of the feasibility and impact&#xD;
      of the change, and will interview beneficiaries to determine how they use the CSB and whether&#xD;
      their use changes with the change in packaging/messaging. We may track the effect on&#xD;
      intrahousehold sharing through self report of consumption among family members. This stage&#xD;
      will last about six months, with data collection from beneficiaries conducted before and up&#xD;
      to six months after the start of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to interviews and focus group discussions, we will collect samples of porridge as&#xD;
      prepared in order to assess the proportion of oil, and we will conduct market observations to&#xD;
      determine whether increased distribution of oil affects availability and price in the market,&#xD;
      and whether market access affects beneficiary mothers' compliance with recommended&#xD;
      preparation method. We will conduct a small number of in-home observations to observe&#xD;
      beneficiary mothers' practices with respect to storage, preparation, and feeding of children,&#xD;
      of which they might not be aware.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key outcomes of the study are the proportion of oil in the CSB porridge as prepared, and&#xD;
      the percent of beneficiary mothers who meet the standard for the oil : CSB ratio.&#xD;
