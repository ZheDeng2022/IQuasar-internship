      The main purpose of this study is to know on one hand if lorazepam is more (effective) than&#xD;
      clonazepam and on the other hand if lorazepam is also effective as the association clonazepam&#xD;
      + fosphenytoin in out-of-hospital treatment of the generalized convulsive status epilepticus&#xD;
      in adult patients.&#xD;

      Background: Early and rapid termination of status epilepticus with intravenous administration&#xD;
      of benzodiazepines only or its association with other antiepileptic drug improves outcomes.&#xD;
      Our out-of-hospital study aims to demonstrate on one hand the superiority of lorazepam&#xD;
      compared with clonazepam and on the other hand the efficacy at least equivalent of lorazepam&#xD;
      in comparison with the association clonazepam + fosphenytoin. If these hypotheses are&#xD;
      demonstrated, the out-of-hospital treatment of the status epilepticus by lorazepam in&#xD;
      monotherapy would then be strongly recommended, considering its efficacy and the simplicity&#xD;
      of administration in the context of the pre-hospital emergency.Objective: To compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of Lorazepam with that of Clonazepam and its association with Fosphenytoin for the&#xD;
      treatment of out-of-hospital status epilepticus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating centers: 41 prehospital emergency services employing mobile intensive care&#xD;
      units and located in urban areas in France participated in this study. In France, the&#xD;
      management of out-of-hospital medical emergencies is under the responsibility of the Service&#xD;
      d'Aide Medicale Urgente (SAMU). Mobile intensive care units are staffed by an attending&#xD;
      emergency physician or anesthesiologist, a nurse, and an ambulance driver. The study is&#xD;
      coordinated by the prehospital emergency service of Lariboisiere Hospital, University Paris 7&#xD;
      (Paris, France)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: 522 patients; 174 patients by group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study: The total duration planned is of 48 months Intermediate analysis: An&#xD;
      intermediate analysis is planned while 261 patients will be included (50 % of the&#xD;
      inclusions).Duration of participation of every patient: 24 hours Data collection: prehospital&#xD;
      data recording during the 60 min period of the study, and intrahospital data recording by the&#xD;
      medical report of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial with 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main criteria of evaluation: the cessation of the status epilepticus and the absence of&#xD;
      recurrence from T20 minutes until T60 minutes after the beginning of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cessation of the status epilepticus is defined by the stop of any motor activity and any&#xD;
      seizures or convulsive movements. The absence of recurrence is defined by the not occurrence&#xD;
      of a new seizures after a period of cessation.&#xD;
