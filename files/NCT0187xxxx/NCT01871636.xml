      Conventional techniques of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) by snare resection do usually&#xD;
      not achieve resection of gastrointestinal mucosal neoplastic lesions larger than 1 cm in&#xD;
      diameter in a single piece. Complete R0 resection cannot be histologically confirmed. In&#xD;
      contrast to EMR the technique of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) allows en-bloc&#xD;
      resection even of large neoplastic lesions. The waterjet-assisted ESD technology (WESD)&#xD;
      allows pressure controlled injection of fluids through the tip of a recently developed&#xD;
      HybridKnife®. Submucosal injection, circumferential cutting and dissection of lesions as well&#xD;
      as coagulation of bleeding sources can be performed with the same device without need for&#xD;
      changing the instrument. Our group reported on effective en-bloc resection of esophageal&#xD;
      areas in all of 14 cases of an Erlangen porcine model. We subsequently compared WESD with EMR&#xD;
      of predefined esophageal mucosal lesions in anesthetizised pigs in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. The results demonstrated that WESD more frequently achieved a complete resection with&#xD;
      a significantly lower number of specimen. WESD caused no perforations and bleedings could be&#xD;
      endoscopically managed during the procedure. In addition we recently reported on this&#xD;
      technology in a first clinical trial on WESD for early Barrett's neoplasia . The results&#xD;
      indicated that WESD can be safely and effectively performed in the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the primary objective of this study is to compare the R0 resection rate of ESD and&#xD;
      EMR for visible lesions of HIgh grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or esophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (EAC). Secondary objectives are related to completeness of resection, safety&#xD;
      of the procedures, the medium term outcome and comparison of costs.&#xD;

      Conventional techniques of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) by snare resection do usually&#xD;
      not achieve resection of gastrointestinal mucosal neoplastic lesions larger than 1 cm in&#xD;
      diameter in a single piece (&quot;en-bloc&quot;). En-bloc resection can even fail in cases of smaller&#xD;
      lesions depending on their location and shape. Extension of EMR by piecemeal resection is&#xD;
      therefore frequently required for removal of the targeted neoplastic area. However the&#xD;
      histological evaluation of several specimen can usually not identify the outer margins of the&#xD;
      neoplastic area. Thus complete R0 resection cannot be histologically confirmed.&#xD;
      Histologically important additional information, e.g. infiltration of lymphatic vessels or&#xD;
      submucosal infiltration may be missed in between resected specimen due to coagulation&#xD;
      artifacts or left tissue bridges. In addition piecemeal EMR of early neoplasia in Barrett's&#xD;
      esophagus is associated with a high recurrence rate probably because of minor remnants of&#xD;
      neoplastic tissue. In contrast to EMR the technique of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)&#xD;
      allows en-bloc resection even of large neoplastic lesions. Variations of this method have&#xD;
      been increasingly used for various types of early gastrointestinal neoplasia mainly in Asian&#xD;
      countries. In Japan ESD has been approved for treatment of selected cases of early gastric&#xD;
      and colorectal neoplasia as an alternative to surgery. A recent meta-analysis of&#xD;
      non-randomized controlled trials showed that ESD of early gastrointestinal tumors is superior&#xD;
      to EMR in terms of en-bloc resection and curative resection rates but it is more&#xD;
      time-consuming and is associated with higher rates of bleeding and perforation. A few small&#xD;
      series on ESD were also reported from Western countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The waterjet-assisted ESD technology (WESD) allows pressure controlled injection of fluids&#xD;
      through the tip of a recently developed HybridKnife®. Submucosal injection, circumferential&#xD;
      cutting and dissection of lesions as well as coagulation of bleeding sources can be performed&#xD;
      with the same device without need for changing the instrument. These options should&#xD;
      accelerate the procedure and may increase its safety and efficacy. Experimental trials in ex&#xD;
      vivo and in vivo pig models showed that the gastrointestinal mucosa of different sites can be&#xD;
      effectively and safely lifted by gentle placement of the HybridKnife® on the wall and&#xD;
      needleless injection of saline solution with pressures between 30 - 70 bar. Our group&#xD;
      reported on effective en-bloc resection of esophageal areas in all of 14 cases of an Erlangen&#xD;
      porcine model. We subsequently compared WESD with EMR of predefined esophageal mucosal&#xD;
      lesions in anesthetizised pigs in a randomized controlled trial. The results demonstrated&#xD;
      that WESD more frequently achieved a complete resection with a significantly lower number of&#xD;
      specimen. WESD caused no perforations and bleedings could be endoscopically managed during&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we applied WESD for early gastric neoplasia in a prospective single center&#xD;
      study. This study involved 29 consecutive patients. The results confirmed the experimental&#xD;
      findings that WESD simplifies the ESD procedure and can be effectively and safely performed.&#xD;
      Repici et al. applied the WESD methodology to colorectal neoplasia larger than 3 cm in&#xD;
      diameter. Also this clinical study showed that WESD is a safe and effective method to provide&#xD;
      en-bloc and curative resection of selected cases of colorectal neoplastic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition we recently reported on this technology in a first clinical trial on WESD for&#xD;
      early Barrett's neoplasia. The results indicated that WESD can be safely and effectively&#xD;
      performed in the esophagus. It achieved en-bloc resection of early BE neoplasia in 27 of 30&#xD;
      patients. The rate of histologically complete resection (R0) was 38.5 % which was higher than&#xD;
      previously reported for focal EMR of BE-EAC. We discussed that higher rates can be expected&#xD;
      in case of well delineated lesions and definition of R0 resection as histologically complete&#xD;
      resection of adenocarcinoma or HGIN. This definition would not consider LGIN at lateral&#xD;
      margins as incomplete resection which is in accordance to a recent trial on ESD of early&#xD;
      colorectal neoplasia. Possible remnants of LGIN seem to be clinically irrelevant because they&#xD;
      are not considered as exclusion criteria for RFA after complete endoscopic removal of HGIN or&#xD;
      EAC. RFA is considered to be the best available ablation technique for eradication of&#xD;
      residual BE mucosa after focal EMR. On the other hand R0 resection of HGIN or EAC is&#xD;
      considered to be important because a complete histological evaluation of the specimen&#xD;
      minimizes the risk of overlooking criteria for advanced tumor stages (e.g. cancerous&#xD;
      infiltration of lymphatic vessels or submucosal tissue) which are related with an increased&#xD;
      risk of lymph node metastases thus requiring major surgery. The risk of a more advanced&#xD;
      lesion is increased in visible lumps or nodules consisting of HGIN. In this context it should&#xD;
      be considered that there is poor inter-observer agreement among pathologists in&#xD;
      distinguishing HGD from intra-mucosal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the primary objective of this study is to compare the R0 resection rate of ESD and&#xD;
      EMR for visible lesions of HGIN or EAC. Secondary objectives are related to completeness of&#xD;
      resection, safety of the procedures, the medium term outcome and comparison of costs.&#xD;
