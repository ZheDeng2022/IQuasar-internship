  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the standard treatment for locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      consists either of chemotherapy by itself or a combination of chemotherapy plus radiation&#xD;
      therapy or no treatment at all. Unfortunately, no treatment thus far has been able to provide&#xD;
      patients with a consistent chance for a cure although there are rare patients who will live&#xD;
      for many years after treatment. For most patients the chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus&#xD;
      radiation will maintain or improve quality of life by keeping the cancer under control for a&#xD;
      period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 25-30% of patients with early pancreatic cancer who are able to have the cancer&#xD;
      completely removed surgically will live beyond 5 years and will be considered cured. This&#xD;
      tells us that aggressive treatment directed at the tumour in the pancreas can lead to cure.&#xD;
      For the majority of patients who can not have an operation, giving more radiation as part of&#xD;
      the treatment may be a strategy that results in better control of the tumour in the pancreas&#xD;
      which may or may not result in patients living longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of adding a higher dose (a &quot;boost&quot; dose) of&#xD;
      radiation using a radiation unit called CyberKnife when combined with standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiation for patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants on this study will receive a 'boost' dose of radiation which consists of 3&#xD;
      treatments over 1 week. The participants will then receive the standard of care treatment of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and standard radiation therapy over a 5 week period, which will be followed by&#xD;
      the conventional 20 weeks of chemotherapy alone. The participants will then be followed for&#xD;
      progression of disease and toxicity related to the boost treatment for up to 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a minimally invasive treatment technique that allows&#xD;
      for ultra-high doses of radiation to be delivered to small areas with precision not&#xD;
      previously possible using older equipment. The CyberKnife® Robotic Radiosurgery System&#xD;
      (Accuray, Sunnyvale California, USA) is a radiation unit specifically designed to focus beams&#xD;
      of radiation accurately anywhere in the body. It is able to track, detect and correct for any&#xD;
      tumor movement during treatment by using a sophisticated image guidance system.&#xD;

    <description>Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a minimally invasive treatment technique that allows for ultra-high doses of radiation to be delivered to small areas with precision. In this study all participants will receive one of 5 dose levels that will be assigned according to Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (TITE-CRM). Three fractions of various dose levels would be delivered over 5 to 10 days (typically Monday, Wednesday and Friday) with at least 36 hours between two sessions. In case of technical or medical problem, the authorized total treatment time is 12 days.</description>
