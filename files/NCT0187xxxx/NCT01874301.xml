  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal discomfort regularly affects &gt;25% of the population worldwide. One of the&#xD;
      major contributors to Gastrointestinal discomfort is constipation, which has a prevalence of&#xD;
      ~15%, and symptoms of which have a significant negative impact on the sufferer's quality of&#xD;
      life. One of the hallmarks of chronic constipation is slow progression of contents through&#xD;
      the gut (i.e. slow gut / colonic transit time), which may be associated with hard stools that&#xD;
      are difficult to expel. Previous studies have shown that probiotics improve colonic transit&#xD;
      times in constipated patients. In addition, several other studies, employing a range of&#xD;
      different probiotic strains, have shown a significant increase in defaecation frequency and&#xD;
      improvement in stool consistency. However, the clinical relevance of these results is&#xD;
      uncertain, due to small sample sizes and limitations in study methodology. The current study&#xD;
      is designed to compare changes in gut transit time and gastrointestinal symptoms following 4&#xD;
      weeks consumption of a probiotic strain in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      manner, in adults with constipation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive, parallel, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, stratified&#xD;
      clinical study, comparing three study arms (two quantities of the probiotic active component&#xD;
      and one placebo)with equal allocation ratio. Recruitment of subjects to the low quantity of&#xD;
      the probiotic will be after fulfilling certain criteria at interim. After half of the&#xD;
      subjects in the two study groups of high quantity and placebo have completed the study (40&#xD;
      subjects), an interim analysis will be performed. Depending on the observed effect size and&#xD;
      the conditional power, the study may be stopped for futility, continued with the two groups&#xD;
      or continued with inclusion of the third group of low dose probiotics.&#xD;
