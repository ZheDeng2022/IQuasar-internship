  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized&#xD;
      study, to compare treatment with intravenous custirsen at 640 mg (highest intended&#xD;
      therapeutic dose) with placebo. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of&#xD;
      custirsen treatment on cardiac conduction and repolarization (electrical activity of the&#xD;
      heart) in healthy subjects. The positive control employed to demonstrate assay sensitivity&#xD;
      consists of a group receiving a single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin on day 7. The&#xD;
      moxifloxacin arm is un-blinded but the ECG readings are blinded.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of custirsen will be evaluated following administration of a single dose&#xD;
      following dose-titration period combined with dexamethasone pretreatment. On days -1 and 7,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo a full ECG assessment for 24 hours. On day 1, randomization and&#xD;
      assignment to the treatment groups will be performed prior to drug administration. Subjects&#xD;
      will remain in the study center throughout the treatment period. All subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged at the end of day 8 procedures, 24 hours after the last dose of custirsen has been&#xD;
      administered. Subjects in groups 1 and 2 will return for an additional visit on day 9, 10 and&#xD;
      14 (±2 days) (approximately 7 days after the last study drug administration). Subjects in&#xD;
      group 3 will not return for a follow-up visits.&#xD;

             tract [including removal of parts of stomach, bowel, liver, gall bladder, or pancreas]&#xD;
             or stomach banding).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has an abnormality in medical history, physical examination, biochemistry,&#xD;
             hematology, coagulation, serology, or urinalysis at the screening or admission visit&#xD;
             that is considered clinically significant by the investigator or meets grades 2-4&#xD;
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4 criteria, or in the opinion&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  any investigational product within 60 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer)&#xD;

                  and until 48 hours after the last study drug administration), history of&#xD;
                  alcoholism, or evidence of drug/chemical abuse&#xD;

                  benzodiazepines, tetrahydrocannabinol), cotinine, or alcohol screen at the&#xD;
