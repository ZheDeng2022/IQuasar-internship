    <textblock>
      Addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Zambia is recognized as a national priority by the&#xD;
      government due to its major contribution to morbidity and mortality among children,&#xD;
      especially infants in their formative years. One of the most successful, cost-effective, and&#xD;
      recommended strategy to address micronutrient malnutrition is 'in-home fortification' with&#xD;
      micronutrient powders (Sprinkles being the most widely recognized) along with nutrition&#xD;
      education. While this intervention has proven to be safe, effective, and efficacious in&#xD;
      numerous other countries, a specific national protocol must be developed to maximize its&#xD;
      effect on reducing anaemia in Zambian children. The proposed research aims to inform such&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Purpose While Zambia has made progress towards reducing under-nutrition among children,&#xD;
           as measured by underweight, other indicators of nutritional status, particularly&#xD;
           stunting and anaemia have remained unchanged over the past decades. Repeated national&#xD;
           surveys show that anaemia remains of public health significance among Zambian children.&#xD;
           According to WHO classification, a prevalence of anaemia above 40% is categorized as a&#xD;
           severe public health problem. There has been no significant reduction in anaemia among&#xD;
           children 6-59 months over the past two decades with an estimated prevalence of 60% in&#xD;
           1998, 53% in 20032 and 49% in 20093. Further, younger infants were found to be more&#xD;
           affected than older children with an estimated prevalence of 81% in children 6-18 months&#xD;
           in 1992 and 61% in children 6-24 months in 2009. In developing countries approximately&#xD;
           50% of all anaemia is attributed to iron deficiency. It is further estimated that the&#xD;
           frequency of iron deficiency is about 2.5 times that of anaemia, and when anaemia&#xD;
           prevalence exceeds 40%, it is assumed that the entire population is suffering from some&#xD;
           degree of iron deficiency. It is therefore assumed that this is the case with young&#xD;
           children in Zambia. It is well established that iron deficiency has adverse health&#xD;
           consequences even before anaemia develops. These include cognitive impairment, decreased&#xD;
           physical capacity and reduced immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The most promising strategy for this age group is 'home fortification' of staple&#xD;
           complementary foods (foods that are consumed in addition to breast milk after 6 months&#xD;
           of age) with small packets of Micronutrient Powders (MNP) that can be easily mixed with&#xD;
           home-prepared food.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MNP are packed in single-serve sachets of mixed vitamins and minerals in powder form,&#xD;
           which can be instantly sprinkled on prepared ready-to-eat complementary foods for young&#xD;
           children without changing the colour or taste of the food. The sachets are packed to&#xD;
           ensure that the correct amounts of micronutrients are given.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As 'stunting', low height for age, is a problem of public health significance in Zambia&#xD;
           with 45% of children under five being stunted, this programme will specifically address&#xD;
           practices that will help to improve nutritional intake and reduce infection in order to&#xD;
           promote growth during the early years of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore the purpose of this project will be to conduct a 12 month trial of MNP in the&#xD;
           Northern Province of Zambia, in order to inform a future scale up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Justification Home fortification with MNP has proved to be efficacious and effective in&#xD;
           reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in young children. Today, MNP are&#xD;
           successfully used in 45-50 countries worldwide. Based on the large body of evidence&#xD;
           available, the WHO strongly recommends the use of MNP containing at least iron, vitamin&#xD;
           A and zinc to improve iron status and reduce anaemia in children 6-23 months of age&#xD;
           where the prevalence of anaemia in children under two years or under five years of age&#xD;
           is 20% or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previous trials have shown a reduction in anaemia by 31%, iron deficiency by 51% in&#xD;
           young children consuming MNP and by 20-30% in a few programmatic settings. Furthermore,&#xD;
           MNP have been shown to be as effective in treating and preventing anaemia as iron syrup.&#xD;
           In 2011, studies in both Nepal and Kenya reported a significant decrease in the&#xD;
           prevalence of stunting following the inclusion of MNP in programmes for children 6-59&#xD;
           months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While studies have demonstrated MNP to be efficacious and effective in specific&#xD;
           settings, it is recognized that the findings from one country are not transferable to&#xD;
           another due to differences in acceptability in accordance with cultural practices,&#xD;
           economics, food availability and particularly infant and child feeding practices. This&#xD;
           project was designed to fill the need for a country specific programme with regionally&#xD;
           relevant training materials, packaging, messages for mothers and distribution system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Through our previous work we developed communications materials and packaging for MNP in&#xD;
           Zambia following a feasibility study and 30-day trial. We evaluated acceptability,&#xD;
           utilization and compliance of MNP and have modified training materials based on our&#xD;
           findings. We are now prepared to conduct a 12-month pilot study on MNP integrated with&#xD;
           IYCF in two districts as the basis for developing an evidence-based policy for&#xD;
           implementing MNP at scale in Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives of the MNP Pilot&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To demonstrate effectiveness of MNP in reducing iron deficiency and anaemia in&#xD;
                children 6-23 months after 12 months of supplementation;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated MNP and IYCF package in improving&#xD;
                child nutritional status and growth;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To quantify the impact of an integrated MNP and IYCF package on reducing iron&#xD;
                deficiency and anaemia and improving the nutritional status of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To develop a MNP communication strategy and Behaviour Change Communication&#xD;
                materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To develop a national plan and policy recommendations for the scale-up and&#xD;
                integration of MNP into IYCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research Method The 'Home Fortification Programme with MNP for Young Children in Zambia'&#xD;
           has been designed as a multiphase project with the first phase consisted of two&#xD;
           components, a feasibility study and a 30-day trial of MNP. The findings of the&#xD;
           previously conducted feasibility study and the 30-day trial have been integrated into&#xD;
           the design of the pilot phase, which will inform how best to scale up the MNP&#xD;
           intervention in Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods have been developed in accordance with the overall pilot programme goals and&#xD;
      objectives, taking into consideration the limitations of implementing a rigorous scientific&#xD;
      design in resource poor settings where access, transportation and communication, are limited.&#xD;
      Ethical considerations do not allow for a control group as the prevalence of anaemia is&#xD;
      presumed to be high and the efficacy of MNP at reducing anaemia, established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot will be conducted in rural communities of Mbala district in the Northern Province.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population for the government's MNP and IYCF intervention is all children 6-23 months and&#xD;
      their caregivers, living in Mbala district, Northern Province. It is estimated that due to&#xD;
      logistical constraints, of 26 health facilities, only 9 will be involved in the pilot.&#xD;
      Therefore the target population will be approximately 2,350 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formulation for the MNP used in the pilot will contain 15 micronutrients including iron,&#xD;
      zinc, vitamin A, C, D, B group vitamins, folic acid and iodine in order to control other&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiencies commonly found in the same individuals. The formulation takes into&#xD;
      account the recommended daily micronutrient requirements for children 6-23 months, the&#xD;
      availability from other sources including on-going nutrition programmes and the upper level&#xD;
      of individual micronutrients. The MNP formula can be safely provided to children that receive&#xD;
      bi-annual high dose vitamin A, or consume iodized salt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers of children 6-23 months will be supplied with boxes of 30 sachets every two months&#xD;
      over the duration of one year. This will cover 50% of the recommended Nutrient Intake for&#xD;
      iron for a child in this age group. The MNP will be delivered to selected families through&#xD;
      the primary health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effectiveness study has been embedded within the pilot programme to assess the effect of&#xD;
      the MNP plus IYCF intervention package in relation to the programme's goals and outcomes&#xD;
      under programmatic conditions within the target population. There will be two distinct groups&#xD;
      invited to participate in the effectiveness component of the pilot, both in the district of&#xD;
      Mbala. One will serve as a control group, and as such will not receive MNP. Both the&#xD;
      treatment group and control groups will receive IYCF and early child development (ECD)&#xD;
      training, deworming tablets (Mebendazole) and insecticide-treated nets, while the treatment&#xD;
      group will additionally receive MNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother-child pairs from the two groups will be closely followed across the 12 month&#xD;
      intervention period with an in-depth assessment taking place at three points in time;&#xD;
      baseline, 6 months and 12 months after the intervention begins. The baseline evaluation will&#xD;
      be conducted before the mothers are trained in the use of MNP as part of complementary&#xD;
      feeding. The tools used for the assessment are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable used for the determination of the sample size for the&#xD;
      effectiveness component of the study is a change in prevalence of anaemia among participating&#xD;
      children (defined as haemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g/dL) over the course of the 12-month intervention in&#xD;
      the district of Mbala&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will include anthropometry, in the form of MUAC, wasting (Weight-for-height),&#xD;
      stunting (height-for-age), and weight-for-age. Biochemical data will be haemoglobin, serum&#xD;
      ferritin, and serum transferrin receptor to measure iron status, C-reactive protein and&#xD;
      alpha-1 acid glycoprotein will be used to control for infections, and retinol binding protein&#xD;
      to measure vitamin A status. There will also be questionnaires, consisting of quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative questions, that will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered in the field into Excel and later transferred to an SPSS file for&#xD;
      analysis. At baseline, descriptive characteristics will be calculated for all variables and&#xD;
      key outcome variables compared across groups. At midline and end-line comparisons will be&#xD;
      made across time among the three groups using means, standard deviation, and proportions as&#xD;
      relevant. The p-value will be set at 0.05 with adjustments made for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
