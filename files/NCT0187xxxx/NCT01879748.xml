  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in healthy&#xD;
      Japanese and Caucasian subjects after administration of single and multiple doses of&#xD;
      rasagiline. All subjects will have a screening visit within 28 days of their check-in day&#xD;
      (day -1) to confirm eligibility. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the investigational&#xD;
      center on study day -1 and their eligibility to participate in the study confirmed. On the&#xD;
      morning of day 1, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 0.5, 1, or 2&#xD;
      mg of rasagiline or placebo at the same time every morning after an overnight fast (of at&#xD;
      least 10 hours) on days 1 through 10. Venous blood samples (4 mL each) for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis will be collected at specified time points through 24 hours after study drug&#xD;
      administration on day 1 and through 48 hours after study drug administration on day 10. The&#xD;
      duration of study participation for each subject will be approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;
