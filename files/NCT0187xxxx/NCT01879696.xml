  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of tissue pressure&#xD;
      monitoring only (Control group) vs. tissue pressure monitoring plus tissue ultrafiltration&#xD;
      (Treatment group) in patients with tibia fractures presenting to the trauma or emergency&#xD;
      departments at participating clinical sites. Tissue ultrafiltration refers to the removal of&#xD;
      muscle interstitial fluid by the ECSPRESS PMFC. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate whether the removal of interstitial fluid by the ECSPRESS PMFC/FC catheters&#xD;
      decrease the incidence of fasciotomy in the Treatment group when compared to the Control&#xD;
      group. Fasciotomy was chosen as the primary outcome because it is clearly defined and&#xD;
      clinically relevant; reduction of fasciotomy is of clear clinical benefit. Enrolled patients&#xD;
      may have isolated tibia fractures OR be multiple trauma patients (those with another major&#xD;
      fracture in a different body region or two distinct body system injuries, excluding those&#xD;
      with injuries to the opposite leg that would preclude them from completing required tests).&#xD;

      Eligible patients who are enrolled in the study will receive standard surgical stabilization&#xD;
      within 72 hours of injury. All Subjects will receive the Twin Star ECSPRESS catheters, which&#xD;
      will be inserted at the end of the surgical procedure to stabilize the tibia fracture and&#xD;
      will be connected to the pressure monitor in the operating room or immediately upon arrival&#xD;
      in the recovery room. The catheters will be used for up to 24-hours after surgical fixation&#xD;
      of the affected lower leg in order to (1) measure and record muscle compartment pressure, and&#xD;
      (2) remove interstitial fluid in the subset of subjects that are randomized to the Treatment&#xD;
      Group. Subjects will be followed closely during the 24 hours the catheter is inserted to&#xD;
      gather muscle pressure data, occurrance of a fasciotomy, adverse events, etc. and then&#xD;
      followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post study enrollment after which&#xD;
      the subjects participation in the study will be completed. There will no interim data&#xD;
      analysis of the study outcomes during the conduct of this study. Data analysis and&#xD;
      presentation of the data will be made after study closure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  • Subject with an isolated tibial shaft fracture requiring intramedullary nailing, or&#xD;
             bicondylar tibial plateau fracture or tibial plateau fracture-knee dislocation&#xD;
             requiring application of a knee-spanning external fixator. OR Subject with an isolated&#xD;
             tibial shaft fracture requiring intramedullary nailing, or bicondylar tibial plateau&#xD;
             fracture or tibial plateau fracture-knee dislocation requiring application of a&#xD;
             knee-spanning external fixator AND another major fracture in a different body region&#xD;
             or injuries to one other major organ system (head, chest, abdomen, pelvis,&#xD;
             genitourinary, or spine) excluding those with injuries to the opposite leg that would&#xD;
             preclude them from completing required tests (see exclusion criteria).&#xD;

             opposite leg that would preclude them from completing required tests (see exclusion&#xD;
             criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Operative procedure (nailing or external fixation) performed within 72 hours of&#xD;
             injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject is at least 18 years of age and no older than 44 years of age. Subject or&#xD;
             legally acceptable representative must able to understand what he/she is being asked&#xD;
             to do, willing/able to understand and sign the Informed Consent to return for the&#xD;
             required follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-surgery.&#xD;
             A legally acceptable representative may sign the Informed Consent on the patient's&#xD;
             behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  • Current evidence of CS prior to the decision regarding enrollment. Surgical&#xD;
             stabilization that resulted in the presence of a bead pouch, VAC, negative-pressure&#xD;
             wound therapy device, or other dressing that would interfere with placement of any of&#xD;
             the four catheters in the anterior deep posterior compartments.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  dermatologic conditions, immunological deficits, or traumatic skin lesions that&#xD;
                  interfere with Catheter placement.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Incision into the anterior or deep posterior compartments of the leg to be&#xD;
                  studied that would release the fascia as this would constitute a partial&#xD;
