    <textblock>
      This project aims to produce a systematic review on present knowledge on effects of using&#xD;
      safety checklists in medicine. Implementation of a checklist system throughout surgical care&#xD;
      may reduce patient morbidity and mortality. The reliability of patient data is crucial to&#xD;
      make firm conclusions as to such effects. This project aims to investigate if such morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality effects are obtainable in two Norwegian hospitals while at the same time making&#xD;
      a crucial evaluation of the patient data used in this study itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An updated systematic review of the research literature provide evidence that safety&#xD;
           checklists use does enhance safety and reduces patient mortality and morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation of the patient safety checklist system will reduce patient mortality and&#xD;
           morbidity in the checklist cohort, and subsequent effects on length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The sensitivity and specificity of ICD-10 coding vs. medical journal information is&#xD;
           poor, with study results to be adjusted accordingly.&#xD;

      1.0 Background Surgical procedures are high risk events and patients may suffer complications&#xD;
      or die post operatively. A report from an on-going patient safety campaign &quot;In Safe Hands&quot;&#xD;
      lead by the Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services reveals that approximately 16&#xD;
      % of all Norwegian hospital admissions in 2010 involved an adverse event (AE) (Deilkås,&#xD;
      2011). A review study on AEs in 2008 included a wide range of in-hospital patients from&#xD;
      Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America (US) (de&#xD;
      Vries et al., 2008). 9 % of the patients experienced an AE, with 7. 4 % of these ending&#xD;
      fatally. The majority of the AEs occurred during surgical treatment or was related to drug&#xD;
      administration. The authors claimed that almost half of these could have been prevented if&#xD;
      checklists covering the entire surgical pathway had been used (de Vries et al., 2008).&#xD;
      Implementation of such a system, called the Surgical Patient Safety System (SURPASS) did in&#xD;
      fact result in a reduction of in-hospital morbidity (from 27.3% to 16.7%) and mortality (from&#xD;
      1.5 % to 0.8 %) (de Vries, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient safety checklists have been introduced and recommended as a standard of surgical care&#xD;
      (Birkmeyer, 2010; de Vries et al., 2011). Studies based on data from electronic patient&#xD;
      administrative systems show that checklist use may reduce mortality and morbidity in surgery&#xD;
      (de Vries et al., 2010; van Klei et al., 2012; Haynes et al., 2009). Safe Surgery checklists&#xD;
      have been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2008 as a strategy to&#xD;
      avoid adverse events (AE) during surgery. More than 6000 hospitals have implemented Safe&#xD;
      Surgery checklists in their operating theatres (OTs)&#xD;
      (http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/), including Haukeland University Hospital&#xD;
      (HUH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentre research project will also introduce a system of patient safety checklists&#xD;
      at each point of care during the surgical patients' stay, not only in the operating theatres&#xD;
      (OTs). The system combines new checklists on patient care (parts of SURPASS) with the already&#xD;
      established Safe Surgery checklist (WHO) in the OTs. At the same time securing reliability,&#xD;
      validity and quality of the patient, morbidity and mortality data will be an essential part&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today the discharging physician reviews the medical journal and makes a medical summary&#xD;
      including coding diseases and complications relevant for the current admission. International&#xD;
      Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes are used to set diagnoses for clinical,&#xD;
      epidemiological and quality purposes&#xD;
      (http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/ICD10Volume2_en_2010.pdf). The ICD-10 codes are also&#xD;
      used for registrations on national mortality and morbidity in the Norwegian National Patient&#xD;
      Register (NPR). Questions have been raised as to the accuracy and quality of the data in such&#xD;
      registers in Norway, e.g. in patients with sepsis (Flaatten, 2004), and intensive care&#xD;
      patients (Aardal et al., 2005). In a Danish study on relations between ICD-10 coding in the&#xD;
      National Registry of Patients and the hospitals' discharge summary and medical records, a&#xD;
      high reliability between ICD-10 scores and co-morbidity was found (Thygesen et al., 2011). To&#xD;
      our knowledge similar studies have not been done in Norway. As a crucial part of this&#xD;
      investigation we concurrently will evaluate the reliability and validity of our patient&#xD;
      administrative data by comparing the post discharge ICD-10 codes to actual data available&#xD;
      directly from medical journal systems as documented by health care personnel in the journal&#xD;
      texts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a systematic review of published studies on effects of safety checklists in&#xD;
           medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore effects on morbidity and mortality after implementing a system of patient safety&#xD;
           checklists at each point of care during the surgical patients' stay (elements of SURPASS&#xD;
           and the WHO Safe Surgery list combined), in a cohort of surgical patients in different&#xD;
           surgical departments in one hospital, with patients from departments not having the&#xD;
           system introduced serving as controls from three hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the validity of the post discharge ICD-10 codes for complications compared&#xD;
           to actual information found in medical journal systems texts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Methods 3.1 The projects and design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systematic review A systematic review on effects of safety checklists in medicine was&#xD;
           done on May 29th, 2012 in the databases MEDLINE, Cochrane library, EMBASE and Web of&#xD;
           Science, limited to only humans. The criteria were pre-set and included all time&#xD;
           published quantitative studies in any language in the in-hospital and pre-hospital&#xD;
           setting where safety checklists were the sole intervention, and effects of using&#xD;
           checklists, generated as measurable outcomes. 7408 singular articles were found. To&#xD;
           ensure the transparency of the reviewing process we used the PRISMA guidelines (Liberati&#xD;
           et al., 2009). 34 studies met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the included&#xD;
           studies measured effects pre-and post-intervention and was classified as having an&#xD;
           observational design. . This systematic review has identified that safety checklists can&#xD;
           be effective safety tools in various clinical settings. Their use has reduced patient&#xD;
           mortality and morbidity. In addition, safety checklist use has been associated with&#xD;
           better human performance, improved compliance with evidence-based practices, promoted&#xD;
           consistency of care, and reduction of technical omissions. None of the included studies&#xD;
           reported that safety checklists have negative effects on patient safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implement the new patient safety checklist system and measure effects on morbidity,&#xD;
           mortality and length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A prospective stepped wedge trial design (Brown &amp; Lilford, 2006; Brown et al., 2008)&#xD;
           will be used when implementing the validated patient safety checklist system in the&#xD;
           Neurosurgical Department, the Orthopaedic Clinic and the Department of Gynaecology and&#xD;
           Obstetrics at HUH. Patients from departments not using the patient safety checklist&#xD;
           system serve as controls, this includes the Head and Neck Clinic (HUH), the Thoracic&#xD;
           Surgery Section of the Heart Department (HUH) and two hospitals outside our own&#xD;
           municipality (Health Trust Førde, and Health Trust Fonna - Haugesund Hospital). Primary&#xD;
           end-points to be measured prospectively include length of hospital stay and morbidity&#xD;
           and mortality utilizing the ICD-10 codes for complications collected electronically from&#xD;
           the hospital patient administrative systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validation of morbidity and mortality data Today ICD-10 codes are produced by&#xD;
           discharging physicians to summarize diagnoses at discharge and any complications having&#xD;
           occurred during patient stay. In order to validate HUH's and Health Trust Førde's ICD-10&#xD;
           coding on patient morbidity and mortality we will randomize inclusion for quality check&#xD;
           comparing the ICD-10 codes used at discharge to all actual information on morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality as documented in the electronic patient journal (EPJ) - DIPS. This validation&#xD;
           should include approximately 700 patients, all having undergone major surgery. Such a&#xD;
           comparison is essential to gain knowledge on the quality of generated ICD-10 data and&#xD;
           thus important to the quality of results in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Intervention study sample Three surgical units at HUH (Department of Neurosurgery,&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Clinic, and Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics) will have the checklist&#xD;
      system implemented. Approximately 3700 patients will be included before and 3700 patients&#xD;
      after checklist implementation. The Control Group includes 7400 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Data collection For the study on mortality and morbidity we will extract ICD-10 codes&#xD;
      used at discharge from the hospitals NPR file, as all Norwegian hospitals report their ICD-10&#xD;
      codes and procedure codes to NPR. In addition to registering all ICD-10 codes on each&#xD;
      patient, we will collect demographic data (age, gender, height and weight), American Society&#xD;
      of Anaesthesiologists Physical Health Classification (ASA), dates of admission and discharge,&#xD;
      and all surgical procedures and major treatments. Data will be processed through Webport&#xD;
      using a system previously developed locally for the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end points, morbidity and mortality, are registered during hospitalization and&#xD;
      postoperatively up to 30 days. Morbidity will be registered as major complications according&#xD;
      to the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program&#xD;
      (http://www.facs.org/cqi/outcomes.html): organ/space surgical site infection, wound&#xD;
      dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, re-intubation, ventilator&#xD;
      use longer than 24 hours, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, sepsis, shock, coma longer&#xD;
      than 24 hours, prosthetic/graft failure, and bleeding. Additional complications to these, as&#xD;
      reported by de Vries (2010) will be included in order to make comparisons possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigating reliability and validity of the ICD-10 codes will be done in detail:&#xD;
      A prospective random selection of 700 patients, 200 patients from Health Trust Førde and 500&#xD;
      patients from the HUH, all having undergone major surgery. Present knowledge should suggest&#xD;
      one or several major complications caused by procedures or iatrogenic causes in at least 17 %&#xD;
      the surgical patients (de Vries, 2010). Then an inclusion of 700 patients is needed in order&#xD;
      to find such complications in 119 cases. We will identify all post discharge ICD-10 codes for&#xD;
      each patient. These codes will be thoroughly reviewed for accuracy and completeness by&#xD;
      comparing to the actual information as documented by physicians and nurses in the EPJs&#xD;
      throughout the total hospital stay. Primary outcome is here to investigate that registered&#xD;
      ICD-10 codes have adequate sensitivity and specificity compared to the information in the&#xD;
      patients' medical journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Statistics Descriptive and inferential statistical methods will be used to analyse data.&#xD;
      Confidence intervals (95% CI) for sensitivity and specificity will be calculated using the&#xD;
      normal approximation for the standard error of proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality and morbidity will be analysed as to time of measurement, e.g. pre and post&#xD;
      intervention, and surgical unit, i.e. using or not using the checklist. Multiple regression&#xD;
      analysis and other appropriate statistical tools will be used to adjust for covariates to&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. Calculation of sample size and power, with an expected mortality&#xD;
      rate decrease (0.015 vs. 0.008) requires a sample size of 3641 patients in both baseline and&#xD;
      post intervention groups with an alpha (0.05, 2-tailed), power is 80%. To calculate sample&#xD;
      size and power for morbidity mitigation from 27% to 17% (de Vries et al., 2010) requires a&#xD;
      much smaller sample size of 234 in baseline and post intervention groups to constitute an 80%&#xD;
      power with alpha at 0.05, 2-tailed. Statistical analysis will be conducted with appropriate&#xD;
      statistical software e.g. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Stata or R.&#xD;
