    <textblock>
      Chronic bladder pain syndrome is a chronic disabling disorder characterized by chronic pelvic&#xD;
      pain, pressure or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder accompanied by at&#xD;
      least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urgency or frequency in the absence of an&#xD;
      identifiable cause. Chronic bladder pain syndrome severely decreases an individual's quality&#xD;
      of life and represents a significant financial burden to those affected by it. Currently,&#xD;
      multifactorial pathogenesis is assumed including endocrine-involvement, pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      irregularities, immunologic aspects and chemical causes. Corresponding to the wide spectrum&#xD;
      of presumptive triggers, a large number of therapeutic approaches are propagated, however&#xD;
      most are associated with limited effectiveness. Thus, treatment of BPS is a challenge and the&#xD;
      ideal therapy remains to be elucidated. Microorganisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis,&#xD;
      Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma genitalium remains a challenge so that these organisms&#xD;
      may well be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic bladder pain syndrome. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesise that doxycycline orally for 4 weeks, including therapy of the sexual partner, can&#xD;
      significantly relieve symptoms in women with chronic bladder pain syndrome&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxycycline is used to treat bacterial infections. Doxycycline is in a class of medications&#xD;
      called tetracycline antibiotics. In addition to the general indications for all members of&#xD;
      the tetracycline antibiotics group, doxycycline is frequently used to treat chronic&#xD;
      prostatitis and pelvic inflammatory disease. Especially intracellular agents, such as&#xD;
      chlamydia, are generally susceptible to doxycycline. Assuming this infection to be&#xD;
      responsible for the chronic bladder pain syndrome in women, therapy will be performed in&#xD;
      accordance with the authorised indication and dosage.Bacterial cystitis is an exclusion&#xD;
      criterion for the diagnosis of chronic bladder pain syndrome. However, the detection of&#xD;
      microorganisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma&#xD;
      genitalium remains a challenge so that these organisms may well be involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of chronic bladder pain syndrome. This is supported by the findings of our&#xD;
      retrospective study1 that doxycycline orally for 4 weeks including therapy of the sexual&#xD;
      partner lead to a reduction of symptoms in 71% of women complaining of persistent urgency and&#xD;
      frequency, chronic urethral and/or bladder pain. Therefore, doxycycline therapy is sensible,&#xD;
      especially considering that there are only a few, costly and often little effective&#xD;
      symptomatic other treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of doxycycline in women with chronic bladder&#xD;
      pain syndrome in a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic bladder pain syndrome is a chronic disabling disorder characterized by chronic pelvic&#xD;
      pain, pressure or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder accompanied by at&#xD;
      least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urgency or frequency in the absence of an&#xD;
      identifiable cause2. In Europe, prevalence rates in women range from 306 to 450/100'0003,4 -&#xD;
      much higher than previously estimated. Thus, chronic bladder pain syndrome is a serious&#xD;
      economic problem for every health care system. In addition, chronic bladder pain syndrome&#xD;
      severely decreases an individual's quality of life and represents a significant financial&#xD;
      burden to those affected by it. Currently, multifactorial pathogenesis is assumed including&#xD;
      endocrine-involvement, pelvic floor muscle irregularities, immunologic aspects and chemical&#xD;
      causes. Corresponding to the wide spectrum of presumptive triggers, a large number of&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches are propagated, however most are associated with limited&#xD;
      effectiveness. Thus, treatment of BPS is a challenge and the ideal therapy remains to be&#xD;
      elucidated. We hypothesise that doxycycline orally for 4 weeks, including therapy of the&#xD;
      sexual partner, can significantly relieve symptoms in women with chronic bladder pain&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To proof or reject the effectiveness of doxycycline in treatment of chronic bladder pain&#xD;
      syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Recruitment of the&#xD;
      study participants is performed in the urologic outpatient clinic of University Hospital&#xD;
      Inselspital Bern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation-list in the institute of pharmacy University Hospital Inselspital Bern will&#xD;
      only be accessible to unblinded employees. In case of unblinding an authorized member of the&#xD;
      blinded trial team contacts the 24-hours service-number of the pharmacist on-duty in the&#xD;
      institute of pharmacy. After disclosure of the patient-number, the pharmacist on-duty&#xD;
      performs the unblinding and informs the authorized unblinded trial-member about allocation.&#xD;
      Finally unblinding is registered on the randomization list by the pharmacist on-duty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unblinded trial-member will record the name of the person who performed unblinding and&#xD;
      the date and reason for unblinding in the patient's medical record.&#xD;
