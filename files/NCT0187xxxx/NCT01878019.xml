      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers want to look at how the brain responds to painful stimulations. They also want&#xD;
      to see if these responses are different in people with and without chronic pain. To test the&#xD;
      brain s response, they will use a chemical called naloxone. Naloxone is used to treat&#xD;
      overdoses of painkilling drugs like morphine. It may be able to block the effect of a&#xD;
      pain-relieving cream. Researchers will apply a pain-relieving cream to a person s lower leg&#xD;
      and look at the results of sensitivity tests with either naloxone or a placebo. This study&#xD;
      will compare the results from people with chronic pain (like fibromyalgia) to those of people&#xD;
      without chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To look at the brain s response to pain in people with and without chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve a screening visit and two testing visits. The testing visits&#xD;
           will be about a week apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. After the screening participants will be administered several&#xD;
           questionnaires about their personality, and their thoughts and feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will try out the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&#xD;
           before using it at the next visit. They will then have the painkilling cream applied on&#xD;
           one part of their lower leg and a normal moisturizing cream on the other part of their&#xD;
           lower leg. They will have heat pulses on these skin areas and rate the pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second visit, participants will have tests in the MRI scanner. The heat pulse&#xD;
           tests will be repeated after an infusion of either naloxone or a placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different pain reducing drugs work in different ways to reduce pain. Many drugs, including&#xD;
      morphine and codeine, reduce pain by binding to opiate receptors in the brain. Another&#xD;
      chemical, naloxone, can block the effect of these drugs. In this study, we are looking at&#xD;
      brain responses to a pain-relieving cream and whether naloxone blocks the effect of the&#xD;
      cream. We will compare the results of people with chronic pain (fibromyalgia) to those of&#xD;
      people without chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study compares MRI response to painful stimulation between people with fibromyalgia and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers under two conditions: 1) naloxone, 2) placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Pain ratings and pain-related MRI responses are compared between people&#xD;
      with fibromyalgia and healthy volunteers&#xD;
