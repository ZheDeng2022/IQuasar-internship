      -  Study to Determine the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Food Effect and&#xD;
           Pharmacodynamics of Single and Multiple Ascending Doses of P11187&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be conducted in three parts, as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part I will be the Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part II will be the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part III will be the food effect evaluation&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  In Part I, the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of&#xD;
           single ascending doses of P11187 will be studied in healthy, overweight or obese, male&#xD;
           and females (of non-child bearing potential) subjects. There will be up to 6 cohorts of&#xD;
           8 subjects each. At each dose level, 6 subjects will receive a single dose of active&#xD;
           treatment, P11187 and 2 subjects will receive a single dose of matching placebo. It is&#xD;
           planned that up to 6 dose levels of P11187 may be evaluated after single dose&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part II, the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of multiple ascending doses of P11187&#xD;
           administered once daily for 14 consecutive days will be studied in overweight or obese,&#xD;
           male and female of non-child bearing potential subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
           Up to 3 dose levels of P11187 are planned to be evaluated in 3 cohorts of 12 subjects&#xD;
           each for 14 days.At each dose level, 9 subjects will receive the active drug, P11187 and&#xD;
           3 subjects will receive matching placebo, once daily for a period of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part III, the food effect evaluation of P11187 will be performed in a randomized,&#xD;
           open-label, cross-over, two-period study at a single dose level in a cohort of 12&#xD;
           healthy male subjects to be administered the drug under fasted and fed&#xD;
           conditions.Subjects will be administered a single dose of P11187 in Periods 1 and 2&#xD;
           under fasted and fed conditions as per the randomization schedule, with a wash-out&#xD;
           interval of 7-10 days between the two periods. Subjects who have received the study&#xD;
           drug, P11187 under fasted conditions in Period 1 will cross-over and receive the study&#xD;
           drug under fed conditions in Period 2 and vice versa.&#xD;
