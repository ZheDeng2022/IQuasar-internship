      The current study design incorporates two previously developed, non-invasive approaches to&#xD;
      characterize the phenotype of individuals affected with XLHED. Facial 3-dimensional (3D)&#xD;
      imaging will be created from white-field morphometric scanning (Hammond, 2004. The 3D facial&#xD;
      photographs collected from males (ages 4 years and up) will be used to develop a non-invasive&#xD;
      screening tool, which could enable detection of craniofacial signs of XLHED in the newborn&#xD;
      period. 3D facial profiling has been reported to be effective in identifying HED (Dellavia et&#xD;
      al., 2008), but the technology does not yet meet the ease-of-use criteria for a universal&#xD;
      screening tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard 2-dimensional (2D) frontal and lateral facial photographs will be taken of the same&#xD;
      XLHED-affected male subjects as well as of adult females (ages 18-45 yrs) at risk for being&#xD;
      XLHED carriers and unaffected adult female controls. The 2D facial photographs will serve a&#xD;
      dual purpose; the first being to beta-test a previously developed algorithm to identify males&#xD;
      affected with XLHED (Automatic Phenotype Identification of XLHED Patients Final Report,&#xD;
      December 25, 2012, unpublished), and the second to adapt the facial recognition algorithm to&#xD;
      identify female carriers of XLHED.&#xD;
