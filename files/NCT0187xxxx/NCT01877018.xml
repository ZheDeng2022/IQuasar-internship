    <textblock>
      The implementation of screening programs for colorectal cancer by screening for fecal occult&#xD;
      blood has proven effective in reducing the incidence and mortality from this type of&#xD;
      neoplasms. However, to ensure the efficiency of the programs require population participation&#xD;
      rates of at least 50%. Experiences in our country show that the population participation is&#xD;
      far from this recommended minimum number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to promote preventive activities in primary care are well received by the&#xD;
      population; in the case of colorectal cancer, direct recommendation of primary care&#xD;
      professionals to carry out the screening is one of the factors with greatest impact on&#xD;
      increasing population participation in such programs. Care overload, circuit design for&#xD;
      screening without the direct intervention of primary care professionals and the multiplicity&#xD;
      of tasks that they must face, are elements that influence the low recommendation for&#xD;
      screening in the target population who consults for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of specific reminders in electronic medical record (in widespread use in&#xD;
      primary care), as a tool to facilitate and encourage direct referral by physicians and nurse&#xD;
      practitioners to perform colorectal cancer screening will mean an increase of at least 10% in&#xD;
      participation of the target population, increasing the efficiency of screening programs. The&#xD;
      introduction of this new software tool will have good acceptance and increase compliance with&#xD;
      recommendations from health professionals.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important public health problem in our country. Over the last&#xD;
      decade, several autonomous regions in Spain have carried out screening programs, but&#xD;
      population participation rates remain below recommended European targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reminders on electronic medical record (EMR) have been identified as a low-cost and&#xD;
      high-reach strategy to increase participation. The population-based colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening program in the city of Barcelona is aimed at men and women between ages 50 and 69&#xD;
      involving immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) every 2 years. Community pharmacies&#xD;
      participating in the program are in charge of delivery and collection of iFOBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main: To asses the effectiveness of an intervention in primary care, by using reminder&#xD;
      systems applied to the electronic medical records to promote the population's participation&#xD;
      in a Public CRC Screening Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To know the population's reasons for refusing to take part in the screening program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To know the health professionals' opinion on the official program implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To know the health professionals' opinion on the implementation of the new computerized&#xD;
           tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled trial and a cross-sectional second phase. Setting: 11 primary&#xD;
      care centers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women, aged between 50-69, with an average risk of developing CRC, involved to&#xD;
           participate in the first round of a population-based CRC screening program (N 57.020).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To be registered with a primary care physician (PCP) at one of the centers&#xD;
           participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care professionals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - All the physicians and nurses working at every center voluntarily participating (N 280).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patients: Refusal to participate. Health care professionals: Refusal to&#xD;
      participate by the center where they work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention It consists of entering a reminder in the EMR of patients (e-cap program), in&#xD;
      the form of a specific icon, in the medical scheduler, which identifies subjects who had been&#xD;
      invited to take part in the CRC screening program. The alert is addressed to physicians and&#xD;
      nurses, in order to promote CRC screening, through some brief advice and asking the patient&#xD;
      to fill in a data collection sheet specifically designed for this study and also included in&#xD;
      the EMR. Health care professionals in the intervention group will have had a training session&#xD;
      on the intervention's characteristics and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The target population registered with the centers involved in the study is about&#xD;
      60.000 people. It is estimated that 90% of them will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      screening program. In case of low participation (30%), the resulting sample could identify a&#xD;
      difference of at least 10% between the control group and the intervention group, with an&#xD;
      alpha error of 5% and a statistical power of 95%, and an estimated loss to follow up rate at&#xD;
      20 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:The randomization unit is the PCP. The allocation of the participant PCPs to&#xD;
      the control or intervention groups is carried out through a stratified random sampling by&#xD;
      center, allocating 50% of the physicians to the control or intervention group, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurses are allocated to the intervention/control group according to the study group of&#xD;
      the PCP that they share patients care with. Patients are allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention/control group according to the study group of their PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking: Given the nature of the intervention, there's no masking of the health professionals&#xD;
      or of the statistician responsible for the statistical analysis, but due to the objectivity&#xD;
      of the final outcome we don't think the result could be influenced by this fact. Moreover the&#xD;
      data manager for the CRC screening program, responsible for the data management of the&#xD;
      participation outcome, does not know what study group the invited population was allocated&#xD;
      to. Patients are also unaware of study group that they have been assigned to, and they have&#xD;
      no access to the EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: CRC screening status (Update, not update, exclusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's characteristics: age, gender, socioeconomic deprivation index, risk factor for&#xD;
           colorectal cancer, clinical risk group, number of visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health professionals characteristics: age, gender, knowledge about CRC screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reminder: date when the sheet was filled in, previous participation in the CRC screening&#xD;
           program (yes, no and barriers), exclusion criteria (normal colonoscopy within the&#xD;
           previous five years, high CRC risk for personal or family history, symptoms of CRC),&#xD;
           intention to participate (yes, no and barriers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health Professionals Opinion questionnaire on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population-based CRC screening program: Information given, process operation, primary care&#xD;
      professionals implication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic reminder: usefulness, usage, operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Data obtained from population based CRC screening program, the EMR and two&#xD;
      questionnaires for the cross-sectional second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data will be analyzed using Stata, version 12.1, statistical software&#xD;
      package and an intention-to-treat approach will be applied. Analyses will include standard&#xD;
      descriptive statistics, Student's t tests, correlation and regression, to examine differences&#xD;
      between groups. All tests will be two-tailed and an alpha level of 0.05 will be applied as&#xD;
      the criterion for statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the nature of the intervention and the great social, economic and demographical&#xD;
      differences of the population registered with the centers participating in this study, we&#xD;
      take the physicians as a unit of randomization, instead of the centers or the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External validity: This is an urban population study, but as the EMR is universally used in&#xD;
      Catalonia's primary care centers, we don't expect differences due to the area of work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are committed to complying with the prevailing norms of Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice, as well as with the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki and the clauses of&#xD;
      general and particular ethical conditions related to the right to privacy, anonymity and&#xD;
      confidentiality. Neither the first name nor the surnames or any other type of data indicating&#xD;
      the identity of the subjects will be registered. Therefore, identification will be made by&#xD;
      numerical codes. Since this type of study is developed in the usual clinical setting,&#xD;
      authorization and support must be and has already been granted by the representatives and&#xD;
      authorities of the groups involved and thus, individual informed consent is not necessary.&#xD;
      However, the consent of target population attending a primary care appointment will be&#xD;
      registered in the EMR. The protocol has been approved by the Clinical Investigation Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Jordi Gol i Gurina Foundation (protocol number P10/31).&#xD;
