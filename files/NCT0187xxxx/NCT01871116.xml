  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to assess the effectiveness of a weight loss program in women&#xD;
      with early stage breast cancer whose body mass index (BMI) is in the overweight or obese&#xD;
      range (&gt;25). Weight loss is beneficial in improving cardiovascular risk factors and overall&#xD;
      health, but may also decrease the chance of breast cancer coming back. A weight loss&#xD;
      counseling program was studied in a general population and was found to be effective to help&#xD;
      reduce weight over a 2 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to determine if women with a recent diagnosis of early breast&#xD;
      cancer will also lose weight with this program. To better understand the effect that weight&#xD;
      loss has on women with breast cancer, we will compare the patterns in blood and breast tissue&#xD;
      samples (tissue biopsies will be optional), and questionnaires evaluating different aspects&#xD;
      of one's well-being, before and after a dietary intervention or no intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has increased rapidly in recent years. Epidemiological studies&#xD;
      since the 1970's have strongly suggested that excess body weight gain may be a major risk&#xD;
      factor for many cancers including breast cancer. In addition, once diagnosed with breast&#xD;
      cancer, women who are overweight or obese experience worse outcomes despite standard local&#xD;
      and adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, most women gain weight following a diagnosis of breast&#xD;
      cancer, and this weight gain may increase risk of recurrence by 40-50% and breast&#xD;
      cancer-related mortality by 53-60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A great deal of effort has been made for many years to explain the relationship between&#xD;
      obesity and breast cancer. Molecularly, the relationship involves dynamic and complex&#xD;
      interactions between a milieu of hormones, cytokines, adipokines, affecting cell signaling&#xD;
      and potentially epigenetic pathways. Recently, studies in postmenopausal women have shown&#xD;
      that weight loss modulates these cytokines and adipokines favorably. Inflammation associated&#xD;
      with obesity can also be characterized pathologically when macrophages surround necrotic&#xD;
      adipocytes in what are called crown-like structures (CLS). Furthermore, increased central&#xD;
      obesity as measured by waist-to-hip ratios, may be associated with hypermethylation of&#xD;
      certain breast cancer genes, and physical activity can reduce methylation of certain breast&#xD;
      cancer-associated genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Women's Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) demonstrated that women with early-stage&#xD;
      breast cancer receiving conventional cancer management randomized to a dietary intervention&#xD;
      group had lower risk of relapse compared to those in a control group in those who lost&#xD;
      weight. While women with a diagnosis of breast cancer are therefore recommended to maintain&#xD;
      ideal body weight, limited progress has been made in developing feasible weight loss&#xD;
      programs. However, collaborators from the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and&#xD;
      Clinical Research at the Johns Hopkins University have recently reported impressive and&#xD;
      sustained weight loss in randomized controlled trials designated Practice-based Opportunities&#xD;
      for Weight Reduction (POWER) in obese women with at least one cardiovascular risk factor&#xD;
      using a remote-support weight loss intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the remote-support weight&#xD;
      loss intervention of the POWER study, designated POWER-remote, in women with early breast&#xD;
      cancer who are overweight or obese, and to assess the effects of weight loss of ≥5% body&#xD;
      weight at 6 months and on biomarkers associated with obesity, inflammation, and breast&#xD;
      cancer. The data will be used to implement a clinical intervention available to all&#xD;
      overweight and obese women with breast cancer, and to design definitive studies assessing the&#xD;
      impact of weight loss and biomarker modulation on risk of recurrent disease or development of&#xD;
      new primary breast cancers.&#xD;
