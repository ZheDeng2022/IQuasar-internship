      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can sometimes develop thinking and memory&#xD;
      problems. These problems can vary widely, from few symptoms to severe problems with memory&#xD;
      and concentration. It initially was thought that good HIV treatment could prevent almost all&#xD;
      HIV-related memory problems. However, even people with low HIV viral loads can have these&#xD;
      problems. It may be caused by HIV affecting the brain and spinal fluid. It is not yet clear&#xD;
      why HIV causes these problems and why they may be worse in some people than others.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study people with HIV and healthy volunteers to see how HIV may affect&#xD;
      people with only small amounts of the virus in their blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study thinking and memory problems in individuals with HIV that is otherwise controlled&#xD;
      with medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 of age or older whose HIV has been controlled with medications&#xD;
           for at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. A neurological test will also be given. Participants will&#xD;
           have a baseline imaging study of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 12 weeks of the first visit, participants will have a second visit. Additional&#xD;
           blood samples will be drawn. Another brain imaging study will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 8 weeks of the second visit, participants will have a third visit to collect more&#xD;
           blood samples. They will also provide spinal fluid samples, either as a single visit or&#xD;
           a longer procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After this visit, participants will return every 12 months for up to 10 years. Blood&#xD;
           samples will be collected as needed at these visits. Thinking and memory tests and&#xD;
           imaging studies may also be given as needed. Spinal fluid may be collected at one visit&#xD;
           a year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of neurocognitive impairment in human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV)-infected individuals remains poorly understood. While the advent of highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a decreased incidence of the most severe form of&#xD;
      HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia, it does not appear&#xD;
      to have impacted overall prevalence of HAND. Existing evidence suggests that the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) could be an important reservoir for HIV regardless of cumulative time on&#xD;
      treatment. This 20 year multi-institute natural history protocol will identify approximately&#xD;
      500 HIV-infected individuals and 250 healthy volunteers for enrollment in multiple HAND&#xD;
      studies at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Subjects will undergo a screening and&#xD;
      evaluation assessment, which will include blood and urine collection, neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing, Client Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      with optional lumbar puncture and ophthalmology exam to repeat yearly for up to ten years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The option to have a lumbar drain is only on the first visit and extended to HIV positive&#xD;
      individuals only. Participants will have the option of doing a positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging if they have previously had a PET/CT scan&#xD;
      under this study. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of immune activation, chronic monocyte&#xD;
      activation, cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus (CMV/EBV) infection/reactivation, and neuronal&#xD;
      injury will be collected. In addition, HIV viral load and genotype, genetic susceptibility&#xD;
      factors and CNS penetration-effectiveness score (CPE) and CSF levels of antiretroviral drugs&#xD;
      may be assessed. A repository of cryopreserved biological samples will be developed and used&#xD;
      for validation of candidate biomarkers in future studies. Collection and analysis of these&#xD;
      data will not only enhance understanding of the CNS as a potential HIV reservoir in&#xD;
      virally-controlled individuals but will further define the association among cortical&#xD;
      thickness, biomarkers and neurocognitive function in an aging HIV-infected population.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Subjects (HIV-infected and HIV-negative Controls):&#xD;
&#xD;
        While different individual HIV neurocognitive studies have specific selection criteria,&#xD;
        especially related to HIV viral load and antiretroviral therapy, inclusion criteria for&#xD;
        this overarching protocol will be flexible in order to identify the broadest base of&#xD;
        potential enrollees possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women, 18 years of age and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ability to sign informed consent by the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least seventh grade educational level and ability to speak, read, and understand&#xD;
             English. Education level will be assessed by subject self-report. Because many of the&#xD;
             neuropsychological subtests were validated using United States norms, subjects must be&#xD;
             native English speakers or if foreign-born, demonstrate ability to understand the&#xD;
             English language at the time of protocol consent and neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Consent to store blood and tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to participate in this study for 10 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-infected Only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HIV-1 infection, as documented by OraQuick rapid test using venipuncture whole blood,&#xD;
             or fingerstick whole blood; or with HIV-1/HIV-2 Multispot rapid test and Western Blot&#xD;
             as determined by NIH Clinical Pathology Laboratory or Leidos Biomedical Research.&#xD;
             Monitoring Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Outside primary medical doctor who provides care&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Plasma HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mm3 or BLD for greater than one year. Patients who&#xD;
             experience transitory episodes of an HIV viral load &gt; 50 copies/mm3 preceded and&#xD;
             followed by plasma viremia &lt; 50 copies/mm3 may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least one year of continuous ART&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-negative Controls Only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.HIV-antibody negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Illness or other condition that, in the opinion of the PI, may interfere with study&#xD;
             participation at the time of enrollment, including, but not limited to those listed&#xD;
             below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. CNS infections: this includes but is not limited to Varicella zoster virus (VZV)&#xD;
                  encephalitis, CNS lymphoma and toxoplasmosis. Subjects who have recovered from&#xD;
                  effectively treated CNS infections may be considered once they resume baseline&#xD;
                  daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Non-CNS opportunistic infections: subjects who recovered from or are completing&#xD;
                  treatment for non-CNS opportunistic infections (OIs) (e.g., Pneumocystis&#xD;
                  pneumonia, Candida esophagitis, or pulmonary TB) can be enrolled if they have&#xD;
                  returned to self-reported baseline activity and functional level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Conditions other than HAND associated with cognitive impairment or dementia such as&#xD;
             Alzheimer s, Parkinson s disease, head injury with loss of consciousness &gt;30 minutes,&#xD;
             untreated sleep apnea with day-time sleepiness, or seizure disorders. Subjects with a&#xD;
             history of seizure disorder with no seizure activity that are on a stable,&#xD;
             non-sedating anti-seizure regimen for &gt;6 months may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent severe, unstable psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, may interfere with study participation and/or data interpretation.&#xD;
             Subjects on psychotropic anxiolytic, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),&#xD;
             and other psychiatric medications may be included if clinically stable for &gt;6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent substance abuse that, in the opinion of the investigators may interfere&#xD;
             with study participation and/or data interpretation. Active substance abuse includes&#xD;
             illegal drug use and/or excessive narcotic or alcohol use as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator. Urine drug screen will be performed on all subjects. Use of nicotine&#xD;
             containing products will not be an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraindication to MRI/ MRS scanning, including pacemakers or other implanted&#xD;
             electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips&#xD;
             (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pins&#xD;
             and rods, heart valves, and cochlear implants), implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel&#xD;
             fragments. Patients requiring a low dose oral benzodiazepine for mild to moderate&#xD;
             claustrophobia will be allowed to participate. Pregnancy testing will be performed in&#xD;
             enrolled participants of childbearing potential 48 hours prior to any MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Medications: narcotics, psychiatric, and anti-seizure medications will not be allowed&#xD;
             except under certain conditions as noted above. Corticosteroids may be permitted for&#xD;
             subjects on stable short-term therapy without CNS disease (i.e., resolving&#xD;
             Pneumocystis pneumonia). Participants must be willing not to take the following&#xD;
&#xD;
             medications within 48 hours of neuropsychological testing : sedating antihistamines&#xD;
             such as diphenhydramine, zolpidem and other drugs identified by the study team that&#xD;
             are associated with altered alertness or impaired memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Inability to refrain from use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication, such as&#xD;
             dipyridamole (Persantine), clopidogrel (Plavix), dabigatran (Pradaxa), or warfarin&#xD;
             (Coumadin) for at least 72 hours prior to invasive procedures (lumbar puncture [LP],&#xD;
             lumbar drain). Aspirin does not need to be held.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior or planned/anticipated exposure to radiation due to clinical care or&#xD;
             participation in other research protocols, which would exceed the recommended&#xD;
             acceptable annual limit of radiation exposure once accounting for the requirements of&#xD;
             the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant or Lactating females are excluded due to exposure to the radioactive compound&#xD;
             for PET/CT scans, which may be excreted in the breast milk and could be potentially&#xD;
             harmful to breast-fed infants. There is also exposure to radiation from the CT part of&#xD;
             the PET/CT scan and the lumbar puncture if done under fluoroscopy. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potention must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy 48 hours prior to&#xD;
             any radiation exposure.&#xD;
