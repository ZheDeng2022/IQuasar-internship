    <textblock>
      Late antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) after kidney transplantation is defined as a separate&#xD;
      rejection entity. So far, no appropriate treatment has been established for this rejection&#xD;
      type. One promising strategy could be the targeting of alloantibody-producing plasma cells.&#xD;
      There is now accumulating evidence that the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib may substantially&#xD;
      affect the function and integrity of non-malignant alloantibody-secreting plasma cells. The&#xD;
      impact of this compound on the course of late AMR , however, has not yet been systematically&#xD;
      investigated. In the planned phase IIa study we will examine the effect of Bortezomib on late&#xD;
      AMR after kidney transplantation. We plan an initial cross-sectional HLA antibody screening&#xD;
      of 1000 kidney transplant recipients to identify patients with detectable donor-specific&#xD;
      antibodies (DSA). DSA-positive recipients will be subjected to kidney allograft biopsy to&#xD;
      detect morphological features consistent with AMR. Forty-four patients with late AMR will be&#xD;
      included in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group intervention trial.&#xD;
      Patients in the active group will receive two cycles of Bortezomib (4 x 1.3 mg/m2). The&#xD;
      primary end point will be the course of estimated GFR over 24 months after randomization.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are the course of DSA levels and protein excretion, measured GFR after 24&#xD;
      months, transplant and patient survival, and the development of acute and chronic&#xD;
      morphological lesions in 24-month protocol biopsies. Our study will clarify the impact of an&#xD;
      innovative anti-humoral strategy on the deleterious effects of late AMR processes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have underscored a dominant role of alloimmune injury as a leading cause of&#xD;
      long-term graft loss in kidney transplantation. In this respect, the formation of antibodies&#xD;
      against specific polymorphic donor antigens, commonly human leukocyte antigens (HLA), has&#xD;
      turned out to be an important trigger of graft rejection (Colvin, RB et al. 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humoral rejection (antibody-mediated rejection; AMR) of organ transplants has been&#xD;
      established to constitute a separate rejection entity and in recent years accurate&#xD;
      biopsy-based (C4d) and serological criteria for this rejection type have been defined to&#xD;
      provide a valuable basis for targeted treatment (Sis, B et al. 2010). It has become evident&#xD;
      that a considerable proportion of recipients develop features of AMR late after&#xD;
      transplantation, a process culminating in chronic irreversible tissue damage, graft&#xD;
      dysfunction and loss (Mauiyyedi, S et al. 2001). Indeed, there are studies suggesting that&#xD;
      newly formed donor-specific antibodies (DSA) represent the primary cause of late graft loss&#xD;
      (Einecke, G et al. 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to early acute AMR, where various treatment protocols including immunoadsorption,&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or CD20 antibody (Rituximab) exist, appropriate targeted&#xD;
      treatment for late AMR still remains to be established (Vo, A et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an earlier uncontrolled study of 11 kidney transplant recipients with advanced&#xD;
      C4d-positive chronic AMR we found that conversion of Cyclosporine A and Azathioprine-based&#xD;
      basal immunosuppression to Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate-Mofetil (MMF) did not have any impact&#xD;
      on DSA levels and graft performance (Schwarz, C et al. 2006). Our observations, which are in&#xD;
      some contrast to a previous small study (Theruvath, TP et al. 2001), suggested that simple&#xD;
      conversion strategies may not suffice to ameliorate ongoing late AMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, we reported on the treatment with Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in a&#xD;
      patient diagnosed with advanced chronic active C4d-positive AMR (Schwaiger, E et al. 2011).&#xD;
      In this patient, a single cycle of Bortezomib led to an impressive decrease in DSA levels and&#xD;
      a complete disappearance of capillary C4d deposits in a follow-up biopsy. Also a remarkable&#xD;
      observation was the stable decrease in proteinuria. As expected, advanced chronic lesions&#xD;
      (severe transplant glomerulopathy) in this patient remained unchanged. Nevertheless, 16&#xD;
      months after treatment, kidney function stabilized and the protein/creatinine ratio was still&#xD;
      half of the initial value of 4,000 mg/g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this investigator-driven, randomized prospective double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo- controlled trial is to assess the efficiency of the innovative concept of proteasome&#xD;
      inhibition with Bortezomib in the treatment of late AMR. Our primary hypothesis is that, by&#xD;
      inhibiting the DSA production of plasma cells, Bortezomib can halt the progression of ongoing&#xD;
      graft injury and dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study (anticipated duration time is 36 months) will be performed in two major steps, Part&#xD;
      A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part consists of a cross-sectional screening analysis of a large cohort of approximately&#xD;
      1000 kidney transplant recipients from our outpatient clinic for the presence of late AMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will screen kidney transplant recipients for the presence of circulating DSA and biopsy&#xD;
      features of late AMR. Key inclusion criteria are a functioning graft at &gt; 6 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation and an eGFR above 20 ml/min/1.73m2. The GFR threshold was chosen to&#xD;
      avoid inclusion of transplants showing a high degree of irreversible chronic damage. For&#xD;
      patients with very advanced graft injury a sustainable treatment benefit can no longer be&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Sample size considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 90% of 1000 recipients available for a pre-screening will be eligible for HLA&#xD;
      antibody testing. In at least 10% (nâ‰¥90) of tested patients DSA detection can be expected&#xD;
      (Lachmann, N et al. 2009). We estimate biopsy-based late AMR features in at least 60% of the&#xD;
      DSA-positive patients (Hidalgo, LG et al. 2009). Hence, at least 50 patients will be eligible&#xD;
      for inclusion into Part B, the randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of GFR eGFR will be calculated using the Mayo equation. For kidney transplants,&#xD;
      this equation was reported to be superior with respect to estimations of GFR slopes (Rule, AD&#xD;
      et al. 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSA screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum obtained in the context of a routine outpatient laboratory control (10 ml blood; no&#xD;
      additional venipuncture) will be pre-screened for anti-HLA immunoglobulin G (IgG)&#xD;
      alloantibodies using LabScreenMixed assays (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA, USA). For&#xD;
      identification of HLA antigen/allele specificities, pre-screen-positive samples will be&#xD;
      subjected to single-antigen flow-bead (SAFB) testing (LABscreen Single Antigen assays, One&#xD;
      Lambda). SAFB results will be documented as mean fluorescence intensities (MFI), and MFI&#xD;
      levels &gt;500 will be considered to be positive. Donor-specificity will be defined according to&#xD;
      donor and recipient HLA typing results. Virtual panel-reactive antibody (PRA) levels will be&#xD;
      calculated using specific software tools (http://www.eurotransplant.eu).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal biopsies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All biopsies will be performed under local anesthesia (lidocaine) using ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      percutaneous techniques (two cores per biopsy). After biopsy, patients will be monitored&#xD;
      closely for at least 6 hours for any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies will be evaluated on standard paraffin-embedded sections and by electron microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Histomorphological, (ii) electron-microscopical and (iii) immunohistochemical criteria&#xD;
      will be applied to assess a score for late AMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase IIa, proof of concept, randomized prospective, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will examine whether treatment with Bortezomib is capable to halt the progression of late&#xD;
      AMR. We plan to include 44 patients into this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficiency and safety of Bortezomib on allograft outcome in recipients with&#xD;
      late AMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      44 patients will be centrally randomized by computer assignment between two study arms&#xD;
      (Bortezomib versus Placebo) using a 1:1 randomization scheme. To avoid the bias of unbalanced&#xD;
      baseline variables that potentially affect treatment responses, stratification will be&#xD;
      performed for eGFR (&gt; versus &lt;50 ml/min/1.73 m2) and the presence or absence of Banff I&#xD;
      T-cell-mediated rejection (index biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient a study ID will be assigned. The participating investigators and the&#xD;
      patients will be blinded to group allocation until the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with Bortezomib or Placebo. Patients allocated to the intervention group will&#xD;
      receive two cycles of Bortezomib at an interval of 3 months. Each cycle will consist of&#xD;
      Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 administered twice weekly on days 1, 4 and days 8, 11. Bortezomib will&#xD;
      be given by injection intravenously (within 3-5 seconds). Bortezomib-treated patients will&#xD;
      receive oral antiviral prophylaxis to prevent the development of herpes zoster infection:&#xD;
      Valacyclovir 500 mg per day (eGFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m2: 250 mg per day) for 3 weeks after&#xD;
      initiation of each cycle. Patients allocated to the control group will receive oral Placebo&#xD;
      instead of Valacyclovir prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our center standard, upon diagnosis of late AMR, all recipients (both study&#xD;
      groups) on therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor (Tacrolimus or Cyclosporine A) or a mammalian&#xD;
      Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (Everolimus or Sirolimus), without Azathioprine or MMF,&#xD;
      will receive MMF (initially 2 x 500 mg per day; in absence of gastrointestinal side effects&#xD;
      and significant leukopenia or thrombocytopenia stepwise increase of dose to 2 x 1000 mg per&#xD;
      day) to avoid underimmunosuppression. Recipients weaned off steroids will receive low dose&#xD;
      Prednisolone (initiation with 10 mg/day, tapered to 5 mg/day within 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Sample size calculations, power calculation, statistical methodology and interim&#xD;
      analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot studies using data from the OEDTR (OEsterreichische Dialysis and Transplant Registry)&#xD;
      were conducted to estimate the eGFR decline and variance of sequential eGFR determinations.&#xD;
      When using only one eGFR determination at two years as primary endpoint, analyses showed an&#xD;
      impracticable high sample size number under the assumption of a median treatment effect of&#xD;
      Bortezomib (0.5 SD). Therefore, the difference in slope of half yearly determined eGFR&#xD;
      between the two treatment groups will be used as quantitative outcomes measure. Mixed linear&#xD;
      models for longitudinal data were used for analyses. Power calculation using an&#xD;
      autoregressive covariance matrix of the first order using a correlation of 0.9, an alpha of&#xD;
      0.05 for the interaction term of treatment and time and an attrition of 8% per year showed&#xD;
      that 2 x 22 subjects would be required to uncover a difference in GFR slopes of 5ml/min/year&#xD;
      with a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide a solid background for our power analysis, we re-analyzed a large retrospective&#xD;
      transplant cohort (transplantation and follow-up at the Medical University Vienna. Evaluating&#xD;
      the impact of late (&gt; 6 months) (C4d-positive) AMR on the clinical performance of kidney&#xD;
      allografts a GFR slope of -8.2 ml/year (over a follow-up of 6 years), as compared to a slope&#xD;
      of -1.8 ml/min/year in non-biopsied and -2.8 ml/min patients in biopsied C4d-negative&#xD;
      subjects was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. Continuous data&#xD;
      will be analyzed by t-test, categorical data by a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test when&#xD;
      appropriate. The analysis of the creatinine trajectories stratified by treatment (and&#xD;
      eventually by baseline GFR and T-cell-mediated rejection) will be performed by a mixed linear&#xD;
      model with time and therapy as the independent parameters. The most applicable covariance&#xD;
      matrices will be determined by graphical analysis and evaluated by the log likely hood ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) of the&#xD;
      Medical University of Vienna (MUW). Interim analyses will be performed by the DSMB after&#xD;
      completion of 10 and 20 cases in the treatment group. The Lan &amp; DeMets extension of the&#xD;
      O'Brian-Fleming stopping rules will be applied (DeMets, LD et al. 1994). The trial will be&#xD;
      stopped if the observed p-value is &lt;0.00001 (first interim analysis after 10 patients) or&#xD;
      &lt;0.00305 (second interim analysis after 20 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most probable AEs caused by Bortezomib (usually transient) are mild to moderate&#xD;
      thrombopenia and leukopenia, decreased appetite, gastrointestinal side effects (vomiting,&#xD;
      nausea, diarrhea), fatigue, peripheral neuropathy and other neurological symptoms such as&#xD;
      headache, dizziness, tremor and hypotension. Intensified immunosuppression may be associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of infection (common: herpes zoster, herpes simplex, pneumonia,&#xD;
      bronchitis, sinusitis, nasopharyngitis). Hence, a careful patient follow-up will include a&#xD;
      close monitoring for infectious complications (bacterial, viral and fungal infections).&#xD;
      Valacyclovir adapted to kidney function will be added to prevent the occurrence of herpes&#xD;
      virus infections (herpes zoster).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most probable AEs caused by Valacyclovir are headache, nausea, gastrointestinal side&#xD;
      effects (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), dizziness, hallucinations, confusion, changes&#xD;
      in blood cell counts (Leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), increased liver and kidney&#xD;
      parameters and fever.&#xD;
