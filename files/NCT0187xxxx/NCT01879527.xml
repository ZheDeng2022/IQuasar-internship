  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following acute inflammation of the optic nerve region, as commonly seen in multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis patients, the optic nerve often undergoes atrophy, thus representing permanent&#xD;
      damage. Data from animal studies suggest that amiloride may prevent this process. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to assess a potential neuroprotective effect of amiloride in acute autoimmune&#xD;
      inflammation of the optic nerve region.&#xD;

      Recent studies have shown that the acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) contributes to the&#xD;
      axonal degeneration in CNS lesions Physiologically, ASIC1 has been described as a&#xD;
      postsynaptic proton receptor on hippocampal neurons influencing the intracellular Ca2+&#xD;
      concentration. In MS, ASIC1 seems to activate under acidic conditions predominating in the&#xD;
      inflammatory CNS lesions leading to a Na+ and Ca2+ overload and consecutive damage and&#xD;
      apoptosis of axons. Consecutively, in a MS mousemodel axonal damage was significantly less&#xD;
      pronounced after administering amiloride, a clinically safe blocker of ASICs. So ASIC1 seems&#xD;
      to play a major role in axonal degeneration in MS. To our knowledge no clinical studies have&#xD;
      tested those promising in vitro results in humans so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one retrospective registry-based cohort study was performed. This study showed no&#xD;
      difference in the risk of incident MS or hospitalization and death among MS patients using&#xD;
      amilorid compared to those using thiazide diuretics. However, this study has numerous&#xD;
      limitations with respect to it's retrospective designone and the fact that amilorid users&#xD;
      were at the vast majority older individuals. Such a late stage of the MS course does not seem&#xD;
      to be the best window of opportunity for interventions with neuroprotective agents. Moreover,&#xD;
      death may be a too multifactorial parameter to correspond with axonal damage alone.&#xD;
      Consequently, a more sensitive parameter for axonal damage in MS is needed to test the impact&#xD;
      of amiloride on neuroprotection and repair.Based on the findings described above we intend to&#xD;
      assess the potential neuroprotective effect of amiloride hydrochlorothiazide (Amilostad HCTÂ®)&#xD;
      in patients with optic neuritis (ON), which has already been demonstrated in a mouse model.&#xD;
      ON is one of the most common manifestations of MS and has already been proven appropiate to&#xD;
      test neuroprotective agents.&#xD;
