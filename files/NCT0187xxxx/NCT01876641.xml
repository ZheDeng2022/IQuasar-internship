      The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of Vemurafenib with Decitabine plus&#xD;
      Cobimetinib improves the low therapy response rate in subjects with malignant melanoma.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the Phase I portion of this study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the proposed schedule of decitabine and Vemurafenib plus Cobimetinib in the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

    <description>In Cohorts 1-4, a subcutaneous dose of decitabine will be administered three times/week over a 2 week period. Cohorts 5 and 6 will receive decitabine two times a week for 8 weeks and Cohorts 7 and 8 will receive decitabine three times a week for 8 weeks. Patients will start treatment with decitabine initially at the cohort in which they enter the study. Patients will remain in the cohort in which they were initially enrolled for the entire treatment course. Vemurafenib + Cobimetinib will be given continuously for subjects in Cohorts 5, 6, 7 and 8. Vemurafenib will be given on a 28-day cycle at the standard dose of 960 mg p.o. BID. Cobimetinib will be given on a 21-day cycle with a 7-day rest between cycles. Decitabine will be given for 2 cycles only. Each cycle will be 28 days long. Vemurafenib + Cobimetinib will be continued indefinitely until disease progression.</description>
