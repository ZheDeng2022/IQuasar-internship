  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adhesions develop in more than 90% of patients undergoing an intra-abdominal surgical leading&#xD;
      to serious consequences and complications at reoperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators initiate a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial to assess&#xD;
      whether the use of C-Qur™ Film decreases the incidence of adhesion formation in subjects&#xD;
      undergoing colorectal surgery. Treatment with the application of C-Qur™ Film as an adhesion&#xD;
      prevention barrier for colorectal surgery will be compared with the control group at the&#xD;
      second stage ostomy takedown procedure. The primary outcome evaluation will be assessment of&#xD;
      adhesions to the incision site.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesions are fibrous bands that connect tissue surfaces where anatomical connections do not&#xD;
      normally exist. Adhesion tenacity appears to be related to maturity, as they can be filmy or&#xD;
      heavily vascularized with sensory nerve fibers. Adhesions are formed after a tissue surface&#xD;
      has been injured (abrasion, desiccation, lysis, etc.) and the subsequent process of&#xD;
      fibrinolysis is interrupted. Adhesions develop in more than 90% of patients undergoing an&#xD;
      intra-abdominal surgical procedure. The clinically relevant symptoms of adhesion formation&#xD;
      are small bowel obstruction, secondary infertility and pain. Other consequences and&#xD;
      complications of postsurgical intra-abdominal adhesion formation include inadvertent&#xD;
      enterotomy and increased dissection time due to adhesiolysis during repeat surgery. The&#xD;
      C-Qur™ Film offers reduction of adhesion formation and the corresponding potential reductions&#xD;
      in small bowel obstruction, secondary infertility, pain and incidence of enterotomies and&#xD;
      prolonged dissection time during subsequent abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess whether the use of C-Qur™ Film decreases the incidence of&#xD;
      adhesion formation in subjects undergoing colorectal surgery with a temporary loop ileostomy&#xD;
      or loop/split colostomy. Treatment with the application of C-Qur™ Film as an adhesion&#xD;
      prevention barrier for colorectal surgery will be compared with the control group at the&#xD;
      second stage ostomy takedown procedure. The primary outcome evaluation will be assessment of&#xD;
      adhesions to the incision site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety objective is to assess the number and type of post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, physician initiated, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects undergoing colorectal resection requiring temporary loop ileostomy or&#xD;
      loop/split colostomy by laparotomy or hand assisted laparoscopy will be included in the&#xD;
      trial. Before closure, patients are randomized 1:1 to either the treatment arm (C-Qur™ Film)&#xD;
      or control arm (no adhesion barrier). Subjects will return 8-16 weeks post-colorectal&#xD;
      resection to have their loop ileostomy or colostomy surgically taken down. During the loop&#xD;
      ileostomy/colostomy takedown, adhesions will be evaluated for incidence, extent, and&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females 18 years of age or older, undergoing elective open or hand assisted&#xD;
      laparoscopic colorectal resection for any colorectal disease with the formation of a&#xD;
      temporary loop ileostomy or loop/split colostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In subjects assigned to the treatment arm, the C-Qur™ Film must be applied under the&#xD;
      incision. Preferably it is also applied to other areas considered to be adhesiogenic, except&#xD;
      the anastomosis. The number of C-Qur™ Film sheets placed in the abdomen is limited to a&#xD;
      maximum area of coverage of 774cm2 (Please refer to Table 2 in section 6.6 for the maximum&#xD;
      number of sheets for each size).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the incidence of adhesions to the incision site in subjects&#xD;
      undergoing colorectal surgery with a temporary loop ileostomy or loop/split colostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of adhesions to the loop ileostomy or colostomy site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extent and severity of adhesions to the incision site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extent and severity of adhesions to the loop ileostomy or colostomy sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of ileostomy takedown from the start of the takedown to the time the bowel is&#xD;
           repositioned in the abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage (%) of abdominal wall with adhesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Type and frequency of surgical and medical complications, including all types of surgical&#xD;
      site infections&#xD;
