      This phase II trial studies how well bevacizumab, fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin before surgery works in treating patients with stage II-III rectal cancer.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or&#xD;
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil,&#xD;
      leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab&#xD;
      together with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin may be an effective treatment&#xD;
      for rectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if six cycles of modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      (mFOLFOX7) plus bevacizumab (Avastin) will yield complete pathologic response (cPR) of 25% or&#xD;
      more in the primary tumor of patients with stage II and III rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the rate of tumor regression (pathologic stage lower than clinical stage) after&#xD;
      6 cycles of mFOLFOX7 and bevacizumab in the primary rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess local recurrence rate over 3 years after 6 cycles of mFOLFOX7 and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlation of the following marker with response (defined as CPR or down staging):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intratumoral Gene expression and germline polymorphism of genes involved in the vascular&#xD;
           endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF independent pathways (VEGF, vascular&#xD;
           endothelial growth factor receptor 1 [VEGFR1], VEGFR2, interleukin-8 [IL8], chemokine&#xD;
           (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 [CXCR2], intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM], VEGFR1 and&#xD;
           VEGFR2, neuropilin 1 or 2 [NRP1,2], cluster of differentiation [CD] 44, aldehyde&#xD;
           dehydrogenase [ALDH], leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like [LRIG].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating tumor cells (CTC) and VEGF-factor A (A) on the CTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Prediction of surgical resection margin by pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV over 2&#xD;
      hours, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 6-8 weeks after treatment, patients undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
