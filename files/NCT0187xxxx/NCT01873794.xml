  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer related fatigue (CRF) - a persistent sense of exhaustion related to cancer or cancer&#xD;
      treatment - can severely interfere with activities of daily living, and has even been&#xD;
      reported to be a factor in patient requests for hastened death. CRF can represent a serious&#xD;
      clinical problem years after all treatment has ended. There is currently no effective&#xD;
      treatment for CRF. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether systematic exposure to&#xD;
      light (from a commercially available Litebook) reduces CRF or other symptoms.&#xD;

      Cancer related fatigue (CRF) - a persistent sense of exhaustion related to cancer or cancer&#xD;
      treatment - can severely interfere with activities of daily living, and has even been&#xD;
      reported to be a factor in patient requests for hastened death. CRF can represent a serious&#xD;
      clinical problem years after all treatment has ended. In our research with cancer survivors 1&#xD;
      to 3 years after completion of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), 40% of those we&#xD;
      interviewed reported that CRF was a major obstacle to the resumption of usual activities.&#xD;
      Despite its impact on quality of life, CRF is under-reported, under-diagnosed, and&#xD;
      under-treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of pharmacologic agents have been studied to treat CRF, but there is insufficient&#xD;
      evidence to recommend their use. The most promising non-pharmacologic interventions --&#xD;
      exercise and cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) -- have shown equally modest effects. The&#xD;
      proposed study focuses on a promising new intervention for CRF, using systematic light&#xD;
      exposure (SLE), consisting of a daily 30-minute exposure to as much as 10,000 lux of light&#xD;
      from a commercially available light box. Study collaborator, Ancoli-Israel and her colleagues&#xD;
      have successfully piloted this line of research with breast cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study will be to assess the effect of SLE on long-term HSCT and breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors, and to determine the feasibility and acceptability of SLE as an&#xD;
      intervention for CRF. The approach will be informed by the procedures that Ancoli-Israel and&#xD;
      her colleagues developed for their research on SLE treatment for breast cancer chemotherapy,&#xD;
      as well as by Redd's studies of CBT to treat adjustment disorders in survivors of HSCT. The&#xD;
      study arms will test the efficacy of two different types of light treatment, bright white&#xD;
      light and dim red light. Outcomes will be assessed through standardized measures of CRF,&#xD;
      sleep quality, and quality of life.&#xD;
