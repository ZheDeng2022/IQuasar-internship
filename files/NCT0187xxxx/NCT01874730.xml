  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre study to take place in approximately 3 centers in Seoul, South Korea.&#xD;
      The study will be carried out as a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical&#xD;
      trial in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine if&#xD;
      an enhanced recovery strategy paying close attention to the type and amount of fluid given&#xD;
      during the surgery with proper monitoring combined with a comprehensive perioperative pain&#xD;
      management will have a better post-operative outcome compared to institutional standard of&#xD;
      care (SOC), in patients undergoing surgery of the colon. One of the fluids used, Volulyte®,&#xD;
      is an intravenous solution used to treat low blood volume. The Volulyte® solution being used&#xD;
      in the study and the monitor used are approved by the Korean Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
