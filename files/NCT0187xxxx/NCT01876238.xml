  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will examine how patients with advanced breast cancer and their oncology&#xD;
      team communicate and plan ongoing care.The purpose of this study is to find out more about&#xD;
      care planning during advanced breast cancer. The study will see if certain aspects of&#xD;
      communication make a difference in how patients understand their illness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new communication practice (T-PAT) is a team approach for discussing prognosis and&#xD;
      treatment goals. T-PAT is specifically designed to a) increase understanding of the prognosis&#xD;
      and treatment goal, b) decrease illness uncertainty, and c) help the patient preserve hope&#xD;
      for the future.This dedicated clinical visit features a structured discussion of prognosis,&#xD;
      treatment goals and options, and end of life concerns. The planned team discussion will&#xD;
      include information contributions for the treating medical oncologist, an oncology nurse and&#xD;
      social worker who currently work together to provide breast cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the feasibility of implementing the T-PAT prognosis discussion intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the effects of T-PAT vs. usual care on pertinent patient reported outcomes&#xD;
           including: a) understanding of the prognosis and treatment goal, b) illness uncertainty,&#xD;
           and c) hope.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  First, a survey will be administered to patients in the waiting room before the&#xD;
                next office visit. This should take 15-20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The second part involves participating in a scheduled appointment that will be&#xD;
                audio-recorded and focus on sharing information about the patient's illness.&#xD;
                Patients will be randomized to either participate in an appointment featuring new&#xD;
                communication practices (T-PAT)or a regular care appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The third part involves a 20 minute survey, after the appointment, with a member of&#xD;
                the study staff. This will take place over the telephone one or two days after the&#xD;
                appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The fourth part is completion of a written reflection on the patients participation&#xD;
                in the study, which will be returned in a pre-addressed, stamped envelope.&#xD;
                Generally, this should take about 15 minutes.&#xD;
