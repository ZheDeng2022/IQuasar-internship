      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The purpose of this study is to find out whether color vision measured with the Cambridge&#xD;
      Color Test is a good way to examine the severity of inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). IRDs&#xD;
      are a major cause of vision loss worldwide, but very little is known about how the diseases&#xD;
      affect color vision over time. This study will tell us if color vision may be used to track&#xD;
      changes in inherited retinal diseases over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To improve understanding of color vision as a way to measure changes in inherited retinal&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People 5 years of age or older who have an IRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will make at least one visit to the National Eye Institute clinic. If they&#xD;
           sign up for more tests, they may have up to three visits to the NEI clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked questions about their medical and eye history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given an eye exam, including eye drops to dilate their pupils. They&#xD;
           will take the Cambridge Color Test, which includes looking at a monitor and pressing a&#xD;
           button, and arranging colored circles. Several other tests may be offered, but&#xD;
           participants can decline to take them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Objective: The aims of this study are to 1) examine the sensitivity of the Cambridge Color&#xD;
      Test (CCT) and the low vision CCT (LvCCT) to the severity of retinal disease in inherited&#xD;
      retinal degeneration (IRD) by comparing color vision status with changes in photoreceptor&#xD;
      structure and function, 2) examine the effects of eccentric fixation and reduction in visual&#xD;
      acuity on color discrimination thresholds obtained with the CCT and LvCCT, and 3) establish&#xD;
      normal ranges for the CCT and the LvCCT and determine the intra-session and inter-session&#xD;
      variabilities for these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Up to 59 healthy volunteers and 144 IRD participants age 5 or older will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study will be comprised of three related projects. For Aim 1, color&#xD;
      discrimination thresholds (CCT and LvCCT) and assessments of retinal structure (imaging) and&#xD;
      function (perimetry/microperimetry and electroretinogram) will be measured in 144 IRD&#xD;
      participants with varying retinal phenotypes and visual acuities. IRD participants will be&#xD;
      divided into four major categories: 1) cone &amp; cone-rod dystrophies, 2) rod-cone dystrophies,&#xD;
      3) inherited maculopathies, and 4) inherited retinal dysfunction syndromes. The fourth&#xD;
      category will be used for IRDs that do not match the description for categories 1-3 (i.e.,&#xD;
      x-linked retinoschisis, congenital stationary night blindness). Degree of severity of retinal&#xD;
      dysfunction in IRD participants will be determined relative to the normal ranges obtained&#xD;
      from the healthy volunteers (see Aim 3a below). For Aim 2 color discrimination thresholds&#xD;
      (CCT and LvCCT) will be measured in one eye from 12 healthy volunteers in order to examine&#xD;
      the effects of eccentric fixation and reduced visual acuity on color thresholds independent&#xD;
      of retinal pathology. Between one and three study visits will be required for this aim. Aim 3&#xD;
      will be comprised of two parts. For Aim 3a, color thresholds will be collected from both eyes&#xD;
      (for intraocular variability) of 35 healthy volunteers age 5 or older. For Aim 3B, color&#xD;
      discrimination thresholds (CCT and LvCCT) will measured from 12 healthy volunteers twice in&#xD;
      one session and then again at a second visit occurring within two months of the initial visit&#xD;
      to determine intra-session and inter-session variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: For both the CCT and LvCCT, an overall quantitative measure of color vision&#xD;
      will be obtained from the calculation of achromatic area. The sensitivity of CCT and LvCCT&#xD;
      will be examined by comparing achromatic area for IRD participants with varying levels of&#xD;
      phenotype severity defined by measures of retinal structure and function. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      for this study include: 1) evaluation of sensitivity of the CCT and LvCCT to disease&#xD;
      severity,&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) evaluation of the effects of decreased visual acuity and eccentricity on color&#xD;
      discrimination thresholds (CCT and LvCCT), 3) establishment of the normal range of color&#xD;
      discrimination thresholds (CCT and LvCCT) as a function of age, and 4) determination of&#xD;
      intra- and inter-session variabilities of the two tests.&#xD;
