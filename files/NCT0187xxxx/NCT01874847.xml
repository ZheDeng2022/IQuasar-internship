      PURPOSE: The long-term goal of this line of research is to develop rational, biologically&#xD;
      based evidence for the treatment of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) in children. The objective&#xD;
      of this application is to examine the effect of melatonin on the symptoms of PCS and its&#xD;
      neurobiology using integrated neurodiagnostic techniques in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERVIEW: PCS is a constellation of clinical symptoms including physical (i.e. headaches),&#xD;
      cognitive (i.e. memory), and behavioral disturbances. PCS is associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity in the child and his/her family), and yet there are no evidence-based medical&#xD;
      treatments available. This suggests an urgent need to develop novel treatment options to&#xD;
      improve outcomes for children suffering from PCS. Melatonin has several relevant mechanisms&#xD;
      of action, and neuroprotective effects. Recent research suggests that the explanations for&#xD;
      persistent PCS symptoms may be due to alterations in neurotransmissions and neuronal&#xD;
      circuitry, particularly involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Investigators&#xD;
      have two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if treatment with melatonin improves PCS in children following mild&#xD;
           traumatic brain injury. Hypothesis: treatment of mTBI children with PCS with 3mg or 10mg&#xD;
           of oral melatonin for 28 days will result in a decrease in PCS symptoms as compared with&#xD;
           placebo. Effects will be dose-dependent and may be independent of sleep effects.&#xD;
           Methods: A randomized double blind, placebo controlled trial (RCT); Outcome measure is a&#xD;
           PCS symptom questionnaire. A subsequent RCT will then be performed using the optimal&#xD;
           melatonin dose at a second centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand the neurophysiological mechanisms of paediatric PCS and assess any&#xD;
           resultant effects of treatment with melatonin. Methods: A case-controlled study within&#xD;
           the RCT, using functional MRI and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to investigate the&#xD;
           neurophysiological properties of paediatric mTBI before and after treatment; Treatment&#xD;
           groups from the RCT will be compared with two control groups: i) normal controls and ii)&#xD;
           asymptomatic mTBI children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE: This study has the potential to 1) provide a safe and effective treatment for&#xD;
      PCS and 2) will provide valuable information about the neurophysiological properties of the&#xD;
      brain associated with PCS following mTBI in children and how these change with symptom&#xD;
      resolution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the treatment of children with PCS following mTBI with 3mg or 10mg of&#xD;
      Melatonin for 28 days will result in a decrease in PCS symptoms as compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the treatment of children with PCS symptoms following mTBI with 3mg sublingual Melatonin&#xD;
      or 10mg of sublingual Melatonin for 28 days result in a decrease in PCS (physical, cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioural) symptoms as compared with placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there a dose-response relationship? Is the treatment effect independent of the effect on&#xD;
      sleep?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled superiority&#xD;
      trial. Three parallel treatment groups will be examined with a 1:1:1 allocation: 1)&#xD;
      sublingual placebo, 2) sublingual Melatonin 3mg, and 3) sublingual Melatonin 10mg. Groups&#xD;
      will be allocated using a randomization sequence that will be created in variable random&#xD;
      block sizes (multiples of 3: 3, 6, and 9) to aid in concealment of next allocation, using&#xD;
      random number generating software. The primary endpoint is the change on the Post-Concussion&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory Score for parent and adolescent. The design allows for dose dependent&#xD;
      response assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: Two academic children's hospitals in Canada Target Population: All children&#xD;
      aged 13 to 18 years presenting to the ED of ACH and CHEO with a mTBI who remain symptomatic&#xD;
      at 30 days post-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized in equal proportions between three groups: placebo, 3mg&#xD;
      Melatonin and 10mg Melatonin. Medication is taken sublingually one hour before sleep time at&#xD;
      night for 28 days and will be continued even if there is symptom resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for proposed dosages: Receptor-mediated effects occur at physiological doses (e.g.,&#xD;
      in children with chronic insomnia effects are achieved at 0.05-0.15mg/kg). However, to&#xD;
      achieve non-Melatonin receptor mediated effects (e.g. GABAergic effects, direct free radical&#xD;
      scavenging and antioxidant effects) may require supra-physiological doses. 3mg Melatonin is a&#xD;
      standard dose used in clinical practice and lower doses do not achieve the same analgesic and&#xD;
      anxiolytic effects; however, 3mg may be insufficient to saturate Melatonin receptors and&#xD;
      could fall short of the supraphysiological doses we are aiming for to achieve the&#xD;
      non-receptor mediated effects. To do this, a higher dose of 10mg will be used which is a&#xD;
      logarithmical increase and is still in a clinically acceptable range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modifications: No serious side effects have been reported with Melatonin treatment at the&#xD;
      above doses. Higher doses (70mg/day) have been used in children with muscular dystrophy with&#xD;
      no adverse events. Occasionally excessive daytime sleepiness has been reported which should&#xD;
      be reported as an adverse event. This usually resolves in a few days. Treatment should&#xD;
      continue unless the sleepiness is problematic for more than 3 days in which case half a&#xD;
      tablet may be tried (after reporting this to the study team).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of study pill will occur at home under the supervision of the parent. When the&#xD;
      study pill is dispensed, the research coordinator will review the importance of following&#xD;
      study guidelines, instructions about taking study pills including timing, storage, and what&#xD;
      to do in the event of a missed dose. Instructions about the purpose, use, and care of the&#xD;
      study pill will be included with the package. Families will be notified that there will be a&#xD;
      pill count at every study visit and the importance of calling the clinic if experiencing&#xD;
      problems possibly related to study product such as symptoms, or lost pills. Methodologies to&#xD;
      maximize follow-up and compliance include convenient follow-up times, participant engagement&#xD;
      strategies (e.g. newsletters, website) and experienced research personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence assessments will include a daily diary, and abreview of the medication log, pill&#xD;
      count every week, and a review of reasons for non-compliance. Unused tablets will be counted&#xD;
      and recorded on the appropriate case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant care: There are no restrictions on the use of other medications. All participants&#xD;
      will be advised to try to avoid analgesia overuse. Participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      diary of any medications, medical appointments and alternative therapies.&#xD;
