      Neck pain is a common symptom in most patients suffering from cervical radiculopathy.&#xD;
      However, some conservative treatments are limited by their modest effectiveness. On the other&#xD;
      hand, surgical intervention for cervical disc disorders is indicated when symptoms are&#xD;
      refractory to conservative treatments and neurological symptoms are progressive. Many&#xD;
      patients use complementary and alternative medicine, including Traditional Chinese Medicine,&#xD;
      to address their symptoms. The purpose of the present study is to examine effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of Qishe Pill, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, for neck pain in&#xD;
      patients with cervical radiculopathy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical radiculopathy is a distinct consideration in the evaluation of any patients who have&#xD;
      neck pain and may be defined simply as an abnormality of a nerve root which originates in the&#xD;
      cervical spine. The initial approach to the management of cervical spondylopathic&#xD;
      radiculopathy is nearly the same as that of nonspecific neck or back pain that can be found&#xD;
      in most patients. Conservative treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs), narcotics, muscle relaxants, physical therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (TENS). The main objectives of conservative treatments are to relieve pain,&#xD;
      improve function and improve health-related quality of life. However, these treatments for&#xD;
      cervical radiculopathy are limited by their modest effectiveness. Surgical treatment for&#xD;
      cervical disc disease is indicated when symptoms are refractory to conservative treatments&#xD;
      and neurological symptoms are progressive. In terms of pharmacotherapy, there is generally no&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial available comparing standard nonsurgical treatment.&#xD;
      Therefore, care plans should be designed principally based on accumulated experience, the&#xD;
      services available locally, and the respective preferences of patients. Treatment plans are&#xD;
      developed to alleviate pain, improve function, and prevent recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), herbal medicines have the potential to&#xD;
      avoid the adverse effects of medications and surgery.According to the basic theory of&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the obstruction of Qi flow and blood circulation in the&#xD;
      neck area caused by pathogenic factors, such as &quot;Feng&quot;(wind), &quot;Han&quot;(cold), &quot;Shi&quot;(dampness),&#xD;
      invading the neck induces cervical degenerative disc diseases which are the cause of cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy. According to the four traditional methods of diagnosis -observation,&#xD;
      listening, interrogation, and pulse-taking, TCM doctors can analyze the specific pathogenic&#xD;
      factors which cause neck pain. Accordingly they can then prescribe herbal formulae based on&#xD;
      the effect and the main indications according to the principles of Chinese medicine. Natural&#xD;
      substances, including herbal medicines, have been used to promote healing and alleviate neck&#xD;
      pain in western countries. Previous studies have demonstrated that some active substances in&#xD;
      herbal medicine can promote Qi flow and blood circulation to alleviate pain.&#xD;
