  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common condition, and the number of people with advanced disease continues&#xD;
      to increase. We need new treatments that improve patients' symptoms and extend life. Recently&#xD;
      the new CircuLite Synergy pump has come into use. It is the smallest pump manufactured to&#xD;
      date and does not cover the full work of the heart, instead providing &quot;partial&quot; support. One&#xD;
      interesting thing about this is that taking some strain off the heart might allow the muscle&#xD;
      to repair and rebuild its own strength. This process is called reverse remodelling, and is&#xD;
      the topic of this research. Our hypothesis is that &quot;partial&quot; support improves patients'&#xD;
      symptoms and causes improvement in heart muscle function. We also want to examine the best&#xD;
      techniques for assessing this, including new scanning and molecular tests, and study some&#xD;
      practical aspects of the pump to do with blood clotting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CircuLite Synergy pump is a new minimally-invasive partial support left ventricular&#xD;
      assist device (LVAD) that pumps blood from the left atrium to the right subclavian artery. Ex&#xD;
      vivo pilot data suggests that the Synergy pump induces structural reverse remodelling, which&#xD;
      proposes the Synergy device as a new disease-modifying therapy. We will assess whether the&#xD;
      Synergy pump facilitates functional, structural and molecular LV reverse remodelling in vivo;&#xD;
      assess how this can be determined and predicted by analysis of circulating micro RNA profiles&#xD;
      and specific echocardiographic parameters; and evaluate the haematological abnormalities&#xD;
      associated with this new LVAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will address these questions with a prospective, observational study comparing patients&#xD;
      implanted with the Synergy device with matched heart failure controls. The two study centres&#xD;
      will be Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust (Harefield Hospital) and University&#xD;
      Hospitals Leuven, Belgium. We will recruit a total of 64 patients. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be change in peak VO2 at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include functional parameters,&#xD;
      profiling of circulating microRNA, multimodal echocardiographic assessment and comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment of platelet activation and coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will quantify the LV reverse remodelling associated with partial support; define new echo&#xD;
      and microRNA markers of reverse remodelling for clinical use, with insights into underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology; and describe the haematological profile of these patients to guide future&#xD;
      antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
