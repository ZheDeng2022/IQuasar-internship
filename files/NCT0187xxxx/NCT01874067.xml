    <textblock>
      This is a collaborative study with 11 Occupational Therapy (OT) departments in North-West&#xD;
      England. The OTs provide arthritis gloves to 25% of out-patients with inflammatory,&#xD;
      rheumatoid and osteoarthritis. The pressure applied by the glove(s) may help relieve hand&#xD;
      pain, swelling and stiffness. People find they help but there is little research testing&#xD;
      this. Of the five small studies published: two found little or no benefit; one found similar&#xD;
      effects from arthritis and ordinary thermal gloves; two found some benefits. Testing if&#xD;
      gloves work helps therapists and patients judge if they will help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study to help us plan a future trial testing if arthritis gloves work&#xD;
      for people with arthritis. We aim to find out: the rate we can recruit people to the study;&#xD;
      if OTs can assess people's hands and provide gloves as agreed; how many people do we need to&#xD;
      take part in a trial; what do people think (if any) is the gloves' most important effect and&#xD;
      how long should we test them for? We will analyse the data to see what effect the gloves&#xD;
      have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 12 months. People will get arthritis gloves as part of their usual care.&#xD;
      The OTs have agreed a standard way of assessing and providing the gloves to ensure best&#xD;
      practice across departments. The assessments include: difficulties using hands, pain and&#xD;
      stiffness levels, and measuring hand and finger joint size and movement. People can take part&#xD;
      if they: have one of the three types of arthritis; are willing to wear Isotoner three-quarter&#xD;
      length gloves; can attend the usual 4 week review appointment for re-assessment; will allow&#xD;
      us to use their anonymized hand assessments. We will also interview some people about their&#xD;
      views of the assessment and their treatment. Each patient will be involved for 4-8 weeks.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational study of usual care providing arthritis gloves with pre- and 4 weeks&#xD;
      post-treatment assessment. Participants are screened and recruited (if eligible and&#xD;
      consenting) as they attend for glove provision as part of routine care. (Participants are not&#xD;
      randomly assigned).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-quarter length finger Isotoner glove(s) for one or both hands, as required. The&#xD;
      participating OTs determine if patients meet their agreed criteria for gloves as part of&#xD;
      usual care. Usually at the same appointment the OT then assesses for and provides these using&#xD;
      the assessment and treatment protocols agreed by North West England College of Occupational&#xD;
      Therapists Specialist Section - Rheumatology (NWCOTSS-R) members as part of their usual care.&#xD;
      Four weeks later, patients attend a review appointment (as part of their usual care) for&#xD;
      re-assessment of their hand(s), and to identify any effects the gloves have had and if any&#xD;
      problems arose meaning glove wear should be stopped or the wear regimen altered. Normally the&#xD;
      patient attends for two appointments only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational therapist (OT) training&#xD;
&#xD;
      The members of the NWCOTSS-R group agreed the glove provision criteria, hand assessment and&#xD;
      treatment protocols and glove instruction sheet in order to improve standards of usual care&#xD;
      in glove provision across Rheumatology OT departments. Prior to recruitment commencing, the&#xD;
      participating OTs attended a training meeting to ensure they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  performed the hand assessments (i.e. swelling, finger flexion and Grip Ability Test)&#xD;
           reliably.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Know how to correctly size and fit the gloves following training by an experienced&#xD;
           Rheumatology OT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  understand the study procedures, know how to take study specific consent and complete&#xD;
           study site documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardised assessment kit and manual was provided to the OTs by the University research&#xD;
      centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Meet the criteria agreed by NWCOTSS-R members for receiving compression gloves as part&#xD;
           of usual OT care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adults with either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. early inflammatory, probable or definite RA, diagnosed by a Rheumatology Consultant ii.&#xD;
      hand OA, diagnosed by a GP, Consultant or Advanced Practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c) Willing and able to wear three-quarter length Isotoner glove(s), following the glove&#xD;
      fitting process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d) Willing to attend for the glove review appointment (part of usual care) approximately four&#xD;
      weeks following glove provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      e) Has a terminal illness, or other health or personal issues, such that the OT considers the&#xD;
      patient's participation may be an undue burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f) Has any other condition which could alter hand symptoms and function between assessments&#xD;
      (eg stroke, multiple sclerosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      g) In early IA/RA or hand OA: received an intra-articular or intra-muscular steroid injection&#xD;
      or started a new anti-inflammatory drug within the last 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      h) In established RA only: started a new DMARD within the last 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 people from each of the: early IA or RA; and Hand OA, condition groups will be recruited.&#xD;
      As this is a feasibility study no sample size has been calculated.&#xD;
