  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a diet prior to administration of contrast&#xD;
      agent in terms of a preventive procedure which leads to an attenuation of the&#xD;
      contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a known kidney disease are especially at risk. A potential beneficial effect of&#xD;
      a diet prior to intervention has been shown in investigations in mammals, therefore this&#xD;
      study will investigate if a pre-interventional diet in patients with known kidney disease and&#xD;
      scheduled contrast agent examination can attenuate or prevent a post-interventional loss of&#xD;
      kidney function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with contrast agent examinations are at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)&#xD;
      and in succession acute renal failure which is associated with significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. None of the currently used preventive procedures show a benefit in terms of a&#xD;
      CIN-prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental data suggests, that a pre-interventional caloric restriction might provide&#xD;
      kidney protection in this context. This clinical trial investigates if this phenomenon is&#xD;
      also applicable in humans. Patients with increased risk for a post-interventional renal&#xD;
      failure due to known chronic kidney disease are randomized in 2 groups. Patients of the diet&#xD;
      group receive a calorie restriction to 60% of the calculated daily energy rate from day -4&#xD;
      until day -1 (included) pre-intervention (day 0 corresponds to day of intervention). Patients&#xD;
      of the control group receive alimentation ad libitum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is the increase of serum creatinine in mg/dl 48 h after begin of&#xD;
      intervention in comparison to baseline value obtained in the morning of the day of&#xD;
      intervention (day 0) in order to analyse if a pre-interventional calorie restriction as a&#xD;
      preventive strategy leads to an attenuation of post-interventioal kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A four day calorie restriction reduces the increase of serum creatinine after&#xD;
      administration of contrast agent in patients with known chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
