  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will treat participants with newly diagnosed, low, intermediate and high risk&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) using multi-modality risk-adapted therapy with standard or intensified&#xD;
      dose chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection. Intermediate and high risk participants&#xD;
      will receive an additional 12 weeks (4 cycles) of maintenance therapy with anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate event-free survival for intermediate risk participants treated with&#xD;
           vincristine, dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide with the addition of maintenance&#xD;
           anti-angiogenic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the false negative rate and incidence of additional positive lymph nodes in&#xD;
           participants undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by limited nodal dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintain a high local control rate in participants treated with surgery and/or limited&#xD;
           volume proton and photon radiation without dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the incidence and type of failure in participants who receive risk-adapted local&#xD;
           therapy relative to the primary tumor volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the feasibility of delivering 4 cycles of maintenance anti-angiogenic&#xD;
           chemotherapy in intermediate and high risk patients following standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the event free survival for high risk patients receiving interval dose&#xD;
           compressed therapy and maintenance anti-angiogenic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the incidence of CTC grade 3 and higher toxicities (and specific grade 1-2&#xD;
           toxicities) related to proton beam therapy.&#xD;

      Participants will be stratified based on both a pretreatment staging system and a&#xD;
      post-surgery surgico/pathologic clinical grouping system. Treatment for low-risk (subset 1)&#xD;
      participants will consist of chemotherapy and radiation. Low-risk (subset 2) and&#xD;
      intermediate-risk participants will receive chemotherapy and radiation and/or undergo surgery&#xD;
      to destroy/remove the tumor. Intermediate-risk participants will also receive 16 weeks of&#xD;
      maintenance chemotherapy. High-risk participants will receive chemotherapy and radiation&#xD;
      therapy. High-risk participants will also receive additional maintenance therapy with&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic chemotherapy.&#xD;

Dexrazoxane is given prior to each dose of doxorubicin. Radiation therapy begins at week 4 or 20 (depending on tumor location) while receiving vincristine and irinotecan. 2 cycles of VDC/IE, 4 cycles of modified vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC), then 2 cycles of modified vincristine/irinotecan (total of 54 weeks).
