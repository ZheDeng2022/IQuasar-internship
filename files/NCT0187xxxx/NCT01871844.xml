  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a within group, randomised, repeated dose, placebo- and octreotide controlled study&#xD;
      in a target population of 45 healthy male subjects. Subjects were required to attend the&#xD;
      clinical for screening procedures between 3 and 28 days before dosing commenced. The study&#xD;
      was conducted in 4 groups of subjects; Groups 1 to 3 were a double-blinded, randomised&#xD;
      design, each consisting of 12 subjects. Group 4 was an open-label design and consisted of 9&#xD;
      subjects. There was a minimum interval of 96 h between dosing of Groups 1, 2 and 3 to allow&#xD;
      for interim analyses of PK and safety/tolerability data for dose escalation purposes. Group 4&#xD;
      (the active control group) was still to proceed if the decision was taken to prematurely stop&#xD;
      dosing with ITF2984 (somatostatin analogue) following review of the PK and safety data&#xD;
      presented at the interim decision meeting; dosing of this group was conducted independently&#xD;
      from Groups 1 to 3. On Days 1 to 6, subjects in Groups 1 to 3 were to receive 2 doses of&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) approximately 12 h apart; subjects in Group 4 were to&#xD;
      receive 3 doses of IMP approximately 8 h apart. For all groups, subjects were scheduled to&#xD;
      receive their final dose of IMP on the morning of Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, subjects were to receive exogenous test administrations(stimulation test) on Day&#xD;
      -1, Day 1 and Day 7 at the same time on each day (ie for Day -1, 23.5 h before the first dose&#xD;
      of IMP, and for Days 1 and 7, 0.5 h after the first dose of IMP on the respective day). Blood&#xD;
      samples for PD and PK analyses were taken at specified time points after each dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects remained on site for 10 days (ie 36 h after the final dose of IMP on Day 7)&#xD;
      providing that discharge conditions had been met, and returned to the clinic between 5 and 10&#xD;
      days after the last IMP administration for a follow-up visit.&#xD;
