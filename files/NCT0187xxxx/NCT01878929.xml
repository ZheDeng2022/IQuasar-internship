  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) is a widely used and effective treatment modality&#xD;
      for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. SCIT starts with a build-up phase during which a&#xD;
      patient receives frequent, escalating doses of the allergens they are allergic to until they&#xD;
      reach a predetermined maintenance dose. This is followed by a maintenance phase during which&#xD;
      the allergen dose is kept constant and administered at greater intervals. Maximum clinical&#xD;
      improvement is generally not seen until a patient is in the maintenance phase. Anecdotal&#xD;
      evidence of possible reactions to SCIT administered during a patient's pollen season has led&#xD;
      to dosage freezes during a patient's pollen season which extends the length of the build-up&#xD;
      phase by many months. Prolonging the buildup phase increases the time required to obtain&#xD;
      maximal benefit from SCIT, and at the same time, can decrease patient compliance with therapy&#xD;
      due to the prolonged period of time when frequent injections are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to determine if adverse reactions to pollen SCIT are increased if&#xD;
      doses are increased during pollen season.&#xD;

      Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) is a widely used and effective treatment modality&#xD;
      for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. SCIT starts with a build-up phase during which a&#xD;
      patient receives frequent, escalating doses of the allergens they are allergic to until they&#xD;
      reach a predetermined maintenance dose. This is followed by a maintenance phase during which&#xD;
      the allergen dose is kept constant and administered at greater intervals. Maximum clinical&#xD;
      improvement is generally not seen until a patient is in the maintenance phase. Anecdotal&#xD;
      evidence of possible reactions to SCIT administered during a patient's pollen season has led&#xD;
      to dosage freezes during a patient's pollen season which extends the length of the build-up&#xD;
      phase by many months. Prolonging the buildup phase increases the time required to obtain&#xD;
      maximal benefit from SCIT, and at the same time, can decrease patient compliance with therapy&#xD;
      due to the prolonged period of time when frequent injections are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to determine if adverse reactions to pollen SCIT are increased if&#xD;
      doses are increased during pollen season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if escalating pollen SCIT doses during the pollen season is&#xD;
      associated with an increased rate of immediate reactions in comparison to holding SCIT doses&#xD;
      constant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will not be an increased rate of immediate reactions to SCIT in build up&#xD;
      phase received during the pollen season in comparison to SCIT held for pollen season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy: In a prospective trial, 245 subjects will be randomized to receive monthly (doses&#xD;
      held constant) or weekly (doses built up) injections. Rate of immediate local and systemic&#xD;
      reactions per injection will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if escalating pollen SCIT doses during the pollen season is&#xD;
      associated with an increased rate of delayed reactions in comparison to holding SCIT doses&#xD;
      constant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will not be an increased rate of delayed reactions to SCIT in build up&#xD;
      phase received during the pollen season in comparison to SCIT held for pollen season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy: In a prospective trial, 245 subjects will be randomized to receive monthly (doses&#xD;
      held constant) or weekly (doses built up) injections. Rate of delayed reactions per injection&#xD;
      will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy is one of the most effective therapies for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, but&#xD;
      the protocol dosing during pollen season is based on limited data. Immunotherapy is given in&#xD;
      increasing dosage during the build up phase in order to build tolerance. After the build up&#xD;
      phase, there is a maintenance phase that is used for the remainder of therapy. At this time,&#xD;
      there is little data to support the common practice of not increasing the dosage of&#xD;
      immunotherapy during pollen seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent allergen immunotherapy practice parameter references 2 articles that have noted no&#xD;
      increased systemic reactions to SCIT during pollen season. , In one prospective study, it was&#xD;
      concluded that there was no direct correlation of reactions to SCIT and pollen season.3 They&#xD;
      did note a correlation between the mean monthly mold counts in August to October and the rate&#xD;
      of systemic reactions. The other study referenced is a prospective study which did not&#xD;
      observe a statistically significant difference in the rate of systemic reactions to grass or&#xD;
      ragweed pollen during their respective pollen seasons.4 However, the conclusions of these&#xD;
      studies are conflicted by another study which consists of surveys retrospectively sent to&#xD;
      members of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology. The surveys in this study&#xD;
      identified 46% of near fatal reactions to SCIT as occurring during peak allergy season.&#xD;
      Though the immunotherapy standard parameters are not defining pollen season as a&#xD;
      contraindication, we will consider it more that minimal risk for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is still common practice to stop the buildup phase and not escalate SCIT dosing during&#xD;
      pollen season due to the conflicting available data and limitations in study design of many&#xD;
      of the studies (retrospective, questionnaire based). A further look into SCIT dosing during&#xD;
      pollen season will allow for more standardized practice and potentially improved patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
