  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some studies have recently shown that the concentration of erythropoietin in the vitreous&#xD;
      humor of diabetic patients suffering from diabetic retinopathy is higher than non-diabetic&#xD;
      patients. It was reported a higher concentration of erythropoietin in vitreous humor than&#xD;
      blood, indicating a local production. In some cases it was also found a positive association&#xD;
      between concentrations of Erythropoietin and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Both&#xD;
      of these factors, erythropoietin and VEGF, show important angiogenic activity and may play a&#xD;
      role in the development of diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study enrolled type 2 diabetic patients with PDR who had to undergo vitrectomy during&#xD;
      the period May 2011-January 2012 at the Unit of Ophthalmology, A.O. Civil Hospital and&#xD;
      University of Brescia. Inclusion criteria were the following: type 2 diabetes, age greater&#xD;
      than 18 years, and PDR; exclusion criteria were: age less than 18 years, type 1 diabetes,&#xD;
      initial DR, PDR patients not requiring surgery, previous vitrectomy in the eye under&#xD;
      examination or other ophthalmic surgery or laser therapy within the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-diabetic patients who underwent vitrectomy for macular hole or pucker represented the&#xD;
      control group (CTRLs); their inclusion criteria were: age greater than 18 years and the&#xD;
      presence of macular pucker or macular hole requiring vitrectomy. Exclusion criteria were: age&#xD;
      less than 18 years, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and previous vitrectomy in the eye under&#xD;
      examination or other ophthalmic surgery or laser therapy within the previous 3 months. All&#xD;
      patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination (visual acuity, slit lamp,&#xD;
      tonometry, fluorescein retinal angiography, and optical coherence tomography -OCT-). Informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all patients after a detailed description of the aims and&#xD;
      procedures of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data were recorded for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Population: age (years), sex (M/F);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical: diabetes (Absent or Type 2); time since initial diagnosis of diabetes (years);&#xD;
           type of therapy for DM: diet, oral hypoglycaemic agents, mixed (oral agents and insulin,&#xD;
           insulin); hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 and diastolic blood&#xD;
           pressure &gt; 90 mmHg or on antihypertensive drugs); current (Yes/No) antihypertensive&#xD;
           therapy; use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
           inhibitors (ACE-i); presence of hypercholesterolaemia, comorbidities, therapy with&#xD;
           statins (Yes/No), anticoagulants (Yes/No), antiplatelet therapy (Yes/No); other&#xD;
           therapies performed, smoking (non-smoker, active smoker); complications of diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus present at the time of evaluation (heart disease, nephropathy, neuropathy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ocular: eye (OD/OS); visual acuity; presence and grade of diabetic retinopathy; presence&#xD;
           of emovitreo; presence of diabetic macular oedema; presence of cataract or lens implant;&#xD;
           intervention with phacoemulsification during vitrectomy; presence of retinal diseases,&#xD;
           or any other concomitant eye diseases; performance of previous retinal laser therapy,&#xD;
           intravitreal injection of Avastin before the vitrectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biochemical: Haemoglobin (g/dL); glucose (mg/dL); glycated haemoglobin (%); platelets&#xD;
           (N/mmc); creatinine (mg/dL); albuminuria (mg/day), creatinine clearance (mL/min),&#xD;
           calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula; total&#xD;
           cholesterol (mg/dL); HDL and LDL; triglycerides (mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent a 23- or 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy. The primary outcome of the&#xD;
      study was the measurement of EPO and VEGF concentrations in serum and vitreous and aqueous&#xD;
      humor. Blood samples, taken before surgery, were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to&#xD;
      separate the serum fraction, which was stored at -80°C. Aqueous and vitreous humor were taken&#xD;
      during the surgery and immediately frozen at -80°C. Both EPO and VEGF concentrations were&#xD;
      measured in serum and vitreous humor; however, owing to the small amount of sample, only EPO&#xD;
      concentrations were determined in aqueous humor. EPO was assayed by radioimmunoassay&#xD;
      (Immulite EPO 200, Siemens), with the lowest detection limit of 1.0 mIU/mL. VEGF was assayed&#xD;
      by ELISA (Human VEGF Immunoassay, R &amp; D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK) with a lower limit of&#xD;
      detection of 10.0 pg/mL. VEGF concentrations below the lower limit of detection were set to 5&#xD;
      pg/mL to perform statistical analysis. VEGF values above 2000 pg/mL were set to 2500 pg/mL;&#xD;
      statistical tests were also performed after deleting the data above 2000 pg/mL.&#xD;
