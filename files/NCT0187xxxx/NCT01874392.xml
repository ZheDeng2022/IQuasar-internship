  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a feasibility study to assess the performance of an Artificial&#xD;
      Pancreas (AP) device using the Artificial Pancreas System (APS©) platform for subjects with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes using rapid-acting insulin as well as preprandial inhaled insulin&#xD;
      (Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation System by MannKind Corporation). The goal of this proposed&#xD;
      study is to explore the feasibility of using multiple insulin delivery routes in order to&#xD;
      mimic the physiology of both first- and second-phase insulin secretion. The intent is to&#xD;
      exploit the rapid action achieved by inhaled insulin to compensate for part of the meals and&#xD;
      utilize the conventional subcutaneous route for management of basal insulin and as&#xD;
      second-phase meal-related insulin.&#xD;
