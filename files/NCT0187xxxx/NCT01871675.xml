  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to characterize the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy profile of IPI-145 given in combination with rituximab, or bendamustine&#xD;
      plus rituximab, to subjects with select relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of two parallel arms. For each treatment arm, a 3+3 dose escalation&#xD;
      design will be applied in 3-6 subject cohorts until the maximum tolerated dose of IPI-145&#xD;
      when given with rituximab (Arm 1) or in combination with rituximab and bendamustine (Arm 2)&#xD;
      is determined. Treatment arm selection will be chosen by the investigator and will depend on&#xD;
      the agents previously administered to the subject. Once the MTD has been determined, the arms&#xD;
      will move on to a dose expansion phase. During the dose expansion phase, each treatment arm&#xD;
      will enroll to population specific cohorts to assess efficacy. All subjects must have had at&#xD;
      least one prior anticancer treatment. The dose expansion cohorts are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Cohort A - CLL: Cohort B - CD20+ NHL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Cohort A - CLL: Cohort B - CD20+ NHL&#xD;
