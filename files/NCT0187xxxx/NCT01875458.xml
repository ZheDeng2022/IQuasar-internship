  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bisphosphonates are drugs that prevent bone loss by blocking the activity of cells that&#xD;
      normally resorb bone. The most common examples of these drugs are Boniva and Fosamax. These&#xD;
      drugs are available for oral or intravenous dosing and are prescribed at daily, weekly,&#xD;
      biweekly, or monthly intervals. Among the many thousands of individuals who currently take&#xD;
      these medications, certain individuals experience &quot;atypical&quot; femur fractures preceded by&#xD;
      prodromal pain, changes in cortical thickening of bone, or bisphosphonate related&#xD;
      osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ). Osteonecrosis of the jaws is defined as exposed bone of&#xD;
      the jaws for 8 weeks or more and requires surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will attempt to identify genomic and rna biomarkers that may play a role in&#xD;
      differential metabolism of bisphosphonates or indicate tendency toward the severe adverse&#xD;
      events associated with these drugs.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>DNA analysis of saliva, blood, and tissues to detect differential response to drugs. DNA will be isolated from each sample and ADME profiling will be performed. Each participant subgroup will be compared to each other using ANOVA modeling. Each participant subgroup will be compared to normative data for the distribution of gene profiles in the general population for each probe on the ADME gene array.</description>

    <description>The relative abundance of miRNA across each participant subgroup will be compared using ANOVA modeling. Each participant subgroup will be compared to normative data for the distribution of miRNA expression profiles in the general population for each probe when available.</description>

    <measure>Microbiome (Bacterial and viral composition) of samples within and across participant groups will be assessed and compared to normative data.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Using microbial genetic methods, we plan to determine the bacterial and viral diversity found in samples to evaluate the possible role of bacteria on the response to drugs. Microbiome metagenomics established within and across each participant subgroup will be correlated with ADME profiling results to assess the potential impact these two phenomena have on each other.</description>
