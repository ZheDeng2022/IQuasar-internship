             Oxford for vaccination for the duration of the trial period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No relevant findings in medical history or on physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation of prior vaccination with BCG not less than 6 months prior to projected&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinical, radiological, or laboratory evidence of current active TB disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous vaccination with candidate vaccine MVA85A or candidate vaccine FP85A or any&#xD;
             other recombinant MVA vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant history of skin disorder, allergy, immunodeficiency (including&#xD;
             HIV), autoimmune disease, cancer (except BCC or CIS), cardiovascular disease,&#xD;

          -  History of anaphylaxis to vaccination or any allergy likely to be exacerbated by any&#xD;
             component of the trial vaccine, including eggs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any abnormality of screening blood or urine tests that is deemed to be clinically&#xD;
             significant or that may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive HBsAg, HCV or HIV antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female currently lactating, confirmed pregnancy or intention to become pregnant during&#xD;
             trial period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of an investigational medicinal product or non-registered drug, live vaccine, or&#xD;
             medical device other than the trial vaccine for 30 days prior to dosing with the trial&#xD;
             vaccine, or planned use during the trial period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months&#xD;
             preceding the planned trial vaccination date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant disease, disorder, or finding, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk or may influence the result of the&#xD;
