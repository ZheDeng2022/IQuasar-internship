    <textblock>
      Background: Responsive stimulation and/or enhanced nutrition interventions delivered to&#xD;
      children through health programs shows improved cognitive, language, and motor, and the&#xD;
      social-emotional status. This could benefit young children in Lebanon and worldwide to&#xD;
      improve their developmental potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This study aims to implement Care for Child Development (CCD) intervention for children&#xD;
      aged 0-3 years within a supportive environment in Day Care Centers and to investigate its&#xD;
      effectiveness on early child development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: CCD program will be implemented in 10 randomly selected daycare centers in&#xD;
      Lebanon where three providers in each center will be trained (CCD-group). Another group of 10&#xD;
      day care centers will serve as controls (WV-group). 228 Children in each group will receive&#xD;
      either early stimulation based on CCD and education from the World Vision Infant and Young&#xD;
      Child Feeding (WV-IYCF) project (CCD-group) or education from the WV-IYCF project (WV-group).&#xD;
      Caregivers' knowledge and behaviors will be assessed before and after the intervention using&#xD;
      a predetermined questionnaire and behavioral checklist. Early child development will be&#xD;
      assessed using Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) and Bayley Scale for infant&#xD;
      Development (BSID-III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome: Implementation of CCD program in day care centers will be feasible and will&#xD;
      lead to enhanced early child development. This study will serve as a prototype for program&#xD;
      implementation throughout the country and the region.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims at testing the implementation and effectiveness of the CCD program on early&#xD;
      child development in selected day care centers in Beirut. It is being conducted in&#xD;
      collaboration with World Vision and the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day Care centers are invited by the ministry of health to participate in this proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After securing the approval of the Center's director, caregivers working at those day care&#xD;
      centers are being invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those caregivers who agree to participate will receive either training on the CCD program AND&#xD;
      early child nutrition from World Vision (Infant &amp; Young Child Feeding Project WV-IYCFP)&#xD;
      (Intervention group) or training on early child nutrition from WV-IYCFP only (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Care for Child Development (CCD) Program developed by World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      /UNICEF provides caregivers with recommendations for stimulating child development through&#xD;
      play and communication activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WV-IYCFP provides activities related to raising awareness on breastfeeding and complementary&#xD;
      food introduction to optimize child nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention group (CCD-Group) consists of 10 day care centers chosen randomly. Three&#xD;
      caregivers from each center (total 30 caregivers) will attend a day-and-a-half CCD training&#xD;
      at the Center of Excellence for Early Child Development at AUBMC. In addition, they will&#xD;
      participate in the World Vision activities related to the Infant &amp; Young Child Feeding&#xD;
      Project (WV-IYCFP). The day care centers in this group will receive a manual including early&#xD;
      child development concepts and techniques to be used as a reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control group (WV-Group) consists of 10 day care centers chosen randomly. Three&#xD;
      caregivers from each center (total 30 caregivers) will participate in activities related to&#xD;
      the WV-IYCFP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers in both groups will be asked to take a knowledge assessment questionnaire on child&#xD;
      development before and after each training, then at 6months and 12 months after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, caregivers' behavior in early child stimulation will be assessed before and&#xD;
      after the trainings. Caregivers will be observed delivering child care as per each center's&#xD;
      routine; their behavior will be assessed using a predetermined behavioral check list&#xD;
      developed based on the CCD program.&#xD;
