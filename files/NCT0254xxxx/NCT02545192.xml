  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to make the first observations of LFMS treating a population of&#xD;
      subjects with PTSD. A positive outcome for this study could translate directly into a new&#xD;
      treatment modality for symptoms of PTSD in both acute and chronic situations. The&#xD;
      investigator's goal is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of LFMS as a possible aid in&#xD;
      the treatment of PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Low Field Magnetic Stimulation (LFMS) procedure is an application of a series of&#xD;
      electromagnetic pulses to the brain lasting twenty minutes. The field and timing parameters&#xD;
      of the LFMS pulses, such as pulse timing, duration, frequency, and electric and magnetic&#xD;
      field distribution and direction are different from other neurostimulation methods. LFMS&#xD;
      electromagnetic fields are significantly weaker than those occurring in electroconvulsive&#xD;
      therapy (ECT) and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LFMS was discovered at McLean Hospital and has been studied as an experimental antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment at McLean. Results from the investigator's single-visit protocol (2006-P-001655)&#xD;
      are encouraging, and demonstrate an immediate mood improvement from LFMS in depressed&#xD;
      subjects. This indicates that LFMS continues to show potential as a treatment for depression.&#xD;
      The profile of clinical response to LFMS that was observed in that study included improvement&#xD;
      in symptoms of anxiety. In this current proposal the investigator's will study the effects of&#xD;
      LFMS on these symptoms of depression and anxiety that are present in a population with a&#xD;
      primary diagnosis of PTSD. The proposed protocol involves three treatments on consecutive&#xD;
      days with follow-up ratings one week after the first treatment and follow-up by phone ratings&#xD;
      in weeks three and four after the first treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The LFMS Device is an electromagnetic coil situated on a cylinder with an inside diameter of 13.2 inches. It produces weak electromagnetic fields at a frequency of about 1000Hz; the magnetic fields are less than 30 Gauss and the electric fields are up to 1.43 V/m. A fully detailed description of the electromagnetic field distribution and waveform has been presented in the IDE submission to the FDA (and determined to be a non-significant risk device).</description>
