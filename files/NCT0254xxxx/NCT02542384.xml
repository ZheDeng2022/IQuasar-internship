  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study schedule is comprised of a 14-day Screening Period, a treatment period and an&#xD;
      observation period. All eligible subjects will be randomized into one of 3 treatment groups&#xD;
      (1 of 2 dose levels or matched placebo). Study drug CR845 will be administered intravenously&#xD;
      prior to surgery, and at specific time intervals post surgery. Additional rescue pain and&#xD;
      anti-nausea medication will be made available. Post surgical changes in pain intensity,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting will be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be admitted to the surgical center on the day of their abdominal surgery (Day&#xD;
      1, unless admission the night before is required). All patients will be seen by the study&#xD;
      staff to confirm eligibility, review study procedures, and conduct all pre-surgical&#xD;
      assessments required for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified patients will be randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups, corresponding to 1 of 2&#xD;
      dose levels of intravenous (IV) CR845 (0.5 or 1 mcg/kg) or matched placebo, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug will be administered every 6 hours during the 24-hour post-operative treatment&#xD;
      period following these initial 2 drug administrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-Operative dose: Within one hour prior to anesthetic induction for surgery. This dose&#xD;
           will be a 2X loading dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline post-operative dose: within 30-minutes of being considered stable in the&#xD;
           Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent dosing will be administered at 6, 12 and 18 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Treatment and Observation Period, pain intensity scores will be obtained at&#xD;
      specified time points and episodes of nausea or vomiting will be recorded. Upon request,&#xD;
      patients may be provided with analgesic or anti-nausea rescue medication (restricted to&#xD;
      morphine (if tolerated), and ondansetron, respectively) at any time after the Baseline dose&#xD;
      of study drug is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling and safety assessments will be conducted during this period as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will remain in the hospital until Day 3 (48-hours after surgery) at which point they&#xD;
      will be evaluated for discharge. A follow-up medical evaluation will be scheduled within 7 -&#xD;
      10 days post-surgery.&#xD;
