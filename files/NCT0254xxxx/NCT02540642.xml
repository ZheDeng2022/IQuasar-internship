    <textblock>
      Increased plasma homocysteine level is associated with macroangiopathy and nephropathy in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. Also increased levels of serum homocysteine are associated with&#xD;
      microalbuminuria which is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      among the patients with type 2 diabetes. With B12 supplementation homocysteine level can be&#xD;
      reduced .Type 2 diabetes as a metabolic syndrome may show improvement in glycaemic control&#xD;
      with Vitamin B12 therapy as there is correction of hyperhomocysteinemia. In studies it is&#xD;
      proved that combination of vit B12, folic acid and vit B6 are effective for&#xD;
      hyperhomocysteinemia.There are no such separate trials on the use of vit B12 alone. This&#xD;
      therapy may be used in large number of type 2 uncontrolled diabetic hyperhomocysteinemic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      this study was planned with following objectives to study effect of Vitamin B12&#xD;
      supplementation on glycaemic control in poorly controlled hyperhomocysteinemic type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Glycaemic control measured by levels of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and&#xD;
           4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fasting blood sugar level at baseline and 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serum homocysteine/ vitamin B12 levels at baseline and 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Serum lipid profile at baseline and 4 weeks&#xD;

      After approval from Institutional Ethics Committee, patients not responding adequately to&#xD;
      oral anti-diabetic agents were recruited from Medicine out patient department (OPD) with the&#xD;
      help of treating physician. Patient were first screened for serum homocysteine/vitamin B12&#xD;
      level along with all baseline investigations. Those having serum homocysteine level more than&#xD;
      15 umol/L or vitamin B12 level less than 223pg/ml were enrolled in this study. Due to high&#xD;
      cost for investigation serum homocysteine level was measured only in 6 patients and serum&#xD;
      vitamin B12 level (cheaper test) was measured in 14 patients with prior permission from&#xD;
      Ethics Committee. Patients were given all the information about Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin)&#xD;
      including adverse effects. A written informed consent was taken from each patient and those&#xD;
      who were willing to participate in study were enrolled in this study. All the information was&#xD;
      recorded in case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were two groups of poorly controlled patient; one group (DRUG GROUP) received&#xD;
      methylcobalamin 500 ug daily with their usual antidiabetic therapy and the other group&#xD;
      (CONTROL GROUP) received suitable antidiabetic drug therapy as prescribed by treating&#xD;
      physician. Methylcobalamin 500ug was given once daily for the period of 4 weeks and were&#xD;
      followed-up at 4 weeks. At Baseline all the investigations were carried out as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Flow Chart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Serum Homocysteine.n=6 (DRUG GROUP), Serum Vitamin B12, n=14 (DRUG GROUP), n=18&#xD;
      (CONTROL GROUP) Body weight, height, Blood pressure,glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level,&#xD;
      Blood sugar-Fasting/Postprandial, Serum lipid profile( to measure the effect of Vitamin B12),&#xD;
      Blood urea, Serum creatinine, Serum Bilirubin, Serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase&#xD;
      (SGOT),Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), Alkaline phosphatase ( to rule out&#xD;
      hepatic or renal dysfunction ), Routine urine examination for albumin, Electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG):to rule out cardiac abnormality viz, IHD, arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Weeks Body weight, Blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA1c) level, Blood&#xD;
      sugar-Fasting/Postprandial, Serum lipid profile, Serum homocysteine/ serum vitamin B12, Urine&#xD;
      albumin examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment of patient for study, All the baseline investigations will be carried out at&#xD;
      Central Clinical Laboratory except glycosylated haemoglobin which was carried out at&#xD;
      department of Pharmacology and homocysteine estimation which was carried out in an accredited&#xD;
      laboratory. ECG, Blood pressure recording was carried out in Department of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Adverse effects: All patients had been given checklist of adverse effect of&#xD;
      vitamin B12. Information of adverse drug reactions (ADRs ) was taken in next follow-up. If&#xD;
      patients are unable tolerate adverse drug reactions they were advised to contact any of&#xD;
      investigators at any time. Contact numbers of investigators was mentioned on patient&#xD;
      information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected adverse drug reactions of vitamin B12 : Anorexia, Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea and&#xD;
      Rash&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size of 20 for each group was calculated in the ratio of 1, power 80 %, considering 10&#xD;
      fold difference of drug effect in vitamin B12 group and control group by using Open Epi&#xD;
      2.3(2009). Randomization was done with the help of randomization software Rando 1.2,2004.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was done by using Open Epi 2.3(2009) and Microsoft Excel.&#xD;
