  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients that require treatment for cancers of the head and neck often require a combination&#xD;
      of surgery and/or radiation and chemotherapy. Hypothyroidism is one of the most common&#xD;
      complications, and has been associated with post-operative complications such as wound&#xD;
      healing problems, fistula formation, and decreased quality of life and survival. Several&#xD;
      studies have examined hypothyroidism after radiation to the head and neck, but few have&#xD;
      examined this after non-thyroid head and neck surgery. Head and neck resection is theorized&#xD;
      to devascularize the thyroid, thus resulting in post-operative hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synthroid is a synthetic thyroid hormone often used in cases of patients with proven&#xD;
      hypothyroidism and after surgical thyroid removal. It's use has been in effect and studied&#xD;
      for over fifty years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment algorithms for hypothyroidism are well published. However, treatment of subclinical&#xD;
      hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with normal or near-normal T3/T4) is controversial. The rate of&#xD;
      subclinical hypothyroidism after non-thyroid head and neck surgery is high (up to 20%), and&#xD;
      is associated with post-operative complications as noted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators propose a double blinded randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      outcomes of patients that develop subclinical hypothyroidism after head and neck surgery, who&#xD;
      are given a standardized dose of synthroid treatment versus those treated with placebo. The&#xD;
      main outcomes to be examined are post-operative complications (wound healing issues, fistula&#xD;
      formation), survival, and quality of life measures.&#xD;

      Background and Scope:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothyroidism is one of the most common complications following multimodality treatment for&#xD;
      head and neck cancer, with an incidence of 7-58% depending on the subsite. The causes for&#xD;
      this high rate of hypothyroidism following treatment for head and neck cancer are&#xD;
      multifactorial. Patients treated for head and neck cancer often require radiation therapy&#xD;
      (RT). The negative effects of RT on the thyroid are well published, and the resultant&#xD;
      hypothyroidism can have widespread implications on a patient's physical and mental health.&#xD;
      Head and neck surgery has also been hypothesized to devascularize and disturb the overall&#xD;
      anatomical structure of the thyroid, thus contributing to the high incidence of&#xD;
      hypothyroidism after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the literature demonstrating the connection between head and neck cancer treatment&#xD;
      and hypothyroidism, complications from this illness after major head and neck surgery remain&#xD;
      common. Decreased survival as well as increased rates of fistulas, infections, and wound&#xD;
      breakdown are some of the physical consequences. Other possible issues include decreased&#xD;
      functional outcomes and increased mental illness, as these are known consequences of&#xD;
      untreated hypothyroidism. While several studies have examined the rate and timing of&#xD;
      hypothyroidism after radiation to the head and neck, there is a paucity of literature on the&#xD;
      effect of surgery on thyroid function. Specifically, in patients treated with single modality&#xD;
      surgery, and in patients treated with primary surgery before the start of RT, when the risk&#xD;
      of wound complications is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synthroid is a synthetic thyroid hormone, and is the mainstay of treatment of patients with&#xD;
      proven hypothyroidism and after surgical thyroid removal. Its use has been in effect and&#xD;
      studied for over fifty years. Side effects of the drug most commonly occur with overdosing&#xD;
      and will mimic those of hyperthyroidism, which may include: heart palpitations, abdominal&#xD;
      pain, nausea, anxiety, confusion, agitation, insomnia, weight loss, and increased appetite.&#xD;
      There is a low chance (&lt; 1%) of allergic reaction to the drug, which may include shortness of&#xD;
      breath, swelling of the face and tongue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas treatment algorithms for clinical hypothyroidism are well established, treatment of&#xD;
      subclinical hypothyroidism remains controversial. Subclinical hypothyroidism refers to a&#xD;
      state of elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), with normal or near-normal thyroid&#xD;
      hormone levels (T3 and T4), or a lack of symptoms of hypothyroidism. Endocrinologists&#xD;
      disagree on whether this disease should be treated, since it is almost always asymptomatic,&#xD;
      and the treatment is mainly for relief of symptoms. Head and neck cancer patients, however,&#xD;
      represent a special population, in which the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism can result&#xD;
      in consequences besides symptoms, such as wound healing issues and fistula development as&#xD;
      described above. Studies have shown that the rate of subclinical hypothyroidism during head&#xD;
      and neck cancer treatment is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators propose a single blinded randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, who are given a standardized dose of&#xD;
      synthroid treatment after head and neck surgery versus those treated with conventional&#xD;
      therapy. A secondary goal of this study is to determine the rate of clinical and subclinical&#xD;
      hypothyroidism after surgical treatment for head and neck cancer, without RT or before the&#xD;
      start of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect synthroid treatment in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism&#xD;
           following head and neck surgery and it's effects on survival, gastrostomy tube (G-tube)&#xD;
           rates, fistula formation, wound breakdown, and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism after surgery for head&#xD;
           and neck cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the factors that are predictive of the development of clinical and&#xD;
           subclinical hypothyroidism after surgery for head and neck cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center double blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial of the effects of&#xD;
      synthroid treatment immediately after surgery for head and neck cancer. Patient meeting&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be identified at the time of booking for surgery and approached by&#xD;
      a member of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from the medical records on the variables under study in&#xD;
      study-specific data sheets. Data sheets will then be de-identified and input into a secure&#xD;
      database that will be password protected hard drive in a room that is locked. Data will then&#xD;
      be exported for statistical analysis when collection is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will be comprised of patients who underwent surgery with or without a&#xD;
      combination of RT and/or chemotherapy for the treatment of non-thyroid head and neck cancer.&#xD;
      Surgery is defined as surgical resection with primary closure or reconstruction with&#xD;
      loco-regional flaps or autogenous free tissue transfer. RT is defined as curative dose&#xD;
      therapy. Chemotherapy is defined as any single agent therapy or combination of cisplatin or&#xD;
      carboplatin. Patients will be prospectively enrolled starting from March 1, 2015 until March&#xD;
      1, 2016. The expected accrual of this patient group will be 200 patients. The demographics of&#xD;
      head and neck mucosal cancers indicate that the male : female ratio will be 3 : 1 and the&#xD;
      mean age will be approximately 60 years with a range of 18 - 85 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess pre- and post-operative thyroid function, each patient will undergo blood&#xD;
      testing including TSH, free T3, and free T4 levels one week prior to surgery, and weekly&#xD;
      following surgery, up to 8 weeks post-operatively (if not receiving radiation), or until 8&#xD;
      weeks after the start of radiation (if receiving radiation therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be classified into &quot;normal&quot; (normal TSH and normal free T3 and free T4 levels),&#xD;
      &quot;hypothyroid&quot; (elevated TSH, decreased free T3 and free T4), or &quot;subclinical hypothyroid&quot;&#xD;
      (elevated TSH (4-10mIU/L), normal free T3 and free T4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with &quot;normal&quot; thyroid function will not be randomized to any treatment arm, but&#xD;
      their post-operative outcomes will be recorded, according to section 8.0. Patients who are&#xD;
      &quot;hypothyroid&quot; will be treated for their hypothyroidism according to the standard of care, in&#xD;
      keeping with American Thyroid Association (ATA) / American Association of Clinical&#xD;
      Endocrinologists (AACE) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with &quot;subclinical hypothyroidism&quot; will be randomized to either the treatment arm or&#xD;
      placebo arm, at the time of discovery of subclinical hypothyroidism (lab value abnormalities&#xD;
      as noted above). Patients who are randomized to the treatment arm will be treated with a&#xD;
      standard dose of 1.6mcg/kg/day of synthroid, and the target of treatment will be a normalized&#xD;
      TSH (0.2-4.0mIU/L), measured at 6 weeks after treatment, according to ATA/AACE guidelines.&#xD;
