  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to confirm clinical safety and feasibility of combining the&#xD;
      antigen-loaded Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccine with chemotherapy including folinic acid,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin, irinotecan and 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) (FOLFIRINOX) and nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine&#xD;
      in patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this trial are to determine preliminary clinical efficacy based&#xD;
      on response rates, overall survival and progression free survival compared with historic&#xD;
      control, and surgical conversion rate as defined as percent of locally advanced&#xD;
      (unresectable) patients achieving resectability within 6 months of treatment initiation.&#xD;
      Also, to identify vaccine immunogenicity by measuring acquired, T cell-mediated immune&#xD;
      activating events post-vaccination and to correlate clinical response with acquired immune&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;

      This is a single center, exploratory pilot safety, open label, phase I trial that will&#xD;
      evaluate the combination of DC vaccination in 2 groups of patients when combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy including FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. The investigations will accrue 20 evaluable subjects over 20 months with 10 patients&#xD;
      in each group. Subjects will be assigned to group 1 or group 2 according to the subject's&#xD;
      disease stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be conducted in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st 3 patients will be enrolled to either group to receive DC vaccinations combined with&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy. A safety analysis will be performed after the first 3 patients have&#xD;
      completed 6 vaccines. If no vaccine dose-limiting toxicity occurs in any of the 3 patients&#xD;
      then the study will proceed with stage 2. Stage 2 will include the enrollment of the&#xD;
      remaining 17 patients.&#xD;
