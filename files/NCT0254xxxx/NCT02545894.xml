  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with global aphasia (PwGA) post stroke have little to no meaningful communication&#xD;
      abilities (ie limited comprehension, spoken language, reading and writing abilities).A&#xD;
      proportion of PwGA will also have limited abilities to use any alternative means of&#xD;
      communication e.g. gesture, pictures or computer devices. There is a suggestion in the&#xD;
      literature that this is because of co-occurring cognitive deficits. The consequence is that&#xD;
      these clients are unable to reliably communicate even their basic needs.This is commonly&#xD;
      known as having no functional communication abilities. Such PwGA tend not to respond to&#xD;
      standard speech and language therapy interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will investigate the effect of a new cognitive intervention designed to improve&#xD;
      basic functional communication abilities. The treatment will be nonverbal and involve&#xD;
      computer and paperbased tasks ordered hierarchically from basic to more complex tasks. Six to&#xD;
      eight participants will take part. All their sessions will take place in their own home. For&#xD;
      some this may be a care home. They will first complete a diagnostic communication assessment&#xD;
      in order for baseline abilities to be established. Further formal language and cognitive&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted over a period of 6 weeks. A relative/friend will complete a&#xD;
      questionnaires about mood/communication. The PwGA will also be videoed interacting with the&#xD;
      research student e.g. looking at a magazine, completing a jigsaw, answering questions and&#xD;
      making choices non-verbally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants then receive the new intervention 3 times a week for 6 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
      All intervention sessions will be videoed. Then participants will be reassessed over 2 weeks&#xD;
      using the same assessments as prior to the intervention. The questionnaire with their&#xD;
      relative/friend and videoed activity session will also be repeated. After a twelve week break&#xD;
      the participant will be videoed interacting with the research student complete some of the&#xD;
      assessments again and their relative will re-complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
