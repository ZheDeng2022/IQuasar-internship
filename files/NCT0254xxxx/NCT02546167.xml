  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, single-center, pilot study to assess the safety and feasibility of infusion of&#xD;
      autologous T cells expressing BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen)-specific chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptors with tandem TCR and 4-1BB costimulatory domains (referred to as CART-BCMA ) in&#xD;
      adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM). CART-BCMA cells will be given as a split dose&#xD;
      intravenous infusion over 3 days. The duration of active intervention and monitoring is&#xD;
      approximately 2 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      At entry subjects will undergo routine laboratory and imaging assessment of their multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. Eligible subjects will undergo steady-state apheresis to obtain large numbers of&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CART-BCMA manufacturing. Cryopreserved&#xD;
      historical apheresis products collected from the patient prior to study entry are usable for&#xD;
      CART-BCMA manufacturing if collected at an appropriately certified apheresis center and the&#xD;
      product meets adequate mononuclear cell yields. If a historical apheresis product is not&#xD;
      available, an apheresis procedure will be scheduled for cell procurement after study entry.&#xD;
      The T cells will be purified from the PBMC, transduced with TCRζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector,&#xD;
      expanded in vitro and then frozen for future administration. The number of subjects who have&#xD;
      inadequate T cell collections, expansion or manufacturing compared to the number of subjects&#xD;
      who have CAR T cells successfully manufactured will be recorded; feasibility of product&#xD;
      manufacturing is not expected to be problematic in this patient population.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have a confirmed prior diagnosis of active MM as defined by the updated&#xD;
             IMWG criteria101..&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have relapsed or refractory disease after either one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. At least 3 prior regimens, which must have contained an alkylating agent,&#xD;
                  proteasome inhibitor, and immunomodulatory agent (IMiD).&#xD;

                  IMiD, defined as progression on or within 60 days of treatment with these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Induction therapy, stem cell transplant, and maintenance therapy, if given&#xD;
             sequentially without intervening progression, should be considered as 1 &quot;regimen&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have signed written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be at least 90 days since autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant,&#xD;
             if performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have adequate vital organ function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 or estimated creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min and not&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/μl and platelet count ≥50,000/μl (≥30,000/μl if&#xD;
                  bone marrow plasma cells are ≥50% of cellularity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. SGOT ≤ 3x the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl (except for&#xD;
                  patients in whom hyperbilirubinemia is attributed to Gilbert's syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45%. LVEF assessment must have been&#xD;
                  performed within 8 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Toxicities from prior therapies, with the exception of peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
                  attributable to bortezomib, must have recovered to grade ≤ 2 according to the CTC&#xD;
                  4.0 criteria or to the subject's prior baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects must have measurable disease on study entry, which must include at least 1 of&#xD;
             the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Serum M-spike ≥ 0.5 g/dL*&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Measurable plasmacytoma on exam or imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 20% (bone marrow biopsy only required at screening if&#xD;
                  no other measurable disease is present).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: Patients with IgA myeloma in whom serum protein electrophoresis is&#xD;
                       deemed unreliable, due to co-migration of normal serum proteins with the&#xD;
                       paraprotein in the beta region, may be considered eligible as long as total&#xD;
                       serum IgA level is elevated above normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable birth control methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        IMWG Criteria for Diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma Presence of an M-component in serum and/or&#xD;
        urine plus clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or a documented clonal plasmacytoma.&#xD;
        In patients with no detectable M-component, an abnormal serum FLC ratio on the serum FLC&#xD;
        assay can substitute and satisfy this criterion. For patients, with no serum or urine&#xD;
        M-component and normal serum FLC ratio, the baseline bone marrow must have ≥10% clonal&#xD;
        plasma cells; these patients are referred to as having 'non-secretory myeloma'. Patients&#xD;
        with biopsy-proven amyloidosis and/or systemic light chain deposition disease (LCDD) should&#xD;
        be classified as 'myeloma with documented amyloidosis' or 'myeloma with documented LCDD,'&#xD;
        respectively if they have ≥30% plasma cells and/or myeloma-related bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PLUS one or more of the following, which must be attributable to the underlying plasma cell&#xD;
        disorder:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Calcium elevation (&gt;11.5 mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;2 mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dl or at 2 g/dl below normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone disease (lytic lesions or osteopenia) OR one of the following &quot;myeloma-defining&#xD;
             events&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow plasma cells ≥60% of cellularity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum free kappa:lambda ratio ≥100:1 (or ≤1:100), with involved free light chain ≥100&#xD;
             mg/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 1 focal bone lesion on MRI&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have inadequate venous access for or contraindications to leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any active and uncontrolled infection.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have received prior gene therapy or gene-modified cellular immunotherapy. Subject may&#xD;
             have received, however, non-gene-modified autologous T-cells in association with an&#xD;
             anti-myeloma vaccine (e.g., hTERT or MAGEA3) or vaccination against infectious agents&#xD;
             (e.g., influenza or pneumococcus) as was performed on our previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have active auto-immune disease, including connective tissue disease, uveitis,&#xD;
             sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or multiple sclerosis, or have a history of&#xD;
             severe (as judged by the principal investigator) autoimmune disease requiring&#xD;

          -  Have a history of neurodegenerative or central nervous system movement disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have prior or active central nervous system (CNS) involvement (e.g. leptomeningeal&#xD;
             disease, parenchymal masses) with myeloma. Screening for this (e.g. with lumbar&#xD;
             puncture) is not required unless suspicious symptoms or radiographic findings are&#xD;
             present. Subjects with calvarial disease that extends intracranially and involves the&#xD;
             dura will be excluded, even if CSF is negative for myeloma.&#xD;

             immunosuppressant medications for GVHD, within 4 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
