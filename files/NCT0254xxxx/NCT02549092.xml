    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effect of LCIG relative to that of OMT&#xD;
      on NMS associated with PD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 3 sequential parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Screening period. The screening period will consist of 3 visits, Visit 1 (V1), Visit&#xD;
      2 ([V2] [optional]) and the Randomization Visit (V3) in which the participant will be&#xD;
      assessed to determine eligibility. The duration of the Screening Period can be between 30 to&#xD;
      67 days to accommodate the required procedures, training and collection of diaries, and to&#xD;
      allow for stabilization of anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS. All anti-PD&#xD;
      medications and medications to treat NMS are required to be stable for a minimum of 30 days&#xD;
      prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Treatment period. Those participants randomized to OMT at the end of V3 will remain&#xD;
      on their current optimized regimen. The day after randomization will be considered Day 1 of&#xD;
      their treatment period and participants will have study visits at the end of Weeks 2, 6, 12,&#xD;
      and 26. All participants randomized to the LCIG group should have all anti-PD medications,&#xD;
      with the exception of levodopa formulations, tapered off within 14 days after randomization.&#xD;
      Optional nasojujunal (NJ) and/or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal tube&#xD;
      (PEG-J) placement will then occur. After that, the participant may begin initiation and&#xD;
      titration of LCIG infusion to be adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response. The day of&#xD;
      initial NJ or PEG-J placement will be considered Day 1 for participants in the LCIG group.&#xD;
      Study visits happen at the end of Weeks 2, 6, 12, and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: Extension/Transition Period. Eligible participants who complete the 26 week study may&#xD;
      continue into the Extension Period of the study. Participants in the LCIG arm will have study&#xD;
      drug dispensation every 4 weeks and will have study visits every 6 months. Participants from&#xD;
      the OMT arm will undergo the NJ (optional) and PEG-J procedures, titration, plus have visits&#xD;
      at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post NJ or PEG-J. Participants will then continue&#xD;
      to receive study drug every 4 weeks and will have study visits every 6 months until Duodopa&#xD;
      is commercially available. Transition to a Post-Trial Access protocol will be possible if&#xD;
      Duodopa does not become commercially available in a location.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 26 in the NMSS Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The NMSS consists of 30 questions in 9 domains (cardiovascular/falls, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, GI tract, urinary, sexual function, miscellaneous). Score of each question is calculated by multiplying severity*frequency. Severity and frequency are rated using a scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) for severity and from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent) for frequency. Total score is the sum of 9 domains, and ranges from 0 to 360, with a lower value indicating a more desirable outcome. Repeated-measure analysis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant(s) must have a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease according to&#xD;
             the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society (UKPDS) Brain Bank Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant(s) demonstrates persistent motor fluctuations in spite of individually&#xD;
             optimized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The participant's Parkinson's disease is levodopa-responsive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant(s) has had optimized treatment with available anti-PD medication and their&#xD;
             motor symptoms are judged inadequately controlled on this optimized treatment.&#xD;
             Optimized treatment is defined as the maximum therapeutic effect obtained with&#xD;
             pharmacological antiparkinsonian therapies when no further improvement is expected&#xD;
             regardless of any additional manipulations of levodopa and/or other antiparkinsonian&#xD;
             medication. This will be based on the Investigator's clinical judgment.&#xD;

             infectious agents, vascular disease, trauma, brain neoplasm), parkinson-plus syndrome&#xD;
             (e.g. Multiple System Atrophy, Progressive supranuclear Palsy, Diffuse Lewy Body&#xD;
             disease) or other neurodegenerative disease that might mimic the symptoms of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant(s) has undergone neurosurgery for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known hypersensitivity to levodopa, carbidopa or radiopaque material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant(s) has contraindications to levodopa (e.g. narrow angle glaucoma,&#xD;
             malignant melanoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant(s) experiencing clinically significant sleep attacks or clinically&#xD;
             significant impulsive behavior (e.g. pathological gambling, hypersexuality) at any&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 32 sites in 9 countries.&#xD;
Data presented are based on a database lock of June 12, 2020.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After a 30- to 67-day Screening Period for required procedures, training, and medication stabilization, eligible participants were randomized to Optimized Medical Treatment (OMT) or Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG) for a 26-week Treatment Period. Before Treatment Period Day 1, LCIG participants had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal extension (PEG-J; with an initial, optional, temporary nasojejunal [NJ] tube placement to titrate the dose of LCIG prior to the PEG-J).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants randomized to LCIG at an individually optimized dose, in accordance with the LCIG approved product label for countries participating in the study during the 26-week treatment phase. Changes to anti-PD and NMS medications were to remain stable and were only made if medically indicated.&#xD;
The total daily dose of LCIG was composed of 3 components: (i) the morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses. The continuous infusion was expected to run over a period of 16 consecutive hours each day.&#xD;
Participants in the United States or South Korea may have elected to enter an Extension/Transition follow-up period to receive an individually optimized LCIG dose, in order to transition to commercially available LCIG.</description>

          <description>Participants randomized to LCIG at an individually optimized dose, in accordance with the LCIG approved product label for countries participating in the study during the 26-week treatment phase. Changes to anti-PD and NMS medications were to remain stable and were only made if medically indicated.&#xD;
The total daily dose of LCIG was composed of 3 components: (i) the morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses. The continuous infusion was expected to run over a period of 16 consecutive hours each day.&#xD;
Participants in the United States or South Korea may have elected to enter an Extension/Transition follow-up period to receive an individually optimized LCIG dose, in order to transition to commercially available LCIG.</description>

Score of each question is calculated by multiplying severity*frequency. Severity and frequency are rated using a scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) for severity and from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent) for frequency.

          <description>The PDSS-2 addresses PD-specific sleep disturbances such as restless leg syndrome (RLS), morning akinesia, pain, and sleep apnea. The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 0 [never] to 4 [very often]). Scores are calculated for each of the 3 domains (motor symptoms at night, PD symptoms at night, and disturbed sleep) as well as a total score. The PDSS-2 domain scores range from 0 to 20 and the total score is a sum of the 3 domains and ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

        <description>The PDSS-2 addresses PD-specific sleep disturbances such as restless leg syndrome (RLS), morning akinesia, pain, and sleep apnea. The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 0 [never] to 4 [very often]). Scores are calculated for each of the 3 domains (motor symptoms at night, PD symptoms at night, and disturbed sleep) as well as a total score. The PDSS-2 domain scores range from 0 to 20 and the total score is a sum of the 3 domains and ranges from 0 to 60. Repeated measure analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 26 in the NMSS Domain Scores</title>
        <description>The NMSS consists of 30 questions in 9 domains. Score of each question is calculated by multiplying severity*frequency. Severity and frequency are rated using a scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) for severity and from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent) for frequency. Cardiovascular/falls scores range from 0 - 24 with lower value desirable. Sleep/fatigue scores range from 0 - 48 with lower value desirable. Mood/cognition scores range from 0 - 72 with lower value desirable. Perceptual problems/hallucinations scores range from 0 - 36 with lower value desirable. Attention/memory scores range from 0 - 36 with lower value desirable. Gastrointestinal tract scores range from 0 - 36 with lower value desirable. Urinary scores range from 0 - 36 with lower value desirable. Sexual function scores range from 0 - 24 with lower value desirable. Miscellaneous scores range from 0 - 48 with lower value desirable.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 26 in the Modified PDSS-2 Domain Scores</title>
        <description>The PDSS-2 addresses PD-specific sleep disturbances such as restless leg syndrome (RLS), morning akinesia, pain, and sleep apnea. The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 0 [never] to 4 [very often]). Scores are calculated for each of the 3 domains (motor symptoms at night, PD symptoms at night, and disturbed sleep) as well as a total score. The PDSS-2 domain scores range from 0 to 20 and the total score is a sum of the 3 domains and ranges from 0 to 60. Repeated measure analysis.</description>
