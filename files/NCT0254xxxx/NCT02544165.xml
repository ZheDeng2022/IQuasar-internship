      The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in accumulation of AGEs (advanced&#xD;
      glycation end-products) in the tissues of individuals who smoke in comparison with&#xD;
      individuals who do not as well as of individuals who consume caffeine versus those who do&#xD;
      not, and finally to examine the probable differences concerning participants' haemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

      Materials and methods Study population The study population consisted of students of Health&#xD;
      Care Professions who accepted to participate in the study and gave their informed consent for&#xD;
      their participation. The population study included healthy volunteers without cardiovascular&#xD;
      problems, other chronic or systemic diseases. Participants were divided into 3 intervention&#xD;
      groups: the first group are non-smokers who consume caffeine on daily basis, the second group&#xD;
      are smokers who do not consume caffeine on daily basis, and the third group are smokers who&#xD;
      consume caffeine on daily basis. Additionally, there was a control group consisting of non&#xD;
      smoking students and no caffeine users on daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology A complete medical history with information about the health status of the&#xD;
      subjects, drug use and the main risk factors for cardiovascular conditions was recorded.&#xD;
      Details concerning smoking and drinking habits, caffeine intake and other medical conditions&#xD;
      and conditions from the individual and family history were retrieved, by filling-in&#xD;
      self-reporting questionnaires. Information about dietary habits and physical activity of the&#xD;
      subjects was also recorded. Body weight and height of all participants were measured. Also,&#xD;
      participants were informed that on the day of the scheduled measurements, they should not&#xD;
      have breakfast nor smoke for 2 hours (for smokers) prior to measurements and finally abstain&#xD;
      from any physical activity. Inclusion criteria in the group of smokers were cigarette smoking&#xD;
      of more than 10 cigarettes/day for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin- autofluorescence measurement Tissue AGEs accumulation was assessed using a validated&#xD;
      skin-autofluorescence (skin-AF) device, namely AGE Reader. In short, the AGE reader&#xD;
      illuminates a skin surface of approximately 4 cm2, guarded against surrounding light, with an&#xD;
      excitation light source between 300 and 420 nm (peak excitation ~370 nm). Skin-AF was&#xD;
      measured at the volar side of the lower arm at approximately 10-15 cm below the elbow fold.&#xD;
      Care had been taken to perform the measurement at normal skin site (without visible vessels,&#xD;
      scars, lichenification, or other skin abnormalities). The investigators performed three&#xD;
      measurements with a 5min interval between them and the investigators calculated the mean&#xD;
      value of three measurements. For the individuals who smoked, these measurements were repeated&#xD;
      2 hours after the smoking of one cigarette and for individuals who consumed caffeine,&#xD;
      measurements were repeated after the intake of 100 mg caffeine (delivered as a beverage).&#xD;
      This was done to check whether there was a change in accumulation of AGEs following cigarette&#xD;
      smoking and caffeine intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemodynamic parameters' measurement The haemodynamic parameters' measurement included&#xD;
      measurement of cardiac output, stroke volume, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean&#xD;
      pressure, pulse rate, interbeat intervals, arterial compliance and systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance. These measurements were performed with the Finometer device (FMS, Finapress&#xD;
      Medical System, BV, Netherlands), while the data were recorded by using the Beatscope, a&#xD;
      specially designed software, to transfer data to the PC and to process pressure waveform&#xD;
      files. The measurements were performed by using a non-invasive method via a finger cuff,&#xD;
      which was wrapped around the finger of the individual, who was in a lying down position for&#xD;
      10 min before the measurements in a room of a sound-attenuated, temperature-controlled&#xD;
      environment, in order to ensure that all measurements will be performed under constant and&#xD;
      stable conditions. Subsequently, the haemodynamic parameters' measurement was performed for&#xD;
      15 min in a sitting position. Additionally, for smokers the measurements were repeated after&#xD;
      15-30 min since smoking one cigarette and after 45 min for individuals who consumed caffeine.&#xD;
