      The aim of the present study were 1) to determine the role of these adipokines in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of periodontal disease, inflammation and tissue destruction comparing with&#xD;
      gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of TNF-α, which has a known pro-inflammatory effect in&#xD;
      periodontal disease, 2) to investigate the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on&#xD;
      GCF vaspin and omentin levels in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients with Chronic Periodontitis&#xD;
      (CP).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue produces and releases a variety of inflammatory factors, including&#xD;
      adipocytokines , such as adiponectin, leptin, tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α),&#xD;
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), visfatin, vaspin and omentin.These adipokines have widespread effects&#xD;
      on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of insulin resistance, diabetes, inflammation, wound healing, and immune responses.Recently,&#xD;
      studies evaluated the serum vaspin and omentin levels as inflammatory markers in T2DM&#xD;
      patients. Based on the above mentioned studies, the present investigation has been devoted to&#xD;
      elucidate the role of adipokines in the pathogenesis that might link DM and periodontal&#xD;
      disease. We hypothesize that vaspin and omentin are inflammatory adipokines involved in&#xD;
      chronic inflammation and are associated with T2DM and CP. Additionally, the evaluation of GCF&#xD;
      vaspin and omentin levels can provide advance the biologic link between DM and periodontitis.&#xD;
      Until now, levels of GCF vaspin and omentin in CP patients with T2DM before and after&#xD;
      non-surgical periodontal treatment has not been explored. Hence, the aim of the present study&#xD;
      were 1) to determine the role of these adipokines in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease,&#xD;
      inflammation and tissue destruction comparing with GCF levels of TNF-α, which has a known&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory effect in periodontal disease 2) to investigate the effect of non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal treatment on GCF vaspin and omentin levels in T2DM patients with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 15 T2DM patients with CP ( DM-CP group), 15 CP patients (CP group), 15 T2DM&#xD;
      patients (DM-CTRL group) and 15 subjects with systemically and periodontally healthy control&#xD;
      subjects (CTRL group) were included in the study. Diabetic subjects should have T2DM and had&#xD;
      no any known systemic diseases other than T2DM. The glycemic status of patients previously&#xD;
      diagnosed with T2DM was confirmed by their glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Periodontal&#xD;
      disease status was determined according to clinical and radiographic criteria by the 1999&#xD;
      classification of periodontal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were clinically evaluated using the following parameters; plaque index (PI),&#xD;
      gingival index (GI) , PD, clinical attachment level (CAL) and BOP (deemed positive if it&#xD;
      occurred within 15 seconds after probing). Clinical measurements were recorded by one&#xD;
      calibrated examiner at six sites per tooth from the full-mouth teeth excluding third molars&#xD;
      using with a Williams periodontal probe (Nordent Manufacturing Inc., ElkGrove Village, IL,&#xD;
      USA) calibrated in millimeters. Anthropometric measurements included weight (kg) and height&#xD;
      (m) of the subjects to calculate the BMI ( weight divided by the square of height, kg/m2 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical and radiological examinations, sampling site selections were performed by one&#xD;
      examiner and the samples were collected on the day after clinical examination of patients.&#xD;
      This was to prevent contamination of GCF with blood associated with the probing of inflamed&#xD;
      sites. The deepest two pocket sites of single-rooted teeth were selected for the collection&#xD;
      of GCF in both periodontitis groups, and also two pocket sites with an absence of&#xD;
      inflammation were sampled to ensure the collection of an adequate amount of GCF in control&#xD;
      groups. In patients from CP and DM-CP groups, sites showing greatest PD when measured with a&#xD;
      periodontal probes and signs of inflammation, along with radiographic conformation of bone&#xD;
      loss were sampled. GCF samples were collected at baseline and after 8 weeks from baseline&#xD;
      sampling in both periodontitis groups, and only at baseline in control groups. To avoid&#xD;
      salivary contamination, the sites to be sampled were rinsed with water, isolated by cotton&#xD;
      rolls and gently air dried. Paper strips (Periopaper; Oraflow Inc.,Smithtown, NY, USA) were&#xD;
      gently inserted 1-2 mm into the sulcus/pocket for 30 seconds. Care was taken to avoid&#xD;
      mechanical injury of the gingival tissues. All samples containing blood and saliva were&#xD;
      discarded. The two strips from two sites of each individual were placed into coded sealed&#xD;
      plastic eppendorf tubes and pooled before freezing at -80 degree&#xD;
