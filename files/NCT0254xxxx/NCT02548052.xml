  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2981278 is a highly potent and selective inverse agonist of retinoic acid receptor-related&#xD;
      orphan receptor gamma (ROR gamma) that is under development for topical treatment of plaque&#xD;
      type psoriasis suitable for topical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study to administer GSK2981278 to subjects with psoriasis. This&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and initial efficacy of a range&#xD;
      of concentrations of GSK2981278 ointment with repeated topical applications in adult subjects&#xD;
      with psoriasis. Results of this study will provide first clinical information on the drug's&#xD;
      safety and efficacy in psoriasis and inform the selection of concentration of GSK2981278&#xD;
      ointment to be evaluated in subsequent clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, single center, test field-randomized, vehicle- and positive- controlled,&#xD;
      subject- and evaluator-blind study. All subjects will receive all 6 treatments on 6 test&#xD;
      fields, for intra-individual treatment comparison. For every subject, the manner of&#xD;
      assignment of each treatment to a particular test field will be according to a randomization&#xD;
      scheme. Thus, the test fields within each subject, and not the subjects themselves, will be&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of screening, followed by a treatment period of 19 days, and a&#xD;
      follow-up visit at Day 27 (+/-2) for subjects who will consent for biopsy. During the&#xD;
      treatment period, subjects will receive all of these treatments: GSK2981278 ointment 0.03%&#xD;
      weight by weight [w/w], 0.1% w/w, 0.8% w/w, 4% w/w, GSK2981278 vehicle, and betamethasone&#xD;
      valerate 0.1% cream. The test fields on which these treatments will be applied will be&#xD;
      identified on stable plaque(s) on the upper extremities, thighs and/or trunk. A blinded&#xD;
      evaluator (an investigator or designee) will perform the measurements and assessments whereas&#xD;
      an unblinded study staff member (not an evaluator) will perform biopsy collection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age and above, at the time of signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with stable plaque psoriasis for &gt;= 6 months, as confirmed by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Up to three plaque area(s) sufficient for six test fields. The target lesion(s) should&#xD;
             be on the trunk, upper extremities or thighs (excluding hands and skin folds);&#xD;
             psoriatic lesion(s) on the knees or elbows are not to be used as a target lesion. It&#xD;
             is recommended, but not required, that all selected plaques are symmetrical in&#xD;
             location, size and clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plaques to be treated should have a comparable thickness of the Echo Lucent Band (ELB)&#xD;
             (as a surrogate for the psoriatic infiltrate thickness) of at least 200 micrometers on&#xD;
             Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the&#xD;
        following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until&#xD;
        after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male condom. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used&#xD;
             consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is&#xD;
             responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female of non-reproductive potential (FNRP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        A FNRP is eligible to participate in this study if she meets at least one of the following&#xD;
        conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Females with one of the following procedures documented and no plans to utilize&#xD;
             assisted reproductive techniques (e.g., in vitro fertilization or donor embryo&#xD;
             transfer): Bilateral tubal ligation or salpingectomy; Hysteroscopic tubal occlusion&#xD;
             procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; Hysterectomy;&#xD;
             Bilateral Oophorectomy (surgical menopause)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Post-menopausal women (including all women over 60 years of age, see below),&#xD;
             Post-Menopause criteria: Females 60 years of age or older; A practical definition&#xD;
             accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile,&#xD;
             e.g., age appropriate, &gt;45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)&#xD;
             or medical suppression of the menstrual cycle (e.g., leuprolide treatment) [In&#xD;
             questionable cases for women &lt; 60 years of age, a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
             follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol falling into the central laboratory's&#xD;
             post-menopausal reference range is confirmatory (these levels need to be adjusted for&#xD;
             specific laboratories/assays)]; Females under 60 years of age, who are on HRT and wish&#xD;
             to continue, and whose menopausal status is in doubt, are required to use a highly&#xD;
             effective method to avoid pregnancy, as outlined in the protocol. Otherwise, they must&#xD;
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study&#xD;
             enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the&#xD;
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage&#xD;
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of&#xD;
             HRT during the study without use of a highly effective method to avoid pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
                  pre-specified requirements and restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2xUpper Limit of Normal (ULN) and bilirubin &gt;1.5x ULN&#xD;
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct&#xD;
             bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt; 480 msec in subjects&#xD;
             with Bundle Branch Block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate&#xD;
             according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), and/or machine-read. The QTc should be based on&#xD;
             single QTc values of ECG obtained over a brief recording period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the judgement of the investigator, would put the subject at&#xD;
             unacceptable risk for the participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence of another ongoing or any acute cutaneous infection, history of&#xD;
             repeated or chronic significant skin infections (unless irrelevant in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, i.e. onychomycosis, labial herpes or other minor diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically-relevant skin disease, other skin pathologies, or a history of skin cancer,&#xD;
             that may, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicate participation or&#xD;

          -  Use of prohibited concomitant medications or products within the defined washout&#xD;
             periods before the Day 1 visit and during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical&#xD;
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications according to summary of product characteristics of the active&#xD;
             positive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, influence the outcome of the trial in the 4 weeks before baseline visit&#xD;
             and during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test&#xD;
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit or intention to have such exposure during the&#xD;
             study, thought by the investigator likely to modify the subject's psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigator or physician performing the initial examination the&#xD;
             subject should not participate in the clinical trial, e.g. due to probable&#xD;
             noncompliance or inability to understand the trial and give adequately informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Close affiliation with the investigator (e.g. a close relative) or persons working at&#xD;
