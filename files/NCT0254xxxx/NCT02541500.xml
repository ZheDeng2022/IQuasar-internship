      The proposed study will evaluate the tolerability, acceptability and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      minocycline for the treatment of co-occurring opioid and amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS)&#xD;
      dependence. In the proposed clinical trial, all patients will first discontinue illicit&#xD;
      opioid and ATS and be inducted onto buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) in the&#xD;
      inpatient ward at the department of psychiatry before beginning to receive minocycline.&#xD;
      Tolerability and acceptability will be evaluated by assessing the rates of patient retention&#xD;
      during treatment, patient satisfaction with treatment and adverse effects during treatment.&#xD;
      The potential efficacy of minocycline will be evaluated with regard to the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure: reductions in ATS use , based on urine toxicology testing and self-report. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures include retention, reduction in HIV risk behaviors and improvements in&#xD;
      functional status.&#xD;

      Additional data available to this project will come from contemporaneous and historical drug&#xD;
      treatment clinical trials and treatment programs conducted at HUSM with similar populations&#xD;
      of patients and proposed/described as other components of the cluster of research projects&#xD;
      described in the overall Research University Team Grant proposal. Comparisons of treatment&#xD;
      process and outcome measures collected in this proposed clinical trial with data collected in&#xD;
      contemporaneous and historical controls will enhance our ability to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      efficacy of minocycline as treatment agent for co-occurring opioid and amphetamine-type&#xD;
      stimulant (ATS) dependence. Data from patients receiving other drug treatments at HUSM will&#xD;
      be used as reference points to evaluate potential effect sizes of treatment effects&#xD;
      associated with minocycline treatment. The preliminary data on treatment retention data,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, potential adverse effects, and efficacy will be used as&#xD;
      preliminary/pilot research when designing and applying for funding support for future large&#xD;
      scale randomized clinical trials aimed at the development of effective medically based&#xD;
      treatments of opiate and ATS abuse or dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) has also emerged as a major drug&#xD;
      problem. Globally, ATS is now the second most commonly used illicit drug type and is more&#xD;
      widely used than heroin. ATS abuse is especially prevalent and problematic in the Asian&#xD;
      region, where ATS production, use, drug seizures, and demand for treatment have continued to&#xD;
      increase. Injection of methamphetamine has been reported in Malaysia (Chawarski et al, 2006)&#xD;
      and other south-east Asian countries (McKetin, 2008). In the most recent survey of&#xD;
      out-of-treatment heroin IVDU in cities across Malaysia, more than 60% report current ATS use,&#xD;
      and 29% inject ATS (Chawarski et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATS use is associated with increased HIV transmission behavioral risks. The connection of&#xD;
      heroin, methamphetamine and HIV in Malaysia is well documented (Chawarski et al, 2006).&#xD;
      Increased needle sharing and risky sexual behaviors lead to increased prevalence of HIV&#xD;
      infection. ATS use exacerbates HIV transmission risk through a number of mechanisms: ATS&#xD;
      users report engaging in more frequent and more risky sexual behaviors while using ATS and in&#xD;
      more frequent needle sharing. ATS is also associated with impairments of mood and executive&#xD;
      functioning that may persist for prolonged periods and may contribute to relapse to drug use,&#xD;
      thus all other problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug abuse has been a major problem in Kelantan for the past several decades (Suarn &amp;&#xD;
      NorAdam,1993) and ATS has been gaining momentum over the past decade. The number of&#xD;
      individuals arrested annually for ATS in Kelantan increased over the past 5 years from 2900&#xD;
      in 2007 to 5300 in 2010. For the past 5 years, Kelantan has also led Malaysia in having the&#xD;
      highest population prevalence of HIV infection, at 47 per 100,000 in 2008, nearly 4 times the&#xD;
      prevalence reported for the rest of Malaysia. Kelantan also has the highest number of women&#xD;
      with HIV in Malaysia with more than 1200 reported in 2008, suggesting that HIV is making the&#xD;
      transition to the general population. A large proportion of treatment seeking drug users in&#xD;
      Kelantan are HIV positives and are susceptible to high mortality (JKNK, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic derived from tetracycline. Minocycline is&#xD;
      substantially more lipid-soluble than other tetracyclines, thus minocycline readily crosses&#xD;
      the blood-brain barrier, and its potential efficacy for treating ATS dependence derives from&#xD;
      its effects on dopamine on glutamate neurotransmission in the brain and its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective and cognitive-enhancing effects in the brain (Dean et al,&#xD;
      2012). Glutamate along with dopamine plays a key role in the rewarding and addictive effects&#xD;
      of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and other stimulants. Input from glutamatergic pathways in&#xD;
      brain reward centers enhances dopaminergic transmission in these pathways and reward.&#xD;
      Blockade of glutamate receptors in these regions prevents many of the behavioral effects of&#xD;
      ATS or other stimulants and prevents reinstatement of stimulant use in animal studies.&#xD;
      Glutamate plays a key role in learning and memory, and blockade of glutamate interferes with&#xD;
      consolidation of memory for the rewarding effects of stimulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline, one of the very few medications affecting glutamate transmission, attenuates&#xD;
      many of the behavioral effects of stimulants in animal models, attenuates release of dopamine&#xD;
      in brain reward pathways in response to stimulants. It has cognitive-enhancing effects in&#xD;
      humans, and improves stimulant-induced and phencyclidine-induced cognitive impairments. In&#xD;
      animal models, minocycline improved stimulant-induced or phencyclidine-induced impairments of&#xD;
      object recognition, sensorimotor gating, and visuospatial memory. A study of nicotine&#xD;
      addiction showed greater reduction in craving for cigarettes while on minocycline as compared&#xD;
      to placebo (Sofuoglu et al, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study (Sofuoglu et al, 2011), minocycline attenuated the subjective, rewarding&#xD;
      effects of amphetamine administration in healthy human volunteers, reduced plasma cortisol&#xD;
      levels following amphetamine administration, and improved reaction times on a cognitive&#xD;
      performance task testing attention. The cognitive-enhancing effects of minocycline have been&#xD;
      found in individuals with schizophrenia, who showed improved working memory, cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility and cognitive planning in response to minocycline. Addition of minocycline early&#xD;
      in the treatment improves negative symptoms in patient with schizophrenia (Chaudry et al,&#xD;
      2012).Minocycline exerts neuroprotective effects but under certain circumstances, also have&#xD;
      neurotoxic consequences (Plane et al, 2010). Reserchers in Japan reported a case of a female&#xD;
      patient whose psychotic symptoms in methamphetamine use disorder were successfully improved&#xD;
      by minocycline, even though the precise mechanisms were not understood then (Tanibuchi et al,&#xD;
      2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very rarely, minocycline is associated with some severe problems, including colitis,&#xD;
      infection with non-susceptible organisms, liver damage, (MacNeil et al,1997), benign&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension, skin rashes, autoimmune disorders or allergic reactions. Although&#xD;
      these problems occur very rarely, we plan to monitor patients for adverse effects closely&#xD;
      throughout the study to ensure early detection and prompt treatment of any serious advere&#xD;
      effect, if one should occur. Additionally, patients treated for acne with minocycline may be&#xD;
      treated with minocycline for many years, while in the proposed study we are planning to treat&#xD;
      patients with minocycline for a very limited period, 4 months. We anticipate that, if it is&#xD;
      found to be efficacious for treating ATS abuse or dependence, minocycline would be used in&#xD;
      the initial phase of treatment to help patients consolidate a period of abstinence from ATS&#xD;
      and develop healthy, drug-free life styles; we do not anticipate that minocycline would be&#xD;
      used for the long-term maintenance treatment of ATS abuse or dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to detoxification and treatment medications, a manual-guided educational drug and&#xD;
      HIV risk reduction counseling (EDRC) will be provided to all participants. EDRC provides&#xD;
      education about medical understanding of opioid and ATS addiction, highly effective&#xD;
      strategies used in successful drug recovery efforts, medical and other harmful consequences&#xD;
      of drug use includingHIV and other infectious disease transmission, as well as about&#xD;
      effective prevention of all negative consequences of illicit drug use (Chawarski et al,&#xD;
      2008). It helps patient to remain in treatment, adhere to prescribed medications, abstain&#xD;
      from or reduce illicit opioid and ATS use and HIV risk behaviors, and make life-style changes&#xD;
      fostering sustained recovery. It also teaches basic cognitive and behavioral coping skills&#xD;
      that increase the patients' chances to reach sustained and prolonged recovery from drugs. For&#xD;
      HIV positive patients, EDRC encourages patients to attend the HIV clinic and adhere to&#xD;
      monitoring, medication, and other treatment recommendations. EDRC will be provided by trained&#xD;
      and supervised nursing personnel, drug counselors, or therapists. It will be offered in&#xD;
      individual format with the frequency ranging from 3 times per week during detoxification to&#xD;
      once per week during the outpatient phase of treatment.&#xD;
