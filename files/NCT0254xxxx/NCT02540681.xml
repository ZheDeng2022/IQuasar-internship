    <textblock>
      The aims of this study address an exploratory endpoint in the Major Extremity Trauma Research&#xD;
      Consortium (METRC) Transtibial Amputation Outcomes Study (TAOS; NCT01821976) that is&#xD;
      investigating prosthesis fit, alignment and condition of the residual limb. As there are no&#xD;
      validated measures of fit and alignment (factors known to impact comfort, function and&#xD;
      performance among amputees) the TAOS study includes a provision in the protocol for&#xD;
      acquisition of photographs, video and radiographs in order to help develop uniform&#xD;
      assessments of the residual limb. The goal of the ProFit study is to validate and refine the&#xD;
      prosthetic assessment tool (ProFit) that was developed by an expert panel of certified&#xD;
      orthotist prosthetistis (CPOs) in collaboration with orthopaedic trauma investigators, a&#xD;
      measurement scientist and a biomedical engineer from the BADER consortium.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: To test the reliability of the ProFit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the TAOS trial returning for their eighteen month final visit will&#xD;
      undergo radiographic, video, and photographic assessment. A blinded prosthetist panel (PP)&#xD;
      will view these remotely and complete a 42 item assessment based on x-ray, photo and video.&#xD;
      We will examine two aspects of reliability for the ProFit, inter-rater reliability and&#xD;
      internal consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To examine the validity and responsiveness of the ProFit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine the validity of the ProFit by specifically evaluating factor&#xD;
      validity, construct validity and discriminant validity. This will be accomplished by&#xD;
      correlating ProFit scores with measures of self-reported pain (Brief Pain Inventory),&#xD;
      function (Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment), and satisfaction (Orthotics and&#xD;
      Prosthetics User's Survey). Moreover, a subset of subjects will undergo quantitative&#xD;
      measurement of fit and alignment using a novel prosthesis-mounted socket reaction moment&#xD;
      sensor. Responsiveness of the ProFit will be based on repeated measurements at 6 and 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To develop a shorter version of the ProFit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on findings from Aim 1 and 2 at the individual item level, we will remove items that:&#xD;
      1) have poor inter-rater agreement; 2) demonstrate weak relationships with clinician and&#xD;
      patient report of overall fit; or 3) exhibit strong ceiling or floor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The ProFit study is a prospective validation study of an assessment of&#xD;
      prosthetic fit and alignment among patients with a transtibial amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 3 years Sample size: 120 TAOS patients will provide adequate power to detect&#xD;
      important differences in fit and alignment 18 months following amputation. A subset of 60&#xD;
      patients is necessary to detect significant differences in alignment using the Smart Pyramid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of study sites: Up to 35 centers including 24 Core METRC sites, 4 MTFs, and 7 METRC&#xD;
      satellite sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients enrolled in the METRC TAOS study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure: This ancillary project to the TAOS trial is designed to study the validity&#xD;
      reliability and validity of the ProFit, a 42-item tool for assessing prosthetic fit and&#xD;
      alignment among patients with a transtibial amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Inter-rater reliability and internal consistency will be examined to&#xD;
      test the reliability of the ProFit. The validity of this assessment will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      variety of construct validity tests. Based on findings from the reliability and validity&#xD;
      analysis, a shorter version of the ProFit will be developed. The performance of the shorter&#xD;
      version will be determined based on correlation with the original assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring: Not applicable&#xD;
