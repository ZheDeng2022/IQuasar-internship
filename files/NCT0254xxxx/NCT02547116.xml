  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and Methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus (SA)&#xD;
      are two of the most important infectious pathogens in CF, with 69% of CF patients having lung&#xD;
      infection with MSSA or MRSA in the last year. Wolter and co-workers recently demonstrated&#xD;
      that a specific morphologic subtype of MSSA and MRSA, small-colony variant Staph aureus&#xD;
      (SCV-SA), is associated with greater decline in lung function and worse clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      SCV-SA is already recognized for its ability to contribute to persistent infection, likely&#xD;
      due to SCV-SA's ability for intracellular growth, as well as its increased antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance compared to normal-colony SA. To investigate the epidemiology and clinical&#xD;
      significance of SCV-SA in CF, and explore the hypothesis that SCV-SA may require unique&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment strategies to optimize clinical response, the investigators will perform&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize the epidemiology of SCV-SA infection in both an adult and pediatric CF&#xD;
           population and investigate the clinical significance of SCV-SA infection in CF by&#xD;
           comparing clinical characteristics and outcomes of CF patients with SCV-SA compared to&#xD;
           those with to normal-colony MSSA/MRSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterize the unique microbiologic characteristics of SCV-SA infection in CF by&#xD;
           evaluating antibiotic susceptibility profiles and molecular characteristics of SCV-SA in&#xD;
           a two large CF patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform a 16-patient pilot study of a novel treatment for SCV-SA infection in CF,&#xD;
           utilizing low dose rifampin in combination with standard anti-SA antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These investigations will delineate the role of SCV-SA as a pathogen in CF and provide&#xD;
      guidance to optimize treatment strategies of MSSA/MRSA CF lung infection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female ≥ 12 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Confirmed diagnosis of CF based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  positive sweat chloride &gt; 60 mEq/liter (by pilocarpine iontophoresis) and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a genotype with two identifiable mutations consistent with CF or abnormal NPD,&#xD;
                  and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  one or more clinical features consistent with the CF phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Written informed consent (and assent when applicable) obtained from subject or&#xD;
             subject's legal representative and ability for subject to comply with the requirements&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Two positive SCV-SA respiratory cultures in the last two years at least six months&#xD;
             apart, plus a positive SCV-SA respiratory culture at Screening Visit and Run-in (Day&#xD;
             -14) Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. FEV1 &gt;30% of predicted normal for age, gender, and height at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Weight &gt; 35 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females of childbearing potential must agree to practice one highly effective method&#xD;
             of birth control, including abstinence. Note: highly effective methods of birth&#xD;
             control are those, alone or in combination, that result in a failure rate less than 1%&#xD;
             per year when used consistently and correctly. Female patients who utilize hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives as a birth control method must have used the same method for at least 3&#xD;
             months before study dosing. If the patient is using a hormonal form of contraception,&#xD;
             patients will be required to also use barrier contraceptives as rifampin can affect&#xD;
             the reliability of hormone therapy. Barrier contraceptives such as male condom or&#xD;
             diaphragm are acceptable if used in combination with spermicides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or change in&#xD;
             routine therapy (including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 14 days of the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of oral or inhaled anti-MRSA drugs within two weeks of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of intolerance to rifampin or TMP/SMX, minocycline, and doxycycline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Resistance to rifampin or TMP/SMX, minocycline and doxycycline at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Abnormal renal function, defined as creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min using the&#xD;
             Cockcroft-Gault equation for adults or Schwartz equation in children, at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Abnormal liver function, defined as ≥3x upper limit of normal (ULN), of serum&#xD;
             aspartate transaminase (AST) or serum alanine transaminase (ALT), or known cirrhosis.&#xD;
             at the time of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Serum hematology or chemistry results which in the judgment of the investigator would&#xD;
             interfere with completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of or listed for solid organ or hematological transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of sputum culture with non-tuberculous Mycobacteria in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of sputum culture with Burkholderia Cepacia in the last year.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Administration of any investigational drug or device within 28 days of screening or&#xD;
             within 6 half-lives of the investigational drug (whichever is longer)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Female patients of childbearing potential who are pregnant or lactating, or plan on&#xD;
             becoming pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would interfere with patient treatment, assessment, or adherence to the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients taking certain drugs will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
