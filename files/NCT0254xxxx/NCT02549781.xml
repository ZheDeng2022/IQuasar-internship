  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the prevalence of problem gambling and risk has been estimated at 1.3%. This&#xD;
      disorder, currently considered a behavioral addiction is characterized by a loss of control&#xD;
      and an excessive focus on the game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature on intervening psychological mechanisms in the development of the game led to&#xD;
      think that the size of loss of control, central among players, could be understood as a&#xD;
      reduction in control capacity but also as automatic activation behavior game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The task of Go-Nogo, commonly used in cognitive psychology, assesses the automatic and&#xD;
      controlled components of behavior. Furthermore, different models of the concept of addiction&#xD;
      underline the importance of the environment associated with addiction. However, no study&#xD;
      takes into account the interaction between the game environment and the involvement of these&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;

      In this study, patients will realize, on a computer, various exercises (called &quot;Go-Nogo&quot;)&#xD;
      whose principle is: 2 symbols (for example, a circle and a square) appear in random order on&#xD;
      the screen computer. The patient will not press the response button (key on the keyboard)&#xD;
      that upon the occurrence of one of the two symbols, in dependence upon the command that it&#xD;
      has been given by the psychiatrist, and this as quickly as possible. The patient will&#xD;
      successively perform 3 versions of this exercise (with a neutral wallpaper, with&#xD;
      neutral/games images or with neutral/games tones).Order of the 3 versions will be determined&#xD;
      by randomization.&#xD;
