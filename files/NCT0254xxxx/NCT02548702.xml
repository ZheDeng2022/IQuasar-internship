    <textblock>
      The Fit4Life intervention aims to engage inactive patients with type 2 diabetes in a&#xD;
      community-based sport intervention, with the aim being that all participants complete 1 x 30&#xD;
      min session of physical activity/exercise per week across the 12 months they are involved in&#xD;
      the intervention (total study duration 3 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the Fit4Life intervention is to slow the progression of disease symptoms and to&#xD;
      improve quality of life in those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this research&#xD;
      study is thus to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in achieving these aims. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that involvement in the Fit4Life programme will increase physical activity,&#xD;
      reduce type 2 diabetes disease symptoms and enhance self-reported quality of life in male and&#xD;
      female patients aged 35-64.&#xD;

      Overview The evaluation will also assess the effect of the community-based sport intervention&#xD;
      (1 x 30 min session per week) on physical activity levels and cognitive function in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes patients. Physical activity is known to assist in the management of type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      thus the effect of the intervention on physical activity levels is of interest. In addition,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes has been shown to detrimentally affect cognitive function. Therefore, the&#xD;
      evaluation will also assess the effect of the community-based sport intervention on cognitive&#xD;
      function in the type 2 diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will engage inactive patients diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes in regular sport&#xD;
      and physical activity. The aim of the project is to use community based sport and physical&#xD;
      activity to enhance health and wellbeing and to facilitate the effective management of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Working in Nottingham City with 60 GP Practices and their Diabetes Specific Nurses,&#xD;
      and in the 3 south area CCGs with up to 60 GP Practices, patients' sporting interests and&#xD;
      motivations will be identified and matched with appropriate, local, community-based sport and&#xD;
      exercise opportunities delivered by specially trained instructors and coaches. The aim of the&#xD;
      study (total duration 3 years) is to engage 4032 people in 1 x 30 minutes of sport/exercise&#xD;
      per week, for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question(s)/evaluation aim(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from baseline in number of participants reporting one or more sessions of sport per&#xD;
      week measured by the UK Single Item Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research question(s)/evaluation aim(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from baseline in body mass (kg); Change from baseline in hip circumference (cm) Change&#xD;
      from baseline in waist circumference (cm) Change from baseline in quality of life as measured&#xD;
      by the Quality of Life Survey (QOLS)(sum of 16 item, 7 point likert scale); Change from&#xD;
      baseline in control of blood glucose concentration as measured by self-report&#xD;
      survey(subjective rating, 'better', 'the same', 'worse'); Change from baseline in control of&#xD;
      blood glucose concentration as measured by HPA1c concentration (mmol/mol)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To use community based sport and physical activity to engage 4032 inactive&#xD;
      patients, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, in 1 x 30 minutes of sport / exercise per week,&#xD;
      over 3 years. In so doing, to enhance the health and wellbeing of the patients and to help&#xD;
      facilitate the effective management of their type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A questionnaire will be distributed to 4032 patients (over the 3 year duration of the&#xD;
      project) at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The questionnaire will ask questions about sports&#xD;
      participation, physical activity undertaken and sedentary behaviour, which will allow&#xD;
      examination of whether the Fit4life project has increased the quantity of sport and physical&#xD;
      activity undertaken by inactive patients, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The questionnaire&#xD;
      will also contain questions investigating the quality of life of patients, perception of&#xD;
      effort and the type and quantity of medication used by patients during their involvement in&#xD;
      the Fit4 life project; this will allow examination of whether the Fit4life project has&#xD;
      enhanced the health and wellbeing of inactive patients, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, as per Sport England requirements, data will be collected on: The number of&#xD;
      people engaged with the project (target and outcome measure); the number of inactive people&#xD;
      engaged in the project; the number of inactive people moved into 1 x 30 minutes of sport; the&#xD;
      number of people still engaged in the sport at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a small sub-sample of patients involved in the project (n=50-100) some direct assessments&#xD;
      of physical activity, health status and physiological function will be made. These&#xD;
      assessments may include measurement of: physical activity via accelerometers / pedometers;&#xD;
      waist and hip circumference; fasting blood glucose, HPA1c and c-peptide concentrations;&#xD;
      responses to treadmill walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to provide rich, explanatory data, to provide information about project processes,&#xD;
      and how the project worked and was received, focus groups / telephone interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with patients (n=30-40 per year), practitioners and key stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will include questions on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of people engaged with the project&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of inactive people engaged in the project&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of inactive people moved into 1 x 30 minutes of sport&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of people still engaged in the sport at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of people still engaged in the sport at 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of people still engaged in the sport at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio-economic status via post code and income&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic characteristics e.g. sex, ethnicity, religion and disability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perception of effort via a Borg scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes medication use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enjoyment of sporting sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of sporting sessions, leader, venue, intensity and duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured directly in all participants by the project team:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waist and hip circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and body mass&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured directly by the investigators in a sub-sample of 50-100:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical activity via accelerometers / pedometers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  waist and hip circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height and body mass&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fasting blood glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HPA1c and c-peptide concentrations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  responses to treadmill walking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups and telephone semi-structured interviews in a sub-sample of 40-50 participants&#xD;
      (accepted qualitative methods)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Process evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceptions of health and fitness as a result of project participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately four thousand patients will be recruited to the project and randomly allocated&#xD;
      to an experimental group (9/10 patients recruited at each time point) and a control group&#xD;
      (1/10 patients recruited at each time point). The experimental group will complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months of involvement with the Fit4Life project. The control&#xD;
      group will complete the questionnaire at 0 and 3 months. Due to the need to provide a service&#xD;
      to all participants and to solicit the co-operation of GPs involved with the project the&#xD;
      control participants will then join the sporting activities offered to all other&#xD;
      participants, but will take no further part in the evaluation. As control participants will&#xD;
      be recruited throughout the project, statistically their data will be combined to form a&#xD;
      rolling control for the full period of the intervention and the analysis will be a mixed&#xD;
      longitudinal design undertaken by a consultant statistician (Prof. Alan Nevill).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from approximately 240 GP practices in the Nottingham City and&#xD;
      South Nottinghamshire area. GPs will provide patients with the project information (including&#xD;
      a telephone and email contact number) and patients will contact the project team themselves.&#xD;
      Patients can also self-refer from road shows and other events but will be asked to obtain a&#xD;
      note from their GP expressing their suitability to take part in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A process evaluation (how has the project worked for staff and patients) will be undertaken&#xD;
      via focus groups and telephone interviews as described earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-scale September/October 2015: NHS Ethics approval gained October 2015 onwards: patient&#xD;
      recruitment to intervention and control groups on-going throughout the study October 2015:&#xD;
      first patients recruited complete the baseline questionnaire and the intervention group have&#xD;
      their motivational interview October 2015: intervention group start sporting activities&#xD;
      December 2015: the earliest recruited control and intervention group patients complete the 3&#xD;
      month survey; the first controls join the sporting activities but take no further part in the&#xD;
      evaluation February 2016: first focus groups with patients and interviews with leaders and&#xD;
      staff take place March 2016: the earliest recruited intervention group patients complete the&#xD;
      6 month survey May 2016: further focus groups and interviews take place June 2016: the&#xD;
      earliest recruited intervention group patients complete the 9 month survey September 2016:&#xD;
      the earliest recruited intervention group patients complete the 12 month survey September&#xD;
      2016: end of year one report submitted to Sport England October 2016: dissemination of early&#xD;
      findings September 2017: end of year two report submitted to Sport England October 2017:&#xD;
      dissemination of interim findings September 2018: final report submitted to Sport England&#xD;
      October 2018: dissemination of study findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of results Survey data will be downloaded to SPSS (Statistical package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences) and the differences between the intervention and control group (accounting&#xD;
      for sex and demographic characteristics) will be examined using an appropriate statistical&#xD;
      methods such as multi-level modelling with a mixed longitudinal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview and focus group data will be transcribed, coded and analysed by interview themes&#xD;
      and by themes (including unexpected outcomes) that emerge from the data set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data will be directly analysed using standard laboratory procedures such as the&#xD;
      determination of oxygen uptake from expired air samples and the determination of blood&#xD;
      glucose using an automated PENTRA analyser with purchased standards and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients recruited to the Fit4life programme will have an initial assessment during which&#xD;
      the baseline questionnaire will be completed. This assessment will take place at a GP clinic.&#xD;
      Patients will start the study in groups of 10 to ease the logistical problems of follow-up&#xD;
      measurements. Patients will have a further introduction to the study (verbal and written) in&#xD;
      addition to the initial information received by telephone and in a written format on&#xD;
      recruitment. Patients will sign an informed consent form and will complete the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire (with the opportunity to ask questions to project staff). In addition the&#xD;
      intervention and the control group will have body mass, height, waist and hip circumference&#xD;
      measured in private by project staff. Control participants will leave once the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire and anthropometric measurements have been completed and will return after 3&#xD;
      months to complete another questionnaire and to join the sporting activities (these&#xD;
      participants will not be included in the intervention group for the evaluation). Patients&#xD;
      will also have been asked to weigh themselves on home scales before they arrive. Project&#xD;
      staff will then undertake the motivational interview with the intervention group participants&#xD;
      and they will be allocated to a sporting activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus all participants recruited should complete the baseline survey. To enhance the&#xD;
      completion of the 3 month and subsequent surveys, these will be administered at sporting&#xD;
      venues where possible (and where facilities are available) by project staff who the patients&#xD;
      have got to know. Where this is not possible patients will be invited back to the original&#xD;
      clinic by project staff who they have got to know through the motivational interview. Surveys&#xD;
      will be posted or emailed out to patients who are not caught by either of these methods. A&#xD;
      limitation here is that participants will have to weigh themselves in their own homes, but we&#xD;
      will have obtained a validation measure of their scales via the initial assessment meeting.&#xD;
