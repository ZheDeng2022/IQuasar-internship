      The purpose of this study is to validate and test a tolerance gene expression profile for the&#xD;
      identification of operationally tolerant liver transplant recipients, allowing for the&#xD;
      successful withdrawal of immunosuppression without rejection in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous pre-clinical work in the Levy Lab identified a novel biomarker gene set for the&#xD;
      identification of tolerance in murine models of rapamycin-induced cardiac tolerance and&#xD;
      spontaneous hepatic tolerance. Validation of this gene expression tolerance biomarker in&#xD;
      operationally tolerant patients is now required for its implementation in the clinical&#xD;
      setting. This proposal intends to validate and test our pre-clinically established tolerance&#xD;
      gene expression biomarker in the clinical setting in order to translate our findings into&#xD;
      improving the length and quality of life of transplant patients in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a distinct gene expression profile expressed in the&#xD;
      peripheral blood will identify operationally tolerant liver transplant recipients, allowing&#xD;
      for the successful withdrawal of immunosuppression in these patients. Our study aims are: (I)&#xD;
      To validate the pre-clinical gene expression profile for the identification of operationally&#xD;
      tolerant liver recipients in plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (2) To&#xD;
      determine that the gene expression profile in the PBMCs is the same as the intra-graft gene&#xD;
      expression profile (3) To demonstrate that liver transplant recipients with the tolerant gene&#xD;
      expression profile can be safely weaned off of immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proof of principle study will be conducted in two phases at the Toronto General Hospital&#xD;
      (TGH) Phase 1 will address study aims 1 and 2, and phase 2 will address study aim 3.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be screened and selected following predefined eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Eligible participants will undergo an informed consent process. The primary goal of&#xD;
      this study is to validate the pre-clinical tolerant gene expression profile that will allow&#xD;
      for the identification of tolerant liver recipients and for the monitored weaning off&#xD;
      immunosuppression in these tolerant patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Tolerance gene expression profile in graft versus peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment to one year post cessation of immunosuppression</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint will be defined as the ratio of patients (n=55) that will express the tolerance gene expression profile in the liver graft versus in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</description>

    <measure>Test of tolerance gene expression profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment to one year post cessation of immunosuppression</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint will assess whether the tolerance gene expression profile can be successfully used to select immunosuppressed patients for the successful weaning off immunosuppression. This endpoint will be evaluated using the number of successful immunosuppression-weaned patients from a 7-10 patient cohort. Successful immunosuppression-weaned patients are defined as patients who achieve an immunosuppression free state without any histological or clinical evidence of rejection for a minimum of 1 year.</description>
