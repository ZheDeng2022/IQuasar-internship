      This study aims to assess the frequency and severity of adverse events during Hepatitis C&#xD;
      therapy with or without first generation protease inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C Virus infection is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease worldwide with&#xD;
      current estimates of approximately 130 - 210 million individuals (according to 3% of the&#xD;
      world population) chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus. However, hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      infections are among the most common causes leading to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and&#xD;
      liver related death worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care is a combination of pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin&#xD;
      (dual-therapy). Since 2011, direct-acting antiviral drugs inhibiting viral protease are&#xD;
      approved as an addition to the standard therapy (triple-therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of adverse events as well as their severity generally depends on the therapy&#xD;
      regimen and is influenced by type and dosage of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most common adverse events (affects up to 95% of patients) are fever, fatigue, headache,&#xD;
      nausea, arthralgia, depression, skin reactions, neutropenia, and anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more frequent occurrence of adverse events with triple-therapy compared to dual- therapy&#xD;
      has become clear since it's introduction, particularly with regard to anemia, neutropenia,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal discomfort, fatigue, dysgeusia, and skin reactions. How- ever, there is&#xD;
      accumulating evidence for a more often appearance of infections and/or infestations in&#xD;
      patients receiving triple-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical consequence from adverse events is a reduction of quality of life and&#xD;
      consecutively the loss of antiviral therapy adherence. Thus, early recognition and immediate&#xD;
      treatment of adverse events are crucial aspects in the success of antiviral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to quantify reported adverse events with respect to therapy reg- imen&#xD;
      (dual-therapy vs. triple-therapy) in patients who are treated at the Department of Internal&#xD;
      Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the Medical University Graz.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a detailed review of international treatment recommendations, as well as an&#xD;
      analysis of possible predictor parameters for the appearance of adverse events and treatment&#xD;
      success is done.&#xD;
