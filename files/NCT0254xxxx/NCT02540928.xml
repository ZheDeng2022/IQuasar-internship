  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a drug called AMG 319 has an effect on a&#xD;
      patient's own immune response to head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This&#xD;
      study is specifically for patients who are having surgery to treat their HNSCC&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancers use 'defence mechanisms' to hide from the immune system and teach the immune system&#xD;
      not to destroy cancer cells. AMG 319 works by blocking these defence mechanisms in the&#xD;
      tumour. It targets and blocks an important protein called PI3K delta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory this leads to removal of a group of inhibitory immune cells. Releasing the&#xD;
      immune brakes leads to immune attack and destruction of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMG 319 looks promising in laboratory studies and in a very early study in a small number of&#xD;
      patients with leukaemia and we now wish to find out if it will be useful in treating patients&#xD;
      with head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomised, doubleblind, placebo controlled Phase II trial looking at the&#xD;
      effects of giving AMG 319 to patients with either human papilloma virus (HPV) positive or&#xD;
      negative head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We propose to treat patients&#xD;
      prior to resection surgery so that we can study the effect of AMG 319 on the cancer in fine&#xD;
      detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 54 patients with HPV positive or negative HNSCC of the hypopharynx, oropharynx,&#xD;
      oral cavity, supraglottis or larynx will be entered into the study. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two treatment groups and will receive between 20 and 29 days of oral&#xD;
      dosing with AMG 319 or placebo immediately before resection surgery.&#xD;

             or larynx (except T1 glottic tumours) for whom surgery with curative intent ± post&#xD;
             operative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is considered the primary treatment of&#xD;
             choice. Surgery should be scheduled to take place no sooner than 21 days and no later&#xD;
             than 30 days post first dose of AMG 319 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients presenting with recurrence can be considered for inclusion, as long as their&#xD;
             previous treatment did not include radiotherapy ± chemotherapy or any other anti&#xD;
             cancer therapy i.e. treated with surgery alone and this did not take place within 6&#xD;
             months prior to trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients presenting with a second primary HNSCC can be considered for inclusion, as&#xD;
             long as any previous radiotherapy, chemotherapy or any other anti cancer therapy was&#xD;
             completed more than 5 years prior to trial entry.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Prior radiotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy or other anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (excluding surgery) for current HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients should be excluded from the trial if they have active or previous&#xD;
             malignancies of other types which in the Investigator's opinion would mean they are&#xD;
             not a good candidate for the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female patients who are able to become pregnant (or already pregnant or lactating).&#xD;
             However, those patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before&#xD;
             enrolment and agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral; injected&#xD;
             or implanted hormonal contraception and condom; have an intra uterine device and&#xD;
             condom; diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom) effective at the first&#xD;
             administration of AMG 319, throughout the trial and for 6 months afterwards are&#xD;
             considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male patients with partners of child bearing potential (unless they agree to take&#xD;
             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception&#xD;

             the trial and for 6 months afterwards). Men with pregnant or lactating partners must&#xD;
             be advised to use barrier method contraception (for example: condom plus spermicidal&#xD;
             gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients unable to swallow oral medications (trial medication must not be chewed,&#xD;
             crushed, dissolved or divided).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. At high medical risk because of non malignant systemic disease including active&#xD;

             whilst taking part in this Phase IIa trial of AMG 319. Participation in an&#xD;
             observational trial or interventional clinical trial which does not involve&#xD;
             administration of an IMP would be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a&#xD;
             good candidate for the clinical trial.&#xD;
