  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In hemiplegic stroke patients, gait performance is affected by impaired walking endurance.&#xD;
      Evidence has shown that higher exercise intensity improves cardiovascular fitness, while&#xD;
      greater dose in task repetition benefits locomotor function. Therefore, the goal of this&#xD;
      study is to examine the effect of a combined cardiovascular/task-oriented interval training&#xD;
      programme on the walking capacity of chronic stroke individuals and the improvement in their&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Owing to the high prevalence of disability in stroke older adults, walking capacity and&#xD;
      participation can be severely affected. According to the International Classification of&#xD;
      Functioning, Disability and Health 2001, participation involves functioning in life. In&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Medicine, there has been a growing concern about it as a way to assess success&#xD;
      of treatment. However, appraisal of participation in stroke research is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all stages after a stroke, Physiotherapy interventions in favor of intensive high&#xD;
      repetitive task-oriented and task-specific training have obtained benefits on trained actions&#xD;
      and activities. But, the effect of this type of treatment on the impact the disease has on&#xD;
      patient´s participation is under investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to determine which kind of physiotherapy task-oriented training&#xD;
      program could better improve participation in chronic stroke subjects: an upper limb strength&#xD;
      training program (ULST) or a combined cardiovascular/task-oriented interval training (IT)&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the effect of a combined&#xD;
      cardiovascular/task-oriented interval training programme on the walking capacity of chronic&#xD;
      stroke individuals and the improvement in their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized single-blind controlled trial was carried out. Fourteen subjects with chronic&#xD;
      hemiplegia resulting from stroke (onset &gt;6m) were recruited. All participants were fully&#xD;
      informed about the experimental procedures and the aim of the study. Written informed consent&#xD;
      was signed by each subject prior to participate. Approval from the ethics committee of the&#xD;
      University of Valencia was obtained for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomly allocated to an ULST program with elastic bands (n=7) or to a&#xD;
      cardiovascular/task-oriented IT program (n=7), focused on walking capacity. In the ULST&#xD;
      group, a nine 5-minute station circuit session was designed. Patients work 2+2 minutes in&#xD;
      each exercise, with a 30-second rest between the 2-minute periods and between stations. The&#xD;
      IT program consisted of a set of 8 cardiovascular exercises at moderate intensity,&#xD;
      interrupted by 1-minute active breaks of task-oriented exercises. Duration of both programmes&#xD;
      was 3 months (3 sessions/week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation was assessed by the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS-16) and the Frenchay Activities&#xD;
      Index (FAI), before and after the intervention.&#xD;
