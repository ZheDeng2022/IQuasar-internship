    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center phase II study for subjects with measurable&#xD;
      advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer using pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel chemotherapy. As this combination of agents has not been tested in this&#xD;
      subject population, the first six subjects enrolled will constitute a safety run-in cohort.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure the safety of this combination treatment, an initial safety run-in will be&#xD;
      conducted for the first 6 subjects. This initial cohort of 6 subjects will be enrolled and&#xD;
      treated with standard doses as described below. Based on toxicity analysis of the initial 6&#xD;
      subjects following completion of 18 weeks of treatment, it will be determined if an extended&#xD;
      safety run-in period would be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of receiving any prior therapy, eligible subjects will be treated as follows&#xD;
      on D1 of cycles lasting 21 days (3 weeks) for a maximum of 6 cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab 200mg will be administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion every&#xD;
           3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel will be dosed at 175mg/m2 and be administered as a 3-hour continuous IV&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carboplatin will be dosed at area under the curve (AUC) of 6 and given as an IV infusion&#xD;
           in 250ml of D5W over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have had prior radiotherapy/platinum-based chemotherapy must initiate paclitaxel&#xD;
      and carboplatin at the following reduced dose levels if they have had prior external&#xD;
      radiotherapy involving the whole pelvis or abdomen or over 50% of their spine, and/or prior&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy for this, or any other cancer. Eligible subjects will be treated&#xD;
      as follows on Day 1 (D1) of cycles lasting 21 days (3 weeks) for a maximum of 6 cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab 200mg administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel will be dosed at 135mg/m2 and be administered as a 3-hour continuous IV&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carboplatin will be dosed at an AUC of 5 and given as an IV infusion in 250ml of D5W&#xD;
           over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent doses of paclitaxel and carboplatin may be escalated to the higher doses as&#xD;
      indicated above, provided these subjects do not exhibit hematologic or nonhematologic&#xD;
      toxicity &gt; Grade 1, except alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following laboratory values must be obtained within 14 days prior to registration for&#xD;
      protocol therapy:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving&#xD;

             recurrence (i.e., biopsy) will be performed per standard of care, at the treating&#xD;
             physician's discretion. If a subject with recurrence is undergoing a biopsy for&#xD;
             clinical indications and is willing and able, an optional collection of 3 frozen&#xD;
             tissue cores of the recurrence site is requested for correlative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 and obtained by imaging within 28 days&#xD;

             registration for protocol therapy, provided that toxicity has resolved to ≤ grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTES: Subjects may have received prior radiation therapy for treatment of&#xD;

                  radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous&#xD;
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the subject has&#xD;
             been disease-free for at least 5 years.&#xD;
