  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiplegic adults after stroke (stroke), children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP)&#xD;
      have both muscles spastic and paresis. These movement disorders are likely to cause muscle&#xD;
      changes both structural and viscoelastic involved in the alteration of neuromotor functions&#xD;
      such as walking. Therefore, it seems interesting to study the structure of these muscles with&#xD;
      available imaging techniques. The medial gastrocnemius muscle presents architectural&#xD;
      characteristics which allows easy evaluation 2D ultrasound. The literature lacks data on the&#xD;
      reproducibility of the measurement, by 2D ultrasound, of the pennation angle and muscular&#xD;
      thickness, particularly in children. In addition, the sonoelastometry by Supersonic ShearWave&#xD;
      Imaging (SSI) is a new technique of ultrasound, non-invasive, dynamic, which allows the&#xD;
      calculation of the modulus of elasticity within a muscle tissue. This allows to consider new&#xD;
      perspectives evaluation of the viscoelastic properties of the muscle. No studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the reproducibility of this method in adults/children/ adolescent after stroke and&#xD;
      hemiplegia.&#xD;

      A 1 week apart, an ultrasound examination will be conducted on the hemiplegic leg side, while&#xD;
      lying on his stomach and on the back. The thickness, elasticity and the pennation angle of&#xD;
      the medial gastrocnemius muscle will be measured.&#xD;
