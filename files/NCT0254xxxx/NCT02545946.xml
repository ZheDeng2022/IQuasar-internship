      Comparing the outcome of traditional incision and drainage with a larger skin incision with&#xD;
      or without gauze packing of cutaneous abscess in pediatrics versus a new minimally invasive&#xD;
      incision and drainage with two small incisions and a vessel loop transversing the incisions&#xD;
      to keep them open.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized single blind clinical trial will be conducted in a suburban&#xD;
      pediatric emergency department that treats approximately 29,000 patients per year. Patients&#xD;
      between 0-17 years with a superficial skin or soft tissue abscess larger than 3 cm that would&#xD;
      be appropriate for ED I&amp;D and outpatient management will be screened for inclusion. Patients&#xD;
      will be excluded if they are immunocompromised (taking chemotherapy, steroid or bioactive&#xD;
      medications or having diabetes mellitus), require a subspecialist for drainage or require&#xD;
      hospitalization. Subjects will be required to provide assent when age-appropriate, and&#xD;
      parental consent will be obtained. The parent or guardian will need to be in the emergency&#xD;
      department with the child to provide consent. Subjects will be randomized to be in either the&#xD;
      traditional I&amp;D arm or the minimally invasive vessel loop arm using numbered sealed envelops.&#xD;
      Computer blocking will randomize these numbered envelopes. Inside the envelope there will be&#xD;
      instructions to the treating physician as to which of two standard techniques should be&#xD;
      employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardized I&amp;D will be performed with a #11 blade scalpel and a full thickness cut&#xD;
           incising the lesion along at least 50% of the abscess diameter. The pocket will then be&#xD;
           probed to break up septations and the residual cavity will be irrigated with normal&#xD;
           saline. Iodinated gauze 0.25 inch will be used to loosely pack the remaining cavity if&#xD;
           the physician deems packing is necessary. The gauze will be left trailing out of the&#xD;
           surgical incision. The abscess will then be covered with 4 X 4 dry gauze and taped in&#xD;
           place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimally invasive I&amp;D with vessel loop will be preformed by making a 5mm incision with&#xD;
           a #11 blade in the area of maximal fluctuance. The cavity will then be probed with&#xD;
           forceps breaking up any septations. The forceps will then be used to find the furthest&#xD;
           extent of the cavity, and the #11 blade will be used to make a 5mm incision at the tip&#xD;
           of the forceps (at the farthest extent of the cavity). The forceps will then be pushed&#xD;
           through this second incision. The vessel loop will be grasped by the forceps and then&#xD;
           pulled back through both surgical incisions. The vessel loop will then be tied loosely&#xD;
           together, creating a loop back through both surgical incisions. Both sides of the&#xD;
           incisions will then be irrigated with normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cultures will be obtained, if possible, from the abscess. Pain medication and sedation at the&#xD;
      time of the I&amp;D will be left to the discretion of the treating physician. Antibiotics will&#xD;
      not be mandated, but allowed at the judgment of the treating medical team. All subjects will&#xD;
      be given 2 prescriptions for analgesia at home. One for mild pain, ibuprofen; another for&#xD;
      moderate or severe pain, acetaminophen with hydrocodone (either liquid or pills) will be&#xD;
      given. Equipotent alternatives will be provided in case of medication allergy. Pain scores&#xD;
      will be assessed using a ten point scale before and after the procedure and at 48 hour follow&#xD;
      up. Data recorded at the first visit will include demographics (age, male/female),&#xD;
      characteristics of the abscess, fever, duration of symptoms, history of prior abscess,&#xD;
      antibiotics in the last month, and provision of antibiotics post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will return to the ER in 72 hours and 1 week for a recheck. At the 3rd day&#xD;
      visit, wound packing will be removed. Large cavities will be repacked at the discretion of&#xD;
      the ED physician. Loops will be cut and removed at the 7th day visit unless significant&#xD;
      cellulitis remains. If cellulitis remains after 7 days, additional visits/hospitalization&#xD;
      would be set up at the treating doctors discretion. Given that failure of treatment is a&#xD;
      possible event in any abscess drainage, even those not involved with this study,&#xD;
      hospitalization or additional visits beyond the 2 included in the study, will be billed to&#xD;
      the patient's family and/or insurance company as any visit to the ER or hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and families will also be contacted at one month via telephone interview. Self-rated&#xD;
      cosmetic outcome will be assessed using a 10 point scale from worst to best looking scar.&#xD;
