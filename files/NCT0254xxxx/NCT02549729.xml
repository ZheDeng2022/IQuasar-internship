    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on&#xD;
      muscle function of postmenopausal women using or not using hormonal therapy replacement&#xD;
      (HTR). The study will evaluate also the prevalence of urinary incontinence reports, its&#xD;
      severity and impact on quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The climacteric period is marked by the decline of estrogens and androgens which represents&#xD;
      negative effect on the urogenital system and may present, as a consequence, pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscles (PFM) dysfunction and urinary incontinence (UI). The pelvic floor muscles training&#xD;
      (PFMT) and hormone therapy (HT) could result in a significant increase in muscle mass with&#xD;
      functional improvement and consequent decrease in complaints of urine loss. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effect of PFMT on muscle function, in the presence of UI, severity&#xD;
      and impact on quality of life in postmenopausal women with or without HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variable sexual function was abandoned due to the fact that the majority of the women do&#xD;
      not presented active sexual life, which is a criteria to answer the questionnaire Index of&#xD;
      Female Sexual Function (IFSF), or did not agree to answer the questionnaire. The anxiety&#xD;
      scale was also abandoned because it was a tool to assess sexual function in a broader way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial. Postmenopausal women will be divided into 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1- without exercise and without HT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - with exercise and without HT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 - without exercise and with HT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4 - with exercise and HT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be evaluated at baseline and up to 12 weeks. The evaluations of the PFM function&#xD;
      will be accomplished through the use of vaginal palpation using the Modified Oxford Scale&#xD;
      (MOS) and perineometry. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire- Short&#xD;
      Form (ICIQ - SF) will be used to assess reports of UI, quality of life will be evaluated by&#xD;
      the SF36 (Medical Outcomes Study 36 - Item Short - Form Health Survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electromyography was not performed because during the collection of data from the pilot&#xD;
      sample there was an excess of outcome measures which made the patients' adhesion unfeasible.&#xD;

    <description>Women will be instructed to perform pelvic floor muscle training daily at home 4 sets of 10 maximum perceived voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscle sustained for 6 seconds followed by 5 flick voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscle. The 4 sets will be performed in 4 different positions (supine, all four, sit and standing). Twice a week they will receive a supervised session using the same protocol described above.</description>
