      A Phase I/IIa, open-label, uncontrolled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Astarabine (BST-236) as single agent in patients with refractory or relapsed Acute Myeloid&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, Phase I/IIa, open-label, uncontrolled, single-center, single arm study&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Astarabine given intravenously (I.V.) in escalated&#xD;
      doses for 6 days for cycle in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or ALL who are more&#xD;
      than 18 years of age. Patients will be screened for eligibility based on existing records&#xD;
      and/or specific laboratory examinations performed for the screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be gradually enrolled into 4 subsequent cohorts of escalating drug doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort # Astarabine Dose Number of Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 0.5 gr/m2 (0.3 age&gt;50) 3&#xD;

&#xD;
        6. 6 gr/m2 (no age limit) 3 up to 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined in case 2 subjects will experience a dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;

             composition to Astarabine/Ara-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Astarabine/Ara-C are agents with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with Astarabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with Astarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. known history of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B or C&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Concurrent use of the following medications: Digoxin, Gentamycin, fluorocytosine,&#xD;
             L-asparginase, any drugs or supplements that interfere with blood clotting can raise&#xD;
             the risk of bleeding during treatment with Ara-C. These include: vitamin E,&#xD;
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, warfarin, ticlopidine,&#xD;
             clopidogrel.&#xD;
