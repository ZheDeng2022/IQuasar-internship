      The standard method for determining the carbohydrate content of a meal in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus is the weighing of individual foods. However, in daily life, the weighing&#xD;
      is not practical at all times. Inaccurate estimation of meal's CHO content, leads to wrong&#xD;
      insulin doses and consequently to poor postprandial glucose control. Fact is that even well&#xD;
      trained diabetic individuals find it difficult to estimate CHO precisely and that especially&#xD;
      meals served on a plate are prone to false estimations underlining an emergent need for novel&#xD;
      approaches to CHO estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GoCarb is a computer vision-based system for calculating the carbohydrate content of meals.&#xD;
      In a typical scenario, the user places a credit card-sized reference object next to the meal&#xD;
      and acquires two images using his/her smartphone. A series of computer vision modules&#xD;
      follows: the plate is detected and the different food items on the plate are automatically&#xD;
      segmented and recognized, while their 3D shape is reconstructed. On the basis of the shape,&#xD;
      the segmentation results and the reference card, the volume of each item is then estimated.&#xD;
      The CHO content is calculated by combining the food types with its volumes, and by using the&#xD;
      USDA nutritional database. Finally, the results are displayed to the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preclinical study using the GoCarb system indicates that the system is able to estimate the&#xD;
      meal's CHO content with higher accuracy than individuals with T1D. Furthermore, the feedback&#xD;
      gathered by the participants showed that the system is easy to use even for non-smartphone&#xD;
      users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized, cross-over pilot study is to investigate the benefits of an&#xD;
      automated determination of the carbohydrate content of meals on glycemic control in subjects&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes mellitus with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      For individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) the current gold standard to evaluate the&#xD;
      carbohydrate (CHO) amount of a meal is by carefully weighing its different components and&#xD;
      calculating the CHO content using reference nutritional tables. The resulting CHO amount is&#xD;
      then used to define the insulin dose needed to avoid an abnormal postprandial glucose&#xD;
      profile. Since this is a cumbersome procedure in real life, diabetic individuals often&#xD;
      estimate the CHO amount based on their personal experience. Especially for food served on a&#xD;
      plate CHO estimates are often significantly over or underestimated leading to high variation&#xD;
      in postprandial blood glucose. Besides the immediate risk of hypoglycaemia, there is emerging&#xD;
      evidence that suboptimal control of postprandial glucose is affiliated with increased risk&#xD;
      for long-term complications (e.g. diabetic micro- and macro-vascular diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of CHO counting in T1D control has been increasingly recognized and investigated.&#xD;
      A meta-analysis including five studies on individuals with T1D has shown, that improved CHO&#xD;
      counting accuracy reduces the HbA1c significantly (0.64% reduction in HbA1c compared to a&#xD;
      control group). Teaching adult individuals with T1D to count CHO reduces HbA1c significantly&#xD;
      and also leads to an improvement in quality of life. Similar findings are reported in&#xD;
      children, in whom higher CHO counting accuracy is associated with a lower HbA1c. Even a short&#xD;
      educational intervention of 4 weeks can still result in a significant and sustained effect on&#xD;
      HbA1c reduction 9 months after without having an increase in hypoglycaemia. Lower CHO&#xD;
      counting accuracy is a significant predictor of prolonged time in hyperglycaemic state. In&#xD;
      one study with adults only 31% of the participants estimated the CHO content with an error of&#xD;
      less than 20 grams per day and accurate CHO estimation were correlated with the lowest HbA1c&#xD;
      values. In line with these findings another study has shown that individuals on intensive&#xD;
      insulin therapy count CHO content of meals with an average error in the order of 16 grams or&#xD;
      21%. In general there is overestimation of small meals and a substantial underestimation of&#xD;
      large meals. While breakfast (+8.5%) and snacks (-5%) were estimated fairly accurately, lunch&#xD;
      (-28%) and dinner (-23%) are more prone to errors leading to an underestimation in the order&#xD;
      of 30 grams. In children, an inaccuracy of ±10grams does not deteriorate the postprandial&#xD;
      glycaemic control, whereas a ±20 grams variation significantly impacts the postprandial&#xD;
      glycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The debate how to optimally estimate CHO intake is on-going and controversial. Fact is that&#xD;
      even well trained diabetic individuals find it difficult to estimate CHO precisely and that&#xD;
      especially meals served on a plate are prone to false estimations underlining an emergent&#xD;
      need for novel approaches to CHO estimation. The investigators hypothesize that computer&#xD;
      vision supported CHO estimation can have a beneficial impact on postprandial glucose control,&#xD;
      ultimately leading to reduced episodes of hypoglycaemia and reduction in long term&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent advances in smartphone technologies and computer vision permitted the development&#xD;
      of applications for the automatic dietary assessment through meal image analysis. The&#xD;
      applications are using either a number of images or a short video of the upcoming meal, as&#xD;
      captured by the user's smartphone. Although several systems have been proposed in the past&#xD;
      decade, none of them is designed for individuals with diabetes, while they rely on strong&#xD;
      assumptions, which often do not hold in real life, or require too much user input. The GoCARB&#xD;
      system provides CHO estimations to individuals with T1D, by using only two meal images. The&#xD;
      current version GoCARB has been designed to deal with&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elliptical plates with a flat base;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  single-dish images;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fully visible food items. The system works without assumptions on the food shape, while&#xD;
           it supports the following food classes: Pasta, green salad, meat, breaded food, beans,&#xD;
           carrots, mashed potato, rice, potatoes, bread, cheese, egg, couscous, mushrooms and&#xD;
           spätzli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of GoCARB-supported CHO estimation in&#xD;
      the postprandial glucose control of individuals with T1D on sensor augmented insulin pump&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a typical scenario, the user places a credit card-sized reference object next to the meal&#xD;
      and acquires two images using her/his smartphone. A graphical user interface guides the user&#xD;
      in choosing the optimal angles for image acquisition based on the smartphone's built-in&#xD;
      sensors. The images are then transmitted to a dedicated server via Wi-Fi or the mobile&#xD;
      network. Then, the following computer vision algorithms are activated: the plate is detected&#xD;
      and the different food items on the plate are automatically segmented and recognized, while&#xD;
      their 3D shape is reconstructed. On the basis of the shape, the segmentation results and the&#xD;
      reference card, the volume and CHO content of each item is then calculated by combining the&#xD;
      food types with its volumes. Finally, the results are displayed to the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's overall objective is to perform a prospective randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      pilot study comparing postprandial glucose control assisted by the GoCARB system against the&#xD;
      usual care approach by the participants. Scope of the study will be to investigate whether&#xD;
      the postprandial glucose profile is improved by using the GoCARB prototype for CHO&#xD;
      estimation. Postprandial glycaemia is evaluated using continuous glucose monitoring.&#xD;
