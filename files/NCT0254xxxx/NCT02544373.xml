  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on&#xD;
      cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); and to evaluate whether OSA&#xD;
      treatment with positive airway pressure therapy could improve cognitive dysfunction in MS&#xD;
      patients who have OSA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 70% of patients with MS suffer from cognitive dysfunction (difficulties with thinking,&#xD;
      information processing, verbal expression, or memory). Cognitive dysfunction is one of the&#xD;
      most disabling symptoms of MS, that can profoundly affect job performance, family&#xD;
      responsibilities, and quality of life. While no treatments have been shown to improve&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction in MS, many patients have not been evaluated or treated for other&#xD;
      common health problems that could be contributing to their cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50% of MS patients also suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea is a common disorder in which the upper airway collapses during sleep, causing poor&#xD;
      sleep quality and decreased oxygen levels in the blood. In patients without MS, OSA is a&#xD;
      well-established cause of poor cognitive performance. Recent studies of non-MS patients also&#xD;
      suggest that cognitive performance may improve with OSA treatment. Yet, despite the high&#xD;
      number of MS patients with OSA, the relationship between OSA and cognitive performance, and&#xD;
      the effects of OSA treatment on cognitive performance in MS, has not received sufficient&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on&#xD;
      cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); and to evaluate whether OSA&#xD;
      treatment with positive airway pressure therapy could improve cognitive dysfunction in MS&#xD;
      patients who also have OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested participants with MS who screen positive on a commonly used screening tool used to&#xD;
      detect those at high risk for OSA will be invited to participate. Consenting participants&#xD;
      will have a baseline cognitive (memory and thinking) test to assess their cognitive function,&#xD;
      and an overnight sleep study (polysomnogram, or PSG) to determine if they have obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea. If the sleep study shows signs of sleep apnea, participants will be assigned&#xD;
      treatment for their sleep apnea with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, either&#xD;
      immediately (Group 1), or 3 months after the baseline sleep study (Group 2). Groups will be&#xD;
      assigned at random (like flipping a coin). There is a 2/3 chance that participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to Group 1. PAP therapy is considered standard clinical care for OSA. It involves&#xD;
      wearing an apparatus that includes a hose and a mask (that covers the nose, or nose and&#xD;
      mouth), connected to a small machine that blows air into the airway during sleep. In order to&#xD;
      determine which airway pressure most effectively treats an individual's sleep apnea, and what&#xD;
      type of mask is needed, a separate sleep study known as an overnight &quot;PAP titration study&quot;&#xD;
      will also be performed. This study is similar to a PSG but also involves fitting of various&#xD;
      masks which are then hooked up to the individual and PAP machine to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      various PAP settings, and to determine which mask is most tolerable for the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also receive repeat cognitive testing at 3 months to see if the immediate&#xD;
      sleep apnea treatment group (Group 1) shows improvements memory and thinking, as compared to&#xD;
      the standard care treatment group (Group 2), who will not start apnea treatment until after&#xD;
      their repeat cognitive test. Participants will be compensated for their travel and time&#xD;
      throughout the course of the study.&#xD;

             home study or in-lab) but have not yet started using PAP therapy on a compliant basis.&#xD;
             *If OSA was NOT diagnosed by a U-M in-lab sleep study within the past year prior to&#xD;
             screening, subjects must be willing to get new baseline in-lab U-M PSG as part of&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

         11. Unwillingness to initiate PAP therapy if clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Severe depression at screening per the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) (The&#xD;
             PHQ-8 is a brief, self-administered questionnaire that evaluates core symptoms&#xD;
             associated with major depressive disorder. Scores range from 0 to 24 based on the&#xD;
             frequency and severity of depressive symptoms over the previous two weeks.)&#xD;
