  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body (metastatic) or has come back (recurrent). Stereotactic radiosurgery, also known as&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy, is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a&#xD;
      single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause&#xD;
      less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of radiation therapy (RT)-related grade &gt;= 4 toxicity, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>RT-related grade &gt;= 4 toxicity will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the study group, taking into consideration the region treated with SBRT, timing of the toxicity, and the nature of the toxicity. Rates of RT-related grade &gt;= 4 toxicity will be recorded, time to RT-related grade &gt;= 4 toxicity will be recorded, and freedom from RT-related grade &gt;= 4 toxicity will be determined using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treated lesion control (LeC), defined as absence of clinical or radiographic progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of treatment to the time of local progression at each treated lesion, assessed up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>LeC will be estimated using descriptive statistics and the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival, defined as progression in the treated lesion, organ in which the treated lesion is present, distant failure, or death from any cause</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to time of progression, assessed up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Progression is defined as any new sites of disease on imaging or any progressive disease by RECIST criteria at initially treated sites of disease (within 80% isodose line). PFS will be estimated using descriptive statistics and the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Toxicity profile of 5-fraction SBRT based on normal tissue dosimetric constraints based on the organ site of involvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities of interest that occur within the 3-12 month time frame after RT start will be documented and analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
