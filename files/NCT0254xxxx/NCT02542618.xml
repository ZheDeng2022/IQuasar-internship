  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Major depression is a common mental disorder with serious consequences. The&#xD;
      societal costs of depression are high. Despite the existence of empirically-supported&#xD;
      psychological therapies, many patients do not benefit from these treatments and relapse and&#xD;
      recurrence percentages are high. Improvement of existing treatments or development of new and&#xD;
      better treatments is badly needed. Inquiry Based Stress Reduction (IBSR) is a promising&#xD;
      verbal therapy focusing on the inquiry of thoughts and could be a next step in improving&#xD;
      psychotherapy for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of the current study is to assess the effectiveness of IBSR.&#xD;
      Research to date has shown that IBSR is effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. The investigators want to know if IBSR is more effective in reducing symptoms of&#xD;
      depression than the best psychotherapeutic treatment for depression at this moment, cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural therapy (CBT). The investigators' secondary objective is to know more about the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms of change of these therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized controlled intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 88 patients with a mild to moderate depression as their principal&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: IBSR or CBT&#xD;
