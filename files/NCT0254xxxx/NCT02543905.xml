  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is now the commonest cancer in men in the Western world, with over 49,000 new&#xD;
      cases diagnosed each year and a lifetime risk of 1 in 11 in the United Kingdom. Prostate&#xD;
      cancer (PrCa) can run in some families and research studies have identified several genetic&#xD;
      changes in Caucasian populations that are thought to increase the risk of developing prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Other studies have shown that men from certain ethnic groups also have a higher risk&#xD;
      of prostate cancer, and this includes men of black African or Caribbean descent. This study&#xD;
      aims to look at men with a higher risk of prostate cancer based on their ethnicity or family&#xD;
      history to see whether any of these genetic changes are present in their DNA (genetic&#xD;
      material) and whether this could be a helpful screening tool in prostate cancer screening&#xD;
      programmes. It is thought that many genetic changes are involved in the development of&#xD;
      prostate cancer and research is being carried out worldwide to identify these genetic&#xD;
      changes. Some of these changes may cause a very slight increase in prostate cancer risk while&#xD;
      others may cause a much larger increase in risk of developing prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators will invite (i) Caucasian men with a family history of prostate cancer; (ii)&#xD;
      men of black African or Caribbean descent; and (iii) men of any ethnicity who have been found&#xD;
      to have inherited a gene mutation that increases risk of prostate cancer for targeted&#xD;
      prostate screening (Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing, MRI and a biopsy of the prostate&#xD;
      gland) and genetic profiling. The outcome of these prostate cancer screening investigations&#xD;
      will be compared with the genetic profiles of those taking part in the study in order to look&#xD;
      for certain genetic changes in the gene code that are thought to increase prostate cancer&#xD;
      risk. This research will help us to determine what the role of such genetic profiling is in a&#xD;
      prostate cancer screening programme and if it helps identify men at high prostate cancer&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;

      Purpose and Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the PROFILE study is to investigate the role of targeted prostate cancer screening&#xD;
      in men at a genetically higher risk to estimate the incidence of PrCa and the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of PSA screening in these populations and correlate this with genetic profiles&#xD;
      and biological endpoints. Additionally, the study aims to identify biomarkers from biological&#xD;
      samples (such as blood and urine) as well as imaging technologies (e.g. MRI and new imaging&#xD;
      techniques) as predictive markers of the risk of developing PrCa and to correlate these with&#xD;
      genetic risk. This study has been designed using an observational approach to look at the&#xD;
      correlation of cancer incidence (on biopsy) with genetic profile. The aim is to evaluate&#xD;
      targeted screening for prostate cancer in men at a genetically higher risk to estimate the&#xD;
      incidence of prostate cancer and the sensitivity and specificity of PSA screening in these&#xD;
      populations and correlate this with genetic profiles (i.e. single nucleotide polymorphism&#xD;
      (SNP) profiles) and biological endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cohorts will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Caucasian men with family history of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Men of black African or Caribbean descent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Men of any ethnicity who have been found to have inherited a gene mutation that&#xD;
           increases risk of prostate cancer (i.e. high-risk gene mutation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men with no prior screening will be offered immediate biopsy and genetic profiling. This will&#xD;
      provide data on genetic profiling and correlation with biopsy irrespective of PSA in men who&#xD;
      have not had any previous screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A PSA screening algorithm was considered as an alternative to biopsy but there is great&#xD;
      controversy over the PSA threshold that should be used as a cut-off. Recent data have shown&#xD;
      that a considerable percentage of men with a PSA within normal range have cancer at biopsy.&#xD;
      Therefore, it was decided by the Steering Committee that all participants should be offered a&#xD;
      biopsy within this study. This will tell us the acceptability of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some men may opt not to have biopsy at baseline (i.e. initial stage). These men will be&#xD;
      followed up with annual PSA, whereby prostate biopsy would be offered if PSA is above or&#xD;
      equal to 1.0ng/ml if the man is aged under 50 years, or where PSA is above or equal to&#xD;
      2.0ng/ml if the man is aged fifty years or over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility and Recruitment&#xD;

           metallic foreign bodies in eye(s), other metalwork, claustrophobia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neither Caucasian or Afro-Caribbean ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any significant psychological conditions that may be worsened or exacerbated by&#xD;
           participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time if they so wish without giving a reason.&#xD;
      No further data will be collected about that individual, and any unused samples will be&#xD;
      destroyed. Data collected up to that point will be retained for audit purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer cases Men who are found to have prostate cancer at biopsy will be referred to their&#xD;
      local urologist for treatment according to local policy. Men will be followed up for 10 years&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the different treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic Profiling All men will have genetic profiling to correlate with disease status and&#xD;
      men will be given the results of this test. It will be emphasised that these are research&#xD;
      results and written information will be provided as a reference guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent All subjects will be informed of the aims of the study, the possible adverse&#xD;
      events, the procedures and possible hazards to which he will be exposed, and the mechanism of&#xD;
      treatment allocation if prostate cancer was to be diagnosed. He will be informed as to the&#xD;
      strict confidentiality of his patient data, but that his medical records may be reviewed for&#xD;
      trial purposes by authorised individuals other than their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be emphasised that participation in this study is voluntary and that the subject is&#xD;
      allowed to refuse further participation in the protocol whenever he wants. This will not&#xD;
      prejudice the subject's subsequent care. Documented informed consent will be obtained,&#xD;
      according to the principals of good clinical practice (GCP), for all subjects included in the&#xD;
      study before they are registered onto the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, burdens, benefits There is a risk of complications from having a prostate biopsy, and&#xD;
      these complications are detailed in the patient information sheet, together with likelihood&#xD;
      of incidence. Complications are rare and standard procedures will be followed at all sites to&#xD;
      minimise their occurrence. The benefit of taking part may be that prostate cancer may be&#xD;
      diagnosed in men previously unaware that they had the disease. While there is the potential&#xD;
      for overdiagnosis of indolent disease, there is also the potential for detecting and treating&#xD;
      clinically significant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of results from the genetic profiling One further consideration is the occurrence&#xD;
      of anxiety as a result of taking part in the study, particularly in receiving research&#xD;
      genetic test results. There is considerable uncertainty about how genetic profile relates to&#xD;
      predicted risk of prostate cancer. For this reason individualised written information will be&#xD;
      provided to each participant putting the research results in the context of the current&#xD;
      population risks. It will be stressed that these are research results only and that the&#xD;
      investigators do not fully understand the meaning of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A psychosocial study is being run concurrently and will explore these issues in more depth&#xD;
      and the participant's experience of receiving these results will be an important component of&#xD;
      the evaluation of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality All information which is collected will be accessible only to the immediate&#xD;
      study team. Any data that is shared will be de-identified and any published data will be&#xD;
      anonymised so that no participant is recognisable from the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records and the data collected for the study may be looked at by authorised persons&#xD;
      from the Institute of Cancer Research, by regulatory authorities and by authorised people to&#xD;
      check that the study is being carried out correctly. All will have a duty of confidentiality&#xD;
      to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Follow-up After the participant has completed the study they will be advised&#xD;
      about any ongoing screening or follow-up that is required. This will be organised through the&#xD;
      participants general practitioner (GP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of samples in future research The informed consent process will explain that samples are&#xD;
      donated as a &quot;gift&quot;. If any of the samples collected are to be considered for use in future&#xD;
      research projects this would have to be approved by the Ethics Committee first.&#xD;
