    <textblock>
      The survival time and the number of long time survivors after radiotherapy in brain cancer&#xD;
      patients have increased for the last decades. Therefore the topic of late-delayed neurotoxic&#xD;
      effects of this therapy gains more and more importance. Among these side effects, the main&#xD;
      and most frequent one is the leukoencephalopathy, a diffused and progressive damage of the&#xD;
      white matter characterized by myelin loss, loss of axons and vascular lesions. The incidence&#xD;
      rate assessment, as well as the occurrence time, is based on retrospective studies with low&#xD;
      numbers of patients, but seems to reach 30 to 50 % of the patients according to the&#xD;
      follow-up. The risk seems to be increased during the first two years after the radiotherapy,&#xD;
      but persists for decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain further insight in the radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy, the objective of this&#xD;
      project is to study the onset and evolution of leukoencephalopathy in a 3-year prospective&#xD;
      cohort of patients having undergone cerebral radiotherapy for glioma (stage 3-4), using&#xD;
      specific cognitive tests, Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI) scans of the brain and predictive&#xD;
      bio-markers of cognitive impairments.&#xD;

      Context The survival time and the number of long time survivors after radiotherapy in brain&#xD;
      cancer patients have increased for the last decades. Therefore the topic of late-delayed&#xD;
      neurotoxic effects of this therapy gains more and more importance. Among these side effects,&#xD;
      the main and most frequent one is the leukoencephalopathy, a diffused and progressive damage&#xD;
      of the white matter characterized by myelin loss, loss of axons and vascular lesions. The&#xD;
      incidence rate assessment, as well as the occurrence time, is based on retrospective studies&#xD;
      with low numbers of patients, but seems to reach 30 to 50 % of the patients according to the&#xD;
      follow-up. The risk seems to be increased during the first two years after the radiotherapy,&#xD;
      but persists for decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No complete characterization of this cognitive impairment has been done yet due to crucial&#xD;
      discrepancies in the neuropsychological assessments that were used (namely missing of&#xD;
      pre-treatment assessment), in the follow-up of patients and in the applied treatment.&#xD;
      However, based on previous studies, it can be said that the short term memory and the frontal&#xD;
      functions are mainly affected and the quality of life is exceedingly impaired. Irradiation&#xD;
      schemes, in particular high doses and large irradiated volume, have been identified as risk&#xD;
      factors of leukoencephalopathy. However, in spite of modified protocols that tended to limit&#xD;
      the risk, the remaining occurrence of the disease suggests a high dependency on individual&#xD;
      risk factors, that are still poorly known and make the individual sensitivity to develop&#xD;
      these secondary effects unpredictable. Other factors such as cardio-vascular factors,&#xD;
      smoking, old age and combined radio-chemotherapy are linked to leukoencephalopathy as well,&#xD;
      although only few of these associations were proved in large studies. Moreover, some specific&#xD;
      bio-markers could complete clinical examinations to predict risk of cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      these patients. Several biomarkers could be of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protein S-100B is a protein synthesized mainly by glial cells and cells of Schwann. It is&#xD;
      an intracellular protein regulating the cytosolic availability of calcium. Its concentration&#xD;
      is 30-100 times brought up in the cerebral tissue that in the other tissues. Its plasmatic&#xD;
      half-life is a 1 hour, its elimination is renal. So, the protein S-100B is a marker of&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury, certain neurodegenerative disorders and malignant gliomas. The dosage&#xD;
      maybe so realized in serum and urines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Growing evidence implicates oxidative/nitrative damage in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
           neurodegenerative disorders. Subsequent studies were undertaken showing that specific&#xD;
           isoprostanes (iPs) levels are elevated in urine and blood of Alzheimer Disease patients&#xD;
           and that these values correlate with memory impairments. This suggests that iPs are&#xD;
           useful biomarkers in neurological diseases. Their levels could be measured in urine and&#xD;
           plasma of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid, derived from the metabolism of&#xD;
           methionine. Higher levels of homocysteine were associated with worse memory performance&#xD;
           in a large group of older subjects. While homocysteine is not a diagnostic test, it may&#xD;
           represent a modifiable risk factor for dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highlighting neuropsychological disorders including at an early stage requires a reliable and&#xD;
      reproducible assessment of the patient's cognitive state. However, a comprehensive&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment takes several hours and a qualified staff, making it difficult&#xD;
      to implement in the conventional patient monitoring. The use of a simple and fast tool to&#xD;
      detect cognitive impairment would help to develop a systematic approach for screening these&#xD;
      disorders. A detection computerized neuropsychological standardized test (Computerized&#xD;
      Cognitive Speed Test - CSCT) assessing processing speed of information, attention and working&#xD;
      memory has been validated in multiple sclerosis patients compared to healthy volunteers. CSCT&#xD;
      quickly detects patients with cognitive impairment, who could be then tested with more&#xD;
      complete tests. It can be conducted by people with no neuropsychology training and the&#xD;
      testing time is less than 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow a better understanding of the impact of cognitive sequelae in patients&#xD;
      treated for glioma with current standard treatments, including radiation. The validation of a&#xD;
      new screening test, the CSCT, in this disease will eventually detect earlier these effects&#xD;
      and possibly initiate treatment before lesions are too advanced. Feasibility of the&#xD;
      implementation of the CSCT in &quot;routine&quot; practice for all patients treated with brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Objectives and methodology To gain further insight in the radiation-induced&#xD;
      leukoencephalopathy, the objective of this project is to study the onset and evolution of&#xD;
      leukoencephalopathy in a 3-year prospective cohort of patients having undergone cerebral&#xD;
      radiotherapy for glioma (stage 3-4), using specific cognitive tests, MRI scans of the brain&#xD;
      and predictive bio-markers of cognitive impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To constitute a prospective cohort of patients treated for glioma (stage 3-4) with&#xD;
      radiotherapy in order to estimate the incidence rate and occurrence time of the&#xD;
      leukoencephalopathy at the end of the follow-up (3 years after first inclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate the CSCT- Computerised Speed Cognitive Test to detect early cognitive&#xD;
           impairment in this patients population compared with complete cognitive tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate precisely the dose received by the different anatomical parts of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the relation between the risk of leukoencephalopathy and the received dose to&#xD;
           the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the prognostic risk factors of leukoencephalopathy (either linked to&#xD;
           radiation treatment or to patients' clinical conditions) among patients with glioma&#xD;
           (stage 3-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To propose and test some bio-markers as predictive factors of cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the radiological changes on MRI associated with neurological abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To build a biological collection for patients treated in the Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnostic of glioma (stage 3-4) treated with radiotherapy in 2 hospitals&#xD;
      (Hospital Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris and Institut Paul Strauss, Strasbourg) will be eligible&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account that about 100 patients with glioma are treated every year in the&#xD;
      Radiation Oncologic department of the Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital and 50 in the Paul Strauss&#xD;
      Institute, the inclusion of 200 patients will take about 2 years. Considering that the&#xD;
      survival of these patients is rather short, median of 2 years for glioma 3-4, complete&#xD;
      follow-up will be available for the majority of the highest glioma stages, those who are most&#xD;
      likely to develop leukoencephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be mainly observational with a follow-up of patients based on classical&#xD;
      monitoring. The only additional information collected will come from a CSCT test, a very&#xD;
      simple and quick test (90 seconds) to identify mild cognitive dysfunction. A detailed&#xD;
      neurological assessment by a neuro-psychologist will be performed before radiotherapy, at 12&#xD;
      and 36 months after radiotherapy and in case of abnormalities of the CSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: Observational prospective cohort of 200 patients, who will be followed&#xD;
           every 2-3 months for a period of 3 years after enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients undergoing brain radiotherapy for glioma (stage 3 to 4) between&#xD;
      April 2015 and April 2017 at the Mazarin Radiotherapy Department, Pitié-Salpêtrière&#xD;
      University Hospital and in the Paul Strauss Institute, Strasbourg .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the radiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the cancer: histological type, date of diagnosis, treatment of the&#xD;
           cancer: type of surgery (total or partial resection), chemotherapy, etc…&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The radiotherapy planning record: type of radiotherapy (whole brain radiotherapy,&#xD;
           stereotactic radiotherapy), total and fractionary delivered doses,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results of the CSCT test and of the detailed neuro-psychological tests before treatment&#xD;
           Comorbidities will be collected from medical records: hypertension, diabetes, smoking&#xD;
           habits, cardiovascular diseases, etc…&#xD;
&#xD;
      After radiotherapy, every 2-3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During routine consultations with neuro-oncologists, the following information will be&#xD;
      collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination: brain features: intracranial high pressure, progressive focal&#xD;
           neurological deficit, epilepsia… and toxicity features: alert symptoms (amnesia,&#xD;
           dysexecutive disorders, gait troubles, urinary dysfunction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scan of brain: tumor features: progression, stability, response and toxicity&#xD;
           features&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results of the CSCT test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive tests results performed during a dedicated consultation with&#xD;
           neuropsychologist: before the radiotherapy and 12 and 36 months after the radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples : before the radiotherapy and 12 and 36 months after the radiotherapy In&#xD;
           case of abnormal results at 2 consecutive CSCT tests (-1.5 Standard deviation (SD) of&#xD;
           loss) with the exclusion of relapse at MRI, additional cognitive tests will be performed&#xD;
           during a dedicated consultation with neuropsychologist. At the end of the follow-up, the&#xD;
           vital status of the lost to follow-up patients will be assessed through the National&#xD;
           Register for Identification of Physical Persons (RNIPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome Cognitive dysfunction due to leukoencephalopathy defined by both abnormal&#xD;
      results at the CSCT test (confirmed by a complete cognitive test) and a MRI scan of the&#xD;
      brain(exclusion of brain tumor relapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death associated with leukoencephalopathy or cognitive dysfunction ● Data analysis: In&#xD;
           this longitudinal study, survival analysis methods will be applied. Occurrence time of&#xD;
           the leukoencephalopathy and incidence rates at different follow-up time points (month 6,&#xD;
           12, 18 and 36) will be considered. The Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate&#xD;
           the leukoencephalopathy free survival function. For potential risk factors, hazard&#xD;
           ratios associated with outcomes will be estimated using Cox models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specificity and sensitivity of the CSCT will be assessed in comparison with complete&#xD;
      cognitive test (gold standard)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will involve the Neurology department and in the Radiotherapy department in the&#xD;
      Pitié Salpétrière University Hospital and in the Paul Strauss Institute&#xD;
