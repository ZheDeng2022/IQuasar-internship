      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people regain the weight they lose through diet and exercise. This might happen because&#xD;
      the weight loss slows their metabolism. This slowing is called metabolic adaptation. It may&#xD;
      cause people to regain weight if they do not keep up high levels of exercise or major caloric&#xD;
      restrictions. Researchers want to find the long-term effects of metabolic adaptation in the&#xD;
      previous Biggest Loser study participants. They hope to learn the body s response to&#xD;
      lifestyle changes that result in weight loss. They also want to see if certain changes can&#xD;
      lead to longer-term success in maintaining weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the long-term metabolic changes caused by rapid weight loss achieved&#xD;
      through diet restriction and vigorous physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Former Biggest Loser research study participants (Protocol No. PBRC29008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a phone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 3 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will last at least 3 weeks. Participants will receive a physical activity monitor and&#xD;
      wireless scale. These will send their daily weight and activity back to NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, participants will stay at NIH for 3 days. Their metabolism will be measured&#xD;
      through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their activity monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples and daily body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical review and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting for 12 hours each night for a blood draw the following morning&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA: a low-dose x-ray of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIS: Electrodes on the hand/wrist and foot/ankle measure body water content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 will last at least 3 weeks. Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continue to monitor their daily weight and activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect urine samples and send them back to NIH&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss is accompanied by a slowing of metabolic rate. Metabolic slowing often occurs to&#xD;
      a degree greater than predicted by the amount of weight lost, a phenomenon called metabolic&#xD;
      adaptation , and is hypothesized to persist over time and promote weight regain. We&#xD;
      previously discovered large metabolic adaptations in response to the intensive lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention as part of The Biggest Loser weight loss competition. Those subjects rapidly&#xD;
      lost massive amounts of weight and their resting energy expenditure decreased by ~500 kcal/d&#xD;
      more than was expected based on their body composition at the end of the intervention. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate whether the metabolic adaptation has persisted in the&#xD;
      years following the intervention in the same subjects. Furthermore, we will measure body&#xD;
      weight and composition in these subjects and investigate the correlates of weight regain.&#xD;

        This natural history study includes enrollment of 16 adult subjects who previously&#xD;
        participated in the Biggest Loser intervention and participated in a study of body&#xD;
        composition and metabolic changes [1]. Several years following weight loss intervention,&#xD;
        these subjects may have experienced weight regain and either persistence or remission of&#xD;
        the previously observed metabolic adaptation. The present study was designed to investigate&#xD;
        the persistence of metabolic adaptation and explore whether the degree of metabolic&#xD;
        adaptation during the weight loss intervention was correlated with body weight and body fat&#xD;
        regain.&#xD;

             Biomedical Research Center protocol no. PBRC29008).&#xD;
