    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV consists of 18 items and is designed to reflect the participant's current ADHD symptomatology; the severity, frequency, and impairment are measured for each of the items. The 18 items are grouped into 2 subscales of 9 symptoms each: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and Inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17). Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms), with the total score for the rating scale ranging from 0 to 54. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

             the date of informed consent throughout the study period and for the defined follow-up&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         35. If hormonal contraceptives were used, they were to be administered according to the&#xD;
             package insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
         36. Females of childbearing potential who were not currently sexually active agreed to use&#xD;
             acceptable contraception, as defined above, if they became sexually active during&#xD;
             their study participation and for the defined follow-up time period.&#xD;

        <description>The ADHD-RS-IV consists of 18 items and is designed to reflect the participant's current ADHD symptomatology; the severity, frequency, and impairment are measured for each of the items. The 18 items are grouped into 2 subscales of 9 symptoms each: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and Inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17). Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms), with the total score for the rating scale ranging from 0 to 54. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ADHD-RS-IV Score Total Score After 1 and 2 Weeks of Double-blind Treatment for Subgroup of Participants With Target CTN SR Dose of 400 mg/Day</title>
        <description>The ADHD-RS-IV consists of 18 items and is designed to reflect the participant's current ADHD symptomatology; the severity, frequency, and impairment are measured for each of the items. The 18 items are grouped into 2 subscales of 9 symptoms each: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and Inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17). Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms), with the total score for the rating scale ranging from 0 to 54. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ADHD-RS-IV Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Subscale Score of Double-blind Treatment</title>
        <description>The ADHD-RS-IV consists of 18 items and is designed to reflect the participant's current ADHD symptomatology; the severity, frequency, and impairment are measured for each of the items. The 18 items are grouped into 2 subscales of 9 symptoms each: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and Inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17). Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms), with the total score for the rating scale ranging from 0 to 54. The possible sub-scale score range is from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>PERMP Score for Subgroup of Participants With Target CTN SR Dose of 400 mg/Day</title>
        <description>The PERMP is a skill-adjusted math test consisting of 400 problems. The PERMP total score is the sum of the number of math problems attempted plus the number of math problems answered correctly in a 10-minute session. The score range of number of math problems attempted and number of math problems answered correctly is 0-400 and the total score range from 0-800. The higher scores indicate better performance. Higher scores mean higher performance and less severe ADHD symptoms.</description>

        <description>The CGI-I permits a global evaluation of the participant's improvement over time. The CGI-I is a 8-point scale ranging from 0 to 7 where 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse and 7=very much worse. The CGI-I is completed by the clinician and assesses the participant's improvement relative to the symptoms at Baseline.</description>
