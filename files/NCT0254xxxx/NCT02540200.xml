      Hip pain in young patients is difficult to diagnose and treat. However, with advanced imaging&#xD;
      techniques and surgical method, the investigators are able to identify hip cartilage lesions&#xD;
      as a cause for the hip pain. MR (magnetic resonance) arthrography is the best imaging&#xD;
      modality to diagnose chondral lesions of the hip, but it occasionally miss the pathology,&#xD;
      thus necessitating a more accurate and invasive means of diagnosis. Consequently, hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy is increasingly used for both diagnosis and treatment for hip cartilage&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microfracture is a means of stimulating bone marrow, and is a standard treatment for small&#xD;
      chondral lesions. This procedure has shown to result in excellent functional and anatomical&#xD;
      outcomes. Microfracture is now recognized as a standard treatment for cartilage lesions in&#xD;
      the knee, and recently the indications of this technique extended to hip pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BST-CarGel device (Piramal Life Sciences, Bio-Orthopaedic Division) is based on the&#xD;
      patented technology for cartilage repair. BST-Gel comprised of the buffer&#xD;
      beta-glycerophosphate and chitosan, which is a well-studied natural material that is&#xD;
      biocompatible and appropriate for its use as a scaffold to assist in cartilage repair.&#xD;
      BST-Gel is mixed with the patient's whole blood and delivered to a surgically prepared&#xD;
      cartilage lesion in conjunction with bone marrow stimulation. The BST-CarGel/blood mixture&#xD;
      solidifies in the cartilage lesion and provides a three-dimensional scaffold for the repair&#xD;
      process. This product has shown to result in superior chondral lesion repair when compared to&#xD;
      the bone marrow stimulation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will collect data through standard of care practice when BST-CarGel in&#xD;
      conjunction with a bone marrow stimulation technique is used for the treatment of focal&#xD;
      cartilage lesions in the hip. In addition, these patients in the study group will be compared&#xD;
      with the group o patients who undergo the bone marrow stimulation technique alone. The&#xD;
      efficacy of BST-CarGel in conjunction with microfracture for cartilage lesions in the knee&#xD;
      has been shown in previous studies. Additional research is required to expand knowledge and&#xD;
      develop treatment guidelines for the treatment of the cartilage lesions in the hip using&#xD;
      BST-CarGel. As the BST-CarGel improves the results of the bone marrow stimulation techniques&#xD;
      without increasing the risks of the procedure, this device can be very beneficial in the case&#xD;
      of cartilage lesions in the hip.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the hip is a disabling condition which leads to tremendous burdens to the&#xD;
      patients and the society. It is difficult to pinpoint the cause of osteoarthritis in most&#xD;
      cases but it is thought to be multifactorial, with genetic, biomechanical, structural and&#xD;
      morphological factors as main contributors. Early identification and intervention of the&#xD;
      osteoarthritic hip had been challenging due to the lack of accurate diagnostic tools and&#xD;
      effective methods of intervention. However, recent advancements of imaging modalities such as&#xD;
      MR arthrography and increased use of arthroscopy have resulted in early identification of&#xD;
      acetabular labral pathology which may contribute to the development of osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a condition where abnormally shaped hip causes&#xD;
      impingement symptoms with the functional range of the hip, leading to labral pathology.&#xD;
      Consequently, FAI is a significant contributor to the development of hip osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      However, diagnosis of FAI can often be challenging as some patients present with impingement&#xD;
      symptoms without clear radiographic signs. Hip arthroscopy, therefore, remains the gold&#xD;
      standard for diagnosing chondral lesions as it allows direct visualization. Consequently,&#xD;
      young patients with hip pain without radiographic evidence would often undergo arthroscopy of&#xD;
      the hip, which can not only identify the underlying pathology but also provide tools to treat&#xD;
      the problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microfracture is a standard treatment for small chondral defects with excellent results and&#xD;
      low complication rates. This procedure leads to attraction of undifferentiated stem cells&#xD;
      into the chondral defects. These cells are stabilized by a marrow clot and differentiate into&#xD;
      stable fibrocartilaginous tissue. This technique has been studied much more extensively in&#xD;
      the knee than in the hip, with excellent short-term and long-term results. Microfracture has&#xD;
      shown to result in better functional outcomes compared to the autologous chondrocyte&#xD;
      implantation, with an equivalent histological outcome. Success in this technique in the knee&#xD;
      led to application of the same technique in the hip joint with excellent results. Philippon&#xD;
      and the colleagues followed nine patients with full-thickness chondral defects who underwent&#xD;
      microfracture via hip arthroscopy. Eight patients had 95% to 100% coverage of the chondral&#xD;
      defects as seen in second look revision hip arthroscopy. In addition, the study by&#xD;
      Karthikeyan and the colleagues showed that 19 out of 20 patients had the average fill of 96%&#xD;
      when the chondral defects were treated with microfracture. Several studies have shown that&#xD;
      this anatomic restoration translates into functional improvements as well. McDonald and the&#xD;
      colleagues showed that professional hockey players who underwent microfracture for&#xD;
      Outerbridge grade IV chondral lesions were able to return to competitive games without a&#xD;
      statistically significant decrease in performance when compared to the matched control&#xD;
      cohort. In addition, the study by Domb and the colleagues shows significant improvements in&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes at two year follow-ups for the patients who underwent arthroscopic&#xD;
      hip surgery with a microfracture procedure. This successful transition has set the precedent&#xD;
      for adapting the effective techniques and tools used in the knee to treat hip pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the bone marrow stimulating technique alone was not the perfect solution for the&#xD;
      focal chondral defects, and various techniques and devices have been utilized to improve the&#xD;
      efficacy of the current bone marrow stimulating technique. Recently, gel-forming biopolymer&#xD;
      has gained interests as a scaffolding material that can be injected into the site of&#xD;
      microfracture to stabilize the clot and facilitate the cartilage repair. Chitosan is a&#xD;
      natural polysaccharide composed of D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues, which&#xD;
      is biocompatible and biodegradable. It is also pH-dependent where it remains dissolved in&#xD;
      solution up to a pH of 6.2, and forms a hydrated gel-like precipitate once pH exceeds 6.2.&#xD;
      Chitosan also remains liquid in room temperature but solidifies to a gel-like state at body&#xD;
      temperature, which makes it an excellent injectable material. It has been studied extensively&#xD;
      as an effective scaffolding biomaterial with low toxicity and great adhesiveness to tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BST-CarGel (Piramal Life Sciences, Bio-Orthopaedic Division) is an injectable chitosan-based&#xD;
      medical device which is designed to be used in conjunction with the bone marrow stimulation&#xD;
      technique. It is comprised of the buffer β-glycerophosphate and chitosan, which is in a&#xD;
      liquid state in room temperature. It is missed with the patients' untreated whole blood, and&#xD;
      delivered to a surgically prepared cartilage lesion where microfracture is already performed.&#xD;
      The BST-CarGel and blood mixture then solidifies in the cartilage defect forming a&#xD;
      three-dimensional scaffold for the repair process by stabilizing the clot in the cartilage&#xD;
      lesion via adhesion and inhibition of clot retraction. The resulting gel implant facilitates&#xD;
      the body's own healing response, potentially by enhancing the residency of wound healing&#xD;
      factors found in the blood along with bone marrow-derived cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of BST-CarGel in treating chondral lesions in femoral condyles have&#xD;
      been shown in a well-designed randomized, controlled trial by Stanish and the colleagues. In&#xD;
      this study, BST-CarGel treatment in conjunction with the conventional bone marrow stimulation&#xD;
      technique was superior to the microfracture alone in terms of lesion filling at 12 months&#xD;
      period, with equivalent clinical benefits and safety profiles. The superiority in cartilage&#xD;
      repair may imply improved long-term clinical outcomes although further studies are required&#xD;
      to establish this correlation. BST-CarGel has received the European CE (Conformité&#xD;
      Européenne) mark approval for the extended indication where it can be used in all synovial&#xD;
      joints in Europe, although the clinical research on other joints is limited. BST-CarGel&#xD;
      optimizes the result of bone marrow stimulation, as demonstrated by previous clinical&#xD;
      results, without increasing the inherent risks for this type of procedures. Therefore,&#xD;
      BST-CarGel could be very beneficial in the case of chondral lesions in the hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the purpose of the treatment of the chondral lesions is not only the anatomic&#xD;
      restoration of the defect but mainly the improvement of the clinical symptoms. The&#xD;
      conventional bone marrow stimulation technique via microfracture has shown to improve the&#xD;
      patients' functional outcomes. The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a simple and valid tool&#xD;
      that is widely used to evaluate the patients' pain. In addition, there are several&#xD;
      questionnaires that are specifically designed for hip pain. Non-arthritic hip score (NAHS)&#xD;
      has been proven to be a valid tool without floor or ceiling effect in measuring the&#xD;
      disability from non-arthritic hip pathology. International hip outcome score (iHOT) is a&#xD;
      valid tool in measuring the patient-reported quality of life score. The original&#xD;
      questionnaires which include 33 items are shown to be valid and reliable.&#xD;
