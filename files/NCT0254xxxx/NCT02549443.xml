      This study evaluates whether providing a nutritional intervention in the form of insulin,&#xD;
      sugar and protein during and after open-heart surgery will increase the body's protein stores&#xD;
      and maintain a normal level of blood sugar. The primary outcome will be Whole body protein&#xD;
      balance which will be assessed by isotope tracer kinetics. Protein balance will be calculated&#xD;
      as protein synthesis minus protein breakdown with positive values indicating anabolism and&#xD;
      negative values catabolism. The preoperative measurements will be performed on the morning&#xD;
      before the operation. Postoperative studies will be conducted two hours after surgery in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit. Patients will be followed for 12 hours after surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Open heart surgery is associated with a catabolic response which is characterized by&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and whole body protein loss. Results of a previous study demonstrated that a&#xD;
      reduction in whole-body protein breakdown and synthesis in patients receiving insulin and&#xD;
      isocaloric amounts of glucose (hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp, HNC) after coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Because protein oxidation did not change and the&#xD;
      circulating concentrations of amino acids decreased (hypoaminoacidemia) in the presence of&#xD;
      insulin therapy whole-body protein balance remained negative, ie patients were still&#xD;
      catabolic. The investigators hypothesize that this lack of anabolic effect is due to the&#xD;
      absence of anabolic substrate supply (amino acids). The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that insulin administered as part of a hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic&#xD;
      clamp during and immediately after CABG:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will induce whole-body positive protein balance if supplemented with intravenous amino&#xD;
           acids (AA) in amounts to preserve normal AA plasma concentrations (isoaminoacidemia),&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will further enhance whole-body protein balance if combined with the infusion of AA in&#xD;
           amounts to increase AA plasma concentrations to supra-normal levels (hyperaminoacidemia)&#xD;
           The primary outcome, whole body protein balance, will be measured 2 hours after surgery&#xD;
           in the intensive care unit. Secondary objectives include (1) measure hepatic albumin&#xD;
           synthesis and (2) assess changes in the metabolic-endocrine milieu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 30 patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Consenting patients will be divided randomly into 3 groups. Patients in&#xD;
      group 1 will receive HNC from the beginning of surgery until the end of the eight-hour study&#xD;
      period after surgery. No amino acids will be given. Patients in group 2 will receive HNC and&#xD;
      AA (Travasol Baxter, Deerfield IL) during and after surgery in an amount equivalent to 20% of&#xD;
      the patient's energy expenditure (EE) as measured before surgery to maintain&#xD;
      isoaminoacidemia. Patients in group 3 will receive HNC and Travasol iduring and after surgery&#xD;
      in an amount equivalent to 35% of the patient's EE to promote hyperaminoacidemia. HNC will&#xD;
      consist of an insulin infusion of 5 mU/kg/min coupled with a variable infusion of glucose&#xD;
      (dextrose 20%) to maintain normoglycemia (4-6 mmol/L). Whole body protein balance will be&#xD;
      assessed by L-[1-13C]leucine tracer kinetics. Protein balance will be calculated as protein&#xD;
      synthesis minus leucine rate of appearance (Ra) with positive values indicating anabolism and&#xD;
      negative values catabolism. Whole body glucose metabolism will be assessed by stable isotope&#xD;
      tracers [6,6-2H2]glucose. Hepatic albumin synthesis will be determined by using primed&#xD;
      continuous infusion of L-[2H5]phenylalanine. The preoperative measurements will be performed&#xD;
      on the morning before the operation. Postoperative studies will be conducted 2 hours after&#xD;
      surgery in the intensive care unit. Patients will be followed for 12 hours after surgery.&#xD;
      Whole body leucine kinetics between the two groups will be analyzed using ANOVA for repeated&#xD;
      measurements. Statistical significance will be set as P&lt;0.05. All p-values will be presented&#xD;
      are 2-tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracer kinetics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body leucine and glucose metabolism measurements were made under postabsorptive&#xD;
      conditions on the day before surgery and, postoperatively, in the intensive care unit. Plasma&#xD;
      kinetics of glucose and leucine, i.e. the glucose and leucine rate of appearance (Ra),&#xD;
      leucine oxidation and non-oxidative leucine disposal, were determined by a primed constant&#xD;
      infusion of tracer quantities of L-[1-13C]leucine and [6,6-2H2]glucose. Blood and expired air&#xD;
      samples were collected, before the infusion, to analyze baseline enrichments. Priming doses&#xD;
      of NaH13CO3 (1 µmol/kg, po), L-[1-13C]leucine (4 µmol/kg, iv) and [6,6-2H2]glucose (22&#xD;
      µmol/kg, iv), were administered followed by the infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine (0.06&#xD;
      µmol.kg-1.min-1) and [6,6-2H2]glucose (0.44 µmol.kg-1.min-1). For the determination of 13CO2&#xD;
      isotope enrichments four expired breath samples were taken after 150, 160, 170 and 180&#xD;
      minutes of isotope infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body leucine and glucose kinetics were calculated by the conventional isotope dilution&#xD;
      technique using a two-pool random model during steady state conditions. At isotopic steady&#xD;
      state the Ra of unlabeled substrate in plasma is derived from the plasma isotope enrichment,&#xD;
      expressed as MPE, according to the following equation: Ra = I.(MPEinf/MPEpl - 1), where I is&#xD;
      the infusion rate of the tracer, MPEinf is the enrichment of the tracer in the infusate and&#xD;
      MPEpl is the tracer enrichment in plasma. The final MPE values represent the mean of all the&#xD;
      MPE measurements during each isotopic plateau. Isotopic steady state conditions were regarded&#xD;
      as valid when the CV of the MPE values at isotopic plateau was &lt;5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At isotopic steady state leucine flux (Q) is quantified by the following formula: Q = S+O =&#xD;
      B+I, where S is the rate of synthesis of protein from leucine, O is the rate of oxidation, B&#xD;
      is protein breakdown and I is the dietary intake. Furthermore Q is equal to Ra (Ra = B+I) and&#xD;
      the rate of disappearance (Rd; Rd = S+O). When tracer studies are done in fasting states,&#xD;
      leucine flux equals B. The rate of protein synthesis is calculated by subtracting leucine&#xD;
      oxidation from leucine flux (S = Q-O). Protein balance is calculated as protein synthesis&#xD;
      minus leucine Ra with positive values indicating anabolism and negative values catabolism.&#xD;
      Plasma [1-13C]α-KIC is used to calculate the flux and oxidation of leucine. The α-KIC is&#xD;
      formed intracellularly from leucine and is released into the systemic circulation. It&#xD;
      reflects the intracellular precursor pool enrichment more accurately than plasma leucine&#xD;
      itself.&#xD;
