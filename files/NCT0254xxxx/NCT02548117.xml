  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypogonadism (low testosterone) is becoming an increasingly recognized problem that affects&#xD;
      numerous men in the United States. Symptoms may be always feeling tired, lower sex drive, and&#xD;
      loss of muscle mass. Treatment typically involves testosterone in either injections or a&#xD;
      topical gel form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, administration of testosterone is not without side effects of its own. Testosterone&#xD;
      supplementation therapy is known to cause a variety of side effects including high blood&#xD;
      pressure and high lipids (fats) and an increased proportion of red blood cells. Side effects&#xD;
      of increased red blood cells can include an increased risk of developing a blood clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in the red blood cells is related to dihydrotestosterone (DHT - a male sex&#xD;
      hormone) activity. It is normal for the testosterone to become DHT. DHT has various effects&#xD;
      on the body including growth of the prostate gland, baldness, and others and DHT levels have&#xD;
      been linked to elevated red blood cell counts in men on testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finasteride is an FDA approved medication used in the treatment of benign prostatic&#xD;
      hypertrophy (BPH) in men with enlarged prostate to improve symptoms and to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      the need for surgery. Finasteride may prevent elevations in or reduce elevated red blood cell&#xD;
      levels in men on testosterone.&#xD;

      Hypogonadism is becoming an increasingly recognized clinical syndrome affecting millions of&#xD;
      men in the United States and globally, and is characterized by symptoms including chronic&#xD;
      fatigue, decreased libido and muscle mass, and low serum testosterone level. Treatment of&#xD;
      hypogonadism in men typically involves treatment with exogenous testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, exogenous testosterone therapy is not without risks, and can cause numerous side&#xD;
      effects including high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, and erythrocytosis, or elevated&#xD;
      hematocrit. Adverse effects of erythrocytosis can include an increased risk of developing&#xD;
      thromboembolism, and treatment of erythrocytosis involves therapeutic phlebotomy and&#xD;
      testosterone dose adjustment, which can decrease the symptomatic benefits of testosterone&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aghazadeh et al.found that erythrocytosis occurring during testosterone therapy may be&#xD;
      related to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. As part of normal physiology, testosterone is&#xD;
      converted to DHT via 5-alpha reductase (5AR). DHT is associated with various effects on the&#xD;
      body, including stimulation of prostate growth, male pattern baldness, and others. Currently,&#xD;
      finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI), is available as an FDA-approved drug used&#xD;
      to treat DHT-related prostate growth and to prevent DHT-related baldness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the positive association between DHT and the increased hematocrit seen in men being&#xD;
      treated for hypogonadism with exogenous testosterone, finasteride's effects in preventing the&#xD;
      synthesis of DHT may improve or even prevent erythrocytosis in men on testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial of patients on injectable&#xD;
      testosterone therapy. Subjects will be evenly distributed between the control and treatment&#xD;
      groups. The treatment groups will receive finasteride and the control groups will not. All&#xD;
      subjects will then be followed with blood tests to determine if there are any changes in&#xD;
      their hematocrit, testosterone, DHT, and other blood test values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim data analysis will be performed after approximately 150 men (75 treatment and 75&#xD;
      control) are accrued into the study and followed for at least 1 year. Rates of hematocrit&#xD;
      elevation and erythrocytosis will be evaluated in finasteride treated and untreated men to&#xD;
      determine whether finasteride is having an impact on erythrocytosis rates and whether any&#xD;
      unanticipated adverse effects are occurring. Secondary outcomes, including effects on&#xD;
      erythropoietin and hepcidin levels, will also be evaluated. Study accrual will continue if&#xD;
      there is evidence that finasteride may decrease the incidence of erythrocytosis. The study&#xD;
      will be stopped if unacceptable adverse events are identified or if there is no evidence&#xD;
      suggesting that finasteride mitigates the risk of erythrocytosis.&#xD;
