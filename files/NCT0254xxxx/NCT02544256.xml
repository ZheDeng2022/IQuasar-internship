  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether mild hypothermia causes reduction of&#xD;
      vasoconstriction in microcirculation after clipping of aneurysms, and affects the blood flow&#xD;
      in small diameter arteries at operating site (ischemia-hyperemia) and occurrence of&#xD;
      vasospasms during the period of 14 postoperative days measured by transcranial Doppler.&#xD;

      Methods: All the patients meeting the study criteria will be randomized into two groups.&#xD;
      Normothermia (NT) group : during the whole period of surgery the body temperature will be&#xD;
      maintained in the range 35.8° C - 36.8° C. Hypothermia (HT) group: After induction to general&#xD;
      anaesthesia the patients will be cooled to body temperature 33.8° C - 34.8° and this&#xD;
      temperature maintained up to the end of microcirculation measurement after aneurysm clipping.&#xD;
      Warming up of the patients will start immediately afterwards. The target temperature at the&#xD;
      time of extubation will be over 36° C in both groups (one of the extubation criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific management: No pharmacological sedation (premedication) will be given to the&#xD;
      patients. Cooling/warming mattress/blanket (PlastiPad® Blanketrol® III Cincinnati Sub-Zero,&#xD;
      USA) will be placed on the operating table. Induction to general anesthesia will be with&#xD;
      propofol 2 mg/kg/b.w i.v. (with possible adjustment according to age and/or physical status&#xD;
      of the patient) and atracurium 0,5 mg/kg/b.w. i.v. After orotracheal intubation, the&#xD;
      esophageal temperature probe will be inserted (depth of insertion 25 cm from the nostril).&#xD;
      Afterwards, the envelope with randomization will be opened by the anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In HT group, the targeted body temperature will be set to 33° C and a bolus of saline 250 ml&#xD;
      cooled to 5° C will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In NT group, the targeted body temperature will be set to 36° C and a bolus of saline 250 ml&#xD;
      warmed to 37° C using infusion heater will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard preparation for the surgery will continue afterwards (insertion of central venous&#xD;
      catheter, arterial catheter, urinary catheter). After finishing the preparation (coming of&#xD;
      the surgeon), the infusion of mannitol 15% at the dose 0,5 g/kg i.v. is started and set for&#xD;
      the duration of 40 minutes. Monitoring: basic monitoring (SpO2, ECG, end-tidal carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (EtCO2), NIBP) together with extended monitoring (invasive blood pressure, response&#xD;
      entropy/state entropy (RE/SE), neuromuscular transmission module (NMT), surgical&#xD;
      plethysmography index (SPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia management: Desflurane anesthesia in O2/air mixture with concentration of oxygen&#xD;
      (FiO2) 0.45 will be used with targeted concentrations of desflurane according to the age&#xD;
      groups initially (to achieve end-tidal concentration of desflurane 6 V%, 5.5 V%, 5 V%, 4.5&#xD;
      V%, and 4 V% in age groups 18 - 30, 30 - 40, 40 - 55, 55 - 65, and over 65 years&#xD;
      respectively), further adjustment will be done to keep target RE/SE 40-50 in the individual&#xD;
      patient. Analgesia will be provided by bolus i.v. administration of remifentanil 80 ug before&#xD;
      induction, followed by continuous administration 0.25 ug/kg/min initially with further&#xD;
      stepwise adjustment according to SPI (3-5 ml/hour steps). Target analgesia according to SPI&#xD;
      is defined as the initial figure of SPI recorded 5 minutes after induction plus 10 points.&#xD;
      Figures of SPI exceeding for 1 minute the target figure indicate the need of increasing the&#xD;
      rate of remifentanil infusion. Atracurium boluses will be used for muscle relaxation, NMT&#xD;
      monitoring by train of four (TOF) will be done in 5 minute intervals, TOF count over 1&#xD;
      indicating need of further atracurium bolus. Starting from dura mater suture, no further&#xD;
      boluses of atracurium will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic stability: Systolic and mean arterial pressures are maintained in the range of ±&#xD;
      15% of usually measured BP for individual patient. Decrease of BP bellow this figure in the&#xD;
      duration of at least 5 minutes is indication for continuous administration of noradrenaline.&#xD;
      Nimodipine is administered continuously during the whole procedure, infusion rate is set at&#xD;
      the ICU, no adjustments are indicated at the OR. Volume therapy is provided by continuous&#xD;
      balanced isotonic crystalloid infusion 5 ml/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculation measurement: After craniotomy, microcirculation will be measured by SDF&#xD;
      probe at the labelled sites of the brain (edge of craniotomy and at the distance of 2 cm from&#xD;
      aneurysm). After aneurysm clipping, the measurement will be repeated at the same sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finishing anaesthesia: At the beginning of skin suture, the remifentanil infusion is stopped.&#xD;
      After finishing the skin suture, the administration of desflurane is stopped and end-tidal&#xD;
      control flush out of desflurane is activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extubation criteria: consciousness Glasgow coma scale (E-2-3/V-1-3/M-6), normotension&#xD;
      including noradrenaline administration in stable continuous dose, normocapnia, spontaneous&#xD;
      ventilation with respiratory rate (RR) over 10/minute, tidal volume (TV) 4-6 ml/kg, preserved&#xD;
      coughing reflex, SpO2 over 95% without/with O2 administration, normothermia over 36° C, train&#xD;
      of four ratio over 92%.&#xD;
