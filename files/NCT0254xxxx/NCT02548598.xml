  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, non-interventional study, consisting of three study arms, (1) Full&#xD;
      Characterization (AIMS-Full), (2) Surgery Arm (AIMS-OR), and (3) Mucus Collection (AIMS-M).&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited and enrolled in either AIMS-Full or AIMS-OR (based on&#xD;
      participant availability). Participants who complete the initial characterization study&#xD;
      (either AIMS-Full or AIMS-OR), may also go on to participate in the AIMS-M arm, which focuses&#xD;
      mainly on sample collection. Participants who choose not to participate in either&#xD;
      characterization arm are able to enroll directly into AIMS-M for sample collection only.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional and non-interventional study to investigate mechanisms of disease&#xD;
      in patients with asthma who have concomitant chronic sinusitis and/or nasal polyps (upper&#xD;
      airway disease). Approximately 160 participants will be enrolled. Patients who are scheduled&#xD;
      to undergo inpatient or outpatient endoscopic sinus surgery at the University of California&#xD;
      San Francisco for clinical management of their upper airway disease will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. Leftover tissues or mucus from the surgery will be collected and processed for&#xD;
      research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of three study arms, (1) Full Characterization (AIMS-Full), (2) Surgery&#xD;
      (AIMS-OR), and (3) Mucus Collection (AIMS-M). Participants will be recruited and enrolled in&#xD;
      either AIMS-Full or AIMS-OR (based on participant availability). Participants who complete&#xD;
      the initial characterization study (either AIMS-Full or AIMS-OR), may also go on to&#xD;
      participate in the AIMS-M arm, which focuses mainly on sample collection. Participants who&#xD;
      choose not to participate in either characterization arm are able to enroll directly into&#xD;
      AIMS-M for sample collection only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable patients, undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery, will be identified and recruited by&#xD;
      the study team. Patients will first be asked to participate in the AIMS-Full&#xD;
      characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are unable or unwilling to participate in AIMS-Full, they will have the option to&#xD;
      take part in the AIMS-OR or AIMS-M arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS-OR will consist of the endoscopic sinus surgery with an optional pre-procedure visit&#xD;
      during which consent and blood specimens will be obtained and questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered. If the optional pre-procedure visit is not done, consent will be obtained at&#xD;
      the surgery visit, and blood will not be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS-M will consist of up to 5 visits. Patients seen in the UCSF Sinus Center clinic may have&#xD;
      clearance of sinus mucus as part of routine clinical care; AIMS-M visits will collect these&#xD;
      mucus samples that would otherwise be discarded. Sinus mucus obtained at the clinic visit may&#xD;
      be used for research purposes if patients have given consent to participate in the AIMS-M arm&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in all three study arms will complete study-specific questionnaires on asthma&#xD;
      and allergy history and impairment and provide samples of nasal secretions that are collected&#xD;
      as part of routine clinical care and would otherwise be discarded. Those participating in&#xD;
      either characterization arm (AIMS-Full or AIMS-OR) will also provide nasal tissues (part of&#xD;
      routine surgical procedure); airway epithelial brushings and blood collection (for study&#xD;
      purposes only). Those participating in AIMS-Full will also participate in the following study&#xD;
      procedures: medical history and physical exam (including vital signs and body&#xD;
      anthropometrics), spirometry, methacholine challenge or airway reversibility testing, exhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide, questionnaires (asthma, sinusitis, metabolic health), urine collection, and&#xD;
      sputum induction. A participant's time commitment to the study will vary depending on which&#xD;
      arm the participant is enrolled.&#xD;

    <description>This study enrolls participants with and without asthma with concomitant chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Investigators aim to study severity of CRS among the two groups following endoscopic sinus surgery. Severity of CRS will be judged using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22, a paper-based, validated questionnaire.</description>
