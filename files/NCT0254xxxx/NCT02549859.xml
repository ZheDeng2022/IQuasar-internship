  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our recent study (Xie et al, Neurology 2015; 84: 415-420) found that bilateral STN DBS of&#xD;
      60Hz, compared to the traditional 130Hz, decreased the aspiration frequency and swallowing&#xD;
      difficulty, freezing of gait (FOG), and other axial symptoms and parkinsonism in Parkinson&#xD;
      patients with FOG refractory to 130Hz and medications. The benefit of 60Hz stimulation&#xD;
      persisted during the 6-week study period, but with worsening tremor in one patient. However,&#xD;
      it remains unknown whether the benefit of 60Hz would persist on prolonged stimulation period,&#xD;
      and whether there is carry-over effect across different conditions. Hence, the investigators&#xD;
      would like to test the hypothesis that the 60Hz stimulation, compared to 130Hz might have&#xD;
      persistent benefit over an extended period in reducing the swallowing dysfunction, FOG, and&#xD;
      other axial symptoms in these PD patients even after correcting the potential carry-over&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 14 Parkinson patients with bilateral STN DBS and refractory FOG&#xD;
      to 130Hz stimulation and dopaminergic medications for two visits of at least 6-month apart.&#xD;
      The 6 patients remaining on 60Hz stimulation after our previous study consisting of 7&#xD;
      patients will be assessed once again as visit-2 after previous visit-1 of their last study.&#xD;
      We anticipate to have 20 patents complete for visit-1 and at least 18 patients complete for&#xD;
      visit-2 in this randomized double-blind prospective crossover study with their usual&#xD;
      medication &quot;on&quot; state, with 6-7 patients on each starting condition (60Hz vs 130Hz vs DBS&#xD;
      off). Swallowing function on modified barium swallowing test and swallowing questionnaire,&#xD;
      FOG in stand-walk-sit test and questionnaire, and other axial and motor function on UPDRS-III&#xD;
      will be assessed under each DBS condition. Changes in measurements between 60Hz and 130Hz at&#xD;
      each visit and under 60Hz between two visits will be analyzed, with swallowing function and&#xD;
      FOG as primary, and the rest as secondary outcomes, correcting for potential carryover&#xD;
      effect. Changes between other DBS conditions might also be explored in this 2-year study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would be the first study on the long-term effect of 60Hz stimulation on dysphagia, FOG&#xD;
      and other axial and motor symptoms in Parkinson patients with bilateral STN DBS and FOG&#xD;
      refractory to 130Hz stimulation and dopaminergic medications, which will have significant&#xD;
      impact on the treatment of difficult axial symptoms of high morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

    <measure>Frequency of Aspiration Events on Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study at Visit 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following treatment for at least 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A speech pathologist used the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) to rate swallows captured by a radiologist during VFSS recording. PAS is an 8-point interval scale: a score of 0 indicates no penetration or aspiration &amp; a score of 6-8 indicates aspiration of increasing severity. For the purpose of this study, aspiration was dichotomized to &quot;0&quot; if PAS score was under 6 or &quot;1&quot; if PAS score was between 6-8. Frequency of aspiration events was calculated by adding number of aspiration events in VFSS under various liquid &amp; food textures. The maximum aspiration frequency was 12 if aspiration occurred on every texture after 2 trials. Lower aspiration frequency means better swallowing function.</description>

        <title>Frequency of Aspiration Events on Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study at Visit 1</title>
        <description>A speech pathologist used the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) to rate swallows captured by a radiologist during VFSS recording. PAS is an 8-point interval scale: a score of 0 indicates no penetration or aspiration &amp; a score of 6-8 indicates aspiration of increasing severity. For the purpose of this study, aspiration was dichotomized to &quot;0&quot; if PAS score was under 6 or &quot;1&quot; if PAS score was between 6-8. Frequency of aspiration events was calculated by adding number of aspiration events in VFSS under various liquid &amp; food textures. The maximum aspiration frequency was 12 if aspiration occurred on every texture after 2 trials. Lower aspiration frequency means better swallowing function.</description>

        <title>Frequency of Aspiration Events on Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study at Visit 2</title>
        <description>A speech pathologist used the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) to rate swallows captured by a radiologist during VFSS recording. PAS is an 8-point interval scale: a score of 0 indicates no penetration or aspiration &amp; a score of 6-8 indicates aspiration of increasing severity. For the purpose of this study, aspiration was dichotomized to &quot;0&quot; if PAS score was under 6 or &quot;1&quot; if PAS score was between 6-8. Frequency of aspiration events was calculated by adding number of aspiration events in VFSS under various liquid &amp; food textures. The maximum aspiration frequency was 12 if aspiration occurred on every texture after 2 trials. Lower aspiration frequency means better swallowing function.</description>

          <description>The bradykinesia subscore of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS-III) contains 11 items. Each item has 5-points ranging from 0 (absence of symptoms) to 4 (severe). Total score ranges from 0-44, with higher scores corresponding to more severe bradykinesia. Specifically, bradykinesia symptoms include: finger tapping right hand, finger tapping left hand, hand movements right hand, hand movements left hand, pronation-supination movements right hand, pronation- supination movements left hand, toe tapping right foot, toe tapping left foot, leg agility right leg, leg agility left leg, global spontaneity of movement.</description>

          <description>The bradykinesia subscore of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS-III) contains 11 items. Each item has 5-points ranging from 0 (absence of symptoms) to 4 (severe). Total score ranges from 0-44, with higher scores corresponding to more severe bradykinesia. Specifically, bradykinesia symptoms include: finger tapping right hand, finger tapping left hand, hand movements right hand, hand movements left hand, pronation-supination movements right hand, pronation- supination movements left hand, toe tapping right foot, toe tapping left foot, leg agility right leg, leg agility left leg, global spontaneity of movement.</description>
