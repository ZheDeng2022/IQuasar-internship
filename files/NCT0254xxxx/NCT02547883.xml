  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients ≥ 75 years, there is no evidence that statins in primary prevention are&#xD;
      associated with a decreased mortality and recent US recommendations consider statins in&#xD;
      people only between 40 and 75 years. Moreover, statins are associated with numerous side&#xD;
      effects impacting quality of life of those people and represent a high cost for the French&#xD;
      healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate cost/effectiveness ratio, in real life, of statin&#xD;
      cessation in people ≥ 75 years treated in primary prevention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Statins in primary prevention are associated with a 1.2% decreased absolute risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in large randomized studies. Anyway, in patients ≥ 75 years, the impact&#xD;
      of statins on mortality have not been demonstrated and large observational studies have shown&#xD;
      an increased risk of mortality in people with low cholesterol. Moreover, statins are&#xD;
      associated with numerous side effects, particularly in the elderly including myalgia and&#xD;
      myositis, diabetes, cognitive disorders, fatigue and loss of energy and of physical&#xD;
      activities, treatment interactions. At last, the cost of statins for the French national&#xD;
      health insurance is 800 million euros per year (including around 200 million euros for people&#xD;
      ≥ 75 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit/risk ratio of statins is not established in primary prevention in people ≥ 75&#xD;
      years, leading to numerous and discordant expert advices since no specific randomized trial&#xD;
      have been conducted in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in patients ≥ 75 years treated with statins in primary prevention, the studied strategy&#xD;
      will be to stop statin therapy. The comparison strategy will be represented by the group of&#xD;
      patient who will continue their statin at the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up every three months, according to general recommendations, during&#xD;
      36 months. Clinical events will be prospectively registered&#xD;
