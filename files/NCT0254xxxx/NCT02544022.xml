      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) who have plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) can have pain&#xD;
      that affects their daily lives. This study aims to improve questionnaires that measure their&#xD;
      pain, daily living, and physical functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine and improve questionnaires about daily living for people with NF1 and PNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 5 and older with NF1 and a PN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 participants will talk about existing pain assessment questionnaires and how PNs&#xD;
      affect their life. They will have group discussions of up to 8 people of a similar age with&#xD;
      NF1 and PNs, or the parents of children with it. These will last about 90 minutes. Children&#xD;
      ages 5 to 7 and their parents will have one-on-one meetings instead. These will last about 45&#xD;
      minutes. Discussions will be audiotaped. After the questionnaires have been changed,&#xD;
      individual interviews will discuss the new wording, instructions, questions, and electronic&#xD;
      format of the new forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 participants may be invited to Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 participants will complete the new questionnaires. These may be pen-and-paper or&#xD;
      electronic. The questionnaires will take about 30 minutes for adults and teens. Children will&#xD;
      work one-on-one with a staff member and may need up to 45 minutes. A small group of&#xD;
      participants will be complete the forms twice in clinic and 1 month later at home. Also, a&#xD;
      small group who start a new pain treatment or have a dose increase in their treatment will&#xD;
      complete the forms twice before the treatment change and 1 month later.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease with multiple clinical manifestations,&#xD;
           including plexiform neurofibromas (PN) that can cause pain and may significantly impact&#xD;
           daily functioning and quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are useful in trials for conditions that are disabling&#xD;
           and chronic like NF1, where symptom reduction and improved functioning and QOL currently&#xD;
           are important treatment outcomes, which may occur with PN shrinkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A critical step toward approval of drugs to treat PNs is to evaluate clinical benefit in&#xD;
           conjunction with a reduction in tumor volume as assessed by imaging endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA requests the use of PROs in NF1 clinical atrials, especially for assessing&#xD;
           changes in symptoms, such as pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, no valid PRO measures exist that are specific to the NF1 population to assess&#xD;
           PN pain, its functional impact on an individual s life, or overall physical functioning,&#xD;
           which may be affected by PNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: Qualitative Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---To evaluate current modifications and the need for any additional modifications to&#xD;
           existing measures of pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale; NRS-11) and pain interference&#xD;
           (Pain Interference Index; PII) and select the most appropriate items to measure physical&#xD;
           functioning (PROMIS Physical Functioning; PROMIS-PF) in NF1 based on qualitative&#xD;
           feedback from patients with NF1, PNs and pain to use as endpoints in clinical trials for&#xD;
           individuals with NF1 and PNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: Evaluation of Psychometric Properties and Collection of Normative Data&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate final versions of the NRS-11, PII, and PROMIS-PF measures on&#xD;
                reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, and feasibility in individuals with&#xD;
                NF1 and PNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with documented NF1 either by NIH clinical criteria or molecularly-proven mutation&#xD;
      in the NF1 gene will be included in the study. Patients must have at least 1 plexiform&#xD;
      neurofibroma (PN) that is at least &gt;3cm on physical exam or &gt;3mL on volumetric MRI. Patients&#xD;
      must be at least 5 years of age and able to understand and speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will be a limited site, multi-institutional research study to maximize our&#xD;
      ability to assess a large, diverse sample of individuals with NF1. NCI is the lead&#xD;
      institution and the three participating sites are Children s National Medical Center,&#xD;
      University of Chicago, and Cincinnati Children s Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: Qualitative Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           --The first phase involves evaluation of current modifications and the need for any&#xD;
           additional modification of the NRS-11 and the PII and evaluating the most appropriate&#xD;
           items from the PROMIS-PF item bank to use in the PROMIS-PF short form by conducting&#xD;
           focus groups and interviews with patients diagnosed with NF1 and PNs and parents of&#xD;
           children. We will conduct up to 24 focus groups across various age bands. We will&#xD;
           conduct up to four groups of 6-8 subjects for each age band (8-11 years; 12-14 years;&#xD;
           15-19 years [still in high school]; 18- 24 years [graduated from high school]; 25+&#xD;
           years; and parents of children with NF1). In lieu of focus groups with young children&#xD;
           (ages 5-7), we will conduct individual cognitive interviews. We will conduct up to 6&#xD;
           interviews for children ages 5, 6, and 7, resulting in up to 18 child cognitive&#xD;
           interviews; we will additionally conduct up to 6 cognitive interviews with parents of&#xD;
           children 5-7. This qualitative data will be evaluated and any necessary changes based on&#xD;
           patient responses, will be made to the NRS-11, PII, and PROMIS-PF. The measures will&#xD;
           then be converted into an electronic format that will have the same items and will have&#xD;
           the same question and answer format as the paper questionnaires. It will be administered&#xD;
           on an electronic tablet. We will then conduct up to 32 cognitive interviews across 3&#xD;
           broad age bands (8-12, 13-19, and 18+) up to 10 cognitive interviews with parents, and&#xD;
           up to 20 additional interviews across age bands if deemed necessary following&#xD;
           qualitative analysis for a maximum ceiling of 62 patients with a target of 42 cognitive&#xD;
           interviews to evaluate the measures. Based on these qualitative results these versions&#xD;
           will be updated if necessary to prepare for phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: Evaluation of Psychometric Properties and Collection of Normative Data&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The second phase will evaluate the final electronic versions of the NRS-11, the&#xD;
                PII, and the PROMIS-PF using a cross-sectional design to examine internal&#xD;
                consistency, construct validity, sensitivity to change, and to provide normative&#xD;
                data on the study measures for the NF1 population. It is our goal to recruit from&#xD;
                14 to 16 patients, with a target of 15 in each of 8 phase 2 age bands for an&#xD;
                approximate ceiling of 128 (target = 120) patients, 64 parents of children (target&#xD;
                = 60) 8+ and 16 parents of children ages 5-7 (target = 15). All patients and&#xD;
                parents will be asked to complete the measures two different times to examine&#xD;
                test-retest reliability or sensitivity to change. For the sensitivity to change&#xD;
                analysis, a subset of patients will be given the measure before and after starting&#xD;
                a new pain medication treatment (including new prescriptions and dose escalations)&#xD;
                or starting a new drug to reduce tumor size.&#xD;
