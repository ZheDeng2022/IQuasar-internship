      The objective is to monitor and quality assure the efficacy, including effects on quality of&#xD;
      life, and safety of Monofer® in Chronic Kidney Disease and Inflammatory Bowel Disease patient&#xD;
      populations when Monofer® is used according to the Monofer® label (Summary of Product&#xD;
      Characteristics, SPC) in current clinical practice and where standard routines are being&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;

      Intravenous (IV) iron is a well-tolerated and efficacious treatment of iron deficiency&#xD;
      anaemia in conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
      (IBD). Several studies in CKD and IBD patients have shown that IV iron is superior to oral&#xD;
      iron, most likely explained by decreased uptake and poor compliance (due to gastrointestinal&#xD;
      side-effects) when using oral iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patented Iron Isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) has been developed to overcome the current&#xD;
      limitations of IV iron drugs with regards to safety and convenience of use. The possibility&#xD;
      to administer Monofer® at high single doses (up to 20 mg/kg) reduces the number of treatment&#xD;
      visits needed for full iron correction, which is cost-effective, resource and time-sparing,&#xD;
      and a reduced drug exposure frequency decreases the risk of side-effects such as infusion&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to monitor and quality assure the efficacy, including effects&#xD;
      on quality of life, and safety of Monofer® in CKD and IBD patient populations when Monofer®&#xD;
      is used according to the Monofer® label (Summary of Product Characteristics, SPC) in current&#xD;
      clinical practice and where standard routines are being followed. The scientific rationale&#xD;
      being to fulfill a need for systematic information/auditing on applied practice including&#xD;
      both short and long-term experience with the use of IV iron in different hospital settings&#xD;
      and in current clinical practice. The outcome will provide an evidence base for optimised&#xD;
      treatment procedures in terms of safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study per site is approximately 21 months, which includes a 6&#xD;
      months enrollment period, a prospective observation period of at least 12 months, and a&#xD;
      period of maximum 3 months prior to the last blood test. Patients will only attend hospital&#xD;
      visits planned as part of their standard treatment and they will receive treatment as a part&#xD;
      of standard care and according to the doctor's discretion. The number of patient visits&#xD;
      depends on the number of Monofer® treatment courses needed during the study period. Each&#xD;
      patient can receive one or more treatment courses during 12 months after informed consent.&#xD;
      The last blood test will be taken after the last Monofer® treatment course which might occur&#xD;
      13-15 months after informed consent. Study termination will occur once the 12 months&#xD;
      observational period has been completed for all patients and the last blood test has been&#xD;
      collected from the last Monofer® treated patient in the study. Each treatment course can&#xD;
      consist of one or more Monofer® administrations. For each administration of Monofer® either&#xD;
      intravenous infusion or injection can be used. Pre- and post-treatment blood tests according&#xD;
      to standard treatment and quality of life assessments for fatigue symptoms (FACIT-Fatigue and&#xD;
      IBD-F Scales) are a part of the Monofer® treatment course. Laboratory assessments, i.e.&#xD;
      anaemia work-up/treatment evaluation, shall be a part of local standard practice. The&#xD;
      protocol does not accept any additional samples outside current local standard practice to be&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with applicable standards and data&#xD;
      cleaning procedures. The collected data will systematically be entered into an electronic&#xD;
      case report form (eClinicalOS, myEDC, license by BioStata Aps Denmark). The sources of&#xD;
      information are the relevant treatment and laboratory results obtained from patient records&#xD;
      as well as the quality of life questionnaires for fatigue symptoms. The data will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the Pharmacosmos Medical Affairs teams and an external Data Management vendor&#xD;
      located in a country within the European Union.&#xD;
