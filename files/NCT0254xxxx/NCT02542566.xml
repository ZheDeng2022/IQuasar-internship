      To test using a randomised control trial, whether conservative rehabilitation and protected&#xD;
      weight bearing versus early weight bearing and accelerated rehabilitation affects patient&#xD;
      outcomes post microfracture surgery of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice in most units is to protect patients from weight bearing prior to entering a&#xD;
      conservative physiotherapy rehabilitation program following microfracture surgery of the&#xD;
      knee. At our unit we believe that protecting patients from weight bearing post microfracture&#xD;
      surgery makes no difference to their outcome and only leads to a longer rehabilitation time&#xD;
      and a delayed return to work and sports. Therefore we want to randomise patients who require&#xD;
      microfracture surgery of the knee for cartilage defects into 2 post operative rehabilitation&#xD;
      groups. One group will be able to weight bear early and will undergo an accelerated&#xD;
      rehabilitation program whilst the other will be protected from weight bearing and will&#xD;
      undergo a more conservative rehabilitation program. We will then follow patients up over a&#xD;
      year and compare outcome data collected at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post&#xD;
      operatively to see if there was any difference in outcomes between the 2 groups. As secondary&#xD;
      outcomes we will also compare the patients in the two groups to see if there is a difference&#xD;
      in time taken to return to work and sporting activities&#xD;
