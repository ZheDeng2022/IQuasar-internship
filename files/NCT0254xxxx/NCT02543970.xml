      This clinical study is an open label investigation into the use of the Celluma3 for the&#xD;
      effective treatment of periorbital wrinkles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test subjects will visit a study center for thirty minute treatments, three times per week,&#xD;
      for a period of four weeks, and a twelve week post-treatment follow up after the final&#xD;
      treatment. Test subjects will have photos taken at the start, at the end of the four week&#xD;
      treatment, and at the final twelve week post-treatment follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the three Clinical Investigators, will act as the Principal Investigator and all three&#xD;
      Clinical Investigators will evaluate the test subjects for inclusion and final results. The&#xD;
