  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung resections for pulmonary malignancies offer the best chance of survival for patients,&#xD;
      but these procedures carry a significant burden of post-operative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Patients are particularly at high risk for post-operative atrial fibrillation (a condition&#xD;
      involving irregular heart rhythm). Atrial fibrillation with symptoms can increase the risk of&#xD;
      stroke - a blockage in a major blood vessel in the brain, which can potentially result in a&#xD;
      disability or even death. The objective of this study is to establish the feasibility of&#xD;
      using ambulatory heart rate monitoring to determine the total incidence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation in the peri-operative period before and after anatomic lung resection for&#xD;
      malignancies. The study will also investigate the correlation between atrial fibrillation and&#xD;
      rates of stroke and other adverse events, as well as serve to identify the patients that are&#xD;
      at a higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel literature suggests that atrial fibrillation that is asymptomatic may just be as&#xD;
      problematic as atrial fibrillation that presents itself with symptoms. The objective of the&#xD;
      study is to establish the feasibility of tracking the total incidence of atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      in the peri-operative period, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic events, using an&#xD;
      ambulatory heart monitor. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the overall incidence of&#xD;
      peri- and post-operative atrial fibrillation. These will be accomplished through usage of&#xD;
      iRhythm ZIO XT, a small pebble shaped device that will be adhered to the patient's chest for&#xD;
      14 days before and after surgery, to measure how often atrial fibrillation occurs.&#xD;
