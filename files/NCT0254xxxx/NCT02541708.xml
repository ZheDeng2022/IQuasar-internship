  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous iron preparations have been shown to be superior to oral iron and have largely&#xD;
      replaced the treatment of anaemia in Northern countries. However, the socio-economic and&#xD;
      medical conditions in low resource countries greatly differ from those in northern countries.&#xD;
      Patients' different access to medication supply, perception of medication need and compliance&#xD;
      as well as the burden of concomitant disease like malaria, soil-transmitted helminths,&#xD;
      schistosomiasis, HIV and red blood cells (RBC) genetic disorders may influence effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of iron substitution modality. The aim of the present study is to compare iv iron&#xD;
      substitution by ferric carboxymaltose (FerinjectÂ®) to per oral iron substitution in a low&#xD;
      resource country&#xD;

      The objectives of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the superiority in terms of effectiveness of iv iron substitution with ferric&#xD;
      carboxymaltose versus per oral iron substitution in women with iron deficient anemia at&#xD;
      delivery in Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety and feasibility of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose substitution&#xD;
           compared to per oral iron substitution in a resource limited country&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate acceptance of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose substitution compared to per&#xD;
           oral iron substitution in a resource limited country&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate wellbeing of women receiving intravenous ferric carboxymaltose compared to&#xD;
           women receiving per oral iron substitution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the sensitivity of diagnosis of iron deficiency by measuring hemoglobin,&#xD;
           mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) only,&#xD;
           compared to the diagnosis by measuring iron metabolism parameters in a resource limited&#xD;
           country&#xD;
