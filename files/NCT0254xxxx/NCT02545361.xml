      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and to determine the Dose Limiting&#xD;
      Toxicity (DLT) and the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) of KAHR-102.&#xD;

      Subjects will have a screening visit for determination of eligibility. Up to 40 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects will be included in the study; up to 30 in stage 1, and 10 in stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into 2 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation - Stage 1A and 1B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Confirmation Phase - Stage 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will start with 3 subjects receiving premedication (20mg Dexamethasone Intravenous (IV), 10mg&#xD;
      Loratadine Per Os (P.O), and 1gr Paracetamol (P.O), 1 hour before treatment) with 2&#xD;
      micrograms/kilograms (µg/kg) KAHR-102 subcutaneous (SC) injection every 14 days for 3&#xD;
      injections. 3 injections will be defined as 1 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be hospitalized for 48 hours following each study drug administration.&#xD;
      Blood will be collected before and 24 hours (h) following the study drug administration for&#xD;
      biochemistry, hematology and cytokine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected during hospitalization for the first and third&#xD;
      KAHR-102 SC injections. Sampling for PK will be repeated on Day 4, 7, 32 and 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling for Anti Drug Antibodies (ADAs) will be taken before all 3 KAHR-102 SC injections.&#xD;
      CT scan and ADAs will be repeated at Day 49.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on safety results from Stage 1A and Clinical Safety Committee (CSC) decision, 12&#xD;
      further eligible subjects will be assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts to receive a SC injection of&#xD;
      KAHR-102 with pre-medication (20mg Dexamethasone (IV), 10mg Loratadine (P.O), and 1gr&#xD;
      Paracetamol (P.O), all 1 hour before the KAHR-102 SC injection, once every 7 days for 3&#xD;
      injections starting with 2µg/kg KAHR-102 SC injection. 3 injections will be defined as 1&#xD;
      Cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be hospitalized for 48 hours following each KAHR-102 SC injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected before and 24h following the administration of KAHR-102 SC&#xD;
      injection for biochemistry, hematology and cytokines level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK samples will be collected during hospitalization for first and third KAHR-102 SC&#xD;
      injections. PK will also be assessed on Days 4, 7 (before administration of second KAHR-102&#xD;
      SC injection), 18 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling for ADA testing will be taken before administration of first and third KAHR-102 SC&#xD;
      injections. CT scan and ADA sampling will be performed on Day 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of Stage 1, safety assessment by CSC and determination of MTD will be&#xD;
      performed. 10 subjects will be treated at MTD. KAHR-102 SC injection will be given every 7&#xD;
      days for 3 injections. 3 injections will be defined as 1 Cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be hospitalized during treatment for 48 hours following each KAHR-102 SC&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected before and 24h following the administration of KAHR-102 SC injection&#xD;
      for biochemistry, hematology, cytokines level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK sampling will be taken during hospitalization for first and third KAHR-102 SC injections&#xD;
      and repeated on days 4, 7(before administration of second injection), 18, 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples for ADA testing will be collected prior to the first and third KAHR-102 SC&#xD;
      injections. At Day 35 ADA sampling and CT scan will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles will be repeated at a frequency of 28 days after third KAHR-102 SC injection of 1st&#xD;
      cycle and 14 days after 2nd cycle and following cycles Treatment will be discontinued based&#xD;
      on investigator decision if CT scan shows evidence of disease progression or for any safety&#xD;
      issues. The process will be overseen by the CSC.&#xD;
