  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, more distal approach to femoral nerve branches (saphenous) in the adductor canal in&#xD;
      the medial compartment of the thigh have shown to provide comparable anesthesia and analgesia&#xD;
      without quadriceps muscle weakness than traditional femoral nerve blocks (FNB) after total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty (TKA). Adductor canal block (ACB) has the unique advantage of providing&#xD;
      localized analgesia to the peripatellar and intra-articular aspects of the knee joint without&#xD;
      reducing the patient's ability to perform a straight leg raise. However, it does not&#xD;
      adequately address the incisional pain component on the anterior surface of the knee&#xD;
      innervated by anterior femoral cutaneous nerve. This pain may be improved by addition of the&#xD;
      anterior femoral block (AFB). Additionally, the ACB does not provide analgesia to the&#xD;
      posterior aspect of the knee, which is commonly moderate to severe after surgery. This pain&#xD;
      may be decreased by addition of the genicular block, also known as the iPACK block&#xD;
      (interspace between the popliteal artery and the capsule of the knee). There is no study that&#xD;
      has evaluated the potentially analgesic benefits of the AFB or the iPACK block combined with&#xD;
      ACB after TKA. Therefore, the investigators designed this randomized, prospective, and&#xD;
      double-blinded study to assess our hypothesis that the addition of the AFB and/or iPACK block&#xD;
      to the ACB will improve analgesic effects, decrease pain scores, deceased opioid requirement,&#xD;
      and as well as facilitate early recovery and improve patient satisfaction with pain&#xD;
      management in patient after TKA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain associated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can pose significant&#xD;
      challenges in the recovery process of the patients undergoing this procedure. Traditionally,&#xD;
      opioids have played a significant role in treating postoperative pain. It is well established&#xD;
      that opioids are highly effective in relieving pain at rest, but are less effective in&#xD;
      relieving pain associated with motion (e.g. ambulation, passive motion, and physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation). Furthermore, the use of opioids for analgesia is associated with well-known&#xD;
      side effects (such as: nausea, vomiting, constipation, ileus, bladder dysfunction,&#xD;
      respiratory depression, pruritus, drowsiness, sedation, and allergic reaction). These opioid&#xD;
      side effects, which range in severity, can significantly interfere with the rehabilitation&#xD;
      process and contribute to a delay in hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant interest exists in the application of regional anesthetic techniques as an&#xD;
      adjuvant to traditional opioid analgesics for pain control in patients after TKA.&#xD;
      Specifically, the incorporation of femoral nerve blocks (FNB) as an adjunct in postoperative&#xD;
      pain control has been widely reported in the anesthesia literature. While it has shown to be&#xD;
      effective in post-operative pain control, it has introduced additional challenges for&#xD;
      physical therapy and raised new concerns regarding the associated quadriceps muscle weakness.&#xD;
      Until adequate quadriceps function returns, the need for knee immobilization devices to&#xD;
      protect patients with traditional FNB from falls interferes with the early recovery process&#xD;
      and the achievement of physical therapy milestones.&#xD;
