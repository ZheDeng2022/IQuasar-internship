  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the last several years have seen great strides in the treatment of relapsing forms of&#xD;
      MS, progressive MS, responsible for the majority of MS-related disability, lags far behind.&#xD;
      Despite much research, the lack of understanding related to what causes patients' relentless&#xD;
      decline in function results in an inability to develop targeted treatment strategies suitable&#xD;
      for clinical trials. This grant has two main goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first goal is to extend the investigators preliminary study on rat neurons treated with&#xD;
      the CSF of MS patients to a larger number of Progressive patients in order to validate the&#xD;
      initial findings and extend the study to include analysis of human neurons. The initiating PI&#xD;
      (Dr. Casaccia) and the Partnering PI and Clinical Neurologist (Dr. Katz Sand) have recently&#xD;
      identified components that are present in the CSF of progressive patients that impair the&#xD;
      ability of rat neurons to produce energy. The partnering PI, Dr. Quinzii (Columbia&#xD;
      University) together with collaborator Dr. Fossati (NY Stem Cells Foundation), have&#xD;
      characterized human neurons generated from stem cells derived from skin biopsies of&#xD;
      progressive patients and detected the presence of energetic deficits. The experimental plan&#xD;
      will build on these results and test hypotheses of disease progression. The overall goal is&#xD;
      to improve understanding on how to stop neurons from degenerating and stop clinical&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second goal is to ask whether it is possible to define a progressive disease course on&#xD;
      the basis of combined biochemical, functional and imaging measurements. The initiating PI&#xD;
      will be responsible for the biochemical assessment of CSF and serum samples and, together&#xD;
      with partnering PI Quinzii, will also provide functional bioassays measurements of&#xD;
      mitochondrial bioenergetics impairment in patients. These data will be combined with clinical&#xD;
      assessment and MRI evaluations conducted by the partnering PI Katz Sand and collaborator&#xD;
      Inglese. A two year clinical and imaging follow up from the initial recruitment will allow to&#xD;
      define whether the combined measurements can be used by clinical neurologists to define the&#xD;
      disease course and better identify therapeutic options for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expectation is that the completion of the stated aims of research will allow an&#xD;
      advancement of the current knowledge of the progressive form of MS and lead to potential new&#xD;
      therapeutic targets.&#xD;
