      Outcomes study to test the hypothesis that patients first identified by community-based&#xD;
      neurologists, implanted by a networked movement disorders center, and then managed by the&#xD;
      same community-based neurologist will have clinical outcomes comparable to movement disorders&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed outcomes study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single blind,&#xD;
      non-inferiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      therapy applied in a community-based model for 62 subjects with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      appropriate for STN DBS therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight community-based private neurology practices will be networked to Vanderbilt University&#xD;
      Medical Center (VUMC). Neurologists for each practice will attend structured educational&#xD;
      programs offered by Medtronic in the identification, selection, and management of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease patients with DBS therapy. Following this educational program, each practice will&#xD;
      identify subjects for implantation VUMC. Following screening and baseline visits at VUMC,&#xD;
      appropriate patients will be implanted with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain&#xD;
      stimulating therapy. The initial post-operative programming will be done at VUMC four weeks&#xD;
      after implantation. 8 subjects will then be equally randomized with half being followed for&#xD;
      long-term management by the community-based neurologist. The other half will be followed at&#xD;
      VUMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subsequent outpatient evaluation management of medications and deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      will be managed per standard of care at the location assigned by randomization,&#xD;
      community-based private neurology practice or VUMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be enrolled during the first 24 months of the study. Follow-up evaluations&#xD;
      at 12 months will be performed at VUMC. Each patient identified by the community-based&#xD;
      neurologist for implantation will be assessed at VUMC. This assessment will include a&#xD;
      videotaped off and on UPDRS III rating, neuropsychological testing, and appropriateness as&#xD;
      outlined in the patient selection educational program. Patients will be implanted by&#xD;
      bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation therapy within 120 days of their initial&#xD;
      assessment. The initial post-operative programming will be performed four weeks&#xD;
      post-operatively, this is all standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomized to be either managed by their community-based neurologist or&#xD;
      at VUMC. Follow-up evaluations at 12 months will include a videotaped on and off UPDRS rating&#xD;
      and neuropsychological testing, anti-parkinson medication dosages, and quality of life&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a clinical diagnosis of probable idiopathic PD. The diagnosis will&#xD;
             be based upon the presence of at least three of four clinical features according to&#xD;
             diagnostic utility (Resting Tremor, Bradykinesia, Rigidity, Asymmetric Onset) and an&#xD;
             absence of clinical features suggestive of an alternative diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Demonstrated response to dopaminergic therapy. In order to exclude patients with a&#xD;
             possible alternative diagnosis, all subjects included in the study must have&#xD;
             demonstrated a good response to DA drugs, defined as demonstrating at least 30%&#xD;
             improvement in parkinsonian motor signs, based upon the UPDRS motor examination&#xD;
             subscore, following the administration of their DA drug(s) during the screening&#xD;
             neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Advanced Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No contraindications to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age between 50 and 75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Available for follow-up for the entire duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Informed Consent: The subject understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the&#xD;
             study procedures and participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. MRI within normal range for age&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of an alternative diagnosis or secondary parkinsonism, as suggested by&#xD;
             features unusual early in the clinical course: Prominent postural instability,&#xD;
             freezing phenomena, or hallucinations unrelated to medications in the first 3 years&#xD;
             after symptom onset; dementia preceding motor symptoms; supranuclear gaze palsy (other&#xD;
             than restriction of upward gaze) or slowing of vertical saccades in the first year;&#xD;
             severe, symptomatic dysautonomia unrelated to medications; documentation of a&#xD;
             condition known to produce parkinsonism and plausibly connected to the subject's&#xD;
             symptoms (such as suitably located focal brain lesions or neuroleptic use within the&#xD;
             past 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Uncontrolled medical condition or clinically significant medical disease that would&#xD;
             increase the risk of developing pre- or postoperative complications (e.g., significant&#xD;
             cardiac or pulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of dementia&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Major psychiatric disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous brain operation or injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active participation in another clinical trial for the treatment of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have demand cardiac pacemakers or who have medical conditions that&#xD;
             require repeat MRI scans.&#xD;
