  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the existing diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) challenge model is already&#xD;
      suitable for dietary interventions in its current form, further characterization of the&#xD;
      working-mechanism of the attenuated strain and further optimization of the study design will&#xD;
      enable the investigators to better select those ingredients that affect the key&#xD;
      pathophysiological processes. The aim of the CORAL study is to further characterize and&#xD;
      increase the discriminative power of the diarrhoeagenic E. coli challenge model.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the CORAL study the investigators want to determine whether increasing the inoculation&#xD;
      dose of diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) to 5E10 Colony Forming Units (CFU) (at day&#xD;
      14) and addition of a second challenge 1E10 CFU (at day 35) will result in an increased&#xD;
      effect-size and duration of measurable outcomes and in an expansion of the relevant clinical&#xD;
      and biomarker readouts of the challenge model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By extensive biomarker and transcriptome analysis of blood and fecal samples, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to explore the working mechanism of the non-toxin producing diarrhoeagenic&#xD;
      E. coli strain and the kinetics of the host response to this infection. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators want to determine whether adding extended fasting and addition of a&#xD;
      standardized evening meal, prior to the inoculation day, will result in a decreased&#xD;
      between-subject variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CORAL study is a parallel 7-weeks intervention study. Subjects will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of two inoculation dosages of a live attenuated diarrhoeagenic E. coli (n=20 per&#xD;
      group). Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual pattern of physical activity and&#xD;
      their habitual food intake, but to standardize their dietary calcium intake. After a&#xD;
      standardized evening meal and an overnight fast, subjects will be orally infected with a&#xD;
      live, but attenuated, diarrhoeagenic E. coli (strain E1392-75-2A; collection NIZO food&#xD;
      research; dose will be either 1E10 CFU (n=22) or 5E10 CFU (n=22) at study day 14). At study&#xD;
      day 35, after a standardized evening meal and an overnight fast, all subjects will receive a&#xD;
      second inoculation of 1E10 CFU of the ETEC vaccine (n=44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At various time points before and after both diarrhoeagenic E. coli challenges an online&#xD;
      diary will be kept to record all food and drinks consumption to assess dietary macronutrient&#xD;
      intake. Moreover, subjects will report information on stool consistency, frequency and&#xD;
      severity of symptoms. At various time points before and after both diarrhoeagenic E. coli&#xD;
      challenges venous blood and (complete) stool samples will be collected. Blood and fecal&#xD;
      samples are collected to quantify several infection- and immune system markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy male subjects, 18-55 years of age who fulfil all of the inclusion criteria and none&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria will participate in the CORAL study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study day 14 and 35, after a standardized evening meal and an overnight fast, all subjects&#xD;
      will receive an inoculation of the diarrhoeagenic E. coli (1E10 CFU (n=22) or 5E10 CFU (n=22)&#xD;
      at study day 14; 1E10 CFU (n=40) at study day 35) Subjects will be instructed to maintain&#xD;
      their habitual diet, except for their dairy intake. Dairy has a high calcium content and&#xD;
      contributes significantly to total daily calcium intake. These dietary guidelines will limit&#xD;
      calcium intake on average to 500 mg/day. From our previous studies, we know that calcium can&#xD;
      significantly reduce the gastro-intestinal symptoms induced by the E. coli strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameter:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Percentage of faecal dry weight (% determined by freeze-drying)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total faecal wet weight (faecal weight in g/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time to first diarrhoeal stool (reported by the subjects in the online diary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale reported by the subjects in the online diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number of stools with Bristol Stool Scale &gt;4 (Bristol Stool Scale reported by the&#xD;
           subjects in the online diary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Stool frequency (Stools per day reported by the subjects in the online diary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Incidence and duration of WHO-defined diarrhoea (Calculated from the Bristol Stool Scale&#xD;
           and the Stool frequency reported by the subjects in the online diary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The incidence, duration and severity of Gastro-intestinal symptoms (Gastro-intestinal&#xD;
           Symptom Rating Scale reported by the subjects in the online diary).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. In addition, the study contains an explorative phase consisting of biomarker and&#xD;
           transcriptome analysis, in order to further explore and identify the mechanism and&#xD;
           kinetics of the host response to the infection.&#xD;

    <description>At study day 14, after a standardized evening meal and an overnight fast, subjects will receive a single oral dose of the attenuated diarrhoeagenic E. coli strain E1392-75-2A (dose will be either 1E10 CFU (n=22) or 5E10 CFU (n=22)). Oral challenge will occur at 10.00 AM. Under supervision of the project team, subjects will get a NaHCO3 solution (100 ml 2% NaHCO3) to neutralize the gastric acid. After 5 minutes, they get a fruit juice (100 ml) containing the attenuated diarrhoeagenic E. coli strain at the above-mentioned dose. Subjects go home, but are not allowed to drink or eat for 1 hour.&#xD;
