  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The highly promising and innovative tracer on 111In-DTPA-AHX-Lys40-Exendin 4 has been applied&#xD;
      to determine beta cell mass in healthy volunteers and patients with type 1 diabetes. However,&#xD;
      the high retention of the tracer in the kidneys was leading to a kidney/pancreas uptake ratio&#xD;
      of 41±23. This high renal uptake is complicating absolute BCM quantification by SPECT&#xD;
      imaging. In order to reduce the kidney/pancreas uptake ratio, investigators propose a&#xD;
      co-infusion with the plasma expander Gelofusine since it has been shown in several&#xD;
      pre-clinical and clinical studies that Gelofusine can reduce the renal retention of several&#xD;
      other, closely related tracers. When investigators are able to reduce the kidney/pancreas&#xD;
      uptake ratio, these findings will improve the interpretation of clinical quantitative SPECT,&#xD;
      having important implications for therapeutic decision making for patients with diabetes,&#xD;
      insulinomas or congenital hyperinsulinism, and may also have a major impact on our&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of these diseases.&#xD;

      Beta-cell imaging in vivo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliable, sensitive and specific non-invasive methods for comprehensive structural and&#xD;
      functional characterization of living pancreatic beta-cells in vivo (and in vitro) would not&#xD;
      only enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of various diseases, but also enable&#xD;
      longitudinal in vivo assessment of beta cell mass (BCM) and distribution in patients with&#xD;
      e.g. diabetes (including patients who received beta cell replacement therapy). Additionally,&#xD;
      it can help in diagnosing insulinomas and congenital hyperinsulinism and when coupled to&#xD;
      other biomarkers it could aid patient stratification and enable patient-specific optimized&#xD;
      treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibiting the reabsorption of radiolabelled peptides&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that the kidney uptake of radiolabelled&#xD;
      peptides can be reduced by co-infusion of agents that inhibit the reabsorption of these&#xD;
      peptides. One of these agents is succinylated gelatin (Gelofusine), a plasma expander that&#xD;
      consists of a mixture of collagen-derived peptides. Previous clinical observations have shown&#xD;
      that Gelofusine infusion results in tubular proteinuria of both albumin and β2-microglobulin.&#xD;
      Although the exact mechanism for this proteinuria is not completely understood, the megalin&#xD;
      receptor system is most likely involved. Based on pre-clinical studies in mice and rats, it&#xD;
      has been known that kidney uptake is significantly reduced for various tracers when&#xD;
      co-infused with Gelofusine, like 111In-Octreotide 111In-Minigastrin, 68Ga-exendin-4 and&#xD;
      111In-DTPA-AHX-Lys40-Exendin 4. Additionally, it was shown that Gelofusine also reduces the&#xD;
      renal retention of 111In- Octreotide by 45% in humans. In the current study, investigators&#xD;
      will determine whether Gelofusine has also an effect on kidney retention of&#xD;
      111In-DTPA-AHX-Lys40-Exendin 4 in humans.&#xD;
