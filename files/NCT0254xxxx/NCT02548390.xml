    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/Ib, dose escalation study of intravenous RXDX-107 administered&#xD;
      to subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study is designed to explore the safety, maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity&#xD;
      of RXDX-107 and to define a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;

    <description>Subjects in this study will receive RXDX-107 intravenously at dose levels specified for their respective dose cohorts. Dosing will begin at 25 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 2 of a 28-day cycle and will escalate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or (RP2D) is determined. An additional schedule of administration of RXDX-107 on Day 1 of a 28 day cycle may be assessed. Cycles will be repeated in four-week (28 day) intervals for up to 6 cycles or until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met.</description>
