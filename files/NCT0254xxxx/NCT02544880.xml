  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Tadalafil treatment, by lowering Myeloid Derived&#xD;
      Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), can prime an antitumor immune&#xD;
      response and promote a permissive environment that should increase the efficacy of anti-tumor&#xD;
      vaccine in a setting of minimal residual disease.&#xD;

      This study is halting accrual at the end of the phase 1 portion of the study as data from the&#xD;
      phase I study suggest that an alternative approach for the phase 2 portion of the study be&#xD;
      undertaken. A newly designed Phase II trial is being developed and will be submitted as a new&#xD;
      study protocol.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase 1 - Number of participants experiencing adverse events and/or treatment limiting-toxicities after receiving protocol therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the lead-in, open-label, single-arm, phase I part of study will evaluate the safety of Tadalafil in combination with anti-MUC1/anti-influenza vaccines (TV) in terms of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-limiting toxicities (TLTs).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2 - Rate of tumor-specific immune response to protocol therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of phase II is to evaluate immune response (tumor-specific immune response of the anti- MUC1 and anti-influenza vaccines when combined with Tadalafil. Immune response will be evaluated by determining patients' immunological profile (e.g. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), leukocyte subsets, and serum cytokine levels) and immunological reactivity (e.g. through DTH skin test, T cell proliferation, by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT), specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration, and immune response by peripheral blood sera) before and after surgery, and during treatment with Tadalafil and the anti-MUC1 and anti-Influenza vaccines.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1/2 - Rate of recurrence-free survival (RFS) in participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with recurrent or second primary HNSCC after salvage surgery. RFS is defined as the time from date of Surgery to the date of first documented recurrence. All patients will be rendered disease free (i.e. no measurable disease) after surgery, thus any confirmed evidence of disease recurrence regardless of size or site will constitute the recurrence time point. Recurrence will be demonstrated by clinical assessments such as clinical examinations and tumor assessments (possibly) by CT, PET/CT or MRI.</description>
