    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate feasibly of outpatient Total Knee Replacement, Total&#xD;
      Hip Replacement and Unicompartmental Knee Replacement in a modern fast-track setup. The&#xD;
      design is as an observational prospective study, evaluating patients that fulfil discharge&#xD;
      criteria on the day of the surgery. The investigators will further evaluate safety aspects,&#xD;
      such a early morbidity and mortality, as well as patient satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fast-track total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and Unicompartmental&#xD;
      Knee arthroplasty (UKA) with length of stay (LOS) of 1-3 is a well established concept for&#xD;
      treating hip and knee osteoarthritis, resulting in short reconvalescence, high patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, and an excellent safety profile (lower or similar mortality / morbidity&#xD;
      compared to conventional pathways with longer LOS). LOS have been significantly reduced&#xD;
      during the past decade, and several centers have published even shorter hospitals stays: &lt;24&#xD;
      hours, with patients staying the night at the hospital but also outpatient surgery, with&#xD;
      patients being discharged on the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these proposed pathways with extremely short LOS, are performed on very selected&#xD;
      patients, with few details on patient satisfaction, outcome and most important patient&#xD;
      safety. Therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions on feasibility of outpatient THA,&#xD;
      TKA and UKA surgery in a general and unselected population. Further on, there is a need for&#xD;
      investigation of safety aspects of outpatient surgery in respect to mortality, morbidity,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and patient reported outcomes. As some, most likely healthy and younger,&#xD;
      patients might benefit from outpatient surgery - eg discharge on the day of surgery, while&#xD;
      others might not; the first step is to identify the patients that are suitable for outpatient&#xD;
      THA and TKA surgery and investigate the safety aspects in respect to mortality, morbidity,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate &quot;feasibility&quot; and &quot;safety&quot; of outpatient THA, TKA and&#xD;
      UKA surgery, respectively as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients, that can be included in the study according to inclusion&#xD;
           criteria stated below, and be evaluated for potential same-day discharge (I) (I =&#xD;
           included)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of included patients (I), that are discharged on the day of surgery (U) and&#xD;
           those who are not discharged and stay for &gt;1 day (B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify reasons for patients not being able to be discharged on the day of surgery (B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  risk for complications (morbidity) in group (U) compared to group (B) (are there&#xD;
           complications that potentially could have been avoided is the patient was not&#xD;
           discharged)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  readmissions in group (U ) compared to group (B) within 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mortality in group (U ) compared to group (B) within 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient satisfaction in group (U ) compared to group (B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported outcome (Oxford knee score + range of motion for TKA and UKA group, and&#xD;
           Oxford hip score for THA group) in group (U) compared to group (B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  contacts to primary sector in group (U ) compared to group (B) within 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of rescue morphine (pain journal) for 7 days post op in group (U ) compared to group&#xD;
           (B)&#xD;
