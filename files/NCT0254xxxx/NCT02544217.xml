  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial Diseases are rare progressive, multi-system, often early fatal disorders&#xD;
      affecting both children and adults. KH176 is a novel chemical entity currently under&#xD;
      development for the treatment of inherited mitochondrial diseases, including MELAS&#xD;
      (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes), Leigh's Disease&#xD;
      and Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). KH176 is a potent intracellular redox&#xD;
      modulating agent targeting the reactive oxygen species which are important in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. After demonstrating a&#xD;
      favourable safety profile in the pre-clinical testing, the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the compound will now be evaluated in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects in this trial&#xD;

    <measure>SAD: Change From Baseline in ECG Results by Timepoint: Corrected QT Interval According to Fridericia's Formula (QTcF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours, 7 day follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline ECG recording consists of a triplicate recording (3 recordings of a least 3 complexes within a 5 minute window) prior to dosing on Day 1. For the evaluation of the corrected QT intervals the average of the 3 recordings will be taken as baseline. Other ECG recordings will be singlet (one recording of at least 3 complexes) prior to dosing. QTcF is calculated as the quotient between the QT interval in milliseconds and the cube root of the RR interval in seconds, according to Fridericia's formula.</description>

        <title>SAD: Change From Baseline in ECG Results by Timepoint: Corrected QT Interval According to Fridericia's Formula (QTcF)</title>
        <description>The baseline ECG recording consists of a triplicate recording (3 recordings of a least 3 complexes within a 5 minute window) prior to dosing on Day 1. For the evaluation of the corrected QT intervals the average of the 3 recordings will be taken as baseline. Other ECG recordings will be singlet (one recording of at least 3 complexes) prior to dosing. QTcF is calculated as the quotient between the QT interval in milliseconds and the cube root of the RR interval in seconds, according to Fridericia's formula.</description>

The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value.</description>

        <description>Hematocrit is a measure of the ratio of red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood by volume. Blood samples were collected from participants at the indicated timepoints for evaluation of hematology parameters. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value.</description>

          <description>Erythrocyte mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is a measure of the average concentration of hemoglobin per red blood cell. Blood samples were collected from participants at the indicated timepoints for evaluation of hematology parameters. The baseline value at visit and the change from baseline value at each timepoint are reported. The change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline value from the baseline value.</description>

        <title>MAD: Change From Baseline in ECG Results by Time Point: QTcF</title>
        <description>The baseline ECG recording consists of a triplicate recording (3 recordings of a least 3 complexes within a 5 minute window) prior to dosing on Day 1. For the evaluation of the corrected QT intervals the average of the 3 recordings will be taken as baseline. Other ECG recordings will be singlet (one recording of at least 3 complexes) prior to dosing, or around the expected Cmax on Day 1 or 7 for the multiple-dose part.&#xD;
QTcF is calculated as the quotient between the QT interval in milliseconds and the cube root of the RR interval in seconds, according to Fridericia's formula.</description>

          <title>MAD: Change From Baseline in ECG Results by Time Point: QTcF</title>
          <description>The baseline ECG recording consists of a triplicate recording (3 recordings of a least 3 complexes within a 5 minute window) prior to dosing on Day 1. For the evaluation of the corrected QT intervals the average of the 3 recordings will be taken as baseline. Other ECG recordings will be singlet (one recording of at least 3 complexes) prior to dosing, or around the expected Cmax on Day 1 or 7 for the multiple-dose part.&#xD;
QTcF is calculated as the quotient between the QT interval in milliseconds and the cube root of the RR interval in seconds, according to Fridericia's formula.</description>
          <population>The safety analysis set included all subjects who have been assigned treatment and have been administered at least once with placebo or KH176.</population>

        <description>The baseline ECG recording consists of a triplicate recording (3 recordings of a least 3 complexes within a 5 minute window) prior to dosing on Day 1. For the evaluation the average of the 3 recordings will be taken as baseline. Other ECG recordings will be singlet (one recording of at least 3 complexes) prior to dosing, or around the expected Cmax on Day 1 or 7 for the multiple- dose part.</description>

        <title>MAD: Change From Baseline in ECG Results by Time Point: the Interval That Denotes Depolarization of the Ventricles, Between the Beginning of the Q Wave and the End of the S Wave (QRS Interval)</title>
        <description>The baseline ECG recording consists of a triplicate recording (3 recordings of a least 3 complexes within a 5 minute window) prior to dosing on Day 1. For the evaluation the average of the 3 recordings will be taken as baseline. Other ECG recordings will be singlet (one recording of at least 3 complexes) prior to dosing, or around the expected Cmax on Day 1 or 7 for the multiple- dose part.</description>

        <description>The baseline ECG recording consists of a triplicate recording (3 recordings of a least 3 complexes within a 5 minute window) prior to dosing on Day 1. For the evaluation the average of the 3 recordings will be taken as baseline. Other ECG recordings will be singlet (one recording of at least 3 complexes) prior to dosing, or around the expected Cmax on Day 1 or 7 for the multiple- dose part.</description>
