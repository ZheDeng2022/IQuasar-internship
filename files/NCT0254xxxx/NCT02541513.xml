      The proposed study will evaluate the tolerability, acceptability and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      paliparidone for the treatment of co-occurring opioid and amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS)&#xD;
      dependence. In the proposed clinical trial, all patients will first discontinue illicit&#xD;
      opioid and ATS and be inducted onto buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) in the&#xD;
      inpatient ward at the department of psychiatry before beginning to receive paliparidone.&#xD;
      Tolerability and acceptability will be evaluated by assessing the rates of patient retention&#xD;
      during treatment, patient satisfaction with treatment and adverse effects during treatment.&#xD;
      The potential efficacy of paliparidone will be evaluated with regard to the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure: reductions in illicit ATS use, based on urine toxicology testing and self-report.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include treatment retention, reduction in HIV risk behaviors and&#xD;
      improvements in functional status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaysia has been struggling in fighting drug addiction in the country (NADI, 2005). Opioids&#xD;
      predominantly heroin and morphine and ATS (Chawarski et al, 2006). dependence are the primary&#xD;
      drugs of abuse for most drug users in Malaysia There are more than 300,000 registered drug&#xD;
      users in Malaysia, most are opioid dependent and current intravenous drug users (IVDU). Drug&#xD;
      abuse comes together with other medical and social problems, as 25-30% of IVDU are infected&#xD;
      with HIV; and IVDU accounts for 70% of HIV infections in Malaysia. There are more than 90,&#xD;
      000 registered HIV positives between 1986 and 2010. (National Anti-Drug Agency of Malaysia,&#xD;
      2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) has also emerged as a major drug&#xD;
      problem. Globally, ATS is now the second most commonly used illicit drug type and is more&#xD;
      widely used than heroin. ATS abuse is especially prevalent and problematic in the Asian&#xD;
      region, where ATS production, use, drug seizures, and demand for treatment have continued to&#xD;
      increase. Injection of methamphetamine has been reported in Malaysia (Chawarski et al, 2006)&#xD;
      and other south-east Asian countries (McKetin, 2008). In the most recent survey of&#xD;
      out-of-treatment heroin IVDU in cities across Malaysia, more than 60% report current ATS use,&#xD;
      and 29% inject ATS (Chawarski et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATS use is associated with increased HIV transmission behavioral risks. The connection of&#xD;
      heroin, methamphetamine and HIV in Malaysia is well documented (Chawarski et al, 2006).&#xD;
      Increased needle sharing and risky sexual behaviors lead to increased prevalence of HIV&#xD;
      infection. ATS use exacerbates HIV transmission risk through a number of mechanisms: ATS&#xD;
      users report engaging in more frequent and more risky sexual behaviors while using ATS and in&#xD;
      more frequent needle sharing. ATS is also associated with impairments of mood and executive&#xD;
      functioning that may persist for prolonged periods and may contribute to relapse to drug use,&#xD;
      thus all other problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug abuse has been a major problem in Kelantan for the past several decades (Suarn &amp;&#xD;
      NorAdam,1993) and ATS has been gaining momentum over the past decade. The number of&#xD;
      individuals arrested annually for ATS in Kelantan increased over the past 5 years from 2900&#xD;
      in 2007 to 5300 in 2010. For the past 5 years, Kelantan has also led Malaysia in having the&#xD;
      highest population prevalence of HIV infection, at 47 per 100,000 in 2008, nearly 4 times the&#xD;
      prevalence reported for the rest of Malaysia. Kelantan also has the highest number of women&#xD;
      with HIV in Malaysia with more than 1200 reported in 2008, suggesting that HIV is making the&#xD;
      transition to the general population. A large proportion of treatment seeking drug users in&#xD;
      Kelantan are HIV positives and are susceptible to high mortality (JKNK, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paliperidone, the primary active metabolite of risperidone, is a long-acting atypical&#xD;
      neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medication. It blocks dopamine 2 (D2) receptors and serotonin 2A&#xD;
      receptors and acts as an alpha2 antagonist. Blockade of the D2 receptors may reduce the&#xD;
      reinforcing effects of ATS or other stimulants; blockade of the serotonin 2A receptor leads&#xD;
      to increased DA release in the prefrontal cortex and motor regions and may thus improve&#xD;
      cognitive performance and mood and reduce motor impairments associated with blockade of D2&#xD;
      receptors; and alpha2 antagonist actions may provide antidepressant effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paliperidone's potential efficacy for treating ATS dependence was suggested both by its&#xD;
      potential for blocking or attenuating the rewarding effects of ATS use and by its potential&#xD;
      for improving cognitive functioning in patients recovering from ATS dependence. An open label&#xD;
      pilot study of oral risperidone for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence provided&#xD;
      preliminary evidence for the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of risperidone.&#xD;
      Risperidone was generally well-tolerated and associated with decreased methamphetamine use&#xD;
      and improvements in fine motor function and mood. A subsequent open trial of injectable&#xD;
      ripseridone found that injectable risperidone was associated with reductions in&#xD;
      methamphetamine use and improvements in verbal memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However to date there have been no published replication studies or studies of paliperidone&#xD;
      for treating ATS dependence in other populations and setting. This proposed pilot study of&#xD;
      paliperidone for the treatment of ATS dependence would extend this work and provide specific&#xD;
      data regarding the tolerability and efficacy of paliperidone in opioid-agonist maintained&#xD;
      patients with co-occurring ATS and opioid dependence (COATS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to detoxification and treatment medications, a manual-guided educational drug and&#xD;
      HIV risk reduction counseling (EDRC) will be provided to all participants. EDRC provides&#xD;
      education about medical understanding of opioid and ATS addiction, highly effective&#xD;
      strategies used in successful drug recovery efforts, medical and other harmful consequences&#xD;
      of drug use including HIV and other infectious disease transmission, as well as about&#xD;
      effective prevention of all negative consequences of illicit drug use (Chawarski et al,&#xD;
      2008). It helps patient to remain in treatment, adhere to prescribed medications, abstain&#xD;
      from or reduce illicit opioid and ATS use and HIV risk behaviors, and make life-style changes&#xD;
      fostering sustained recovery. It also teaches basic cognitive and behavioral coping skills&#xD;
      that increase the patients' chances to reach sustained and prolonged recovery from drugs. For&#xD;
      HIV positive patients, EDRC encourages patients to attend the HIV clinic and adhere to&#xD;
      monitoring, medication, and other treatment recommendations. EDRC will be provided by trained&#xD;
      and supervised nursing personnel, drug counselors, or therapists. It will be offered in&#xD;
      individual format with the frequency ranging from 3 times per week during detoxification to&#xD;
      once per week during the outpatient phase of treatment.&#xD;
