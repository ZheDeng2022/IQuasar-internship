      A variety of mindfulness-based interventions, such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy have been shown to be beneficial for individuals&#xD;
      experiencing mood and anxiety symptoms. The aim of this pilot study is to test the&#xD;
      feasibility of using a similar intervention, known as Big Mind, for veterans with PTSD and&#xD;
      other psychological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Big Mind is a method of self-exploration that utilizes a voice dialog technique to help&#xD;
      individuals see the world and themselves from a variety of perspectives. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that this process will increase mindfulness and decrease self-referential&#xD;
      thinking, which is associated with negative affect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the feasibility of using this method, veterans with PTSD will complete a four-week&#xD;
      group Big Mind class with a total of four sessions. The investigators will use a single group&#xD;
      design with pre and post-intervention measures to assess tolerability and acceptance of the&#xD;
      intervention. Secondary outcome measures will evaluate symptom improvement and increased&#xD;
      mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this project demonstrates that using this intervention for veterans with PTSD is feasible,&#xD;
      then more rigorous clinical trials will be warranted.&#xD;

      In recent years, interventions involving mindfulness have become increasingly popular as&#xD;
      complementary mind-body therapeutic strategies for a variety of medical and psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness has been described as a practice of focusing attention on moment-by-moment&#xD;
      experience with an attitude of curiosity, openness and acceptance. In other words, practicing&#xD;
      mindfulness is simply experiencing the present moment. During mindfulness, awareness is&#xD;
      focused on external sensory inputs, internal sensations, such as proprioception and pain, as&#xD;
      well as awareness of the internal workings of the mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness originated in Buddhist spiritual practices. One of these is Zen, a traditional&#xD;
      Buddhist approach that primarily involves the practice of developing mindfulness by way of&#xD;
      seated meditation. Two secular mindfulness-based interventions that have been extensively&#xD;
      studied are Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy&#xD;
      (MBCT). MBSR was developed by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical&#xD;
      Center as secular method to utilize Buddhist mindfulness in mainstream psychology and&#xD;
      medicine. MBSR includes education about stress as well as training on coping strategies and&#xD;
      assertiveness in addition to mindfulness. MBCT was developed by Zindel Segal, Mark Williams&#xD;
      and John Teasdale. MBCT is based upon MBSR and combines the principles of cognitive therapy&#xD;
      with those of mindfulness to prevent relapse of depression. MBCT, like MBSR, utilizes secular&#xD;
      mindfulness techniques including seated meditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A very large literature now supports the effectiveness of MBSR for social anxiety disorder,&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder, improved psychological functioning among individuals with&#xD;
      medical disorders and pain. Evidence indicates that MBCT is beneficial for unipolar&#xD;
      depression relapse prevention, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, hypochondriasis&#xD;
      and social phobia. The strongest evidence is for relapse prevention in unipolar illness.&#xD;
      Finally, a recent review and meta-analysis specifically addressed the effectiveness of MBSR&#xD;
      and MBCT (and similar interventions) for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. The&#xD;
      authors concluded that mindfulness based therapy improves symptoms of anxiety and depression&#xD;
      across a wide range of severity and even when these symptoms are associated with other&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions are incompletely&#xD;
      understood. However, considerable evidence suggests these approaches decrease depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, at least in part, by altering self-referential thinking. For example, increased&#xD;
      self-focused thinking is associated with affective symptoms. Furthermore, there is strong&#xD;
      evidence that a particular type of thinking about self contributes to dysphoria in general&#xD;
      and unipolar depression. Specifically, analytical self-focused rumination (thinking&#xD;
      analytically about self and symptoms) is maladaptive. This cognitive style is associated with&#xD;
      overgeneral autobiographical memory, global negative self-judgments, greater negative future&#xD;
      thinking and dysphoria. Furthermore, there is compelling evidence that ruminative self-focus&#xD;
      is associated with both the severity and duration of depressive symptoms as well as relapse&#xD;
      of illness. In contrast to analytic self-focus, mindfulness (or experiential self-focus) is&#xD;
      adaptive. Therefore, interventions that increase mindfulness and/or decrease analytical&#xD;
      self-referential ruminations may be effective for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In fact,&#xD;
      studies indicate that mindfulness approaches do in fact exert benefit as a result of both&#xD;
      increasing mindfulness and decreasing self-focused rumination. These interventions also&#xD;
      promote additional cognitive changes that may help ameliorate symptoms. One of these is&#xD;
      enhancing compassion specifically including patience and kindness directed toward the self.&#xD;
      Self-compassion is a predictor of psychological health and increases in caring for one's self&#xD;
      appear to contribute to the effectiveness of these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable evidence that MBSR and MBCT have broad spectrum antianxiety and&#xD;
      antidepressant effects as well as generally enhance psychological functioning and pain&#xD;
      tolerance. Nonetheless, these approaches are unlikely to be effective for all patients. Thus,&#xD;
      there is a need to evaluate the potential effectiveness of other mindfulness interventions.&#xD;
      Further, the effectiveness of MBSR and MBCT suggests that other mindfulness interventions may&#xD;
      also be beneficial and that studies of alternative approaches are warranted. Finally, there&#xD;
      is a compelling need to evaluate the use of mindfulness approaches as adjunctive&#xD;
      interventions for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to pilot test the feasibility of using an alternative mindfulness approach, Big Mind&#xD;
      for veterans with PTSD seeking complementary and alternative treatment at the George E.&#xD;
      Wahlen VAMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Big Mind (BM), developed by Zen Master Dennis Genpo Merzel is a secular mindfulness and&#xD;
      self-discovery intervention that integrates aspects of Zen practice with a voice-dialogue&#xD;
      method. Voice-dialog is sometimes used as a therapeutic tool in western psychology. The BM&#xD;
      process guides individuals to shift their perspective, particularly in regard to&#xD;
      self-perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BM facilitates self-discovery by teaching participants to become aware of different aspects&#xD;
      of their sense of self by giving voice to these separate components. In other words, BM&#xD;
      facilitates becoming &quot;mindful&quot; or more aware of one's own cognitions and emotions. Aspects of&#xD;
      self may be cognitive constructs, such as the &quot;Controller,&quot; the &quot;Skeptic,&quot; the &quot;Self-Critic,&quot;&#xD;
      the &quot;Cheater&quot; and &quot;Doubt&quot; or emotional states, such as &quot;Fear,&quot; &quot;Anger,&quot; &quot;Joy&quot; or &quot;Compassion&quot;&#xD;
      or sensations, such as &quot;Pain.&quot; During a BM session, participants develop self-awareness by&#xD;
      speaking as specific component, or &quot;voice&quot; of self, such as &quot;the voice of Fear.&quot; Temporarily&#xD;
      assuming the identity of an aspect in principle allows in depth exploration of the cognitions&#xD;
      and emotions associated with that particular construct. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      his process can be therapeutically useful because facets associated with negative traits&#xD;
      (e.g. the Cheater) or unpleasant affect (Fear) may be partially repressed and unacknowledged&#xD;
      by the self. Bringing disowned voices to light facilitates working with cognitions and&#xD;
      emotions in a more constructive way. For example, when one experiences chronic symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety (fear), the tendency is to try to avoid or prevent the unpleasant emotion. However,&#xD;
      &quot;fear of the fear&quot; actually increases the discomfort and may result in the adoption of&#xD;
      maladaptive strategies, such as excessive substance use or avoidance. Further, &quot;fear of fear&quot;&#xD;
      likely exacerbates anxiety by increasing the baseline level of fear and perpetuating a&#xD;
      vicious cycle of fear leading to even greater fear. BM offers a unique approach by giving&#xD;
      active voice to the fear. Thus, one is able to examine the fear closely and come to recognize&#xD;
      that it is transient and not harmful. When one both allows and actively encourages the&#xD;
      experience of fear, the &quot;fear of fear&quot; dissipates and more adaptive behavior strategies can&#xD;
      be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BM process teaches how to shift perspective, therefore providing a means to escape the&#xD;
      cycle of repetitive self-criticism and unconscious behavioral patterns and emotional&#xD;
      responses. This is accomplished by viewing one's thoughts and behaviors from a neutral&#xD;
      standpoint rather than from an ego based or self-focused perspective. Becoming &quot;mindful&quot; of&#xD;
      these patterns facilitates taking conscious control of cognitive and emotional responses&#xD;
      rather than being controlled by them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to decreasing negative cognitions and emotions, the investigators also&#xD;
      hypothesize that BM increases mindfulness and decreases the analytic self-referential&#xD;
      thinking associated with depression and PTSD. One can become less attached one's self-concept&#xD;
      as well as the overall importance of self. This change in perception decreases the need to&#xD;
      think about self analytically and increases one's ability to experience life in the here and&#xD;
      now (mindfully).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BM has been used extensively over the last decade as a method of spiritual self-discovery.&#xD;
      However, it has not been used as a clinical intervention. Scientific studies have not been&#xD;
      conducted with the exception of one published study which suggested effectiveness as a rapid&#xD;
      spiritual intervention tool. This study also provided preliminary evidence that the BM&#xD;
      process increases mindfulness and decreases depression and anxiety. Based on the evidence for&#xD;
      other mindfulness interventions discussed above, the investigators hypothesize that an&#xD;
      adjunctive BM group intervention will decrease PTSD, mood and anxiety symptoms as well as&#xD;
      increase physical pain tolerance among veterans with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Big Mind intervention will be presented in a group format. There will be four group&#xD;
      sessions (90 minutes per group) and sessions will occur once weekly. Groups will be held in a&#xD;
      classroom or group room at the George E. Wahlen VAMC. The number of subjects per intervention&#xD;
      will be 5 - 10. The intervention will be repeated until a maximum of 30 subjects have been&#xD;
      enrolled. Subjects will be given homework assignments to complete between group sessions.&#xD;
      Each session will include BM group practice and review of homework assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will complete six instruments at three time points of assessment: 1)&#xD;
      baseline assessment prior to session one; 2) mid-point assessment during the intervention&#xD;
      (end of week 2) and 3) post-intervention (end of week 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attendance and reports of adverse events will be collected throughout the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject feedback will be obtained post-intervention (end of week 4).&#xD;
