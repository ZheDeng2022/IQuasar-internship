  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Report of Asthma Deaths published in 2014 highlighted significant deficiencies&#xD;
      in both primary and secondary care resulting in one of the highest mortality rates in Europe.&#xD;
      A key recommendation in the report is the provision of an annual asthma review in primary&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telehealthcare is an alternative means of service delivery incorporating the use of telephone&#xD;
      and e-mail consultations which may improve access and quality of patient care. There is scant&#xD;
      data on the role of teleheathcare in asthma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre, primary care-based, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the use&#xD;
      of telehealthcare to conduct the annual asthma review for adult patients with well-controlled&#xD;
      asthma. This will be compared with standard care (face-to-face consultations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telehealthcare will consist of a telephone consultation followed by an e-mail with an&#xD;
      attached personalised asthma action plan and a link to a video demonstrating inhaler&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care will involve a face-to-face consultation in primary care. The two patient&#xD;
      groups will be compared prospectively to determine whether there is a difference in the&#xD;
      quality of care evaluated in terms of the patient experience/ satisfaction, health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, asthma control and frequency of asthma exacerbations over a 6 month period&#xD;
      after the asthma review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be presented in the form of frequency tables, bar charts and pie charts.&#xD;
      Non-parametric tests will be applied to determine whether there is a significant difference&#xD;
      in the quality of care received.&#xD;
