    <intervention_name>Elotuzumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Elotuzumab will be administered intravenously at a dose of 10mg/kg weekly (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 4-233k cycle) of the first 2 cycles and every 2 weeks (Day 1 and Day 15) thereafter.&#xD;
A window of -1 to +3 days is permitted in Cycles 1 and 2. In Cycle 1 and 2, an elotuzumab dose that falls outside of the pre-specified window must be skipped. In Cycles 3 and beyond, elotuzumab dosing may be delayed for up to 1 week as clinically indicated. If unable to administer within 1 week, then the dose should be skipped and resumption of the elotuzumab continues per the guidance document defined schedule. In addition the following premedication must also be administered 30-90 minutes prior to any elotuzumab:&#xD;
H1 blocker: diphenhydramine (25-50mg PO or IV) or equivalent&#xD;
H2 blocker: ranitidine (50mg IV) or equivalent&#xD;
acetaminophen (650-1000mg PO)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed Written Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) Before any program procedures are performed, the patient will have the details of&#xD;
             the program described to him or her, and she or he will be given a written informed&#xD;
             consent document to read. Then, if the patient consents to participate in the program,&#xD;
             she or he will indicate that consent by signing and dating the informed consent&#xD;
             document in the presence of program personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) Patients must be willing to refrain from blood donations during program drug&#xD;
             therapy and for 8 weeks after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age and Reproductive Status&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Men and women, aged 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
                  pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24&#xD;
                  hours prior to the start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Women must not be breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. WOCBP must use method(s) of contraception as indicated in the Informed Consent&#xD;
                  Form. Because of the teratogenic potential of elotuzumab, a highly effective&#xD;
                  method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is required.&#xD;
                  The individual methods of contraception and duration should be determined in&#xD;
                  consultation with the investigator. In this study men and WOCBP must be using&#xD;
                  methods of contraception for at least 1 month (4 weeks) before and women for up&#xD;
                  to 8 weeks, men for up to 90 days, after the last dose of elotuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
                  failure rate of less than 1% per year. The investigator shall review&#xD;
                  contraception methods and the time period that contraception must be followed.&#xD;
                  Men that are sexually active with WOCB must agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
                  method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with elotuzumab plus 5&#xD;
                  half-lives of the program drug plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a&#xD;
                  total of 90 days post-treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Women who are not of childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or&#xD;
                  surgically sterile and azoospermic men do not require contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sex and Reproductive Status&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. WOCBP not using 2 forms of effective birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  program medication.&#xD;
