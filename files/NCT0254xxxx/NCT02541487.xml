      This is a cross-sectional comparison study of three maternal and fetal groups. Patients&#xD;
      studied are women (and their fetus if they conceive) participating in the Reproductive&#xD;
      Medicine Network's (RMN) FIT-PLESE investigation (funded, the NuPA and PAo arms) compared to&#xD;
      control mothers who decline the intervention protocols and their fetuses if they conceive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Via participation in the FIT-PLESE study (from the RMN) we will randomize 90 obese women with&#xD;
      unexplained infertility 1:1 to a lifestyle modification program consisting of nutritionally&#xD;
      balanced caloric restriction (1200-1500 kcal/d), a gastric lipase inhibitor (Alli) and&#xD;
      increased physical activity (with a goal of reaching 10K steps/d) (NuPA) versus increased&#xD;
      physical activity alone (PAo). The pre-pregnancy intervention lasts 16 weeks, with a goal of&#xD;
      7% weight loss in the NuPA arm. Weight and physical activity are monitored with wireless&#xD;
      devices (Fitbit Wireless Activity Tracker and Fitbit Aria Wireless Activity Scale,&#xD;
      respectively). Following the 16 week pre-pregnancy intervention, all randomized couples will&#xD;
      undergo standard treatment for unexplained infertility, 3 cycles of CC-IUI (requiring ~3&#xD;
      months). The goal for both treatment groups is to maintain levels of physical activity and&#xD;
      weight achieved during the pretreatment phase during the empiric infertility treatment phase.&#xD;
      Women who conceive will be followed throughout pregnancy with the wireless activity monitors&#xD;
      and wireless scales. Additionally there will be three brief onsite visits during pregnancy&#xD;
      (at 16, 24 and 32 weeks) for determination of weight, waist circumference, glycemic measures&#xD;
      (fasting glucose, insulin, and HgbA1C), apolipoprotein lipids, and blood pressure.&#xD;
      Nutritional intake will be assessed with The Dietary Assessment Questionnaire and Diet&#xD;
      History Questionnaire II (DHQ II), the instrument chosen by FIT-PLESE investigators&#xD;
      (http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/dhq2/). The primary outcomes of FIT-PLESE are the&#xD;
      live-birth rate, birth weight, gestational age at delivery, and congenital anomaly rate. The&#xD;
      subject inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the Human Subjects section. There is&#xD;
      no overlap between the aims of FIT-PLESE and those of the present R21 proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three maternal and fetal groups for this proposal are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIT-PLESE participants (University of Pennsylvania Central IRB approved)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Nutritional/Physical Activity (NuPA) Intervention: Obese participants in the&#xD;
      FIT-PLESE clinical trial randomized to the nutritional restriction /AlliTM/physical activity&#xD;
      arm that achieve pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Physical Activity only (PAo) Intervention: Obese participants in the FIT-PLESE&#xD;
      clinical trial randomized to the exercise only arm that achieve pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (University of Oklahoma IRB approved) Group 3 (Infertile, non-lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention controls): Obese women (60) with unexplained infertility who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for FIT-PLESE but decline participation in the trial and who&#xD;
      elect to undergo CC-IUI treatment and achieve pregnancy without prior diet and exercise&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have extensive experience evaluating fetal morphometry from women participating in a&#xD;
      prospective study designed to assess the relationship between maternal and neonatal adiposity&#xD;
      (n=77) who have already undergone similar ultrasound and biomarker measurements during&#xD;
      pregnancy at OUHSC. The data have been collected and are being analyzed. These non-diabetic&#xD;
      women with uncomplicated pregnancies were evenly distributed between pre-pregnancy BMIs for&#xD;
      normal weight (BMI &lt;24.9, n=23), overweight (BMI 25-29.9, n=29) or obese (BMI 30&gt;, n=25).&#xD;
      These women conceived spontaneously and did not undergo diet or exercise intervention (see&#xD;
      preliminary data below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess participants of Group 1, 2 and 3 prior to pregnancy and during each trimester&#xD;
      at 16, 24, and 32 weeks gestational age for the mothers who conceive. We will then evaluate&#xD;
      each fetus of those who conceive during each trimester of pregnancy at the same gestational&#xD;
      ages. We will evaluate newborns within one week of delivery for body composition. All&#xD;
      participants will have the same inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
