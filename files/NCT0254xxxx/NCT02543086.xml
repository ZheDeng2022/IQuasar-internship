  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center open label study conducted in multiple sequential cohorts using&#xD;
      Induced Blood Stage Malaria infection in healthy volunteers to characterize the effectiveness&#xD;
      of KAE609 against sexual and asexual blood stage forms of Plasmodium falciparum. This study&#xD;
      is divided in 2 parts (Part A and part B). A total of 8 healthy volunteers per cohort will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Based on the results of Part A, Part B will be undertaken to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      KAE609 following pretreatment with Piperaquine on sexual stage/gametocytemia and its activity&#xD;
      as an inhibitor of onward transmission to mosquito vectors using experimental mosquito&#xD;
      feeding assays.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is single center multiple sequential Cohort study divided in 2 parts (Part A and part&#xD;
      B). A total of 8 healthy volunteers per cohort will be enrolled in Part A, which will focus&#xD;
      on characterizing the antiparasitic activity of KAE609 after single dose administration in&#xD;
      the human Induced Blood Stage Malaria model. Once Part A is completed, Part B will evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of KAE609 following pre-treatment with Piperaquine on sexual stage/gametocytemia&#xD;
      and its activity as an inhibitor of onward transmission to mosquito vectors using&#xD;
      experimental mosquito feeding assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part A the threshold for commencement of treatment for an individual subject will occur&#xD;
      if Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction quantification of all participants in that Cohort&#xD;
      is ≥ 1,000 parasites/mL or if Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction quantification of any&#xD;
      participant is ≥ 5,000 parasites/mL, and there is clinical evidence of malaria, as defined by&#xD;
      a Clinical symptom score ≥6. The First cohort will be dosed with a single dose of KAE609.&#xD;
      During Part A, an additional second single-dose of KAE609 for subsequent cohorts may be&#xD;
      tested (~15 days after first dose of KAE609 but may vary) if sexual parasitemia is&#xD;
      identified. Subsequent cohorts of part A (An) will be dosed based on the results of first&#xD;
      cohort (A1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part B, the threshold for commencement of treatment for an individual subject will be&#xD;
      when Polymerase Chain Reaction quantification of all participants is ≥ 5,000 parasites/mL or&#xD;
      if the Polymerase Chain Reaction quantification of any participant is ≥ 5,000 parasites/mL&#xD;
      and is accompanied by a clinical symptom score ≥6, before all participants have reached the&#xD;
      treatment threshold (PCR quantification of ≥ 5,000), then treatment of that participant will&#xD;
      begin within a 24 h period. Cohort B will receive a pre-treatment with Piperaquine (480 mg)&#xD;
      followed by KAE609 (~15 days) after Piperaquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initial treatment with KAE609 (Part A) or Piperaquine (Part B) on Day 1,&#xD;
      participants will be followed up as in-subjects for at least 72 hours to ensure tolerance of&#xD;
      the treatment and clinical response. If subjects are clinically well as per judgment of the&#xD;
      Investigator, they will be discharged and will be monitored on an outpatient basis for safety&#xD;
      and clearance of malaria parasites via Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction. If any study&#xD;
      subjects in a cohort in Part A show evidence of gametocytemia after initial treatment with&#xD;
      KAE609, a second single-dose of KAE609 will be administered to those subjects as out patient.&#xD;
      In part B where significant gametocytemia is expected because the initial Piperaquine&#xD;
      treatment is not expected to clear gametocytes, a single dose of KAE609 will be administered&#xD;
      at the time of peak gametocytemia. The KAE609 dose for Part B will be selected during the&#xD;
      study, based on Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic and safety analysis of Part A. If&#xD;
      recrudescent asexual parasitemia is identified, compulsory commencement of rescue medication&#xD;
      will be used. Treatment for recrudescence will be a single dose of Piperaquine only for Part&#xD;
      A. In addition, compulsory terminal curative treatment will be administered to all&#xD;
      participants at the end of study. Participants will be monitored for three days to ensure&#xD;
      adherence to the rescue medication therapy. Adverse events will be monitored via telephone&#xD;
      monitoring, within the clinical research unit, and on out-subject review after malaria&#xD;
      challenge inoculation and antimalarial study drug administration. Blood samples for safety&#xD;
      evaluation, malaria monitoring, and red blood cell antibodies will be drawn at screening and/&#xD;
      or baseline and at nominated times after malaria challenge.&#xD;

    <description>This study is divided in 2 parts (Part A and part B). Each participant in each of the cohorts will be inoculated with viable parasites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes administered intravenously. For Part A &amp; Part B, commencement of treatment will be determined by Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction results.&#xD;
The First cohort of Part A (A1) will be dosed with a single dose of KAE609. During Part A, an additional second single-dose of KAE609 may be tested (~15 days after first dose of KAE609 but may vary) if sexual parasitemia is identified. Subsequent cohorts of part A (An) will be dosed based on the results of first cohort (A1).&#xD;
