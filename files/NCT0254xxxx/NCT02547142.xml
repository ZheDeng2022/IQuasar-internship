  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care physicians and nurses are trained to help reduce suffering and improve&#xD;
      quality of life in patients under their care. Their services also include other components&#xD;
      such as referral to dietitians, social workers and community resources, to assist patients in&#xD;
      their homes. In addition to this, they may also administer interventions to make patients&#xD;
      more comfortable, assisting them and their families in making important decisions and&#xD;
      providing support, during that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, palliative care is provided to esophageal cancer patients on an as-needed basis,&#xD;
      through the referral of a heath care professional or the patient's request. This study aims&#xD;
      to assess the impact of the integration of early palliative care combined with appropriate&#xD;
      medical care in the metastatic esophageal cancer population, so that patients can benefit&#xD;
      from these services at an earlier stage. It is hoped that this will improve quality of life,&#xD;
      symptom management, depression and anxiety, as well as survival.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous reports suggest that starting palliative care early in patients with breast,&#xD;
      colorectal, prostate and lung cancers appear to improve quality of life, symptom management,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and perhaps even survival, but it has never been tested in patients with&#xD;
      esophageal cancer.This study aims to assess the impact of the introduction of early&#xD;
      palliative care services on the esophageal cancer population, as opposed to traditional&#xD;
      palliative care, which is provided on an as-needed basis, usually in end-of-life situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective one-armed pre-post intervention evaluation. Eligible patients that&#xD;
      have consented will receive an early consultation with the palliative care group. In addition&#xD;
      to this, the patients will be administered appropriate oncological care including surgical,&#xD;
      brachytherapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy services. The patients will be referred to the&#xD;
      palliative service at the time of consent, with a consultation taking place within one week&#xD;
      of referral receipt. The nurses and physicians involved in the palliative service will not&#xD;
      only provide symptom management, psychosocial support, assistance with treatment related&#xD;
      decisions and other patient needs. Information about symptoms, anxiety and depression, and&#xD;
      quality of life will be collected through surveys at two timepoints - at baseline, when the&#xD;
      patient consents and at 12 weeks post diagnosis of metastatic disease. The primary outcome of&#xD;
      the study is the change in quality of life perceived by esophageal cancer patients at the two&#xD;
      timepoints. Secondary outcomes include differences in esophageal cancer specific symptoms and&#xD;
      anxiety and depression scores at the two timepoints, as well as patient survival information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is integrated into the currently operational Esophageal Diagnostic Assessment&#xD;
      Program (EDAP) conceptualized and implemented at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. It is&#xD;
      hoped that this study will also help to establish the full integration of palliative care&#xD;
      into the overall care of patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
