  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of autologous&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (MNC) collected from bone marrow (BM) and intracoronary delivery for&#xD;
      individuals with declining performance of their single right ventricle systemic pumps. This&#xD;
      procedure has the potential to foster a new strategy for congenital heart patients. This is&#xD;
      an open-label study of autologous MNC derived from bone marrow with a 2-year follow-up to&#xD;
      document 1) related serious adverse events and 2) monitor changes in cardiac structure and&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

      This study is an open label Phase I trial to determine the safety and feasibility of bone&#xD;
      marrow-derived mononuclear cells delivered into the coronary circulation of subjects with&#xD;
      Fontan circulation and right ventricular dysfunction. Subjects will be screened at outpatient&#xD;
      clinic visits at Mayo Clinic and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered&#xD;
      participation in this trial. Once informed consent has been obtained; preoperative values&#xD;
      will be established and a selection committee will review subjects within three days prior to&#xD;
      planned procedure to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria. This will require a non-study&#xD;
      cardiologist to review the clinical case and confirm the baseline cardiac function with&#xD;
      evidence of disease progression with right ventricle dysfunction. However, individuals with&#xD;
      decreased cardiac function requiring inotropic support and immediate listing for cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation will NOT be included such that the risk of this research procedure may not be&#xD;
      acceptable. Following cell-based product delivery, subjects will be followed for 6-months&#xD;
      according to a pre-determined schedule that includes imaging studies along with&#xD;
      questionnaires, electrophysiology and laboratory studies. Subjects will be contacted for an&#xD;
      additional 18-months for surveillance by phone.&#xD;
