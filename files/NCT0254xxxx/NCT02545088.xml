  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to establish the added value of training with the&#xD;
      Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) exoskeleton system as part of regular rehabilitation intervention&#xD;
      programs after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) to compare potential effects on functioning and disability of gait and mobility training&#xD;
      long-term after stroke by comparing A) HAL-training combined with conventional rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions to B) conventional rehabilitation interventions without HAL and to C) no&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of the interventions will be assessed in terms aspects of body function,&#xD;
      walking ability and endurance as well as level of activity in daily living and participation&#xD;
      assessed at the end of intervention and at a 6 and 12 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive gait training with HAL is performed 1 session/day, 3 days/week for 6 weeks and each&#xD;
      session will not exceed 60 min of effective walking time with HAL. In addition, each session&#xD;
      will include conventional gait training that will not exceed 30 min effective training time.&#xD;
      To standardize the training procedure, training with HAL is performed on a treadmill and to&#xD;
      enable body weight support. Body weight support is used to prevent falls and to unburden the&#xD;
      weight of the suit (9 kg). The training program is performed by physiotherapists, trained in&#xD;
      the HAL method and the study procedures. At the end of the 6 weeks, the physiotherapist that&#xD;
      has been engaged in the patient's conventional training will perform 1-2 home visits to&#xD;
      inform/educate the patient and those who are providing assistance to the patient in how the&#xD;
      patient can make use of any gains in gait function during activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st control group will receive conventional gait training performed 1 session/day, 3&#xD;
      days/week for 6 weeks that will not exceed 1h 30 min effective training time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2nd control group will not receive an intervention. The conventional gait training is&#xD;
      performed according to current best evidence based practice and may include over ground&#xD;
      walking with assistance and/or assistant devices as well as the use of a treadmill and body&#xD;
      weight support and training of gait function in activities of daily living&#xD;

             &lt;0.8m/s according to 10 meter walk test, which corresponds to limitations in community&#xD;
             ambulation (Bowden et al 2008)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand training instructions as well as written and oral study&#xD;
             information and to express informed consent or by proxy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body size compatible with the HAL suit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contracture restricting gait movements at any lower limb joint&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular or other somatic condition incompatible with intensive gait training&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe, contagious infections (e.g. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA)&#xD;
             or Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase bacteria).&#xD;
