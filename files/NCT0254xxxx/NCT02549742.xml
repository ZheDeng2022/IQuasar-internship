    <textblock>
      A phase II clinical trial testing electrochemotherapy on mucosal recurrent head and neck&#xD;
      cancer. Twenty-five patients will be treated. Primary outcome is tumour response on imaging.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are response from tissue samples, VAS score, Quality of life evaluation&#xD;
      and side effects to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electric pulses may be used to transiently permeabilise cell membranes, enabling passage of&#xD;
      otherwise non-permeating molecules. This dramatically enhances the cytotoxic effect of&#xD;
      certain chemotherapeutic agents, and is termed electrochemotherapy. Electrochemotherapy is&#xD;
      now standardly used in the treatment of cutaneous metastases of various cancers in over 100&#xD;
      cancer centers around Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention of this trial is to investigate the possible use of electrochemotherapy in&#xD;
      recurrent head and neck cancer as a palliative treatment. Surgery and radiotherapy, with the&#xD;
      possible addition of chemotherapy, cures a large part of patients with head and neck cancer.&#xD;
      However, in the event of recurrence curative options may be exhausted and the patient is&#xD;
      referred for palliative chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is for this patient group, the investigators propose electrochemotherapy in a clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrochemotherapy is administered as a once-only treatment, with possible retreatment&#xD;
      after eight weeks. Under general anesthesia, chemotherapy is administered intravenously,&#xD;
      followed by application of electric pulses to the tumour area. Before treatment, the location&#xD;
      and spread of the tumour is determined by imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial includes evaluation of response by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and PET/CT&#xD;
      (Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography) scans (base-line, 4 weeks, 8 weeks),&#xD;
      tissue samples, as well as adverse events registration and questionnaires on quality of life.&#xD;
      The planned study is a phase II clinical study, prospective, observational with up to 25&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will be performed in collaboration between the Department of Oncology, Copenhagen&#xD;
      University Hospital Herlev, which has extensive experience in electrochemotherapy, and the&#xD;
      Department of Ear Nose and Throat Surgery at Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet,&#xD;
      that has the surgical expertise and set-up needed.&#xD;
