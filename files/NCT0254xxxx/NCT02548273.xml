      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal changes in diabetics after phacoemulsification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cataract is one of the common cause of reversible blindness. In diabetics, Age-related&#xD;
      cataract occurs earlier and nuclear cataract is more common and tends to progress rapidly.&#xD;
      True diabetic cataract is a rare condition usually occurring in young adults due to the&#xD;
      osmotic over-hydration of the lens. Initially a large number of fluid vacuoles appear&#xD;
      underneath the anterior and posterior capsules, which is soon followed by the appearance of&#xD;
      bilateral snowflake-like white opacities in the cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic hyperglycemia also inhibits the function of Na+ k+ ATPase activity thereby causing&#xD;
      dysfunction of the corneal endothelial cell layer. The endothelial cell morphology is also&#xD;
      abnormal in diabetics. Polymegathism and Pleomorphism are noted. The cornea is also found to&#xD;
      be thicker in diabetics owing to the slower recovery of corneal edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation is one of the most common surgical&#xD;
      procedures performed for cataract surgery with a smaller incision, which decreases the tissue&#xD;
      injury, reduces post-operative pain and inflammation, and provides a rapid refractive&#xD;
      stabilization. Surgeries that are done for cataract result in decrease in the endothelial&#xD;
      count of which phacoemulsification has lesser degree of endothelial damage compared to those&#xD;
      of other surgeries. Parameters like nucleus density(1), axial length(2) and the ultrasound&#xD;
      power(3) also influence the endothelial cell count after phacoemulsification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the central corneal thickness and endothelium after phacoemulsification in&#xD;
           diabetics in comparison with non-diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the factors associated with Corneal endothelial cell damage after&#xD;
           phacoemulsification in diabetics in comparison with non-diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shultz et al(4) in the study on morphologic changes in corneal endothelial cells in diabetics&#xD;
      for a duration of more than 21 years, found that diabetic corneal endothelial cell changes&#xD;
      are caused continuously even after ocular operations, because the diabetic cornea is unstable&#xD;
      and vulnerable. They found annual rates of reduction in corneal endothelial cells were 2.5%&#xD;
      per year in operated eyes having extracapsular cataract extraction and 0.3% to 0.5% in normal&#xD;
      individuals, thus showing a higher reduction rate in the surgically treated eyes by 10 year&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furuse and coauthors(5) compared the morphologic changes in corneal endothelial cells after&#xD;
      performing planned Extra capsular cataract extraction on 96 normal aged cataract patients and&#xD;
      diabetic patients. They observed that there was no significant difference between the 2&#xD;
      groups in terms of the density of corneal endothelial cells, the co-efficient of variation in&#xD;
      cell size, and the cell hexagonality until 12 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goebbels and spitznas(6) performed flurophotometry of the corneal endothelium before and 4&#xD;
      days, 3 weeks and 6 weeks after phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation and&#xD;
      endothelial permeability was evaluated in the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Endothelial permeability did not differ between the diabetic and non diabetic groups before&#xD;
      operation, markedly increased in both groups 4 days after operation and recovered 3 weeks&#xD;
      after operation in the non diabetic group but 6 weeks after operation in the diabetic group.&#xD;
      This result was consistent with delayed recovery of endothelial function in the cornea of&#xD;
      diabetic patients after cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lee et al(7) studied the effect of the severity of retinopathy on endothelial loss post&#xD;
      phacoemulsification and found an increased loss of endothelial cells and increased&#xD;
      coefficient of variation in patients with high risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy when&#xD;
      compared with patients with non proliferative diabetic retinopathy or patients without&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Su et al(8) designed a population based cross sectional study including 3239 eyes and&#xD;
      examined the relationship of diabetics and CCT. They found that diabetes is associated with&#xD;
      greater CCT, independent of age, sex and IOP levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inoue et al(9) investigated corneal endothelial structure and corneal thickness in 99 eyes&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes and 97 control eyes without diabetes. They found a decrease in cell&#xD;
      density and an increase in coefficient of variation and concluded that the corneal&#xD;
      endothelial cell structure was damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether the study involves humans : Humans only or animals or both&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study : Case control study Number of groups : 2 groups. Group 1 - phacoemulsification&#xD;
      in diabetics Group 2 - phacoemulsification in non-diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size : 80 patients in each group. The sample size is estimated with an expected&#xD;
      difference of 19 in corneal thickness at 5% level of significance and 80% power. The minimum&#xD;
      sample size estimated was 70 in each group. The sample size is further modified with an&#xD;
      expected drop out of 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was approved by the Institute Ethical Committee. The study was done on patients&#xD;
      attending ophthalmology outpatient services for visual ailments.Essential data such as name,&#xD;
      age, sex and hospital number of patients enrolled were noted. The purpose and details of the&#xD;
      study were explained to each subject and after obtaining informed consent, patients were&#xD;
      recruited into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, detailed ocular examination including visual acuity (using Snellen's chart or&#xD;
      equivalent E optotypes), refraction, slit lamp examination, corneal endothelial count and&#xD;
      morphology assessment (ECD, CV, hexagonality) using Konan noncon robo specular microscope&#xD;
      (Model - NSP 9900) and corneal thickness using ultrasonic pachymeter were done for all&#xD;
      patients planned for phacoemulsification surgery. Specular microscopy and pachymetry were&#xD;
      measured by the same observer for all subjects. CCT was measured after topical anesthesia&#xD;
      using one drop of proparacaine eye drops (0.5% w/v) and an average of three readings was&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative mydriasis, phacoemulsification time and power were noted. Postoperatively,&#xD;
      visual acuity, ocular inflammation scores, corneal thickness, CD, CV and hexagonality were&#xD;
      measured on the first week, six weeks and three months. Ocular inflammation score was&#xD;
      calculated based on the SUN (Standardization of uveitis nomenclature) working group grading&#xD;
      scheme for anterior chamber cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test for differences between groups in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics was&#xD;
      done using the Chi-Square test for categorical variables. Independent student's t test or&#xD;
      Mann Whitney's U test was used for comparing continuous variables. To identify the&#xD;
      independent factors associated with the outcome, multiple logistic regression analysis was&#xD;
      used. Preoperative versus postoperative modifications within the groups were verified using&#xD;
      two-way repeated measures ANOVA. All statistical tests were carried out at 5% level of&#xD;
      significance and p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data analysis was&#xD;
      performed using SPSS (version 20.0, SPSS Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an Increase in central corneal thickness and decrease in corneal endothelial count&#xD;
      after phacoemulsification surgery in diabetics in comparison to non-diabetics.&#xD;
