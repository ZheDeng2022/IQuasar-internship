  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in for treatment of benign intracranial hypertension will undergo two tests that are&#xD;
      not routinely performed for these patients: central corneal thickness and axial length of the&#xD;
      eye. The data obtained from these measurements will be assessed to see if the correlate with&#xD;
      aspects of vision loss including visual acuity, visual field status, optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) results, and fundus photographs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with benign intracranial hypertension would be identified at diagnosis from the&#xD;
      general ophthalmic and neurologic patient population in the Ochsner Health System. All would&#xD;
      have a baseline eye examination with visual field and optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
      testing, a standard step in managing any patient with this condition. Two measurements would&#xD;
      be taken at minimal risk to the patient that they would not normally have done at the&#xD;
      baseline exam: central corneal thickness and axial length. These procedures are routinely&#xD;
      done on patients with glaucoma, corneal disease, and cataracts without a significant risk of&#xD;
      injury. The theoretical risks with central corneal thickness and axial length measurements by&#xD;
      A-scan ultrasonography are related to the small risk for transmission of infection or corneal&#xD;
      abrasion due to a probe touching the cornea. These tests would be performed at no charge to&#xD;
      the patient and would not significantly increase the time of the ocular examination. Patients&#xD;
      would have neuro-imaging studies and lumbar puncture to confirm the diagnosis of benign&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension as standard parts of the work up for the condition independent of&#xD;
      the research study. The authors will statistically analyze the standard measures of visual&#xD;
      field function and health of the nerve fiber layer by OCT to see if any or all of the&#xD;
      proposed risk factors correlates with deterioration of visual function. Data would continue&#xD;
      to be collected at follow up visits related to visual fields and OCT as would normally be&#xD;
      performed on standard visits for this condition. The measurements of central corneal&#xD;
      thickness and axial length would be performed solely at the time of enrollment in the study&#xD;
      since these measurements do not change over time.&#xD;
