    <textblock>
      The search for genetic alterations in primary tumor by NGS techniques followed by the&#xD;
      detection of these alterations in circulating tumor DNA and/or CTC/DTC present in peripheral&#xD;
      samples (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, possibly urine) collected during several&#xD;
      steps and after the treatment could be a tool to monitor the response during and after the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
