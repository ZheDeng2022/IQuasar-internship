    <textblock>
      Depression is a common disorder, especially in old age, where it is associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether there are features of individual patients with major&#xD;
      depression that may predict positive treatment response. The study will invite 40 patients&#xD;
      who have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder with onset after the age of 60 years&#xD;
      to participate. Participants will be recruited from the Mental Health of Older Adults&#xD;
      services at the South London and Maudsley NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust. Participants&#xD;
      will receive usual treatment as set out in standard Care Pathways, used by the clinical care&#xD;
      team. As part of the study, they will undergo a short battery of neuropsychological tests and&#xD;
      a standard MRI brain imaging protocol. The neuropsychological tests and assessment of&#xD;
      depression severity will be carried out twice (at Baseline and Week 12). Data will be&#xD;
      analysed to investigate whether there are features specific to those patients who show a good&#xD;
      response to antidepressant treatment after 12 weeks. Identification of such predictors may&#xD;
      help to stratify treatment approaches in the future and lead to the early identification of&#xD;
      individual patients who may require alternative treatment approaches to standard&#xD;
      antidepressants.&#xD;

      Aim and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors of treatment response may help to improve treatment approaches in late-onset major&#xD;
      depression patients. The study will identify features of patients with major depression that&#xD;
      may predict good and poor treatment response. It will use demographic, clinical,&#xD;
      neuropsychological and brain MRI data to investigate the potential value of these as&#xD;
      predictors of response to standard treatment over 12 weeks. For example, impairment of&#xD;
      executive functioning on cognitive testing may predict patients whose depression does not&#xD;
      respond to 12 weeks of treatment. MRI may reveal specific characteristics that predict good&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Subject inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion: Patients with major&#xD;
      depressive disorder, diagnosed for the first time after the age of 60 years, with a Mini&#xD;
      Mental State Examination score &gt;24/30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion: Participants with a history of other major psychiatric illness or intellectual&#xD;
      disability will be excluded. Those who have unstable medical conditions, including a history&#xD;
      of neurological disease (stroke, epilepsy, recent delirium, neurodegenerative disease or&#xD;
      dementia) will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with late-onset major depressive disorder will be identified by members of care&#xD;
      teams of the Mental Health of Older Adults Services of the South London and Maudsley NHS&#xD;
      Foundation Trust. A poster and information leaflet about the study will be also provided to&#xD;
      the services to facilitate recruitment. The researcher will also use the trust Consent for&#xD;
      Contact (c4c)' mechanism to assist the recruitment process. Potential participants who&#xD;
      contact the researcher or give their permission to be contacted will be sent a written brief&#xD;
      information sheet and invited to respond via an expression of interest letter and a stamped&#xD;
      and addressed envelope. If they are interested, a consent for screening and medical record&#xD;
      review will be sought. And following screening for the absence of significant cognitive&#xD;
      impairment with the Mini-Mental State Examination by the researcher if this has not already&#xD;
      been performed, they will be provided with a full information sheet and be invited to consent&#xD;
      to participate in the study at their home or the IOPPN depending on participants' preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening assessment will be done at potential participants' residences. A brief&#xD;
      history of psychiatric and medical conditions will be taken. Participants will be interviewed&#xD;
      with the following assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a 30 point assessment for general cognitive&#xD;
           function, with exemption if they have been completed in clinical work within 1 month of&#xD;
           the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI safety questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      If potential participants are eligible for inclusion into the study and remain interested,&#xD;
      written information will be left with them and an appointment will be made for further&#xD;
      discussion and gaining informed consent. If they are not eligible for the study on the basis&#xD;
      of screening, or decide not to proceed at this stage, all data collected will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent visit and baseline assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have been encouraged to read all information sheets carefully and will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask further questions at this stage. Their capacity to consent will be&#xD;
      assessed by the researcher and they will then be asked to provide verbal and written consent&#xD;
      to be involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following baseline assessment and neuropsychological tests will be performed at&#xD;
      participants' homes or the IOPPN depending on participants' preference and last about one and&#xD;
      a half hour:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data including sex, age, marital and living status, number of education&#xD;
           years completed, and occupation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical data including current prescribed medical treatment, current depressive episode&#xD;
           onset and treatment type, dosage and duration received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIR-G) is a scoring questionnaire for&#xD;
           assessing underlying medical disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), a self-rating scale and Hamilton Depression&#xD;
           Rating Scale (HAM-D 21 items), an interview-based rating scale are used for depressive&#xD;
           severity assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. WHODAS 2.0 is a questionnaire assessing general functioning and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Neuropsychological tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Trail making test - a pen and paper based test for processing speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Digit span and Spatial Span tests - tests for working memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Verbal fluency, category fluency and design fluency - tests for fluency that ask&#xD;
                participants to generate words or pictures in the rules given.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Colour-Word Interference test - a paper-based reading test for inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A letter will be sent to participants' GPs to inform them of their participation. The GP may&#xD;
      be asked to confirm or provide information in case of the participant has questionable&#xD;
      medical history that might contraindicate an MRI procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scan procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo an MRI scan at the CNS based at the IOPPN within 4 weeks of&#xD;
      baseline assessment. A taxi will be provided for participants to travel to the IOPPN. At the&#xD;
      CNS, participants will be encouraged to ask any questions and the MRI safety questionnaire&#xD;
      will be repeated to ensure there are no contraindications. Noise protection will be provided&#xD;
      to the participants and a mock scan will be offered to familiarize them with the real MRI&#xD;
      scanner if they would like this. Participants will then undergo a structural and functional&#xD;
      MRI scan, the latter includes asking them to close their eyes for a period of time. The MRI&#xD;
      scan will last about 1 hour. After the MRI scan, transport by taxi will be provided to return&#xD;
      participants to their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final assessment At Week 11, the researcher will contact the participants and make an&#xD;
      appointment for the final assessment at Week 12 at their home or the IOPPN depending on&#xD;
      participants' preference. The final assessment will last about one hour. Participants will&#xD;
      undergo the same assessment as in baseline assessment and the Mini-Mental State Examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that throughout and following the study, participants will receive standard care,&#xD;
      following the Trust Care Pathway.&#xD;
