      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of low vs. high eating frequency (EF)&#xD;
      on biomarkers of health and subjective appetite.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between eating frequency&#xD;
      (EF), obesity, and other markers for disease risk. It has been suggested that consumption of&#xD;
      several small, frequent meals may influence physiological mechanisms, reducing the risk for&#xD;
      disease and lowering appetite. Participants in this randomized crossover study completed two&#xD;
      intervention phases lasting three weeks each: one of low eating frequency (&quot;low-EF&quot;; 3 eating&#xD;
      occasions/day) and one of high eating frequency (&quot;high-EF&quot;; 8 eating occasions/day). Fasting&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor, and leptin were measured at baseline and&#xD;
      endpoint of each phase and an optional subjective appetite testing session lasting four hours&#xD;
      was offered at the endpoint of each phase. During appetite testing sessions, participants&#xD;
      consumed an amount of food equal in total energy and macronutrient content at either one&#xD;
      occasion at 8:00 am (&quot;low-EF&quot; condition) or spread evenly over two smaller eating occasions&#xD;
      at 8:00 am and 10:30 am (&quot;high-EF&quot; condition). Ratings of hunger, desire to eat, fullness,&#xD;
      thirst, and nausea were made every 30 minutes using paper-and-pencil semi-anchored 100-mm&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scales. A composite appetite score was calculated as the mean of hunger, desire&#xD;
      to eat, and 100-fullness. The generalized estimating equation modification of linear&#xD;
      regression was used to compare fasting plasma biomarkers and mean ratings of subjective&#xD;
      appetite.&#xD;
