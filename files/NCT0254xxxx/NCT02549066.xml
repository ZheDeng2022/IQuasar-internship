  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), especially when oxygen delivery is low, is&#xD;
      associated with acute kidney injury. Unpublished data shows that renal oxygen delivery is&#xD;
      compromised during CPB due to low hematocrit and redistribution of blood flow away from the&#xD;
      kidneys. We wish to study if increased CPB flow can improve renal oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who develop cardiac failure after weaning from CPB will be treated as per our&#xD;
      departments routine with the inotropic agent milrinone, and measurements will be made before&#xD;
      and after treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as a 50 % increase in serum creatinine above baseline, is&#xD;
      a complication commonly seen in the intensive care unit. After cardiac surgery with&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass, up to 30% of the patients develop AKI and about 2-5% requires acute&#xD;
      dialysis. AKI renders increased morbidity, mortality and costs, and the mortality rate&#xD;
      increases with the degree of renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of AKI is considered to be a multifactorial process, where renal ischemia,&#xD;
      nephrotoxic agents and inflammatory processes all contribute. Oxygen delivery to the kidney&#xD;
      is compromised in states of low cardiac output, severe hypotension and anemia. The renal&#xD;
      medulla, utilizing large amounts of oxygen in the tubular sodium reabsorption mechanism, is&#xD;
      hypoxic already under normal conditions and therefore especially susceptible to acute renal&#xD;
      ischemia. In postoperative AKI, Redfors et al showed that renal vasoconstriction in&#xD;
      combination with high medullary oxygen consumption deteriorates the oxygen supply-demand&#xD;
      relationship. This supply-demand mismatch of the renal oxygenation is considered a key&#xD;
      mechanism of medullary ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in cardiac surgery is associated with AKI, but the&#xD;
      mechanisms remain unclear. Institution of CPB changes vasomotor tone and decreases renal&#xD;
      perfusion pressure. Hemodilution during CPB could potentially improve microcirculatory flow&#xD;
      through reduced blood viscosity, but it might also reduce the oxygen delivery to the renal&#xD;
      medulla. The extracorporeal circulation triggers the systemic inflammatory response syndrome,&#xD;
      contribute to hemolysis and micro embolization, all with negative renal effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      de Somer and co-workers recently showed that during CPB, a nadir delivery of oxygen (DO2) of&#xD;
      &lt; 262 mL/minute/m2 is independently associated with AKI. This emphasizes the importance of&#xD;
      oxygen delivery. Preliminary data from a recent study indicates that CPB induces a&#xD;
      significant renal oxygen demand/supply mismatch due to a 25% fall in renal oxygen delivery&#xD;
      (RDO2), in turn caused by a haemodilution and redistribution of RBF away from the kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPB flow-rates varies between different centres depending mainly on empirical experience.&#xD;
      Common flow-rates at the institution of CPB; 2,2-2,5 L/minute/m2 equals the average cardiac&#xD;
      index in anesthetized adults with normal hematocrit. Potential benefit from low flow is less&#xD;
      oedema, less haemolysis, less hypertension during hypothermic CPB and reduction of the&#xD;
      bronchial blood flow that rewarms the heart and might obscure the surgeons view. Increased&#xD;
      CPB flow is routinely used when indications of inadequate perfusion such as lactataemia,&#xD;
      increased pCO2 or low central venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is seen. Mackay and co-workers&#xD;
      showed that increased CPB flow significantly increased renal perfusion during normothermic&#xD;
      CPB in pigs. Adluri et al found that higher pump flow during hypothermic CPB in man increased&#xD;
      hepatic blood flow. However, the impact of higher than usual flow rates on renal hemodynamics&#xD;
      and oxygenation has not been studied in man.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to study the impact of increased CPB flow on renal oxygenation, filtration fraction&#xD;
      and blood flow. Renal vein and pulmonary artery catheters will be inserted after the start of&#xD;
      anesthesia. During stable conditions after the start of CPB and aortic cross clamp, the CPB&#xD;
      flow will be altered in a randomized fashion. Measurements will be made at three different&#xD;
      CPB flows, ranging from our clinical standard 2,4 L/min/m2 up to 3,0 L/min/m2. Additional&#xD;
      measurements will be made after weaning from CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac failure requiring inotropic support after weaning from CPB is not uncommon. In our&#xD;
      department, the drug of choice is milrinone. The effects of milrinone on systemic circulation&#xD;
      has been well established, but the renal effects has not been studied in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients requiring inotropic support after CPB using the criteria below milrinone will be&#xD;
      administered (0,04 mg/kg as a loading dose and 0,50 ug/kg/min as subsequent infusion).&#xD;
      Measurements of systemic and renal variables will be made before and 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: Central venous pressure (CVP) ≥ 12 mmHg AND/OR Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure&#xD;
      (PCWP) ≥ 16 mmHg AND Cardiac Index (CI) ≤ 2,1 L/min/m2 AND Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) &lt;&#xD;
      12 %.&#xD;
