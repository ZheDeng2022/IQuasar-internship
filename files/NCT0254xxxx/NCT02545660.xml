  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During orthodontic treatment bacterial plaque readily accumulates on the teeth. This is&#xD;
      because food easily accumulates around the braces and it is more difficult to clean when the&#xD;
      braces are in place. The plaque accumulation can lead to demineralisation (white spots)&#xD;
      developing on the teeth. This is the start of decay and can lead to permanent marks and&#xD;
      fillings being required.Prior to the start of orthodontic treatment adequate oral hygiene is&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During orthodontic treatment, it is important that patients have an excellent level of oral&#xD;
      hygiene to prevent plaque accumulating and demineralisation occurring. However, adequate&#xD;
      tooth brushing can be difficult to perform as the bacterial plaque is not easily visible.&#xD;
      Thus patients may not be able to see which areas need better tooth brushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QLFD(Quantitative Light Induced Fluorescence Digital) is a noninvasive method that uses&#xD;
      fluorescent light to illuminate the oral bacteria in plaque that are responsible for&#xD;
      demineralisation. The purpose of this study is to use the QLFD camera to assess its ability&#xD;
      to measure plaque accumulation and demineralisation before the start of orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment. The study will also assess the QLFD camera as a tool to improve oral hygiene.&#xD;

      Plaque is a contributing factor for the development of dental diseases including tooth decay&#xD;
      and gum disease. Thus, an excellent standard of oral hygiene is required to ensure all plaque&#xD;
      is removed from the teeth to reduce the risk of developing these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque accumulation starts and is greatest at plaque stagnation sites, which tend to be at&#xD;
      the gum margins. In orthodontic treatment, the brackets and archwires are significant plaque&#xD;
      stagnation sites.Conventional tooth brushing is also more difficult compounding the increased&#xD;
      plaque accumulation and retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very important that patients learn to recognize the presence of plaque to ensure&#xD;
      optimal levels of oral hygiene are achieved. Frequently patients have difficulty localizing&#xD;
      the deposits to enable optimal levels of oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demineralisation occurs due to bacterial fermentation of dietary sugars, which produces&#xD;
      acids. This leads to white marks developing on the tooth surfaces, which is the first stage&#xD;
      of dental caries. The risk of demineralisation is increased during orthodontic treatment, as&#xD;
      there tends to be greater plaque accumulation. Previous studies have reported prevalence&#xD;
      rates of demineralisation during orthodontic treatment to be as high as 96%. The most visible&#xD;
      front surfaces of the teeth are often the most severely affected which can have a detrimental&#xD;
      impact on their appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early demineralisation can be reversible if plaque control is improved, however progresses&#xD;
      cavities may develop which require restoration. The main form of management of&#xD;
      demineralisation is prevention. This is mainly by having an excellent level of oral hygiene&#xD;
      and having a diet with a limited number of sugar intakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During orthodontics, patients frequently find it difficult to detect the plaque around the&#xD;
      braces, thus oral hygiene is often not adequate. This leads to greater plaque accumulation&#xD;
      and an increased risk of developing demineralisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QLFD Biluminator is a noninvasive novel device, based on previous QLF technology. In&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo studies of the former QLF device demonstrated it to be appropriate for&#xD;
      identifying demineralisation and longitudinal monitoring of mineral changes during&#xD;
      orthodontics. The advantage of the new QLFD device is that it takes a white light image in&#xD;
      addition to a QLF image. Having two images, taken nearly simultaneously, allows comparisons&#xD;
      to be made and ensures consistency with regards to magnification and angulation. From these&#xD;
      images, plaque accumulation and demineralisation can be measured. In addition,&#xD;
      demineralisation can be detected on QLF images before it is evident on white light images,&#xD;
      which is of great benefit to clinicians in detecting at risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess plaque accumulation and demineralisation using the new QLFD device&#xD;
      before the start of orthodontic treatment. It will also assess its use as an oral hygiene&#xD;
      evaluation tool to improve patients tooth brushing who have inadequate oral hygiene to start&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment. White light and QLF images will be taken with the QLFD device and&#xD;
      patients will be given focused oral hygiene advice based on these images.&#xD;
