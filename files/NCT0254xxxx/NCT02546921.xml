    <textblock>
      This first in human study of the new therapeutic antibody MOv18 IgE in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer seeks to demonstrate the potential for the use of this IgE antibody as an example of&#xD;
      the use of the IgE class of antibodies for the treatment of cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic antibodies have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with a range of&#xD;
      cancers. Currently available therapeutic antibodies belong to the IgG class. This study is&#xD;
      looking at a new drug called MOv18 which belongs to a different class of antibody, the IgE&#xD;
      class. IgE antibodies may trigger a more powerful immune response to tumour cells than these&#xD;
      available IgG antibodies and so be more effective in treating certain types of cancer. This&#xD;
      is the first time an IgE antibody therapy will be given to patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOv18 IgE antibodies are designed to recognise and attach to a particular protein called the&#xD;
      folate receptor alpha. Scientists have found more of this protein on the surface of certain&#xD;
      cancer cells than on the surface of normal cells, most commonly ovarian cancer and to a&#xD;
      lesser extent cancers of the kidney, pleura, endometrium, lung, breast, bladder, colon and&#xD;
      pancreas. Once attached, the MOv18 IgE antibody should trigger the body's own immune system&#xD;
      to attack and kill the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected based on the presence of folate receptor protein on their tumour in&#xD;
      a previous biopsy. The study is the first study of this new antibody treatment to be given to&#xD;
      humans and will focus primarily on the assessment of safety confirming the findings of&#xD;
      preclinical studies that exposure to MOv18 IgE will not trigger anaphylaxis. This is in&#xD;
      addition to extensive PK, biodistribution of the antibody and immunological response. The&#xD;
      study will follow a dose escalation design where small groups of patients are treated at a&#xD;
      set dose, starting with a very low dose followed by exponential increasing doses, to find a&#xD;
      safe dose at which the drug has a good chance of effectively treating the cancer. Patients&#xD;
      will receive a short course of treatment. The majority of patients treated at the higher dose&#xD;
      levels will be asked to provide a pre and post treatment biopsy to explore the effect of the&#xD;
      treatment on the tumour.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically-proven advanced, unresectable solid tumour of a type&#xD;
             known to express FRα in a percentage of cases&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Archival tumour tissue expressing FRα (1+, 2+ or 3+ membrane staining on at least 5%&#xD;
             of tumour cells by immunohistochemistry using the BN3.2 antibody, based on the&#xD;
             technique described by Lawson &amp; Scorer, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Advanced disease for which no alternative therapy is felt to be appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease or disease evaluable by tumour marker. Measurable disease is&#xD;
             preferred for patients entering higher cohorts to facilitate efficacy assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1 and a life expectancy of&#xD;
             at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below. These&#xD;
             measurements should be performed within 7 days before the first dose of MOv18 IgE (Day&#xD;
             -7 to Pre-dose on Day 1). Measurements performed before Day -7 may be accepted by the&#xD;
             CDD to demonstrate eligibility if repeat testing is logistically difficult for the&#xD;
             patient and is not considered necessary medically in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             or CDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Laboratory Test Value required Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥&#xD;
             1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5&#xD;
             x ULN unless raised due to liver metastases in which case up to 5 x ULN is permissible&#xD;
             Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Aged 16 years or over at the time consent is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Written (signed and dated) informed consent and capable of co-operating with treatment&#xD;
             and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy, immunotherapy or&#xD;
             chemotherapy during the previous four weeks (six weeks for nitrosoureas and&#xD;
             mitomycin-C) and investigational medicinal products during the previous 4 weeks, or 5&#xD;
             product half-lives before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients on beta-blockers and unable to interrupt beta-blockade (which may counteract&#xD;
             the therapeutic effects of adrenaline), or tricyclic anti-depressants/MAOIs (which can&#xD;
             dangerously augment the effects of adrenaline). These agents should be discontinued at&#xD;
             least 4 half-lives before administration of the first dose of MOv18 IgE and for the&#xD;
             duration of MOv18 IgE therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients on bisphosphonates or treated with bisphosphonates in the last 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments that have not resolved to Grade 1&#xD;
             or lower (other than alopecia of any grade or Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known brain metastases that have not been previously treated and been stable for at&#xD;
             least 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female patients who are able to become pregnant (or already pregnant or lactating).&#xD;
             However, those female patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             before enrolment and agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral,&#xD;
             injected or implanted hormonal contraception and condom; have an intra-uterine device&#xD;
             and condom; diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom) effective at the first&#xD;
             administration of IMP, throughout the study and for six months afterwards are&#xD;
             considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take&#xD;
             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception at&#xD;
             the first administration if IMP, throughout the study and for six months afterwards)&#xD;
             or agree to sexual abstinence*. Men with pregnant or lactating partners should be&#xD;
             advised to use barrier method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel)&#xD;
             to prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             * Abstinence is only considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when this&#xD;
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence&#xD;
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
             not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. At high risk from the effects of anaphylaxis because of non-malignant systemic disease&#xD;
             including active uncontrolled infection, cardiac failure, peripheral vascular disease,&#xD;
             previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dyspnoea due to heart failure, extensive lung&#xD;
             metastases, significant pleural effusions or other conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of laryngeal oedema, uncontrolled or high risk asthma (according to Global&#xD;
             Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines), or anaphylaxis. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to carboplatin, taxanes, or contrast media may enter the study at the&#xD;
             investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with any congenital or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or receiving&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy (including any dose of systemic corticosteroids), or who are&#xD;
             immunosuppressed post organ transplant. However, patients receiving inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids and patients with a history of allergy (other than anaphylaxis) are&#xD;
             eligible, as are patients with a history of auto-immune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with baseline elevation in serum tryptase (indicating possible mastocytosis)&#xD;
             or a positive baseline basophil activation test (indicating a hypothetical potential&#xD;
             for anaphylaxis with MOv18 IgE).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Participating or planning to participate in another interventional clinical trial,&#xD;
             whilst taking part in this study. Participation in an observational study or in the&#xD;
             follow-up phase of a previous interventional trial is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a&#xD;
             good candidate for the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients unwilling or unable to interrupt antihistamines (which may interfere with&#xD;
             skin prick testing). Antihistamines should be discontinued at least 4 half-lives&#xD;
             before the first skin prick test.&#xD;
