      The primary objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of time on levels of&#xD;
      Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP)&#xD;
      biomarker levels in a population of head injured subjects over the age of 18 presenting&#xD;
      acutely with a Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15 as well as in a group of uninjured control&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Subjects eligible for study participation will be over the age of 18 with a standard of&#xD;
        care head CT result from the local neuroradiologist and be able to undergo an initial blood&#xD;
        draw within 6 hours of head injury. Subjects who will be permitted into the study include&#xD;
        those who will meet all the inclusion criteria and will have none of the exclusion&#xD;
        criteria. Subjects enrolled into the control cohort will be recruited from the general&#xD;
        population.&#xD;
