    <textblock>
      Currently there is uncertainty on how schizophrenic patients feel pain. Pain has several&#xD;
      components including cognitive behavior which allow humans to perceive it as a negative&#xD;
      emotion. It is difficult to say precisely what are the differences in cognitive processing&#xD;
      between the emotional component of pain and painless another negative emotion (eg fear).&#xD;
      However, pain and negative emotion have some neural networks together and there are many&#xD;
      common ways between emotional processing (pain or negative) and storing information (limbic&#xD;
      system).&#xD;

      The study is to go 1 time in hospital for memory test. These tests consist in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: words to painful sense will be shown on a screen, one at a time for 5 seconds.&#xD;
           Patient or healthy volunteer will need to retain them. Then these same words, mixed with&#xD;
           others that patient/healthy volunteer will not learn, will again be displayed on the&#xD;
           computer screen one at a time for 5 seconds. Upon the occurrence of a word,&#xD;
           patient/healthy volunteer must press the 'L' key if they think they have learned the&#xD;
           word or the &quot;D&quot; key on the keyboard if they feel that they have not learned this word.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: words to negative sense will be shown on a screen, one at a time for 5 seconds.&#xD;
           Patient or healthy volunteer need to retain them. Then these same words, mixed with&#xD;
           others that patient/healthy volunteer will not learn, will again be displayed on the&#xD;
           computer screen one at a time for 5 seconds. Upon the occurrence of a word,&#xD;
           patient/healthy volunteer must press the 'L' key if they think they have learned the&#xD;
           word or the &quot;D&quot; key on the keyboard if they feel that they have not learned this word.&#xD;
&#xD;
           15 schizophrenic will be included in group 1 and 15 other schizophrenics in group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           15 Healthy volunteer will be included in group 1 and 15 other Healthy volunteer in group&#xD;
           2.&#xD;
