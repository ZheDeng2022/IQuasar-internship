        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Healthy, non-smoking, male or female between the ages of 18 and 55 years (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI between 18 and 32 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, is of non-child bearing potential (i.e., surgically [bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, hysterectomy, hysteroscopic sterilization, or tubal ligation]. Or, is&#xD;
             naturally sterile [&gt;12 consecutive months without menses]) with verification by&#xD;
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If male and non-vasectomized, must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain&#xD;
             from sexual intercourse during the study until 30 days beyond the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug. No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his vasectomy has&#xD;
             been performed 4 months or more prior to first dose of study drug. A male who has been&#xD;
             vasectomized less than 4 months prior to study start must follow the same procedure as&#xD;
             a non-vasectomized male.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant abnormal findings during physical examination including&#xD;
             blood pressure, heart rate or rhythm, clinical laboratory tests or 12-lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, endocrine, pulmonary,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurological or psychiatric disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thyroid stimulating hormone test at screening outside the normal range. Repeat testing&#xD;
             is allowed once at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent (&lt;6 months) hepatobiliary disease; or aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
             (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or direct bilirubin greater than the upper limit&#xD;
             of reference range at screening. Repeat testing is allowed once at the discretion of&#xD;
             the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elevated creatine kinase (CK) at screening (one repeat test allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gilbert's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive screening test for HIV antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal screening ECG: including machine-read QTc &gt;450 msec (confirmed by manual over&#xD;
             read), QRS &gt;110 msec, intermittent bundle branch block, frequent premature atrial or&#xD;
             premature ventricular contractions, or any rhythm other than normal sinus rhythm which&#xD;
             is interpreted by the Investigator to be clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to a similar study drug (e.g., Karo Bio KB2115 or Metabasis&#xD;
             MB7811), or a history of important drug or other allergy (except for untreated,&#xD;
             asymptomatic seasonal allergies at time of dosing) unless deemed not clinically&#xD;
             significant by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to thyroid medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of intolerance to or adverse reaction to a statin, or history of myopathy&#xD;
             including rhabdomyolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intolerance to beta-blockers (beta-blocker treatment could be appropriate to alleviate&#xD;
             tachycardia if observed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational drug (or medical device)&#xD;
             within the last 30 days prior to the first dosing day, or who have been exposed to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to forgo consumption of red wine, Seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit&#xD;
             juice and/or pomelos, star fruit, grapefruit hybrids or other citrus juices from 5&#xD;
             days prior to the first dose of study drug and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of drug or alcohol abuse as defined by the Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual 5th Edition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14&#xD;
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of&#xD;
             hard liquor) within 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of acetaminophen within 7 days before dosing and throughout the study except for&#xD;
             the treatment of an adverse event as directed by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of regular use of tobacco or nicotine containing products within the past 6&#xD;
             months relative to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine drug screen or alcohol test at screening or Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, or are nursing.&#xD;
