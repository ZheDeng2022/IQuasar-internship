      Investigation of clinical practices, safety and effectiveness of Cerebrolysin in routine&#xD;
      treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a devastating disease and one of the primary causes for death and long term&#xD;
      morbidity imposing a heavy burden on patients, relatives and the health care system. Except&#xD;
      for fibrinolytic therapy, which is only possible in a minor fraction of patients, there is no&#xD;
      widely approved medication for the treatment of acute stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin has been approved for the treatment of stroke in over 45 countries worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the approval of Cerebrolysin, stroke therapy has evolved, namely, with improved overall&#xD;
      care, stroke units, more targeted rehabilitation, and the increasing availability of&#xD;
      fibrinolytic therapy (rtPA, Actilyse) in specialized centers throughout the world. More&#xD;
      recently, interventional therapies with various thrombus retrievers have emerged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the Cerebrolysin treatment in stroke has evolved with different time windows,&#xD;
      dosages and lengths of therapy being given in a pragmatic way by physicians within the&#xD;
      specification of Product Characteristics for Cerebrolysin (SPC). The main aim of this study&#xD;
      is to capture these variables of the Cerebrolysin treatment and its comedication in order to&#xD;
      give guidance to further research. This research may consist of an extension of the current&#xD;
      registry or targeted research in one or several subgroups of patients responding to&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore the overall aim of this registry study to monitor the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of Cerebrolysin therapy against the background of the now established and evolving&#xD;
      stroke therapies. In the concomitant control group these therapies alone or in combination&#xD;
      will be compared to the addition of Cerebrolysin in these patients. Of particular interest is&#xD;
      the treatment in stroke units, with rtPA and systematic rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open observational treatment design has been chosen to collect data to capture the&#xD;
      therapies as applied in real clinical practice and to avoid the selection bias typical for&#xD;
      controlled studies excluding the majority of patients from participation. In order to&#xD;
      overcome the observational bias as major and inherent limitation of open trial designs, a&#xD;
      remote and blinded assessment will be done: after three months treatment the patients'&#xD;
      assessment of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a widely accepted primary outcome parameter)&#xD;
      will be -after specific informed consent- video-taped and subsequently assessed by at least&#xD;
      two independent and blinded assessors experienced in the remote assessment of the mRS.&#xD;
