  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin injuries due to trauma are relatively common, and patients are very concerned about&#xD;
      scars caused by trauma and primary repair. Recently, the use of ablative and non-ablative&#xD;
      lasers based on the fractional approach has become a novel strategy for the treatment of&#xD;
      scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of dual-mode Er:YAG laser delivering&#xD;
      pulses either with and without heat/coagulation in a cohort of patients with long&#xD;
      keloid/hypertrophic scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that ablative fractional laser without heat/coagulation is equivalent&#xD;
      to laser with heat/coagulation in terms of scars volume reduction, while the secondary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that ablative fractional laser without heat/coagulation is superior in terms of&#xD;
      post-operative erythema and hypopigmentation reduction.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin injuries, such as lacerations or abrasions, due to trauma are relatively common, and&#xD;
      patients are very concerned about scars caused by trauma and primary repair. Multiple&#xD;
      modalities for improving the clinical appearance of scars have been attempted with varying&#xD;
      success, including corticosteroids, dermabrasion, surgical revision, chemical peeling,&#xD;
      silicone gel application, pressure therapy, and radiation. Lasers such as the carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (CO2), erbium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG), and pulsed dye (PDL) lasers have all been&#xD;
      used with differing success in the treatment of scars. The goal of all these treatments is to&#xD;
      soften depressions and stimulate neocollagenesis in order to fill in the residual defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablative lasers used for skin resurfacing, such as the CO2 and Er:YAG laser, can reduce&#xD;
      various scars, but significant adverse effects limit their use, and patient downtime can be&#xD;
      extensive. Owing to these potential risks, nonablative lasers have been developed as a safe&#xD;
      alternative to ablative laser resurfacing, and have been reported to be effective and safe&#xD;
      for scars. However outcomes have remained unsatisfactory and require several treatments to&#xD;
      achieve satisfactory efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the use of ablative and non-ablative lasers based on the fractional approach has&#xD;
      become a novel strategy for the treatment of scars, and some authors have suggested that&#xD;
      treatment with fractional lasers for various scars, such as postoperative, atrophic, and acne&#xD;
      scars, has been demonstrated to safely improve the appearance of the scars. However, there is&#xD;
      a lack of studies comparing coagulation modality of such lasers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of dual-mode Er:YAG laser delivering&#xD;
      pulses either with and without heat/coagulation in a cohort of patients with long&#xD;
      keloid/hypertrophic scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, investigator initiated, double blind, within-subject split-lesion&#xD;
      design, equivalence randomized clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients, referring to Dermatology outpatient and fulfilling inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      are included. Participants are then randomly assigned to get treatment with Er:YAG laser on&#xD;
      half of scar section side by equally splitting the lesion area in two symmetric and uniform&#xD;
      parts. One side will be treated with coagulation while the other one will be without. In case&#xD;
      of multiple lesions per patient, only the largest and most uniform one is selected for the&#xD;
      study purpose.&#xD;
