  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the effect of a probiotic supplement (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052&#xD;
      and Bifidobacterium Longum R0175) dissolved in a dairy product such as milk or ice-cream on&#xD;
      symptoms of ADHD and anxiety in children. The main goal is to determine if probiotics might&#xD;
      be useful as a treatment for anxiety and ADHD symptoms in children. A second goal is to&#xD;
      examine the effects of probiotics on saliva cortisol levels. Finally, the investigators are&#xD;
      also interested in the effects of the probiotics on children's digestive health.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited using information distributed through schools in the Annapolis&#xD;
      Valley area and with the use of advertising campaigns visible across Nova Scotia as&#xD;
      previously described. Interested participants will be directed to the study's website&#xD;
      (www.probioticstudy.com), where they will be able to view a complete summary of the study's&#xD;
      timeline and details. After reviewing the website, guardians of potential participants will&#xD;
      be able to complete an initial consent form and preliminary questionnaire in order to&#xD;
      determine their child's eligibility for participation. The process of completing the consent&#xD;
      form and initial questionnaires is expected to take approximately 15 minutes. Participants'&#xD;
      responses to the preliminary questionnaire will be reviewed by the researchers, and initial&#xD;
      appointments will be scheduled, either at the Acadia University location or the Halifax&#xD;
      location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be enrolled in the study for a thirteen-week period with a six-month&#xD;
      follow-up session. The first week will be an information-gathering week during which&#xD;
      participants will complete a daily food diary online with their parents' assistance. Each&#xD;
      evening during this initial week, and at the end of each week throughout the study period,&#xD;
      the child will answer a few questions about his or her symptoms of anxiety and/or ADHD, and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal health. Parents/guardians will answer parallel questions about the child's&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and/or ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality will be maintained by assigning each participant a code number based on the&#xD;
      last four digits of their phone number and the first letter of their last name when they&#xD;
      begin the study (for siblings the first letter of their first name will be used). The food&#xD;
      diary and all other subsequent questionnaires will be matched with the participant's data via&#xD;
      their code number. Participants or their guardians will be required to remember their&#xD;
      individual code, although, in the event they forget their code number, a master list will be&#xD;
      kept on an external hard-drive in an encrypted, password-protected file, locked in the&#xD;
      researchers' office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During or shortly after the food-diary week, the researcher will schedule a meeting with each&#xD;
      participant and guardian in order to provide detailed instructions on the first phase of the&#xD;
      study and to obtain informed consent for continuation in the study from the parent/guardian&#xD;
      and assent from the child. During the first meeting parents/guardians will complete study&#xD;
      outcome measures. Child participants will also complete outcome measures and cognitive tests.&#xD;
      These measures will be administered once again following the completion of the first phase&#xD;
      (week five), following the four-week wash-out period (week nine), and the second phase (week&#xD;
      thirteen). These measures are the clinical trial's primary end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the information-gathering week, participants will begin the first phase of the&#xD;
      study. They will consume either the probiotic or placebo powder taken with milk or ice cream&#xD;
      for four weeks. For the second phase, the conditions will be reversed, and the participant&#xD;
      will consume the alternate substance for four weeks; thus, all participants will receive the&#xD;
      probiotic in one phase and the placebo in another phase. The order in which participants&#xD;
      receive the probiotics and placebo will be randomized within groups of ten participants to&#xD;
      ensure counterbalancing - i.e., roughly equal numbers of participants receiving probiotics&#xD;
      and placebo in the first phase. The four-week intervention phases will be separated by a&#xD;
      four-week washout period to ensure that any potential residual effects from the first phase&#xD;
      have passed by the time the second phase commences. Following the wash-out period,&#xD;
      participants will complete the relevant outcome measures once again to establish baseline&#xD;
      scores prior to beginning the second intervention phase. Because this a double-blind design,&#xD;
      the participants, their parents/guardians and the researchers administering the probiotics&#xD;
      and placebos will not be aware which powder (probiotic or placebo) the participant is&#xD;
      receiving in each of the two phases; only the Clinical Director at Lallemand Health Solutions&#xD;
      will be privy to the experimental condition of the participants. Morning saliva samples for&#xD;
      cortisol analysis will be collected from participants during weeks two (baseline visit), five&#xD;
      (second visit), nine (third visit), and thirteen (fourth visit) of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first week of each phase, the researcher will contact the participants by email or&#xD;
      phone on the third and sixth day to check in and make sure participants/their guardians do&#xD;
      not have any concerns and/or questions regarding their participation. Following the initial&#xD;
      week of each phase, participants will be contacted weekly in order to monitor progress and&#xD;
      address any concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During first and second meetings, parents will be supplied with either probiotic or placebo&#xD;
      powder as well as detailed instructions for the first and second intervention phases. At the&#xD;
      fourth and final appointment, participants will complete the aforementioned questionnaires&#xD;
      (if not done online) and be given the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about&#xD;
      the study. If participants wish to know during which phase they received the probiotic&#xD;
      formula, they be supplied with this information following the completion of the study.&#xD;
