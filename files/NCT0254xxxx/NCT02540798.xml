  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how pre-test anxiety levels affect the reproducibility of symptoms&#xD;
      during routine urodynamic testing in women. Urodynamics is a test that assesses the function&#xD;
      of the lower urinary tract, including the bladder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of urodynamic tests often determine treatment for patients, which may include&#xD;
      bladder retraining, medication and/or surgery. Thus, it is important for the results of&#xD;
      urodynamics to be accurate and representative of the patient's symptoms outside of the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-test anxiety levels in women undergoing urodynamics will be measured using a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire HADS (Hospital anxiety and depression scale). The patient, prior to their&#xD;
      routine urodynamics test, will fill out this self-administered questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproducibility of patient symptoms will be measured using a non-validated quantitative&#xD;
      bladder test assessment. The patient will fill out this self-administered quantitative&#xD;
      bladder assessment after their urodynamics test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-test anxiety and symptom reproducibility variables will be correlated against each&#xD;
      other to assess whether there is correlation between the two. A Spearman Rho test will be&#xD;
      used to assess the strength of the relationship.&#xD;
