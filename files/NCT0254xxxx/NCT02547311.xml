  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents and emerging adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience significant struggles&#xD;
      with their diabetes management resulting in worsening diabetes health and increased&#xD;
      complications. This population's declining well-being occurs during a time when they should&#xD;
      be at their healthiest and enjoying multiple exciting life transitions. Their worsening&#xD;
      diabetes management is complicated by the fact they are also learning how to become more&#xD;
      independent from their family in preparation for eventually leaving home. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      number of people under 20 years of age diagnosed with T1D has increased dramatically over the&#xD;
      past 10 years giving rise to increased concern about providing care to this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Team Clinic Intervention is an innovative clinical care approach to address the medical&#xD;
      and developmental needs of adolescents with T1D and their families. A group medical&#xD;
      appointment format will be used for routine diabetes clinic visits in middle school and high&#xD;
      school adolescents with T1D. Parents of these patients will be participating in their own&#xD;
      group during these clinic visits. The Team Clinic model incorporates developmentally tailored&#xD;
      peer support and novel learning tools, (e.g. games, physical activity, and/or interaction&#xD;
      through Internet resources, e.g. blogs, forums) into the shared medical appointment design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Team Clinic Intervention is to improve medical and psychological outcomes in&#xD;
      adolescents with T1D and their parents. The study will investigate, in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, the efficacy of a novel clinical care model that addresses the unique&#xD;
      developmental strengths and weaknesses of the T1D adolescent population. The Team Clinic&#xD;
      format streamlines clinical care delivery to this often-challenging patient population&#xD;
      without placing additional burden on youth, families, or clinics because the intervention&#xD;
      will be completed during routine diabetes care visits. Moreover, the Team Clinic approach&#xD;
      maximizes the benefits of peer support by delivering care in a group format to address the&#xD;
      sense of isolation that teens and families coping with chronic illness often feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, the Team Clinic Intervention will not only positively impact adolescents with&#xD;
      T1D and their families, but it could be used as a model of care for other adolescents with&#xD;
      chronic medical conditions struggling to remain involved and invested in their medical care.&#xD;
      Team Clinics may be one approach to successfully engaging adolescents in their diabetes care&#xD;
      prior to their transition away from home, which will help them remain invested and active in&#xD;
      their medical care through adolescence and young adulthood.&#xD;
