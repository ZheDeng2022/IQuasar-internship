    <textblock>
      Despite considerable advances in cancer treatment, patients with locally advanced lung cancer&#xD;
      still face a poor chance of survival and a high risk of experiencing serious, life&#xD;
      threatening treatment-related side-effects. These side-effects are poorly understood and&#xD;
      difficult to measure: it is therefore challenging to design new treatment strategies aiming&#xD;
      to decrease treatment toxicity and yet increase survival. At present, many patients present&#xD;
      with tumours so large that only a low palliative dose of radiation therapy can be offered in&#xD;
      order to keep the risk of side-effects to an acceptable level. In this project, named INHALE,&#xD;
      the possibility of irradiating lung cancer patients while they hold their breath in deep&#xD;
      inspiration (so called: Deep inspiration breath hold, or DIBH) will be investigated. In DIBH,&#xD;
      the healthy lung tissue is pushed away from the tumour, and even when a large tumour is&#xD;
      present, a high curative dose of radiation therapy can be offered. This technique is simple&#xD;
      and is widely used to treat breast cancer patients in our institution as well as in other&#xD;
      centres in the world. If positive, results from INHALE can be transferred easily and with&#xD;
      minimal costs throughout Denmark and the rest of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIBH has only sporadically been used in lung cancer patients to date, because of the&#xD;
      assumption that this patient group, often having a poor performance status, could not comply&#xD;
      with DIBH procedure. However, the investigators' experience has shown that the majority of&#xD;
      lung cancer patients can comfortably hold short repeated DIBHs during treatment sessions&#xD;
      throughout the eight weeks of their treatment course, even if they have a relatively poor&#xD;
      lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences in side-effects between patients treated with the INHALE regimen and a large&#xD;
      group of patients previously treated at our institution will be thoroughly investigated,&#xD;
      using both follow-up CT images and a range of clinical parameters. INHALE is a unique study&#xD;
      because of combining use of the highest level of technology to ensure high-quality treatment&#xD;
      in DIBH and a thorough scientific investigation of follow-up data. INHALE will provide an&#xD;
      improved understanding of how to assess and decrease treatment side-effects: consequently the&#xD;
      investigators aim to test the hypothesis in a large clinical trial in order to improve&#xD;
      survival of lung cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Lung cancer remains a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality. In Denmark,&#xD;
      the incidence has shown a slight, but robust decrease over the last 10 years in males, but&#xD;
      the incidence in females continues to increase. The relative survival at 5 years is only 11%&#xD;
      for men and 15% for women. While surgery is the treatment of choice in early stage disease,&#xD;
      radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is the only treatment modality with curative&#xD;
      potential in patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the overall survival remains poor and loco-regional disease progression or&#xD;
      recurrences are common. Clinical studies have indicated a radiation dose response&#xD;
      relationship, suggesting a higher radiation dose would improve local control. However, in a&#xD;
      recent randomized phase III trial RTOG0617, of standard-dose (60 Gy) vs. high-dose (74 Gy)&#xD;
      concomitant chemo-radiotherapy the overall survival was lowest in the high-dose arm. While&#xD;
      toxicity may not be the only explanation to the negative result of RTOG0617, an increased&#xD;
      rate of high-grade toxicity in the 74 Gy arm is certainly of major concern: this trial&#xD;
      furthermore highlights the limited current understanding of the mechanisms of treatment&#xD;
      related toxicities and how they limit our attempts to increase local control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy-related side effects are severe, yet difficult to assess and quantify. CTC AE is&#xD;
      the general golden standard tool for measuring adverse events. However, many patients have&#xD;
      heart and lung related comorbidity prior to the radiotherapy and it may be difficult to&#xD;
      completely distinguish comorbidity and treatment related toxicity, even if reliable baseline&#xD;
      data exist. The symptomatology of pneumonitis correlates poorly with radiological findings&#xD;
      and with a decline in lung function. Radiation induced heart toxicity is disputed in this&#xD;
      group of patients and not all physiological responses to radiotherapy are fully understood.&#xD;
      Serious or even lethal toxicities after high dose radiation therapy are underreported in&#xD;
      prospective trials, most likely because the mechanisms and the time span of toxicity was&#xD;
      different from the expected. A recent retrospective study13 described a positive correlation&#xD;
      between the delivered treatment dose and an increase in lung tissue density after treatment,&#xD;
      measured on consecutive follow-up CT scans. No correlation to clinical outcome was made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the understanding of radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity is still limited.&#xD;
      Reliable measures of toxicity are highly warranted in order to perform prospective trials&#xD;
      improving the therapeutic outcome of lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In DIBH radiotherapy, patients hold their breath during imaging for radiotherapy planning and&#xD;
      during radiotherapy delivery. DIBH results in profound anatomic changes: tumour motion is&#xD;
      minimised, the heart is drawn downward and the lungs are inflated and push the healthy away&#xD;
      from the target volume. DIBH is now the standard treatment for patients with mediastinal&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer. This technique is simple, cost-efficient and spares the&#xD;
      heart and lungs without any detriment to other healthy organs or to the target. However, lung&#xD;
      tumours represent an additional challenge as they are mobile: their daily position must be&#xD;
      assessed reliably in order to avoid underdosing the tumour and overdosing the healthy lung&#xD;
      The investigators recently performed a pilot study based on 17 lung cancer patients, and&#xD;
      found that most patients were able to maintain several consecutive deep inspiration breath&#xD;
      holds of each 20 seconds throughout the course of radiotherapy. No a correlation between the&#xD;
      FEV1 value and the ability to perform DIBH was observed. The range of FEV1 for the 17&#xD;
      patients was 1.2 - 3.2 litres (44-67% of predicted value). The patients were planned in both&#xD;
      DIBH and free breathing but treated in free breathing. DIBH plans resulted in a significantly&#xD;
      lower lung dose. However, previously it was observed that for some selected patients with&#xD;
      multiple targets, DIBH is not the best treatment option. This highlights the importance of a&#xD;
      full investigation of the potential benefits and drawbacks of DIBH in lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of INHALE is to investigate the feasibility of delivering safe and precise&#xD;
      DIBH lung cancer radiotherapy. The secondary aims of INHALE are to investigate the potential&#xD;
      of DIBH lung cancer radiotherapy to reduce treatment toxicity and to explore reliable and&#xD;
      logistically manageable toxicity endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. Is DIBH well tolerated by lung cancer patients throughout their treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b. Can the prescribed dose be delivered accurately and reproducibly to the target in DIBH?&#xD;
&#xD;
      1c. Is DIBH safe?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. d. What is the overall survival and the local progression free survival for patients&#xD;
           treated in INHALE?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a. Is DIBH dosimetrically beneficial for all patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      2b. What is the extent of the dosimetric benefit of DIBH? 3a. Is it possible to measure&#xD;
      radiation-induced lung damage (RILD) in lung cancer patients in a pragmatic way? 3b. Can&#xD;
      image-based measures be used for the assessment of toxicity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      INHALE is primary a feasibility study. It will be based on prospective inclusion of 80&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced NSCLC for treatment in DIBH. All patients with NSCLC referred&#xD;
      for concomitant or sequential chemo-radiotherapy can be included in INHALE. For the secondary&#xD;
      toxicity research questions, a historic cohort of approximately 350 patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC treated with concomitant or sequential chemo-radiotherapy in free breathing&#xD;
      from 2009-2014 will be used for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment planning Imaging for the treatment planning will be performed according to local&#xD;
      and national guidelines (www.dolg.dk) with the addition of a DIBH FDG PET/CT and two&#xD;
      consecutive DIBH CT scans to measure reproducibility of the consecutive DIBHs. The DIBH FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT will be acquired during the same session as the conventional FDG PET/CT (without&#xD;
      additional use of PET-tracer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audio-visual respiratory coaching will be applied to train the patients to hold their breath&#xD;
      at a comfortable and reproducible inspiration level. Video goggles will be used during&#xD;
      planning and during treatment, if treatment is applied in DIBH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that cannot comply with treatment in DIBH will be treated in free breathing and&#xD;
      registered as &quot;non compliant&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients a DIBH as well as a free breathing plan will be calculated using volumetric&#xD;
      modulated arc therapy technique, with constraints according to the national guidelines. The&#xD;
      plan with the lowest doses to lung and heart will be chosen for patient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Patients treated with conventional free breathing technique will be treated&#xD;
      according to standard clinical procedures including daily set-up to tumour position by cone&#xD;
      beam CT (CBCT). Patients treated with DIBH technique will be set-up with DIBH CBCT, a&#xD;
      technique requiring 2-3 consecutive DIBHs. DIBH treatment will be delivered gated. In case a&#xD;
      patient looses the ability to perform DIBH during the treatment course, the conventional free&#xD;
      breathing plan will be applied for the remaining treatment fractions and the patient&#xD;
      registered as non-compliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily position of the target volume will be monitored on the CBCT, assuring precise&#xD;
      delivery of the prescribed dose to the target(s). In case of differential motion between the&#xD;
      treatment targets (i.e. change in the spatial separation of the primary tumour relatively to&#xD;
      the lymph node metastases), these images will enable us to decide whether to proceed with the&#xD;
      treatment or re-scan the patient and adapt the treatment plan accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Patients will be followed according to national guidelines with the addition of&#xD;
      supplementary lung function tests. Furthermore, the patients will be asked to contact the&#xD;
      department in case of pneumonitis symptoms, i.e. dyspnoea, cough and moderate fever. At each&#xD;
      control visit, medication, symptoms and hospital admissions will be registered. All heart and&#xD;
      lung related diagnoses will be registered for all participating patients during the follow-up&#xD;
      period. Patients will be followed for five years or until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety In case of any toxicity of grade 4 or 5, patient history and treatment plans will be&#xD;
      reviewed. If association with treatment parameters is suspected, treatment constraints will&#xD;
      be prospectively adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The study is primary a feasibility study and for this mainly descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be employed. With regards to the analysis of frequency of dosimetrical&#xD;
      benefit of DIBH, assuming an underlying benefit rate of 75%, the width of the observed 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval based on binomial statistics is approximately 64%-84%. This is a&#xD;
      sufficiently accurate estimate of the rate of benefit from DIBH to initiate a phase III trial&#xD;
      and engage other centres in prospective testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary research questions several candidate toxicity endpoints are tested and&#xD;
      while the study is not powered to see a difference between the candidate endpoints, choosing&#xD;
      the endpoint with the apparent best discriminatory power for a phase III trial should be&#xD;
      expected to be the most effective strategy ('pick the winner' analysis). However, the&#xD;
      potential statistical advantage will be balanced against a medical priority. In this way a&#xD;
      maximum of knowledge from the data will be gained enabling the basis to formulate&#xD;
      well-founded hypotheses for future studies in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan The resulting toxicity from DIBH will be compared to a historical&#xD;
      cohort encompassing approximately 350 patients treated from 2009-2014 in free breathing at&#xD;
      investigators' institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cox proportional hazards model predicting the risk of RILD will be generated. We expect the&#xD;
      model to involve performance status, smoking status, tumour size and -location as predictors,&#xD;
      but the analysis will be based on a model reduction technique using backwards elimination,&#xD;
      possibly assisted by forced entry. The resulting Cox model will be used to generate expected&#xD;
      freedom from RILD curves. The predicted freedom from RILD can now be compared to the observed&#xD;
      Kaplan Meier curve for the trial patients. The relative risk of RILD (observed vs. expected)&#xD;
      can then be extracted. Bootstrap resampling or a published method using SAS software will&#xD;
      obtain confidence bands on the expected outcome curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison with the historic cohort will be made both as an &quot;intention to treat&quot; analysis.&#xD;
      The historic cohort will be identified in a database collected in a project already approved&#xD;
      by the Danish Board of Health (sagsnr. 3-3013-569/1/) and the Danish Data Protection Agency&#xD;
      (jour.nr. 30-1178) and administered by Lotte Nygård.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives It is expected that one or more of the toxicity endpoints in INHALE will be&#xD;
      solid enough to serve as a primary endpoint for a phase III trial of optimized radiotherapy&#xD;
      of locally advanced NSCLC, enabling the radiotherapy society to gain solid evidence for the&#xD;
      use of emerging technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, DIHB holds the potential for synergetic combination with other new principles,&#xD;
      e.g. dose painting with boost to radio-resistant areas of the tumour, as this technique&#xD;
      requires that tumour motion is minimal in order to deliver the dose correctly.&#xD;
