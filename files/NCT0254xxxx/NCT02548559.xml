  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label to double-blind study evaluating the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) for&#xD;
      the treatment of anxiety in adults. Participants will use a sublingual (under-the-tongue)&#xD;
      solution of whole plant-derived CBD or placebo three times daily for four weeks in addition&#xD;
      to their normal treatment regimen. Participants' clinical state will be assessed weekly&#xD;
      during the treatment period. In addition, cognitive function and measures of quality of life,&#xD;
      sleep, and general health will be assessed at baseline and the post-treatment final visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes across many cultures for a range of disorders&#xD;
      for thousands of years. The plant is comprised of a variety of components, such as&#xD;
      phytocannabinoids, which include (among others) the major intoxicating constituent of&#xD;
      cannabis, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabidiol (CBD), a major non-intoxicating&#xD;
      constituent of cannabis. Increasing evidence indicates that CBD in particular may have&#xD;
      significant medicinal properties and benefits; experimental studies in both animals and&#xD;
      humans have demonstrated that CBD can act as an anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, and muscle&#xD;
      relaxant. Several studies have demonstrated that CBD produces acute anxiolytic effects in&#xD;
      animals and humans, although thus far no clinical trials of CBD have been conducted in&#xD;
      patients with anxiety. As a growing number of states are legalizing medical cannabis, a gap&#xD;
      exists in the scientific literature regarding the effects of CBD on anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is composed of two phases. Phase 1 is comprised of a four-week, open-label&#xD;
      clinical trial of a high-CBD containing compound in individuals with anxiety. Participants&#xD;
      will be pre-screened by phone in order to evaluate their eligibility for the study. If&#xD;
      approved, participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit, and will&#xD;
      complete a structured clinical interview, clinical and quality of life questionnaires, and&#xD;
      cognitive assessments. Enrolled participants will be given CBD solution to use for the&#xD;
      duration of the study; participants will be instructed to self-administer 1 milliliter (ml)&#xD;
      of the tincture under the tongue three times per day for four weeks. Throughout the treatment&#xD;
      period, participants will return to the hospital on a weekly basis to complete questionnaires&#xD;
      about their mood and quality of life. Participants will also return to the hospital for a&#xD;
      final visit after four weeks of treatment to complete additional questionnaires and cognitive&#xD;
      assessments. Phase 1 of the study was completed in early 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the study is a double-blind clinical trial of this solution in patients with&#xD;
      anxiety. This double-blind trial began after the open-label trial was completed. In the same&#xD;
      manner as the open-label trial, participants will be pre-screened by phone, and approved&#xD;
      participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit to complete a&#xD;
      structured clinical interview, questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will also have the option to complete an hour-long MRI scan at the baseline and&#xD;
      final visits. Enrolled participants will receive either full-spectrum CBD solution,&#xD;
      single-compound CBD solution, or placebo solution to self-administer throughout the four week&#xD;
      treatment period, as described above. Participants will return to the hospital weekly during&#xD;
      the treatment period to complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life.&#xD;
      Participants in this phase of the study will also return for a final visit after four weeks&#xD;
      of treatment to complete additional questionnaires, cognitive assessments, and an optional&#xD;
      hour-long MRI scan. We are currently recruiting for Phase 2 of the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Self-Reported Anxiety as Assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI is a 21-item self-report measure used to rate subjective, somatic, and panic-related symptoms of anxiety on a scale of 0 to 3, and will be given to participants on a weekly basis.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Anxiety Assessed by the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The OASIS is a brief 5-item measure used to evaluate the functional impairment cause by anxiety that will be given on a weekly basis; the frequency and intensity of anxiety, as well as the degree of avoidance and interference with work and social function are rated on a scale of 0 to 4.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Self-Reported Anxiety Assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure is comprised of two 20-item scales, with a range of four possible responses from 1 to 4, and differentiates between the more temporary condition of &quot;state&quot; anxiety and the more general quality of &quot;trait&quot; anxiety. It will be given on a weekly basis.</description>
