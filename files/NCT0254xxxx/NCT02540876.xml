  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies how well ilorasertib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)-deficient solid cancers that have spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced)&#xD;
      or have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;
      Ilorasertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 2 cm with&#xD;

             collection (&gt;= 1 g/24 hrs); subjects may be re-screened if proteinuria is shown to be&#xD;
             controlled with or without intervention&#xD;
&#xD;

             clarifications of these determinations should be brought to the attention of the&#xD;
             principal investigator (PI); the PI will make the final determination on when it is&#xD;
             safe to initiate ABT-348 (ilorasertib) therapy under circumstances where the magnitude&#xD;
             or relevance of possible CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers is unclear in the protocol&#xD;
