    <textblock>
      A national study of a three year cohort consisting of all patients diagnosed with anal cancer&#xD;
      in 2011- 2013 with data retrieval from three national registries: Cancer Registry, Patient&#xD;
      registry and Cause of Death Registry all within the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare. All&#xD;
      out- and inpatient visits with diagnoses, admission dates and discharge dates will be&#xD;
      requested including.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient documentation from the concerned hospitals will be collected and data on the details&#xD;
      of the treatment collected retrospectively in a standardised fashion using a clinical record&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbidity will be calculated using data from the Patient Registry using all main and&#xD;
      co-diagnoses 2 years prior and then at least two years after treatment cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed questionnaires will be sent out once at 2-3 years and a second time at about 6 years&#xD;
      after index treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus or &quot;anal cancer&quot; is an uncommon disease in the Western&#xD;
      world. In Sweden approximately 100 patients are diagnosed each year. Most patients are&#xD;
      treated by chemotherapy and radiation, but a small subgroup of non-responders and patients&#xD;
      with recurrent disease undergo abdominoperineal excision with a permanent colostomy. In most&#xD;
      reports of results these patients have a worse prognosis and a higher risk of local&#xD;
      recurrence than anal cancer as a group(1, 2), possibly a result of a selection bias. Recently&#xD;
      the results in a large Nordic cohort were presented, indicating that a further factor&#xD;
      connected with successful outcome was that the patient was included in a treatment&#xD;
      protocol(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small number of patients with very small cancers are operated on primarily. This is&#xD;
      especially true for anal margin tumours(4). However, for the most part patients will be&#xD;
      primarily treated with radiotherapy, as their curative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Sweden the treatment has been centralised for many years. The radiotherapy is normally a&#xD;
      long course therapy with many smaller doses resulting in a high dose of radiation. There are&#xD;
      well known complications such as skin problems and to some extent chronic radiation effects&#xD;
      on deeper structures, which can result in functional side effects. If the treatment includes&#xD;
      an abdominoperineal excision, the effects of a colostomy on quality of life as well as&#xD;
      functional aspects of this surgical procedure are largely unknown in this group of patients.&#xD;
      In our research group we have earlier studied large cohorts of patients who have undergone&#xD;
      abdominoperineal excision for rectal cancer, and also unselected groups of patients with&#xD;
      rectal cancer, studying both functional aspects and quality of life using detailed&#xD;
      questionnaires (5, 6). Further we have results on quality of life from a cohort of Swedish&#xD;
      inhabitants, representing men and women aged 30 to 90 years. The majority of the questions in&#xD;
      these questionnaires are similar making comparisons possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other studies within the SSORG network we have used the &quot;Steineck concept&quot; to investigate&#xD;
      patient experiences of health, functional results and quality of life (7-11). We use specific&#xD;
      questionnaires with detailed questions about experiences and symptoms asking about severity&#xD;
      and duration as well as questions on socioeconomic functioning and life style factors (12,&#xD;
      13). Our experience is that patients are motivated to answer such questionnaires, with a&#xD;
      compliance at 3 months &gt;90% and at 12 months &gt;85%.&#xD;
