      In order to evaluate the difference in beta cell mass in patients with and without complete&#xD;
      resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB)&#xD;
      investigators aim to compare quantitative PET imaging of the pancreas between these patient&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These highly relevant data will provide investigators with more information on the possible&#xD;
      role of beta cell mass in the mechanisms behind resolution of T2DM after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      This would be of great interest for the assessment of RYGB as an alternative therapy in&#xD;
      patients with T2DM with a BMI &lt;35, who currently do not meet the international guidelines for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity and T2DM The prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) in the Netherlands is&#xD;
      600.000-800.000 and each year ~70.000 new patients are diagnosed. This increasing number of&#xD;
      patients with T2D is closely correlated with the obesity epidemic. In women, over 50% of T2D&#xD;
      risk can be accounted for by obesity. Also, over 85% of T2D patients are overweight and ~50%&#xD;
      are obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese patients with T2D not only have elevated glucose levels but are also at risk to develop&#xD;
      dyslipidemia and hypertension. This clustering of cardiovascular risk factors leads to an&#xD;
      increased risk of micro-and macrovascular long-term complications. In fact, patients with T2D&#xD;
      have a 2-4 times increased risk for cardiovascular disease. These complications seriously&#xD;
      decrease the quality of life and life expectancy of T2D patients. The burden of this disease&#xD;
      not only affects these patients but our society as well. Health care costs with respect to&#xD;
      diabetes amounted 814 million euro in 2005 in the Netherlands and indirect costs because of&#xD;
      absence of work are unknown but thought to be substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss is perhaps the most important therapeutic intervention in obese patients with&#xD;
      T2D. Weight loss intervenes in the underlying pathophysiology and restores insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and sometimes even insulin secretion. In addition, it improves dyslipidemia and&#xD;
      hypertension. In contrast, most pharmacological interventions only relieve the symptoms of&#xD;
      the complex disease process underlying T2DM whilst the disease process itself is not&#xD;
      addressed and even progresses in the course of time. Unfortunately, the effect of weight loss&#xD;
      interventions such as diet and lifestyle or even drugs is often modest (3-5 kg) and&#xD;
      short-lived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery and T2DM remission Weight reducing surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery, is the&#xD;
      only intervention that leads to persistent weight loss and it is superior above conventional&#xD;
      (non-surgical) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery can be divided into restrictive (gastric band) and malabsorptive procedures&#xD;
      (biliopancreatic diversion) or a combination of the 2 (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, RYGB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current indications are BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 or BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 with co-morbidities like T2D.&#xD;
      The greater the malabsorptive component, the greater the effect on weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analyses also showed spectacular metabolic improvement of bariatric surgery in obese&#xD;
      patients with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of diabetes resolution after RYGB is not completely understood and there is&#xD;
      evidence that it might not be completely dependent on weight loss. While significant weight&#xD;
      loss has not yet been achieved within days after the surgery, glycemic control has been found&#xD;
      to occur already at this time. Also, the improvement in glucose control after gastric bypass&#xD;
      is greater than with equivalent weight loss obtained by dietary intervention or purely&#xD;
      restrictive bariatric procedures. There are several hypotheses concerning the&#xD;
      weight-independent effects of bariatric surgery on insulin secretion. The most popular ones&#xD;
      are the 'hindgut-hypothesis', which states that expedited delivery of nutrients to the distal&#xD;
      intestine enhances the secretion of intestinal peptides like glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP1)&#xD;
      and peptide YY and the 'foregut hypothesis', which states that the exclusion of the duodenum&#xD;
      and proximal jejunum from the transit of nutrients results in changes in secretion of&#xD;
      intestinal peptides. However, several other mechanisms, both in- and outside the intestines&#xD;
      might play a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While improvement of beta cell function has been reported in both healthy individuals as well&#xD;
      as T2D patients after RYGB it is unclear whether the actual beta cell mass is subject to&#xD;
      change after bariatric surgery. In Goto-Kakizaki rats duodenal jejunal bypass was found to&#xD;
      increase pancreatic concentrations of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2), a&#xD;
      biomarker for beta cells. Furthermore, an increase in beta cell mass, beta cell number and&#xD;
      extra islet beta cells was found after RYGB in a porcine model. However, there are only few&#xD;
      studies in humans, with conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of bariatric surgery on glycemic control in morbidly obese patients (BMI 35 kg/m2&#xD;
      or more) with T2DM is confirmed and has been accepted as an alternative therapy in this&#xD;
      patient population for treatment of T2DM by the Diabetes Surgery Summit Consensus Conference&#xD;
      (DSS), which was participated by 50 experts and endorsed by multiple international scientific&#xD;
      societies (such as American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the International Federation for&#xD;
      the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic diseases (IFSO)) and the International Diabetes&#xD;
      Federation Taskforce on epidemioloy and Prevention of Diabetes, a consensus working group of&#xD;
      diabetologists, surgeons and public health experts. They also consider expanding the&#xD;
      indications for bariatric surgery in obese patients with T2D who currently don't meet the&#xD;
      international guidelines for bariatric surgery. In this regard, more information on the&#xD;
      effects of bariatric surgery on beta cell function and beta cell mass would be helpful. If&#xD;
      this information could be obtained preoperatively this would improve the selection of&#xD;
      patients who would benefit from bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging of beta cells in vivo Reliable, sensitive and specific visualization of living&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cells in vivo is important to broaden our understanding of resolution of T2D&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery. Reliable quantification of the remaining beta cell mass will lead to&#xD;
      a better assessment of beta cell function after bariatric surgery. This could lead to a&#xD;
      better understanding of the relative importance of factors leading to the recovery of&#xD;
      glycemic control. This could help in the consideration whether to expand the indications for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery to patients with T2D who currently do not meet the criteria (BMI&lt;35).&#xD;
