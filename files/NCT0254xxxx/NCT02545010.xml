  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Epithelial Ovarian Cancer is the most lethal amongst the gynecologic malignancies&#xD;
      and is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States.1 Despite&#xD;
      initial high response rates, 50% to 75% of women who present with advanced disease suffer&#xD;
      relapse and require re treatment2.The optimal treatment for platinum resistant ovarian cancer&#xD;
      remains hotly debated. Combination chemotherapy is not favored due to its increased toxicity&#xD;
      and lack of convincing benefit when compared to single agent chemotherapy.3,4 Recently, the&#xD;
      addition of bevacizumab to single agent chemotherapy in the AURELIA study improved&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) from 3.4 months to 6.7 months. Response rates were also&#xD;
      improved from 11.8% versus 27.3% (p= 0 .001).9 Aim: To determine the maximal tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of weekly paclitaxel in combination with LDWART. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      will be based on the MTD in this Phase I study. Method: This study is designed as a&#xD;
      prospective, single arm phase I study with 3+3 with dose de-escalation and cohort expansion.&#xD;
      All patients will receive weekly paclitaxel at a pre specified dose of 80 mg/m2, 70 mg/m2,&#xD;
      60mg/m2 or 50 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion according to institution specific standard&#xD;
      practices. Cycles of chemotherapy will be administered weekly without interruption on Days&#xD;
      1,8,15,22,29,36 for a total of 6 weekly cycles in combination with LDWART(Fig.1). LDWART will&#xD;
      be given at 60 cGy fractions, twice daily for two days, with a minimum of 4 hours inter&#xD;
      fraction interval, starting on day 1 of each cycle of weekly paclitaxel for 6 weeks.(Fig.1).&#xD;
      Importance of proposed research: The combination of a LDWART with weekly paclitaxel may&#xD;
      improve the efficacy of the current standard weekly paclitaxel in platinum resistant ovarian&#xD;
      cancer patients. Potential benefits and risks: The combination may improve treatment&#xD;
      response. Adding LDWART may increase treatment risks, but these will be monitored closely.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Is a female patient of childbearing potential, defined as a female&#xD;
                  physiologically capable of becoming pregnant (including a female whose career,&#xD;

                  females whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means), unless&#xD;
                  they are using a highly effective method for birth control throughout the study&#xD;
                  and for 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Highly effective methods for birth&#xD;
                  control include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Total abstinence: This is an acceptable method when this is consistent with&#xD;
                       the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g.&#xD;
                       calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal&#xD;
                       are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Female sterilization: The patient has had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
                       (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
                       taking study drug. In case of an oophorectomy alone, the reproductive status&#xD;
                       of the patient must have been confirmed by follow-up hormone level&#xD;
                       assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Male partner sterilization: The patient has the appropriate post-vasectomy&#xD;
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       (For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be&#xD;
                       the sole partner for that patient.)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       These patients must also agree to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                       Use of a combination of the following (1+2):&#xD;

&#xD;
                         2. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam, gel, film, or cream, or&#xD;
                            vaginal suppository Reliable contraception maintained throughout the&#xD;
                            study and for 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. Females considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential: The&#xD;
                       definition applies to females who have had 12 months of natural&#xD;
                       (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
                       appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or 6 months of spontaneous&#xD;
                       amenorrhea with serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels &gt;40 mIU/mL (for US&#xD;

&#xD;
                       In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the&#xD;
                       patient has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is she&#xD;
                       considered not of childbearing potential.&#xD;
