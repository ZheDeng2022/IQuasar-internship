      The central goal of the proposed study is to generate essential pilot data necessary to&#xD;
      support an established line of research leading to future extramural grant submissions. The&#xD;
      aims of the current study are two-fold: 1) to compare cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and&#xD;
      gait endurance across three groups of people: (1) individuals with Parkinson Disease (PD) who&#xD;
      participate in boxing on a regular basis, (2) individuals with PD who participate in exercise&#xD;
      other than boxing on a regular basis and (3) healthy controls of the same age who exercise on&#xD;
      a regular basis and 2) to examine the relationship between CRF and motor symptoms of PD&#xD;
      (bradykinesia, tremor and postural instability). Forty-five participants (15 for each group)&#xD;
      who participate in exercise on a regular basis (at least 120 minutes of exercise per week for&#xD;
      the past 3 months) will be recruited for this cross-sectional study. In a single testing&#xD;
      session, participants will perform the following tests: (1) clinical performance measures and&#xD;
      (2) a CRF assessment. A one-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests will be used to examine&#xD;
      differences in dependent variables across the three exercise groups. Relationships between&#xD;
      CRF and clinical performance measures will be evaluated with Pearson's correlation&#xD;
      coefficients.&#xD;

        A total of 45 individuals will be enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Three groups will&#xD;
        each consist of 15 individuals (individuals with Parkinson Disease that participate in&#xD;
        boxing, individuals with Parkinson disease that participate in group exercise other than&#xD;
        boxing, and individuals without disability that participate in group exercise other than&#xD;
        boxing).&#xD;
