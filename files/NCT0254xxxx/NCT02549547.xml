    <textblock>
      The WHO, the Pan American Health Organization, the EU Council of Ministers, the World&#xD;
      Federation of Mental Health, and the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists all agree -&quot;there can&#xD;
      be no health without mental health&quot;. Within Canada, 6.7M people live with a mental illness&#xD;
      and when family and caregivers are included almost everyone is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review (2014) concluded that physical activity has a significant potential for&#xD;
      reducing depressive symptoms in people with a mental illness. Globally, physical inactivity&#xD;
      is &quot;pandemic&quot;. Current guidelines recommend a minimum of only a 150 minutes a week of&#xD;
      moderately vigorous exercise but 85% of Canadians do not meet the national recommendations.&#xD;
      How then can people with depression be motivated to become physically more active?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Medical Visits (GMVs) can be used to provide health services and they have proven&#xD;
      effective in some settings, including mood disorders. As well as providing economic and&#xD;
      resource efficiencies, the GMV model has the potential to add a 'support&#xD;
      group/accountability' element for behavioural interventions such as physical activity&#xD;
      promotion; such influence is not present in an individual patient-physician consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Jump Step&quot; is a 14-week program within a GMV setting designed to motivate and support people&#xD;
      with depression to engage in regular physical activity. The investigators seek to design,&#xD;
      implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of the Group Medical Visits focused on promoting&#xD;
      physical activity for patients with depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mental disorders, including anxiety and depression, contribute more than either&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease or cancer to the burden of disease worldwide. Individuals with chronic&#xD;
      diseases and major depression use more health resources, have higher degrees of functional&#xD;
      disability, and experience higher productivity losses, compared to their counterparts without&#xD;
      major depression. Within Canada, 6.7M people live with a mental illness and when family and&#xD;
      caregivers are included almost everyone is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane Review examined the effectiveness of exercise in treating depression and the&#xD;
      results of 39 trials and over 2,300 subjects confirmed a moderate effect for exercise when&#xD;
      compared to no treatment or a control group. A smaller number of studies found no differences&#xD;
      in efficacy between exercise and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and/or antidepressant&#xD;
      therapies, the current &quot;gold standards&quot; for depression care. A systematic review (2014)&#xD;
      concluded that physical activity has a significant potential for reducing depressive symptoms&#xD;
      in people with a mental health challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, physical inactivity is &quot;pandemic&quot;. Current guidelines recommend a minimum of only&#xD;
      150 minutes a week of moderately vigorous exercise but 85% of Canadians do not meet the&#xD;
      national recommendations. There is no question that physical activity can be an effective&#xD;
      treatment; how then can people dealing with depression be motivated to become physically more&#xD;
      active?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of psychiatric care for mood disorders is delivered through one-to-one&#xD;
      consultations between a patient and psychiatrist or family physician. Treatment plans rarely&#xD;
      include physical activity despite evidence for its effectiveness. In fact, efforts to promote&#xD;
      physical activity within traditional clinical settings are fraught with challenges such as a&#xD;
      lack of practitioner resources, reimbursement, time, and confidence, and poor patient&#xD;
      retention. Instead, people are commonly prescribed powerful pharmaceuticals despite mounting&#xD;
      evidence that these drugs should be reserved for the most serious cases of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. While drugs have their place, this place is firmly behind interventions such as&#xD;
      psychotherapy and physical activity in the majority of cases of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel strategies are needed for promoting physical activity and self-management that are also&#xD;
      physically, financially, and psychologically accessible. Group Medical Visits (GMVs) are a&#xD;
      promising approach to mental health care. Group Medical Visits are organized around a group&#xD;
      of people living with a specific condition. The structure and formats of GMVs vary.&#xD;
      Typically, in lieu of a short individual visit, a patient will participate in a longer&#xD;
      (60-120 minutes) group visit with six to 14 other patients, led by a physician and/or other&#xD;
      healthcare practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GMVs have been scientifically tested in an array of primary care settings over the last 10 to&#xD;
      15 years, including mental health[6-8]; no studies to date, though, have focused exclusively&#xD;
      on physical activity promotion. Briefly, the theoretical rationale for this approach is a&#xD;
      multifactorial &quot;interdisciplinary model&quot;, including medication/treatment monitoring, patient&#xD;
      education, social support, goal setting, and motivation for improving person's&#xD;
      self-perception to uptake physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within British Columbia, the Mood Disorders Association of BC has taken a leadership role in&#xD;
      integrating Group Medical Visits into psychiatric care. Based on the success of MDABC's adult&#xD;
      Group Medical Visits, UBC researchers collaborated with MDABC to design and prototype&#xD;
      &quot;Step-by-Step (SBS).&quot; SBS was a series of 14 weekly Group Appointments designed to help&#xD;
      patients with anxiety and/or depression incorporate physical activity as part of their&#xD;
      treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-led by a psychiatrist and an exercise therapist, each two-hour GMV combined specific&#xD;
      participants' self-management and activation. A physical activity section in each Group&#xD;
      Appointment provided participants instruction in techniques/exercises that they could employ&#xD;
      in their everyday lives to become more physically active without having to attend special&#xD;
      classes, set aside time, or make concerted efforts to &quot;exercise&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After three months post-SBS intervention, median depression scales (PHQ-9) decreased 38% from&#xD;
      16 to 10 (p&lt;0.01; IQR: 8/12); and, median anxiety scales (GAD-7) decreased 50% from 13 to 6.5&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05; IQR: 8.5/9). Median daily &quot;steps&quot; increased 71% from 3,366 to 5,746 (IQR:&#xD;
      2,610/6,237), though this was not significant (p&gt;0.10). These data compare favourably with&#xD;
      other interventions such as psychotherapy and medications. Fourteen of 15 participants&#xD;
      (93.3%) completed the 14-week program and loved it!&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the design and realization of Step-by-Step the investigators intentionally 'meet&#xD;
      participants where they were at.&quot; The intervention was not static but a dynamic constantly&#xD;
      evolving process whereby the investigators continuously refined the program based on weekly&#xD;
      feedback. As a result, the investigators were able to better able to meet the needs of&#xD;
      participants though it did mean what the investigators were testing changed over the course&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equally, the investigators intended the program to address participants holistically, which&#xD;
      therefore demanded a multifactorial approach. Instead of testing a single variable the&#xD;
      investigators were examining the impact of a collection of elements as a whole. Exit&#xD;
      interviews with participants suggested a number of factors might have led to program&#xD;
      retention and the improvements in physical activity, depression, and anxiety. The&#xD;
      investigators cannot say definitely which components of the program had impact, only that as&#xD;
      a whole the investigators did see improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the above evidence regarding physical activity's impact on well being, one could&#xD;
      reasonably offer that as a society we have a moral and ethical obligation to promote physical&#xD;
      activity as a first-line treatment for depression. The question remains 'how can individuals,&#xD;
      dealing with depression, be better motivated to become more physically active?' The promotion&#xD;
      of physical activity through GMVs and the inclusion of a physical activity component within&#xD;
      group patient visits are worthy of further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROPOSAL: Through a mixed methods approach the investigators will evaluate the success&#xD;
      of Jump Step, a series of 14 Group Medical Visits in motivating adults (≥18yrs), dealing with&#xD;
      depression to become more physically active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators propose that adults dealing with Major Depressive Disorder&#xD;
      (MDD) and/or Bi Polar II, depression, who participate in a weekly series of 14 Group Medical&#xD;
      Visits (Jump Step) will have lower depression and anxiety ratings, higher rates of physical&#xD;
      activity/step counts, and higher levels of &quot;patient activation&quot; post-intervention as compared&#xD;
      to pre-intervention. Participants will also report deeper engagement and confidence in&#xD;
      physical activity; increased levels of self-care and treatment as well as greater well being&#xD;
      in qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit volunteers via the following approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Posters located in A) the Mood Disorders Association of BC (MDABC); B) the psychiatric&#xD;
           services area of major hospitals; C) areas visible to potential volunteers within&#xD;
           related services organizations; D) coffee shops, community centres, YMCAs, and such&#xD;
           venues. The investigators will obtain permission from the appropriate authorities to&#xD;
           display advertisements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postings on the websites/list-serves of related service organizations such as the MDABC,&#xD;
           the BC Psychiatric Association, BC Mental Health &amp; Addiction Services, and Health&#xD;
           Authority Mental Health Services. The investigators will obtain permission from the&#xD;
           appropriate authorities to display advertisements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Through word-of-mouth at MDABC and other service agencies and any resulting 'snowball&#xD;
           sampling'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Through social media such as Facebook and Twitter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If needed the investigators will advertise in Lower Mainland papers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDABC psychiatrists and staff will also verbally inform clients of the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate with the understanding that participation or non-participation will not affect a&#xD;
      client's access to or quality of psychiatric care and/or MDABC services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous participants in the Jump Step Needs Assessment (Part 1) (UBC Ethics: H14-00973) who&#xD;
      meet the eligibility criteria and have signed consent will be given first preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will either be emailed a blank consent form and a Physical Activity Readiness&#xD;
      Questionnaire (2014 PAR-Q+) or obtain them through the MDABC office. Potential participants&#xD;
      will scan and email their signed consent form and the PARQ+ form and Participant Declaration&#xD;
      back to the Research Assistant; or they will mail signed paper copies of the forms back to&#xD;
      the office of the investigators at the CHHM. Self Addressed Stamped Envelopes (SASEs) will be&#xD;
      available at the MDABC office for this purposed. If needed the investigators will mail&#xD;
      consent forms to potential participant along with a SASE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to one-week prior to the baseline assessment or a minimum of 48&#xD;
      hours to review the consent form, ask questions, and/or discuss the consent with family&#xD;
      members, friends, etc. The investigators believe 48 hours provides sufficient time for&#xD;
      reflection and/or conversation and provides their Research Assistant with sufficient time to&#xD;
      adequate schedule interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will contact their Research Assistant who will answer questions,&#xD;
      confirm their eligibility, and schedule them for interviews. Each potential participant will&#xD;
      have filled out, signed, and submitted the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (2014&#xD;
      PAR-Q+). Research staff and/or the psychiatrist will follow up as appropriate, regarding&#xD;
      their responses in the PARQ+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each assessment (baseline/post-intervention) will take approximately 90 minutes. The&#xD;
      investigators will reimburse each participant $5 for each assessment they attend as well&#xD;
      their parking/public transit up to $5.50 per assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professional transcription services will transcribe the interviews. Jump Step investigators&#xD;
      will then analyze the data for common themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention participants who have signed consent will be divided into cohorts of 20&#xD;
      participants each. Cohorts will participate in a weekly series of 14 Group Medical Visits&#xD;
      (GMVs) co-led by a MDABC psychiatrist and an exercise therapist. GMVs will take place at the&#xD;
      centrally located Robert Lee YMCA (downtown Vancouver), which will provide access to both&#xD;
      meeting space for the group discussions as well as exercise facilities for the physical&#xD;
      activity component of each Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The curriculum will include (i) life skills development; (ii) disease specific education,&#xD;
      relating to physical activity promotion, uptake, and adherence. The investigators will&#xD;
      present also this education within a broader holistic context that acknowledges and supports&#xD;
      a participant's social, emotional, spiritual, financial, physical, and nutritional well&#xD;
      being; and (iii) GMVs will integrate medical care/medication management into their delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the physical activity component, participants will take part in regular group walks,&#xD;
      emphasizing that 150 minutes weekly of moderate activity (e.g. brisk walking) is all that is&#xD;
      necessary to obtain the medical benefits offered by regular physical activity. On other weeks&#xD;
      participants will stay in the YMCA and be taught techniques and exercises that they can&#xD;
      employ in their everyday lives to become more physically active without having to attend&#xD;
      special classes, set aside time, or make concerted efforts to &quot;exercise&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group exercises might include aerobic training of cardio respiratory functioning, circuit&#xD;
      training with simple tasks, e.g. ergometer bicycling, resistance bands, light weightlifting,&#xD;
      etc. A trainer will supervise all interventions. Each subject will be given a physical&#xD;
      activity sensor (Fit Bit) and participants will receive instruction from a researcher as to&#xD;
      logging the wear time daily.&#xD;
