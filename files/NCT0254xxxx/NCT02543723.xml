  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral chemotherapeutic agents (OCAs) are increasingly being used as an alternative to&#xD;
      traditional intravenous chemotherapy, and factors promoting this trend include increased&#xD;
      survival times requiring long-term therapy, acceptability among patients, convenience, and&#xD;
      cost savings due to reduced hospital time. Although OCAs are commonly preferred by patients,&#xD;
      adherence to these medications vary. Suboptimal medication adherence leads to loss of&#xD;
      treatment efficacy, increased toxicity, and increased health care costs. Thus, it is critical&#xD;
      to develop and test interventions that effectively improve adherence to OCAs. Although the&#xD;
      medication adherence literature has been criticized for methodological issues, some&#xD;
      components of interventions have had promising results on adherence such as electronic&#xD;
      monitored adherence feedback, cognitive-education, nurse-based interventions, and&#xD;
      technology-based or telehealth strategies. The investigators propose to unify components of&#xD;
      these effective approaches in a novel way to assess the efficacy and feasibility of two&#xD;
      telehealth-based strategies (electronic medication-event monitoring with feedback and&#xD;
      tailored nurse coaching which includes cognitive-education) in an effort increase OCA&#xD;
      adherence among cancer patients who are at high-risk for non-adherence in rural eastern North&#xD;
      Carolina.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to improve cancer patient's adherence to their oral chemotherapy&#xD;
      agents. We want to test whether a tailored nurse coaching intervention will significantly&#xD;
      improve medication adherence as compared to a control group (standard-of-care). With strong&#xD;
      support from our collaborators at the Vidant Cancer Care - Eddie and Jo Allison Smith Tower&#xD;
      at Vidant Medical Center (VCC), study participants included cancer patients that were within&#xD;
      their first two cycles of a new oral chemotherapy regimen at Vidant Medical Center/Leo W.&#xD;
      Jenkins Cancer Center, which serves individuals throughout the 29 counties in rural eastern&#xD;
      North Carolina (ENC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To assess the barriers to, and facilitators of, adherence to oral&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents among cancer patients who are at high-risk of non-adherence. Using&#xD;
      the three-stage process of elicitation, intervention, and evaluation, we assessed factors&#xD;
      that influenced non-adherence among this population. This formative qualitative assessment&#xD;
      was accomplished by conducting interviews with English speaking cancer patients (N=25) and&#xD;
      through key informant interviews/focus groups with cancer care providers (N=10). Objective 1&#xD;
      served as a baseline assessment to identify the unique factors that contribute to&#xD;
      non-adherence and directly informed the development of tailored medication adherence&#xD;
      strategies outlined in objective 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2. To test the effectiveness a telehealth adherence motivation strategy among&#xD;
      cancer patients on oral chemotherapeutic agents who are at high-risk of non-adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a randomized control trial study of 150 subjects where subjects were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to control or intervention arm. The Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model&#xD;
      of Adherence and the results of objective 1 guided this aim. Controls received the&#xD;
      standard-of-care. The intervention arm received the standard-of-care and the nurse coach&#xD;
      intervention. Specifically, we assessed whether a tailored nurse coaching intervention&#xD;
      component will significantly improve medication adherence at higher rates as compared to the&#xD;
      control group. The nurse coach intervention component involved individualized&#xD;
      barriers/facilitators screening tool, educational tools, and regular contact with cancer&#xD;
      patients via telephone calls across a six-month period. We hypothesize that the nurse-coach&#xD;
      intervention would be effective at increasing medication adherence. This hypothesis is&#xD;
      supported by existing medication adherence literature that suggests a tailored intervention&#xD;
      using multiple adherence strategies can potentially have a significant impact on increasing&#xD;
      medication adherence.&#xD;

    <description>The participant's cancer medication adherence was taken at baseline and within a 6-month follow-up period. We measured the participant's self-efficacy with medication adherence increase with their OCAs using the SEAMS scale.&#xD;
SEAMS Scale: 21 items scale, ranges from 21-63, higher scores indicate higher level of self-efficacy for medication adherence.</description>

    <description>We measured the participant's cancer health literacy at baseline and at 6 months via the CHLT-30.&#xD;
The CHLT-30 measures cancer health literacy along a continuum with 0-30 representing the number of correct answers provided to the items. Continuous scores provided by the CHLT-30 do not allow to determine who has limited health literacy or put people in a category, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of cancer health literacy.</description>

The educational strategies include information about the patient's cancer treatment and expected outcomes; clear instructions about medication dosing schedule; what to do if a dose is missed or delayed; medication side effects and/or potential drug interactions; and review of cancer health literacy infographics. The behavioral skills and affective support strategies include coping strategies for side effects, skills for fitting medication regimen into daily routine, identifying a support network, communication skills for interacting with providers, and facilitating a positive perception for effective self-management experience. Patients received weekly phone calls from the nurse coach during the first month of the intervention, and then bi-monthly follow-up calls for the remainder of treatment or 6-month follow-up period.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the intervention 2 group a tailored nurse coach component. Participants will receive an initial session conducted by the nurse coach, via phone or in-person. Participants will receive weekly phone calls from the nurse coach during the first month of the intervention, and then bi-monthly follow-up calls for the remainder of treatment or 6-month follow-up period (whichever occurs first). The nurse coach will modify the intervention plan to address identified barriers to adherence at this time.</description>

          <description>The nurse coach conducted an initial assessment with the participant and identified specific adherence strategies tailored to the participant's needs. The educational strategies include information about the patient's cancer treatment and expected outcomes; clear instructions about medication dosing schedule; what to do if a dose is missed or delayed; medication side effects and/or potential drug interactions; and review of cancer health literacy infographics. The behavioral skills and affective support strategies include coping strategies for side effects, skills for fitting medication regimen into daily routine, identifying a support network, communication skills for interacting with providers, and facilitating a positive perception for effective self-management experience. Patients received weekly phone calls from the nurse coach during the first month of the intervention, and then bi-monthly follow-up calls for the remainder of treatment or 6-month follow-up period.</description>
