  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate brain signals related to freezing of gait (FoG),&#xD;
      a symptom of Parkinson's Disease, that can lead to dangerous falls. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that uncovering these signals can lead to better deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FoG) is a devastating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that affects more&#xD;
      than half of the patient population. Defined as an intermittent failure to initiate or&#xD;
      maintain effective stepping, FoG is a common cause of falls and injuries in PD. There is an&#xD;
      unmet but pressing need to develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat disabling drug- and&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation (DBS)-resistant FoG in PD. The objective of this research study is to&#xD;
      uncover an electrical biomarker for FoG from human electroencephalography (EEG) to better&#xD;
      understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of the symptom and to inform the development&#xD;
      of clinical interventions for FoG. The central hypothesis is that EEG activity over the motor&#xD;
      cortex will exhibit significant changes leading up to and during FoG episodes. This biomarker&#xD;
      can then facilitate the detection of FoG events directly from scalp recordings. The rationale&#xD;
      for the proposed research is that non-invasive detection of FoG episodes can be used to guide&#xD;
      responsive DBS strategies to resolve the episode and prevent potential injuries. Furthermore,&#xD;
      it is hypothesize that this biomarker will modulate when therapeutic DBS settings for FoG are&#xD;
      turned on. Given the vast number of DBS parameter combinations that need to be tested and&#xD;
      chronically verified, such a biomarker can significantly shorten clinical programming and&#xD;
      prevent side effects of non-optimal stimulation settings. This study will review changes in&#xD;
      scalp recorded EEG and gait parameters during natural FoG episodes while participants are&#xD;
      ambulatory in an advanced gait laboratory setting using a wireless EEG amplifier with active&#xD;
      electrodes. The modulation of the uncovered biomarker during clinical programming of DBS&#xD;
      settings in participants with bilateral DBS implants in the globus pallidus internus (GPi)&#xD;
      and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). This project is innovative as the dataset acquired will&#xD;
      be the first of its kind in PD patients with FoG, and will open a new direction of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary investigation that can potentially uncover the cortical mechanisms of FoG&#xD;
      in humans and which in turn could lead to novel and effective therapies for those suffering&#xD;
      from PD. This contribution will be significant because it will provide a critical and unmet&#xD;
      therapeutic option for FoG and decrease morbidity and mortality associated with FoG related&#xD;
      falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the following goals will be accomplished:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruit subjects who have undergone DBS implantation for the treatment of PD and who&#xD;
           have clinically verified FoG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect EEG data during ambulatory tasks that often induce FoG episodes and uncover&#xD;
           biomarkers of FoG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a closed-loop paradigm for acute testing when FoG events are detected from EEG&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use the EEG biomarkers to guide DBS parameter selection for treatment of FoG.&#xD;
