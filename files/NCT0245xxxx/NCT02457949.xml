  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether altering the timing and frequency of social assistance&#xD;
      disbursement reduces drug related-harms that increase on the days surrounding monthly&#xD;
      synchronized government social assistance cheque issue.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coordinated monthly income assistance payments, while seeking to alleviate poverty, can also&#xD;
      have negative and unintended impacts, particularly among people who use illicit drugs (PWUD).&#xD;
      Observational research has identified escalations in drug-related harm coinciding with&#xD;
      monthly assistance payments, such as overdose, treatment interruption, hospital admissions&#xD;
      and public disorder. This project varies the timing and frequency of income assistance&#xD;
      disbursement, and evaluates whether varying income assistance disbursement reduces&#xD;
      drug-related harm coinciding with coordinated income assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conducted among 273 PWUD, participants will be allocated for 6 income assistance cycles to a&#xD;
      control or one of two intervention arms. Participants in the control arm will receive&#xD;
      payments according to the existing monthly government schedule. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive their income assistance: (1) monthly on a day different from&#xD;
      government cheque issue; or (2) semi-monthly on days different from government cheque issue.&#xD;
      The intervention will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative methods for its impact&#xD;
      on drug use and related harms.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Interim analyses produced signal of intervention efficacy for primary outcomes and weaker&#xD;
    signal of increased exposure to violence. Therefore, DSMC recommended stopping recruitment in&#xD;
    May 2018. Enrolled participants completed intervention by Aug 2018&#xD;
