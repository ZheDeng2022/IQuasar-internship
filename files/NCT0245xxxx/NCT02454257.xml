      The aim of the proposed study is to better understand the epidemiology of, risk factors for&#xD;
      and consequences of critical illness leading to improvements in the risk models used to&#xD;
      underpin national clinical audits for adult general critical care, cardiothoracic critical&#xD;
      care and in-hospital cardiac arrest using data linkage with other routinely collected data&#xD;
      sources.&#xD;

      Aim: To improve risk models used to underpin national clinical audits for adult general&#xD;
      critical care, cardiothoracic critical care and in-hospital cardiac arrest using data linkage&#xD;
      with other routinely collected data sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To improve risk models for adult general critical care by: (1a) developing risk models&#xD;
           for mortality at fixed time-points and time-to event outcomes (by data linkage between&#xD;
           the CMP and death registrations from ONS); developing risk models for longer term&#xD;
           chronic health outcomes of (1b) diabetes (by data linkage between the CMP and the&#xD;
           National Diabetes Audit) and (1c) end-stage renal disease (by data linkage between the&#xD;
           CMP and the UK Renal Registry); and (1d) developing risk models for subsequent health&#xD;
           care utilisation and costs (by data linkage between the CMP and HES)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To improve risk models for cardiothoracic critical care by: (2a) enhancing risk factor&#xD;
           data (by data linkage with the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database); (2b) developing&#xD;
           risk models for longer term mortality (by data linkage between the CMP and death&#xD;
           registrations from ONS); and (2c) developing risk models for subsequent health care&#xD;
           utilisation and costs (by data linkage between the CMP and HES)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. .To improve risk models for in-hospital cardiac arrest by: (3a) enhancing risk factor&#xD;
           data (by data linkage between NCAA and HES); (3b) developing risk models for longer term&#xD;
           mortality, health care utilisation and costs (by data linkage between NCAA and ONS);&#xD;
           (3c) developing risk models for subsequent critical care utilisation (by data linkage&#xD;
           between NCAA and CMP); and (3d) developing risk models for subsequent health care&#xD;
           utilisation and costs (by data linkage between NCAA, ONS and HES)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Immediate translation of the improved risk models into practice through: (4a) adoption&#xD;
           into routine comparative outcome reporting for the national clinical audits; and (4b)&#xD;
           communication of research output to providers, managers, commissioners, policy makers&#xD;
           and academics in critical care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The project will utilise high quality clinical data collected for the Case&#xD;
      Mix Programme (CMP) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (NCAA) - the national clinical audits&#xD;
      for adult critical care and in-hospital cardiac arrest. These data will be linked with data&#xD;
      from the National Diabetes Audit, UK Renal Registry and National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit,&#xD;
      routine administrative data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and death registrations&#xD;
      from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data linkage will be undertaken by the HSCIC Data Linkage and Extract Service (DLES) acting&#xD;
      as a trusted third party. Identifiers (with no associated clinical data) will be uploaded&#xD;
      from each national clinical audit to secure servers at HSCIC. DLES will perform the data&#xD;
      linkage and will return a common key that can be used to link all records of the same patient&#xD;
      across the datasets. The three national clinical audits external to ICNARC will extract an&#xD;
      agreed, pseudonymised dataset for linked records and DLES will extract data from HES and ONS&#xD;
      and these datasets will be passed to ICNARC. ICNARC will produce pseudonymised data extracts&#xD;
      from the CMP and NCAA and these will be linked to the datasets provided by the national&#xD;
      clinical audits and DLES using the common key. In this way, only pseudonymised data will be&#xD;
      linked between the multiple data sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The following approaches for model development will be applied depending on&#xD;
      the outcome and objectives of the analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modelling of mortality at fixed time-points (30 days, 90 days, 1 year) using logistic&#xD;
           regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modelling of time-to-event outcomes using standard survival regression methods such as&#xD;
           Weibull and Cox regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To handle interval-censored data: Cox proportional hazards models, complementary log-log&#xD;
           models using partial likelihood estimation (to permit interval censoring) and&#xD;
           discrete-time hazard models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To account for both interval censoring of the time-to-onset and competition with death:&#xD;
           Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models and illness-death models will be&#xD;
           considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Objective 3, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for greater than 20 minutes&#xD;
           and survival to hospital discharge outcome, multilevel logistic regression with random&#xD;
           effects of hospital will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To model Hospital resource use and costs post-critical care: multilevel regression model&#xD;
           and Log linear regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk prediction models will be validated for their discrimination, calibration and overall&#xD;
      fit using a panel of measures including: c index; plots of observed against predicted risk;&#xD;
      Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic; Cox's calibration regression; Shapiro's R, Brier's&#xD;
      score and corresponding approximate R2 measures; and reclassification.&#xD;
