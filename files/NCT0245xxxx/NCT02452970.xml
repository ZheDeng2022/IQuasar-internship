  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the investigational drug, RRx-001, an epigenetic&#xD;
      agent, which turns on a number of beneficial genes that the tumor has silenced, can&#xD;
      resensitize the tumor(s), in other words make it/them re-respond to gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin, which, hopefully, will translate to a longer lifespan. The name of the open-label&#xD;
      study, which means that patients will know what treatments they are receiving, is EPIC, a&#xD;
      hybrid or combination of EPIgenetic for the mechanism of action of RRx-001 and&#xD;
      Cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment is divided into two stages. During the first stage, patients will receive&#xD;
      RRx-001, which is administered intravenously weekly, for a fixed time period of six weeks. At&#xD;
      that time the second stage starts in which cisplatin and gemcitabine are reintroduced for as&#xD;
      long as the tumors respond to them to determine whether resensitization has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) of patients at 9 weeks after the reintroduction of gemcitabine and cisplatin.&#xD;
