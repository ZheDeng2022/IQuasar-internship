  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in adolescents and young adults with chronic&#xD;
      illnesses and are associated with decreased adherence to medical regimens. However, many&#xD;
      young patients go untreated for anxiety and depression. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate an online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program in young adults with chronic&#xD;
      illness. Prior research has shown online CBT to be effective in multiple other populations,&#xD;
      but to the investigators' knowledge, this is the first study to examine web-based CBT for&#xD;
      young adults with chronic illnesses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional problems such as anxiety and depression commonly surface during adolescence and are&#xD;
      even more common among youth with chronic illness compared to other children. Emotional&#xD;
      comorbidities are associated with decreased adherence to medical regimens in children and&#xD;
      adults as well as poorer clinical outcomes for medical conditions and increased medical&#xD;
      expenditures. It is widely accepted that cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for anxiety and depression and in-person CBT has been shown effective for young&#xD;
      people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, despite the presence of this effective&#xD;
      treatment, the majority of those with anxiety and depression are untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offering mental health services in an acceptable, feasible and low cost fashion remains a&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research suggests that web-based CBT is a promising candidate for offering effective and&#xD;
      feasible treatment for anxiety and depression to young people. It has been shown effective&#xD;
      for mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety in adults and adolescents with a&#xD;
      primary diagnosis of depression. In adults, studies comparing face-to-face CBT treatment to&#xD;
      web-based CBT with low level therapist support showed comparable clinical outcomes and a 15%&#xD;
      cost savings for online treatment. Furthermore, an online treatment format may be especially&#xD;
      appealing for younger populations who spend much of their time online as well as for people&#xD;
      with chronic illness, who may be home-bound due to symptoms. Despite the well-established&#xD;
      evidence base for web-based CBT in other populations, the greater affordability of web-based&#xD;
      CBT compared to face-to-face treatment, and the appeal of the online format for young adults,&#xD;
      the investigators are aware of no published studies examining the use of web-based CBT for&#xD;
      young adults with chronic illness. The innovation of the proposed project is to study low-&#xD;
      cost, web-based CBT in a new population of adolescents and young adults with inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions that constitute serious chronic illness.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be asked to complete a web-based cognitive behavioral therapy &quot;self-help&quot; program. The program consists of six weekly modules, in which participants practice new ways of thinking (e.g. how to recognize and change distorted thinking, utilizing a thought change record, identifying cognitive errors, and modifying automatic thoughts) to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Participants receive text message reminders to complete the weekly session.</description>
