      Study designed to determine the ability and accuracy of anterior segment optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (AS-OCT) to measure the distance between the corneoscleral limbus and the&#xD;
      insertion site of the extraocular muscles (EOM) in adults with and without previous&#xD;
      strabismus surgery. And to compare in surgical patients the pre-operative AS-OCT&#xD;
      limbal-muscle insertion distance measurement to the intraoperative limbal-muscle insertion&#xD;
      measurement using calipers (gold standard).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of strabismus is often surgical. A better surgical plan would be possible if&#xD;
      the exact limbus-insertion distance of the extraocular muscles was known. The clinical&#xD;
      ophthalmologic examination, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy, cannot elucidate the muscle&#xD;
      insertion position prior to surgery. This information is especially important in patients who&#xD;
      have undergone prior strabismus surgery. In these patients, previous surgical data may not be&#xD;
      available or the muscle insertion may be in a different location than expected. Thus, a&#xD;
      preoperative imaging study that could accurately locate the muscle insertion may be useful&#xD;
      for designing the surgical plan, possibly improving the success of the surgery, and reducing&#xD;
      operative time and intraoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies that used computed tomography (CT) scans and high-resolution magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), have failed to reliably detect the rectus muscle insertions. Ocular&#xD;
      ultrasound allows anatomic visualization of the EOM, but has a low image resolution.&#xD;
      Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), can accurately measure the limbus-insertion distance,&#xD;
      however, it induces significant measurement errors due to the pressure applied to the globe&#xD;
      during examination. The recent advances in AS-OCT imaging allow non-invasive, detailed,&#xD;
      cross-sectional examination of anterior segment structures by generating a two-dimensional&#xD;
      high resolution image from a reflected light beam. Two previous studies have successfully&#xD;
      used AS-OCT to analyze EOM insertions, but the number of participants was small and patients&#xD;
      with previous strabismus muscle surgery were not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators purpose is to gather limbus-EOM insertion distance data using the AS-OCT in&#xD;
      a greater number of patients, include patients who have undergone previous strabismus&#xD;
      procedures, and correlate AS-OCT measurements with intraoperative findings in those patients&#xD;
      undergoing strabismus surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After recruitment, a written consent will be obtained from subjects who agree to&#xD;
           participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A review of medical records will be performed to obtain demographics data, type of&#xD;
           strabismus, history of previous eye surgery, etc (see Data Collection Sheet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. AS-OCT imaging of the rectus muscles will be performed in all patients using the Visante&#xD;
           (Visante AS-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec) and/or Heidelberg Spectralis (Spectralis AS-OCT;&#xD;
           Heidelberg Engineering) instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For patients undergoing strabismus surgery, the distance from the corneoscleral limbus&#xD;
           to the insertion site of the rectus muscles will be measured with calipers at the time&#xD;
           of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After the surgery, AS-OCT imaging of the rectus muscles will be performed during&#xD;
           routinely scheduled post-operative clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All acquired images will be stored in the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute MERGE HealthCare&#xD;
      Completes Acquisition of Ophthalmic Imaging Systems (OIS), a clinical imaging storage system,&#xD;
      which is secured against unauthorized access. All background information will be entered into&#xD;
      REDCAP data capturing system by one of the investigators and be accessible only to the&#xD;
      investigators (http://www.project-redcap.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AS-OCT devices that will be used are commercially available, FDA approved, and routinely&#xD;
      used in clinical settings to evaluate the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. There&#xD;
      are no experimental imaging procedures planned for the purpose of this study. All imaging&#xD;
      acquisition protocols have been well-established and are non-invasive. There is no contact&#xD;
      with the eye during image acquisition. This exposes the subjects to no greater than minimal&#xD;
      risk as the result of participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible adult patients who are undergoing strabismus evaluation at the Bascom Palmer Eye&#xD;
      Institute will be invited to participate. The consent processes will occur during the clinic&#xD;
      visit. The study does not involve any additional clinic visits. The patient will have ample&#xD;
      opportunity to discuss the study, review the consent form, and sign the consent form during&#xD;
      the course of the visit. This study will follow the SOP: Informed Consent Process for&#xD;
      Research (HRP-090).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-English Speaking Subjects We will exclude patients whose English proficiency precludes&#xD;
      reading the form and understanding its contents.&#xD;
