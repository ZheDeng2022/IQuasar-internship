      This clinical study is a phase 1 study which carried out to to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and tolerability of multiple intravitreal injections of BCD-021(bevacizumab&#xD;
      biosimilar candidate manufactured by CJSC BIOCAD, Russia) when used in patients with&#xD;
      neovascular wet age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;

      BCD-021-1 is an open label, non-comparative, non-randomized, multicenter phase 1 clinical&#xD;
      study evaluating pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of multiple intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of BCD-021 (bevacizumab biosimilar, CJSC BIOCAD) when given in patients with&#xD;
      exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enrol 10 patients with confirmed neovascular wet age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration. Before inclusion into the active phase of the study, patients will undergo a&#xD;
      diagnostic examination during the screening period with a maximum duration of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal part of the study includes the period from the first intravitreal injection and&#xD;
      until 28 days after the third intravitreal injection. The goal of this stage is to evaluate&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, the safety and tolerability of multiple intravitreal injections of BCD-021&#xD;
      (CJSC BIOCAD, Russia) when used in patients with neovascular wet age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension phase of the study (month 4 - month 12) is required to assess the long-term effects&#xD;
      of the therapy and get full information about the immunogenicity of the study drug.&#xD;
