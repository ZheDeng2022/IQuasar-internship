    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the impact of a new injection-free six-to-nine month treatment&#xD;
      regimen of linezolid, bedaquiline, levofloxacin, pyrazinamide (PZA) and ethionamide/high dose&#xD;
      isoniazid (INH) compared to the conventional empiric injection-based regimen. The secondary&#xD;
      aim is to determine if other treatment-related outcomes including adverse events, adherence&#xD;
      to treatment, culture conversion, and cure/completion are significantly different in the&#xD;
      intervention and conventional arms.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB is completely out of control in South Africa and is now officially the most common cause&#xD;
      of death in this country. Alarmingly, the gravity if this pandemic has now been compounded by&#xD;
      the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), which constitutes resistance to the two&#xD;
      most potent anti-tuberculous drugs, namely rifampicin and isoniazid . XDR-TB refers to&#xD;
      resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, any fluoroquinolone, and any second line injectable drug&#xD;
      (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). MDR-TB is a burgeoning epidemic in South Africa, with&#xD;
      rates trebling over the last decade. It is of considerable concern because mortality is high&#xD;
      (up to 50% in South Africa) and it often affects economically active young adults. It is also&#xD;
      a major threat to health care workers in South Africa. We recently showed a rate in SA health&#xD;
      care workers 6 fold higher than the general population further exacerbating the shortage of&#xD;
      this critical workforce in the country. The increasing cost to manage this disease is&#xD;
      unsustainable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although drug-resistant TB comprises less than 2% of the total caseload in the country&#xD;
      (approximately Â½ million patients with TB treated per year), it consumes almost 40% of the&#xD;
      total national TB programme budget, and more than 60% of the total TB drug budget. This is&#xD;
      not sustainable and drug-resistant TB therefore has the capacity to destabilise functional TB&#xD;
      control programmes in many countries in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of MDR-TB is arduous, with a six to eight month intensive phase of daily&#xD;
      painful injections of Kanamycin combined with oral pyrazinamide, a fluoroquinolone&#xD;
      (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin), prothionamide and either cycloserine or para-aminosalicylic&#xD;
      acid (if cycloserine cannot be used). Treatment continues for 18 months after consecutive&#xD;
      negative sputum cultures, and lasts at least 20 months. There are substantial drug-associated&#xD;
      toxicities and adverse events that frequently lead to interruption or cessation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to test the efficacy of a new drug regimen for the treatment of MDR-TB&#xD;
      which is of short term duration and which does not contain an injectable drug, thus making&#xD;
      treatment easier to administer and thereby potentially increasing compliance. All the drugs&#xD;
      will be available to the NTP if the study is shown to be successful. This regimen will&#xD;
      comprise linezolid, bedaquiline, levofloxacin, PZA and either ethionamide or high dose INH or&#xD;
      teridazone. A gene-directed diagnostic approach (mutational analysis) will be used in the&#xD;
      interventional arm to individualise therapy and to inform on the use of high dose INH versus&#xD;
      ethionamide. If both mutations are present then to administer teridazone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the proposed study the key aim is to test a regimen (rather than an&#xD;
      individual drug) and will look at how the outcomes (24 month), including treatment&#xD;
      completion/cure (i.e. treatment success which is the primary outcome) and mortality, are&#xD;
      impacted. It is expected that introduction of a shortened effective regimen will reduce drop&#xD;
      out and drastically reduce mortality and on-going transmission. Moreover, the rates of XDR-TB&#xD;
      and TDR-TB may also decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at 5 trial sites in South Africa that are designated MDR-TB&#xD;
      treatment facilities and it many cases patients will be recruited from the satellite clinics&#xD;
      of these centres reflecting the decentralized MDR-TB program. All the sites have the&#xD;
      necessary expertise and facilities to carry out the proposed study. The study is a fully&#xD;
      conceived and funded within South Africa.&#xD;

The continuation phase will start after 2 consecutive negative sputum cultures and continue for 18 months with Moxifloxacin, PZA, Ethionamide and Terizidone.&#xD;
In 2016 the WHO revised the treatment guidelines for MDR-TB. The South African National Tuberculosis Program adopted these recommendations and it was integrated into the study in September 2016: SA NTP recommended shorter regimen(9-12 months):Intensive phase (4-6 months): kanamycin, levofloxacin, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, high-dose isoniazid/ethionamide, ethambutol. Continuation phase (5 months): levofloxacin, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, ethambutol.</description>

             initiation of MDR-TB treatment, in this study the Hain MTBDRsl LPA will be used on the&#xD;
             sputum sample to exclude any pre-XDR and XDR cases from participation in the study&#xD;

        Whenever the investigator has reason to suspect that there might be a health problem (other&#xD;
        than TB) participation should only be considered after discussing the case with the medical&#xD;
        monitor. Note: Participants who are currently on, or have previously been on drug-sensitive&#xD;
        TB treatment are not excluded from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Post-randomisation exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        â¢ Fluoroquinolone and/or SLID resistance detected on DST using the isolate. Note: A woman&#xD;
        who falls pregnant during the treatment phase of the trial will not be excluded but will be&#xD;
        counselled regarding potential termination of pregnancy.&#xD;
