  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of an anti-cocaine&#xD;
      vaccine called dAd5GNE in cocaine-dependent individuals. It uses the concept of a vaccine to&#xD;
      treat the neurological effects of cocaine by evoking &quot;immunity&quot; to prevent the effects of&#xD;
      cocaine on the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, double blind study assessing the safety&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of an anti-cocaine vaccine called &quot;dAd5GNE vaccine&quot;. The vaccine is&#xD;
      designed to prevent cocaine from reaching the brain. The vaccine is comprised of GNE, a&#xD;
      cocaine-like molecule that is linked to the capsid protein of a disrupted serotype 5&#xD;
      adenovirus. The vaccine is used to evoke &quot;immunity&quot; to prevent cocaine from reaching the&#xD;
      brain. The vaccine evokes an immune system response and stimulates the creation of&#xD;
      anti-cocaine antibodies. The antibodies bind to the cocaine molecules when a person takes&#xD;
      cocaine and prevents the cocaine molecules from reaching the brain. This cocaine-antibody&#xD;
      complex is not able to cross the blood brain barrier and thus eliminates the effects of&#xD;
      cocaine on the brain, as seen in pre-clinical studies done by our group. In mice, rats and&#xD;
      nonhuman primates, this vaccine evoked a persistent, high titer, high affinity IgG&#xD;
      anti-cocaine antibody response. The pre-clinical studies conducted establish efficacy for&#xD;
      high anti-cocaine antibody titers. The immunity sequesters parenterally administered cocaine&#xD;
      in the blood, in mice, rats and nonhuman primates (Appendix I-III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject, the study will take place over a period of 32 weeks from the time of the&#xD;
      first vaccine administration, and will enroll cocaine addicts, as defined by the Diagnostic&#xD;
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, Text Revisions (DSM-V-TR).&#xD;

        Accrual will be random, with no bias as to gender or racial/ethnic group. Because the&#xD;
        accrual process will be random, it is possible that there may be differences in the&#xD;
        proportion of males and females, and racial/ethnic groups among the study individuals. All&#xD;
        subjects will be concurrently participating in behavioral therapy programs run by Dr.&#xD;
        Beeder's clinical team. Each case will be reviewed with the Eligibility Committee,&#xD;
        comprised of three investigators other than the PI, to determine eligibility. The Principal&#xD;
        Investigator will not participate in this process.&#xD;
