  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study designed to observe the toxicity and efficacy of&#xD;
      PBS proton RT for patients with esophageal cancer undergoing trimodality therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that PBS proton RT will be associated with a favorable adverse&#xD;
      event profile and quality of life, with similar disease control outcomes, relative to&#xD;
      historical comparisons of patients treated with photon RT.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0-2 (Appendix I)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical consultation to confirm that patient is an appropriate candidate for&#xD;
             esophagectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical oncology consultation to confirm that patient is an appropriate candidate for&#xD;
             chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned to receive standard of care neoadjuvant CRT, consisting of PBS proton RT (50&#xD;
             Gy/25 fractions) and concurrent chemotherapy (weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel),&#xD;
             followed by surgical resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the Active Monitoring&#xD;
             Phase of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: During the Active Monitoring Phase of a study (i.e., active treatment and&#xD;
        observation), participants must be willing to return to the consenting institution for&#xD;
        follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to sign consent onto the Mayo Clinic Radiotherapy Patient Outcomes Registry&#xD;
             and Biobanking study, IRB number 15-000136&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy or RT for esophageal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of RT to the thorax&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment&#xD;
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or&#xD;
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be HIV positive and not currently&#xD;
             receiving antiretroviral therapy. NOTE: Patients known to be HIV positive, but without&#xD;
             clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving any investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for the&#xD;
             primary neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other active malignancy ≤ 1 year prior to registration. EXCEPTIONS: Non-melanotic skin&#xD;
             cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix. NOTE: If there is a history or prior&#xD;
             malignancy, they must not be receiving other specific treatment for their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of myocardial infarction ≤6 months, or congestive heart failure requiring use&#xD;
             of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
