  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial in people with diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea who&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned for 3 months to PAP therapy along with healthy lifestyle and sleep&#xD;
      education or healthy lifestyle and sleep education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research over the last decade has shown that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common&#xD;
      condition in people with diabetes. Observational and experimental evidence also indicates&#xD;
      that intermittent hypoxemia and recurrent arousals in OSA may alter glucose metabolism and&#xD;
      worsen glycemic control. However, the impact of treating OSA with positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (PAP) therapy on glycemic variability and control is not well defined. Adequately powered&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials have yet to be performed to demonstrate whether PAP therapy for&#xD;
      OSA in diabetics can improve glycemic variability (and control), decrease blood pressure, and&#xD;
      reverse endothelial dysfunction. The overarching goal of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      PAP therapy for OSA in diabetics leads to improvements in (a) glycemic variability as&#xD;
      assessed by self-monitoring of blood glucose and continuous monitoring of glucose; (b)&#xD;
      glycosylated hemoglobin; (c) blood pressure; (d) endothelial function; (e) serum and urinary&#xD;
      biomarkers; and (f) dyslipidemia.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Endothelial Dysfunction as Assessed by the Reactive Hyperemic Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial function was measured by the EndoPAT device - difference at 3 months - baseline, by group. The outcome reported is the Reactive Hyperemic Index (RHI). The RHI is a measure of endothelial vasodilator function. The RHI is the post-to-pre occlusion peripheral arterial tone signal ratio in the occluded arm relative to the other arm, which is not occluded. Persons with worse endothelial function have a lower RHI score. Consequently, a low RHI indicates more endothelial dysfunction. A value of 1.67 or less is considered abnormal vascular tone. The reported lower and upper limits in adults with type 2 diabetes is 1.1 - 4.9.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale measures self-reported sleep propensity or daytime sleepiness. The range of the scale is 0 to 24 (integers only), with increasing values corresponding to increasing sleepiness. A cut-point of ≥ 11 is also sometimes used to differentiate those with pathological sleepiness (≥ 11) versus those without &lt; 11. The difference between the three month final visit - the baseline visit score is reported by group</description>

        <description>Endothelial function was measured by the EndoPAT device - difference at 3 months - baseline, by group. The outcome reported is the Reactive Hyperemic Index (RHI). The RHI is a measure of endothelial vasodilator function. The RHI is the post-to-pre occlusion peripheral arterial tone signal ratio in the occluded arm relative to the other arm, which is not occluded. Persons with worse endothelial function have a lower RHI score. Consequently, a low RHI indicates more endothelial dysfunction. A value of 1.67 or less is considered abnormal vascular tone. The reported lower and upper limits in adults with type 2 diabetes is 1.1 - 4.9.</description>
