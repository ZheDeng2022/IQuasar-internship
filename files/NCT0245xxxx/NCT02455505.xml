  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This screening tool will be used to identify significant relations of patients with advanced&#xD;
      medical illness or serious hospitalization and family individuals who lost their loved one&#xD;
      and who could use professional support in the future. We are interested in enrolling family&#xD;
      members or close friends of patients with advanced medical illness as well as family members&#xD;
      or close friends who have lost a loved one. Some screening tools to identify family members&#xD;
      who might need support do exist, but the investigators are hoping to develop one that is&#xD;
      brief and easier for healthcare providers to use. The information learned in this study will&#xD;
      help us refine the screening tool. Family member input will be essential in the development&#xD;
      of this screening tool.&#xD;
