      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of Infliximab-Biosimilar to&#xD;
      Infliximab-Innovator and to demonstrate its noninferiority, in patients with ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis or Crohn's disease in remission under treatment with infliximab up to 3 months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients, male or female, aged above 18 years at time of enrolment will be selected from&#xD;
        hospital databases based on appointments for Infliximab infusion as treatment for IBD.&#xD;
        Patients are eligible for inclusion if they have an established diagnosis of ulcerative&#xD;
        colitis or Crohn's disease, are in clinical remission and are medically treated with&#xD;
        Infliximab for at least 12 weeks prior to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has an allergy or hypersensitivity to one of the components of infliximab&#xD;
             and/or immunoglobulin products, except hypersensitivity reactions which have a&#xD;
             positive response to hydrocortisone and thereby are under control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has a current diagnosis with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or an infection with&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or 2. Patients with a past history of chronic&#xD;
             hepatitis B or hepatitis C will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has a history of tuberculosis (TB) or a current diagnosis of TB or other&#xD;
             severe or chronic infection such as abscess, opportunistic infection or invasive&#xD;
             fungal infection. Patients with a past history of a severe or chronic infection will&#xD;
             not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has had recent exposure to persons with active TB. In that case screening for&#xD;
             latent TB (defined as a positive result for interferon-Î³ release assay (IGRA) with a&#xD;
             negative examination of chest X-ray) will be performed. If there is sufficient&#xD;
             documentation of prophylaxis or complete resolution following TB-treatment based on&#xD;
             hospital-specific guidelines the patient can be enrolled. If the result of the IGRA is&#xD;
             indeterminate at screening, 1 retest will be done. If the repeated IGRA result is&#xD;
             indeterminate again, the patient will be excluded. Patients with a positive IGRA&#xD;
             result and a negative examination of chest X-ray who has received at least the first&#xD;
             30 days of TB-therapy can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient who is taking any of the following concomitant medications or treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone or budosenide).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Live or live-attenuated vaccine within 8 weeks of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other biological treatments than infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subtotal and total colectomy prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any planned abdominal surgery for IBD at the time of randomization and/or during&#xD;
                  the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has one or more of the following medical conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active entero-vesical, entero-retroperitoneal, entero-cutaneous and&#xD;
                  entero-vaginal fistula for within 6 months prior to screening. Entero-enteral&#xD;
                  fistulae without clinical significant symptoms upon investigator's opinion and&#xD;
                  anal fistulae without draining problems are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current short bowel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of any malignancy within the 5 years prior to randomization except&#xD;
                  cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or completely&#xD;
                  excised and cured squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of lymphoma or lymphproliferative disease or bone marrow hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of organ transplantation, including corneal graft/transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has had treatment with any other investigational device or medical product&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of randomization or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patient who is currently pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant&#xD;
             or breastfeed within 6 months of the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
