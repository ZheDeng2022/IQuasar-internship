    <textblock>
      Obesity, known to be associated with a pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic humoral milieu,&#xD;
      confers a worse prognosis in prostate cancer (PrCa). Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are&#xD;
      identified in the blood in advanced cancer. Their quantitation provides prognostic&#xD;
      information. &quot;Cloaking&quot; of CTCs by adherent platelets impedes natural killer (NK)-cell&#xD;
      clearance of CTCs from the circulation, enhancing metastatic spread. NK-cell function in&#xD;
      blood and in solid organs is quantitatively and qualitatively reduced in obesity. Platelet&#xD;
      cloaking may be enhanced in obesity due to the pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic state, and&#xD;
      may be a mechanism for worse cancer-specific outcomes in this group. Obesity and its&#xD;
      biochemical effects may be influenced by lifestyle changes such as exercise. Physical&#xD;
      activity reduces levels of systemic inflammatory mediators and so an aerobic exercise&#xD;
      intervention may represent an accessible and cost-effective means of ameliorating the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory effects of obesity. The ExPeCT trial will determine if a prescribed exercise&#xD;
      intervention can ameliorate the degree of platelet cloaking in obese and non-obese men with&#xD;
      advanced prostate cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis is that enhanced platelet cloaking of circulating tumour cells in&#xD;
      obese men with prostate cancer, due to increased systemic inflammation, is a mechanism&#xD;
      underlying worse prognosis of cancer in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test the following four hypotheses, dividing the experimental and&#xD;
      analytical work into four separate projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Platelet cloaking of circulating PrCa tumour cells is more prominent in men with obesity&#xD;
           than without&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Regular exercise can ameliorate platelet cloaking&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The degree of platelet cloaking varies with levels of systemic and primary tumour&#xD;
           inflammation and coagulability&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Expression of an obesity-associated lethality gene signature leads to variation in&#xD;
           platelet cloaking&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first hypothesis, 200 men with metastatic PrCa will be recruited, and divided into&#xD;
      exposed and non-exposed groups based on body mass index (BMI &gt;25). The objective will be to&#xD;
      enumerate CTCs and quantify the degree of platelet cloaking in exposed and non-exposed&#xD;
      groups, and to draw meaningful comparisons between the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second hypothesis, the objective will be to determine to what extent the number of&#xD;
      CTCs and the degree of platelet cloaking varies in exposed and non-exposed groups following a&#xD;
      supervised exercise intervention, and to compare this with a non-exercised comparison group.&#xD;
      The exercise intervention will prescribe moderate intensity aerobic exercise that will be&#xD;
      supervised once per week for 3 months and completed independently at home for a further 3&#xD;
      months. Patients will wear Polar heart rate monitors to monitor exercise prescription and&#xD;
      progression. Assessments including blood sampling and quality of life questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the third hypothesis, the objective will be to build a serological, haematological and&#xD;
      immunological picture of the state of systemic inflammation and coagulability, and the degree&#xD;
      of inflammation within the prostate gland. Furthermore, the investigators intend to correlate&#xD;
      and compare these variables with the results of the first and second objectives, in order to&#xD;
      determine whether the number of CTCs and the degree of platelet cloaking varies with changes&#xD;
      in the inflammatory / coagulatory milieu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the fourth hypothesis, the objective will be to determine whether the expression profile&#xD;
      of a number of lethality-associated genes, known to be associated with PrCa progression,&#xD;
      coagulation and stem-cell like phenotype, correlates with the number of CTCs and the degree&#xD;
      of their cloaking by platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTC numbers and the degree of platelet cloaking will be common denominators which anchor&#xD;
      these four objectives together and enable comparison between them.&#xD;
