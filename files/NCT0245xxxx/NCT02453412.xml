      Patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are dependent on renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy (dialysis). The majority of dialysis is facilitated by hemodialysis. For hemodialysis&#xD;
      a vascular access is necessary, preferable an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in which a vein is&#xD;
      directly anastomosed to an artery. In order to use the AVF for hemodialysis three criteria&#xD;
      have to be met; the minimal flow over the AVF is 600 mL/min, the diameter is at least 6 mm,&#xD;
      and the AVF is located less than 6 mm under the skin. Unfortunately, approximately half of&#xD;
      the patients (50%) are confronted with an AVF that does not meet these criteria; the so&#xD;
      called non-maturation or primary failure. In case of non-maturation the AVF is not only&#xD;
      unusable for dialysis, but also requires reinterventions on short- and long-term. Firstly to&#xD;
      mature the AVF, and secondly, when the AVF is matured, to keep the vascular access. Using a&#xD;
      computational simulation postoperative flow can be predicted. Based on patient-specific&#xD;
      duplex measurements, the model can calculate the flow that can be expected following vascular&#xD;
      access surgery for all AVF configurations; fore- or upper arm. These calculations lead to an&#xD;
      advice which configuration is indicated; a flow that exceeds 600 mL/min, leading to&#xD;
      maturation. Potentially the aforementioned 50% of non-maturation can be reduced. The patient&#xD;
      then has an adequate vascular access and reinterventions are adverted, resulting in a&#xD;
      decrease of costs, hospital demand, and an increase of the patients' quality of life. When&#xD;
      the expected reduction of non-maturation is confirmed, the computational tool can be offered&#xD;
      to other hospitals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major and growing healthcare problem associated with&#xD;
      substantial costs. By the end of 2010 the global patient population requiring chronic renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy (RRT) exceeds 2 million, of which approximately 90% relies on&#xD;
      hemodialysis (HD). The number of patients dependent on RRT are expected to annually increase&#xD;
      with 8%. Based on this figure, it is expected that in 2030, 7.3 million ESRD patients need HD&#xD;
      treatment. To facilitate adequate HD therapy a reliable vascular access (VA) is mandatory and&#xD;
      can be provided by either creation of an autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF), a prosthetic&#xD;
      arteriovenous graft (AVG) or a central venous catheter (CVC). Guidelines by the National&#xD;
      Kidney Foundation (NKF K/DOQI Guidelines), the Vascular Access Society (Good Nephrological&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines) and the European Dialysis and Transplant Association (European Best&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines on vascular access) advocate the implementation of an all-autologous&#xD;
      fistula policy to maximize the use of AVF over AVG and CVC because AVF have the best&#xD;
      long-term patency, fewer complications and require less interventions once fully maturated.&#xD;
      Although the implementation of preoperative ultrasonography examination for vessel assessment&#xD;
      has reduced the number of early AVF failure by improving the selection of the most suitable&#xD;
      vessels and site for AVF creation, short- and long-term AVF dysfunction remains the major&#xD;
      cause of morbidity and hospitalisation in HD patients, and is therefore the major limitation&#xD;
      for HD treatment. This dysfunction is usually associated with non-maturation of the newly&#xD;
      created AVF or the formation of neo-intimal hyperplasia (NIH) which potentially results in&#xD;
      decreased access flow and eventual fistula thrombosis in up to 50% of AVFs. On the other&#xD;
      hand, the low resistance vascular traject via the AVF may lead to impeded perfusion of the&#xD;
      extremity distally of the AV anastomosis resulting in hand ischemia (HAIDI = Hemodialysis&#xD;
      Access Induced Distal Ischemia), while an abundant AVF flow may lead to the development of&#xD;
      left ventricular hypertrophy, both with potentially severe consequences. These high-flow&#xD;
      complications occur in approximately 20% of fistulae. Numerous studies have investigated&#xD;
      alternative preoperative mapping tools and criteria for reduction of AVF related&#xD;
      complications. However, current clinical use of these individual tools and parameters does&#xD;
      not take into account their potential interplay at a systemic level. Therefore one might&#xD;
      consider that multiple prognostic parameters within a single patient are likely more valuable&#xD;
      to improve outcome and therefore it is obvious to tailor the type of AVF to the individual&#xD;
      patient. A possible solution to deal with multiple independent prognostic factors is&#xD;
      implementation of a predictive patient-specific computational tool that relates geometrical,&#xD;
      mechanical and hemodynamical parameters by means of physical laws. As a result, the&#xD;
      computational tool takes the complex interplay between different prognostic parameters into&#xD;
      consideration and accounts for individual differences in anatomy, physiology, demography and&#xD;
      hemodynamics. Such an innovative computational tool opens new opportunities. By predicting&#xD;
      postoperative flow abovementioned deleterious events can possibly be prevented. High-flow&#xD;
      (&gt;1500ml/min) and low-flow (&lt;600ml/min) vascular access can then be predicted and&#xD;
      consequently be rejected and a more suitable AVF-configuration chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, simulation of outcome after AVF creation is at hand. Recently, the feasibility&#xD;
      of VA computational simulation has been investigated and proven in the ARCH FP7 ICT-224390&#xD;
      project (ARCH; patient-specific image-based computational modeling for improvement of short-&#xD;
      and long- term outcome of vascular access in patients on hemodialysis therapy). Within this&#xD;
      technological and clinical study, longitudinal collection of cardiovascular data was&#xD;
      performed with the intention to develop, calibrate and validate patient-specific modelling&#xD;
      tools for surgical planning and assistance in the management of complications arising from&#xD;
      AVF creation. Given the difficult and heterogeneous patient population, the study protocol&#xD;
      was designed in such way that pre- and postoperative imaging could be performed strictly,&#xD;
      aiming at complete datasets of structural, functional and demographical data. Although the&#xD;
      computational simulation model has been validated in a small patient group, larger randomized&#xD;
      observational patient studies, aiming at evaluating the potential beneficial effect of the&#xD;
      use of computational tools in reducing AVF-related clinical problems, are needed.&#xD;
