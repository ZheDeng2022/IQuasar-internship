      neo-adjuvant and adjuvant setting in patients with surgically resectable pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is an innovative approach being developed for the treatment of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, a lethal and relatively chemotherapy-resistant disease. However, the tumor and its&#xD;
      environment have developed a number of ways in which they inhibit the function of the immune&#xD;
      system preventing it from recognizing and killing the cancer. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      still do not understand how T cells, the cells in the immune system that have the potential&#xD;
      to recognize cancer as different and kill cancer cells, traffic into the tumor to accomplish&#xD;
      their task. The investigators are currently testing an immune system activating pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer vaccine (known as GVAX) in combination with immune boosting doses of the chemotherapy&#xD;
      agent, cyclophosphamide, as preoperative and postoperative treatments for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      The investigators have discovered tertiary lymphoid aggregates, a unique lymph node-like&#xD;
      structure formed within resected tumors from the patients who received the vaccine two weeks&#xD;
      prior to the surgery. This discovery demonstrates that the immune system can get into the&#xD;
      tumor and provides the investigators with the opportunity to better understand how these&#xD;
      immune cells traffic into the tumor and function once they arrive. The investigators also&#xD;
      found that the vaccine causes an increase in signals that would suppress the immune system's&#xD;
      ability to fight off cancer cells, including signals involving PD-1. In this novel study, the&#xD;
      investigators will test the effects of blocking PD-1 in combination with the vaccine in&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer. The investigators will specifically isolate these immune&#xD;
      cells and evaluate at both the genetic and protein level, the types of signals expressed by&#xD;
      these aggregates. The investigators will compare aggregates from patients with long term&#xD;
      survival versus patients who succumb to their cancer early. In this way, the investigators&#xD;
      will be able to determine how safe this novel treatment is, how effective it is at changing&#xD;
      the immune system in pancreatic cancer, and how it impacts the health and survival of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer patients who undergo surgery to remove the cancer.&#xD;

Approximately 6-10 weeks after surgery, patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV on day 0 and the vaccine on day 1. Beginning approximately 1 month after vaccination, patients receive standard adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Beginning approximately 4-8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV on day 0 and the vaccine on day 1.
