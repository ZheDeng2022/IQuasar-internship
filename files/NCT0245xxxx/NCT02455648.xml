      Healing of mucosal defects after endoscopic mucosal resection in the oesophagus is prone to&#xD;
      result in varying degrees of stenosis, especially if the resected area is large and/or&#xD;
      circumferential. A new technique was described where autologous cells from the patients own&#xD;
      oral mucosa are harvested and cultures on proprietary membranes (coated, temperature&#xD;
      sensitive). These membranes, coined cell sheets, are used to cover the mucosal defects.&#xD;

      Aim Our aim is to evaluate if mucosal wound healing after endoscopic resection of early&#xD;
      cancers or pre-cancerous lesions in the esophagus can be enhanced by transplantation of&#xD;
      autologous cell sheets, thus reducing the risk of esophageal stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (EAC) has increased rapidly in the western world during the last decades. The reason for this&#xD;
      increase is unknown, however, there is a strong association between the risk of developing&#xD;
      EAC and gastro esophageal reflux. Chronic reflux may lead to Barrett's esophagus (BE), a&#xD;
      condition where the squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by columnar&#xD;
      epithelium(1). BE is a premalignant condition with a lifetime risk of progressing to EAC of&#xD;
      5% in men and 3% in women (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of progression is dependent on the grade of dysplasia in BE. One meta-analysis&#xD;
      showed that low-grade dysplasia had a cancer incidence of 17/1,000 patient-years while&#xD;
      high-grade dysplasia had an incidence of 66/1,000 patient-years (3). Medical treatment can&#xD;
      reduce reflux symptoms, but there is no proof that it can decrease the risk of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment High-grade dysplasia The American Gastroenterological Association guidelines&#xD;
      recommend that patients with high-grade dysplasia should be treated with surgical resection,&#xD;
      endoscopic therapy or be offered surveillance with endoscopy every 3 months (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Japanese Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (JGSE) has described that endoscopic&#xD;
      mucosal resection (EMR) is suitable for BE with high-grade dysplasia given that the diameter&#xD;
      is ≤2 cm, &lt; 1/3 of the esophageal circumference and limited to the mucosa. One of several&#xD;
      advantages with EMR is that the resected mucosa can be examined histologically, compared to&#xD;
      ablative therapies. Briefly, EMR is performed by submucosal injection to separate esophageal&#xD;
      wall layers and then resection of the mucosa with a snare. A similar technique is endoscopic&#xD;
      submucosal dissection (ESD) which also includes a submucosal injection, but instead of using&#xD;
      a snare for resecting, the lesion is dissected with cutting instruments, such as the&#xD;
      insulation-tipped (IT) knife.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another approach is radiofrequency ablation using a cylindrical balloon with electrodes&#xD;
      attached. One study showed complete eradication in 81.0% of high-grade dysplasia patients.&#xD;
      Using ablation techniques, no tissue-samples are possible to collect for histology and there&#xD;
      might also be a risk for buried Barrett's metaplasia or dysplasia which can progress.&#xD;
      Complications to radiofrequency ablation include chest pain, upper gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
      and stenosis formation (4). Moreover, patients undergoing ablation therapy require life-long&#xD;
      surveillance endoscopy (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early esophageal cancer The best curative treatment for early adenocarcinoma of the esophagus&#xD;
      is considered to be esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy (3). Esophagectomy is an&#xD;
      extensive surgical procedure with a mortality rate ranging between 4.9- 18.0% and risk for&#xD;
      serious post-operative complications ranging between 26-41% (6). There are also frequently&#xD;
      occurring post-operative complaints such as reflux, diarrhea and dysphagia (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic therapy modalities that initially were reserved for patients with HGD have been&#xD;
      used as alternatives to open surgery for early esophageal cancer. Although the practice was&#xD;
      pioneered in Asia, it is increasingly practiced in Europe and the US (7). Early cancers&#xD;
      classified as M1 (limited to epithelial layer) and M2 (invading lamina propria) may be good&#xD;
      candidates for endoscopic therapy as they are not associated with lymph node metastasis (4).&#xD;
      Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are the two&#xD;
      resective techniques for removing mucosal tissue from the esophagus (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMR, during which resection of the mucosa is performed with a snare after separation of the&#xD;
      mucosa and the muscularis propria by submucosal injection of saline or hyaloronic acid&#xD;
      injection is reserved for lesions &lt; 15 mm in diameter (8). Larger lesions can be removed by&#xD;
      so called piece meal resection, but the risk for an incomplete resection and subsequent local&#xD;
      recurrence is substantial (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With ESD, where a submucosal dissection is performed after lifting and delineation of the&#xD;
      lesion with a full-thickness mucosal circumferential cut much larger lesions can be removed&#xD;
      en bloc, reducing the risk for an incomplete resection (8, 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications to EMR and ESD A common complication after both EMR and ESD is stenosis of the&#xD;
      esophagus that can result in dysphagia. Mucosal defects larger than ¾ of the esophageal&#xD;
      circumference are strongly associated with the development of stenosis. This can be treated&#xD;
      by repetitive balloon dilatations. Takahashi et al retrospectively analyzed 437 patients&#xD;
      treated with EMR/ESD. 90 patients had mucosal defects &gt; ¾ of the esophageal circumference, of&#xD;
      which 70 developed strictures requiring dilatation (1-45 dilatations per patient with a&#xD;
      dilatation treatment time of 1-51 months). During dilatation therapy 7 perforations and 1&#xD;
      bleeding occurred (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell sheet transplantation In 2006, Ohki et al published an article on how to prevent&#xD;
      inflammation after aggressive endoscopic resection. Scarring and stenosis of esophagus is&#xD;
      caused by severe inflammation. In a canine model they tried to improve wound healing and&#xD;
      reduce constriction. They created transplantable cell sheets from autologous oral mucosal&#xD;
      epithelial cells (OMEC). In six animals esophageal ulcers were created by ESD. In three of&#xD;
      the animals, two cell sheets were transplanted. Neither of the groups showed stricture,&#xD;
      probably owing to the thicker muscle layer in dogs. However, the study showed that the&#xD;
      transplant group had an enhanced wound healing with less inflammation. The results imply that&#xD;
      cell sheet transplantation could potentially prevent stenosis after extensive mucosal&#xD;
      resections. The cells did not cover the whole ulcer, but secretion of growth factors and&#xD;
      cytokines are believed to have accelerated healing from native tissue. The harvested cell&#xD;
      sheets still had intact extra cellular matrix which may act as glue to the tissue, making&#xD;
      sutures unnecessary (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the background of the above mentioned study Ohki et al have performed a feasibility&#xD;
      study in humans (unpublished data), that thus far has shown very promising results (by direct&#xD;
      communication with Dr Ohki).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description Study design Part 1 A feasibility study in patients with early&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma or HGD in Barrett's mucosa where endoscopic resection is clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 A randomized controlled trial comparing ESD/EMR without cell sheet transplantation and&#xD;
      ESD/EMR with cell sheet transplantation with respect to mucosal wound healing time and&#xD;
      stricture formation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary endpoint: time to complete wound healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary endpoints: esophageal stricture occurrence, inflammatory response measured&#xD;
           with CellVizio, quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-OES18) Patients Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
           Patients with intramucosal adenocarcinoma or high grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus&#xD;
           where endoscopic resection is indicated in accordance with clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inability to give informed consent due to mental disorder, language barrier etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part 1: The feasibility study in Western patients with adenocarcinoma, 10 patients will&#xD;
      be recruited. No formal power calculation is made for the feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part 2: Based on the results of the Japanese feasibility study wound healing was x %&#xD;
      more rapid among cell sheet transplanted patients compared to expected healing time without&#xD;
      transplantation. Assuming a difference of healing time of 30%, based on these Japanese data&#xD;
      12 patients would be required in each group to obtain a power of 80% with alpha= 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation and transplantation of cell sheets Isolation and culturing of oral mucosal&#xD;
      epithelial cells (OMEC) The patients' oral cavity will be sterilized with iodine (??) and&#xD;
      local anesthesia will be administered to the inside of cheek. A 5 mm punch biopsy will be&#xD;
      taken and the wound sutured. The biopsy will be treated with dispase to separate the&#xD;
      epithelial cells, and after that they will be exposed to trypsin to create a single-cell&#xD;
      suspension. The single-cell suspension will be seeded to temperature-responsive cell dish&#xD;
      inserts and cultured for two weeks. No animal or bacterial derived material will be used for&#xD;
      the culturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harvesting of cell sheets When the endoscopists approximate that there is 40 minutes left of&#xD;
      the ESD the investigators will put the dishes in a 20°C incubator for 30 minutes. The cell&#xD;
      sheets will be transferred to a support membrane and transplanted to the esophageal ulcer by&#xD;
      endoscopic forceps. A light pressure will be applied to improve attachment. Depending on the&#xD;
      size of the ulcer, several cell sheets will be transplanted in the described manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Weekly gastroscopies with Cellvizio. Weekly blood samples - (CRP, interleukins,&#xD;
      Blood status) Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC C30 and OES18)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healing will be measured endoscopically by visualising and photo-documenting a&#xD;
           completely intact mucosa during the weekly gastroscopies. Along with these endoscopical&#xD;
           pictures, a grading of healing based on confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) will be&#xD;
           developed, as the pilot study (first part of the study) demonstrated feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-operative stenosis will be assessed by the easy passage of a standard 9 mm&#xD;
           endoscope through the area of resection at weeks 1-4 and then in three-monthly&#xD;
           intervals. Additionally, standard questionnaires will be used. Dysphagia is part of the&#xD;
           EORTC OES18 module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance The investigators are hoping that this study will help us identify a method of&#xD;
      preventing stenosis of esophagus after EMR/ESD. The stenosis commonly causes dysphagia that&#xD;
      not only seriously reduces the quality of life but also could pose a threat for&#xD;
      malnourishment.&#xD;
