  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been growing interest in identifying Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI) which is susceptible to progress to PD dementia(PDD). PD-MCI is&#xD;
      known to significantly correlates with low cerebrospinal beta-amyloid 1-42 and 1-40 levels,&#xD;
      in which suggest the existence of something common with Alzheimer's dementia. PDD have showed&#xD;
      more cholinergic deficits than Alzheimer's dementia and responds to donepezil. The&#xD;
      investigators assume that PD-MCI patients also have cholinergic deficits. Donepezil improves&#xD;
      cognition, and seems to be well tolerated and not to worsen parkinsonism in patients with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. Donepezil produced similar improvements in cognition and behaviour in&#xD;
      DLB and PDD. This supports the hypothesis that the two disorders are closely related&#xD;
      clinically and neurobiologically. Larger scale, placebo controlled clinical trials are needed&#xD;
      to provide an evidence base to guide the clinical use of cholinesterase inhibitors in Lewy&#xD;
      body disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that earlier intervention, later appearance of dementia should be needed to&#xD;
      lower the socioeconomic costs and to improve the quality of life on patients and caregivers.&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that donepezil may delay the development of dementia in patients&#xD;
      with PD-MCI.&#xD;
