      By performing a 89Zr-MPDL3280A-PET scan prior or during treatment with MPDL3280A, the uptake&#xD;
      of the tracer in the primary and metastatic tumor lesions and normal organ distribution can&#xD;
      be evaluated, as well as the use of a 89Zr-MPDL3280A-PET as a complementary tool for patient&#xD;
      selection and MPDL3280A- target saturation during treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)/Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis is an&#xD;
      important immune checkpoint for T cell activation that is used by tumors to evade the host&#xD;
      immune response. Blocking signaling with the PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A results in ongoing T&#xD;
      cell activity and can induce durable tumor regression across numerous solid tumor types.&#xD;
      PD-L1 is not only expressed by tumor cells but also by immune cells, activated vascular&#xD;
      endothelial cells and in immune privileged sites such as the eye. An obstacle to using PD-L1&#xD;
      expression as predictive biomarker might be its potential heterogeneous expression and fast&#xD;
      dynamics. For PD1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition PD-L1 tumor surface expression, positive in&#xD;
      40-100% of all melanoma patients and 35-95% of all non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      patients, was proposed as a potential biomarker. In early clinical trials, PD-L1 expression&#xD;
      has been associated with response to PD1/PD-L1 inhibition. However, other clinical trials&#xD;
      reported response to PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors in up to 47% of PD-L1-negative melanomas&#xD;
      assessed by a single biopsy. In bladder cancer weak to strong PD-L1 expression has been&#xD;
      reported in 30% of the patients, however also response in PD-L1-negative patients has been&#xD;
      seen. For triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) little is known, but early response data are&#xD;
      also very promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radio-labeling of MPDL3280A with the positron emission tomography (PET) radionuclide&#xD;
      Zirconium-89 (89Zr) enables non-invasive imaging and quantification of PD-L1 distribution in&#xD;
      cancer patients. By performing a 89Zr-MPDL3280A-PET scan prior to treatment with MPDL3280A,&#xD;
      the uptake of the tracer in the primary and metastatic tumor lesions and normal organ&#xD;
      distribution can be evaluated, as well as the use of a 89Zr-MPDL3280A-PET as a complementary&#xD;
      tool for patient selection in the future. There is currently no information with regards to&#xD;
      tumor saturation or inflammation induced by checkpoint inhibitors. This can be measured with&#xD;
      SUV of 89Zr-MPDL3280A PET changes during a therapeutic dosing with MPDL3280A.&#xD;
