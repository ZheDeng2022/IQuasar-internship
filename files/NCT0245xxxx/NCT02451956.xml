    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, single center phase II study of AZD5363 in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harboring PIK3CA mutation or&#xD;
      amplification as a second line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive AZD 5363 plus weekly paclitaxel combination regimen. A arm is composed&#xD;
      of 25 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour evaluation using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to&#xD;
      first dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date of enrollment, up to week 40, then every&#xD;
      16 weeks until objective disease progression (within a window of +/- 7 days of the scheduled&#xD;
      date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AZD5363 is a highly potent adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive AKT inhibitor with&#xD;
      IC50&lt;10nmol/l for all three AKT isoforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD5363 is well designed to inhibit the important main signal pathway in various human&#xD;
      cancer. AZD5363 is a specific inhibitor of the AKT pathway which is activated in a wide&#xD;
      spectrum of tumours.The combination of AZD5363 to standard chemotherapy, paclitaxel, might&#xD;
      improve the outcomes of 2nd line therapy in advanced gastric cancer patients .&#xD;
