  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a registry to monitor quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      clinically localized breast cancer who have received stereotactic accelerated partial breast&#xD;
      irradiation via CyberKnife.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy for breast cancer is delivered using several whole breast and partial breast&#xD;
      approaches. The optimal approach is unknown. The utilization of partial breast irradiation is&#xD;
      growing due to the convenience of fewer fractions versus fifteen- thirty treatments required&#xD;
      with conventional or hypofractionated whole breast radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early results with partial breast techniques are promising, showing similar cancer control&#xD;
      and toxicity. There is a large body of mature Phase I/II and preliminary Phase III data&#xD;
      available exploring the replacement of WBI with an accelerated course of radiation therapy&#xD;
      restricted to the region around the tumor bed (accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation, aPBI)&#xD;
      using a variety of techniques. For appropriately selected patients treated with modern&#xD;
      techniques, the results are encouraging and the techniques have been shown to be safe,&#xD;
      tolerable, and highly reproducible with outcomes similar to WBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is limited data assessing the quality of life, cosmetic and oncologic&#xD;
      outcomes following stereotactic partial breast irradiation in a large patient population. Our&#xD;
      study will be the first essential step in aggregating the outcomes of patients undergoing&#xD;
      this type of external beam irradiation in a large patient population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are eligible to participate in the registry if they receive CK-SAPBI in 5&#xD;
             fractions within 12 weeks of surgery and sign an institution specific consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additionally, subjects will be considered standard risk and optimal for CK-SAPBI if they&#xD;
        meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed AJCC (seventh edition) Stage 0 or I breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On histological examination, the tumor must be DCIS or invasive non-lobular carcinoma&#xD;
             of the breast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical treatment of the breast must have been wide excision, lumpectomy or partial&#xD;
             mastectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 50 years or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ER positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PR positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Her2 negative (IHC 0-1+; for IHC 2+, FISH must be non-amplified)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with invasive tumors should undergo axillary sentinel lymph node evaluation&#xD;
             or axillary lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative inked surgical margins of excision or re-excision, clear of invasive tumor&#xD;
             and DCIS by at least 2 mm&#xD;

             malignancy-associated microcalcifications with no remaining suspicious calcifications&#xD;
             in the breast before radiotherapy. Alternatively, a specimen radiograph can be&#xD;
             obtained showing all the suspicious calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No involved axillary lymph nodes, N0(i+) allowed&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  -Patients with invasive lobular carcinoma or nonepithelial breast malignancies such as&#xD;

             suspicious areas in the ipsilateral breast unless confirmed to be negative for&#xD;
             malignancy by biopsy. Breast MRI will be required to exclude multicentric disease and&#xD;
             additional suspicious areas will require biopsy to exclude malignancy.&#xD;

             penetrance genes (TP53, STK11, PTEN, CDH1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior ipsilateral breast irradiation.&#xD;
