  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate which number of lymphedema therapy&#xD;
      treatments/week best reduces upper extremity swelling, increased arm function, and reduces&#xD;
      the most lymphedema symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) is the &quot;gold standard&quot; in lymphedema care and has been&#xD;
      found to be efficacious in numerous studies. These studies have varying treatment protocols&#xD;
      of intensive phase I CDT with dosing ranging from 2x/wk for a mean of 7.5 wks to 6x/wk until&#xD;
      a plateau in arm volumes were achieved. This variability in research does not lend itself to&#xD;
      recommendations of evidence-based protocol use of CDT in an outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although CDT is backed by efficacy studies, the daily dosing given to patients is based on&#xD;
      anecdotal rather than evidence-based practice. Because the traditional protocol was developed&#xD;
      from &quot;longstanding experience,&quot; research is necessary to determine the best dosing of the&#xD;
      intensive phase of CDT. The purpose of this study is to investigate what level of dosing in&#xD;
      the intensive CDT phase promotes best volume reduction and increased upper extremity function&#xD;
      in the breast cancer-related lymphedema patient population. This particular study will&#xD;
      answer: What dosing produces best volumetric reduction and upper extremity function in the&#xD;
      intensive phase of complete decongestive therapy for outpatients with breast cancer-related&#xD;
      lymphedema 2x/wk for 4wks or 4x/wk for 4 wks?&#xD;
