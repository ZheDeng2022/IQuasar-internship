      This is a preliminary, open-label, clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      and tolerability of vortioxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder in patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease. In addition, the study will assess the effects of vortioxetine&#xD;
      on heart rate variability in these patients.&#xD;

      Comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) are common:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major depressive disorder is a highly prevalent disorder that is serious, and in some cases&#xD;
      life-threatening, condition. The 12-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the&#xD;
      United States is 6.6% (Kessler et al., 2003). Coronary artery disease (CAD) is also a large&#xD;
      and growing problem in the United States. According to the 2014 American Heart Association&#xD;
      (AHA) report on heart disease and stroke statistics, an estimated 15.4 million Americans ≥20&#xD;
      years of age have coronary artery disease. The total prevalence of coronary artery disease in&#xD;
      this population is estimated to be 6.4%, with a prevalence of 7.9% in men and 5.1% in women.&#xD;
      By the year 2030, the prevalence of coronary artery disease is projected to increase&#xD;
      approximately 18% from 2013 estimates (Go et al., 2014). Thus, patients with major depressive&#xD;
      disorder and comorbid CAD represent a large population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression in patients with CAD is clinically important:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression frequently accompanies coronary artery disease and has been linked more somatic&#xD;
      symptoms, hospitalizations, increased financial burden, and poorer quality of life, as well&#xD;
      as being a predictor of worse outcomes of cardiac disease. Reduction of cardiac risk factors&#xD;
      is less likely to be successful in depressed patients. Depression may also interfere with&#xD;
      medication adherence, as depressed patients are three times as likely to be noncompliant with&#xD;
      their medication regimens. In addition, depression is associated with decreased rates of&#xD;
      participation in cardiac rehabilitation, higher healthcare utilization and costs, and greatly&#xD;
      reduced quality of life (Lichtman et al., 2009). Due to these effects of depression on&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, there is increasing recognition that depression should be formally&#xD;
      considered a risk factor for adverse medical outcomes in patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome (Lichtman et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there is a great, unmet clinical need to treat patients with major depressive disorder&#xD;
      and coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the older tricyclic antidepressants, the newer serotonin-norepinephrine&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors are also associated with cardiovascular risks like hypertension,&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension, and perhaps QTc prolongation (Mago et al., 2014). Vortioxetine is a&#xD;
      newly approved antidepressant thought to work by combining modulation of 5-HT receptor&#xD;
      subtypes and inhibition of the serotonin transporter (Citrome, 2014). Early data suggests&#xD;
      that this multimodal mechanism of action results in increased brain levels of serotonin,&#xD;
      dopamine, and noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex (Pehrson et al., 2013). Clinical trials&#xD;
      of vortioxetine for major depressive disorder have not shown any cardiovascular adverse&#xD;
      effects (Mago et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Heart Rate Variability is a measure is based on the changes in&#xD;
      the interval between consecutive heart beats and between consecutive instantaneous heart&#xD;
      rates. It has become the conventionally accepted term to describe variations of both&#xD;
      instantaneous heart rate and RR intervals. Long term reduced heart rate variability can lead&#xD;
      to immune dysfunction and inflammation, cardiovascular disease and mortality (Newhouse,&#xD;
      2014). Several studies in depressive patients have shown reduced heart rate variability that&#xD;
      suggests an increased sympathetic activity and/or reduced vagal activity (Carney et al.,&#xD;
      2009). Thus, treating depression effectively may reduce heart rate variability, which is a&#xD;
      surrogate marker for better cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has been planned as a pilot, open-label study of the use, for the first&#xD;
      time, of vortioxetine in patients with documented coronary disease. Therefore, the sample&#xD;
      size is not based on a formal sample size calculation but on feasibility of a small study&#xD;
      that, if positive, can lead to a future larger, adequately powered study. A sample size of 25&#xD;
      patients is appropriate for the present purpose. The results of this proposed study would&#xD;
      inform sample size calculation for a future, larger study.&#xD;
