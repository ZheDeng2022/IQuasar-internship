    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine whether Peptest (Human Pepsin&#xD;
      lateral flow in vitro diagnostic medical device) is equivalent to other GERD diagnostic&#xD;
      methods commonly applied in clinical practice by testing a large number of clinical samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be performed by evaluating Peptest results in GERD patients (Erosive esophagitis or&#xD;
      NERD), defined using standard clinical procedures, and compared to healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) mainly manifests as three types, erosive esophagitis&#xD;
      (EE), non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and Barrett's esophagus. EE is characterized by&#xD;
      damaged distal esophageal mucosa which is visible by endoscope, and also referred to as&#xD;
      &quot;endoscopically positive gastroesophageal reflux disease&quot;. NERD is defined as discomfort&#xD;
      related to reflux without any obvious mucosal damage by endoscope, and is also known as&#xD;
      &quot;endoscopically negative gastroesophageal reflux disease&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present the diagnosis of GERD uses syndrome-based diagnosis, proton pump inhibitor (PPI)&#xD;
      test, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, endoscopy, etc. However, some of the above methods&#xD;
      lack specificity and some may bring great suffering to patients due to being invasive (e.g.,&#xD;
      24-hour esophagus pH monitoring). The disadvantage of endoscopy lies in its low detection&#xD;
      rate, only 2.95% to 4.1% as NERD is the most frequent diagnosis. Therefore, diagnosis based&#xD;
      on GERD syndromes still remains one of the most common diagnostic methods. In recent years,&#xD;
      questionnaire surveys about GERD have been carried out at abroad, aiming at finding a simple&#xD;
      and feasible diagnostic method. As one of the worlds's most recognized and commonly used&#xD;
      diagnostic scale for the diagnosis of GERD, reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ) is a survey of&#xD;
      medical history mainly based on symptom score. Studies at both home and abroad have confirmed&#xD;
      its validity and reliability in the diagnosis of GERD. The reflux symptom index (RSI) is a&#xD;
      validated questionnaire used to confirm the presence (or absence) of extra-esophageal reflux&#xD;
      that are atypical symptoms of reflux that control subjects may overlook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peptest (Human Pepsin lateral flow in vitro diagnostic medical device) can be used in clinic&#xD;
      for fast and convenient pepsin detection in patients' saliva. Pepsin, detected from saliva&#xD;
      samples, can be regarded as a marker of a reflux event for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal&#xD;
      reflux disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Peptest (Human Pepsin lateral&#xD;
      flow in vitro diagnostic medical device) produced by RD Biomed Limited is equivalent to other&#xD;
      GERD diagnostic methods commonly applied in clinical practice by testing a large number of&#xD;
      clinical samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GERD patients and controls will provide saliva samples and these will be tested for the&#xD;
      presence of pepsin using Peptest. Peptest results (positive or negative) will be evaluated in&#xD;
      GERD patients (Erosive esophagitis or NERD) defined using standard clinical diagnostic tools&#xD;
      and compared to controls (confirmed to not have reflux using two validated questionnaires).&#xD;
