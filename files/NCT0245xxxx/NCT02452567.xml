  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with a constellation of cardiometabolic abnormalities (including&#xD;
      insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure and dyslipidemia) that are risk factors for&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss can improve all of the cardiometabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities associated with obesity. Up to ~25% of lean people (Body Mass Index [BMI]&#xD;
      18.5-24.9 kg/m²) have many of the cardiometabolic abnormalities associated with obesity and&#xD;
      are referred to as metabolically abnormal lean (MAL) people. However, the MAL phenotype is&#xD;
      not well characterized, and it is unclear whether weight loss has beneficial metabolic&#xD;
      effects in already lean people. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to: 1) carefully&#xD;
      phenotype MAL people and 2) evaluate the effect of moderate (8-10%) diet-induced weight loss&#xD;
      in MAL people. This will be investigated in 15 MAL (defined as having 2 or more of the&#xD;
      following: intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content ≥5.6%, glycated hemoglobin ≥5.7%, fasting&#xD;
      plasma glucose concentration ≥100 mg/dl, 2-hr oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma&#xD;
      glucose concentration ≥140 mg/dl, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA-IR) ≥ 2.5) men and women. Only lean people who have a BMI ≥21.0 but &lt;25.0 kg/m² will be&#xD;
      asked to lose weight to avoid the risk that participants become underweight (BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m²)&#xD;
      during weight loss therapy.&#xD;
