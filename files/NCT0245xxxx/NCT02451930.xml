    <time_frame>Baseline through Cycle 1 (21 day cycles)</time_frame>
    <description>A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as an adverse event (AE) during the first 21 days that was possibly related to the study drug and fulfilled any of the following criteria using the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0: Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, Grade 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that persists more than 3 days despite maximal supportive intervention, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding requiring transfusion, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding, Grade 4 neutropenia that persists more than 5 days, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever, Grade ≥3 skin toxicity despite best supportive care with some exceptions, if a total at least 75% of the planned dose for both agents cannot be administered in the first cycle due to toxicity, prolonged delay (&gt;2 weeks) in initiating cycle 2 due to treatment-related toxicity and Grade 5 toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Objective Response Rates [ORR]) in Part A and Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured Progressive Disease or Start of New Anti-Cancer Therapy (Up To 16 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD) (Disease Control Rate [DCR]) in Part A Cohort 2 and Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured Progressive Disease or Start of New Anti-Cancer Therapy (Up To 16 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD as defined by RECIST v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Date of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to Date of Objective Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 16 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>DOR was defined only for responders (participants with confirmed CR or PR). It was measured from the date of first evidence of a confirmed CR or PR to the date of objective progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever was earlier.</description>

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug until first observation of objective (radiographically documented) PD as defined by RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever comes first. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Objective Response Rates [ORR]) in Part A and Part B</title>
        <description>ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD) (Disease Control Rate [DCR]) in Part A Cohort 2 and Part B</title>
        <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD as defined by RECIST v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>
