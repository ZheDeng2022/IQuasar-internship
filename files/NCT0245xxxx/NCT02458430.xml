      Balance and gait problems cause severe impairments for people with Parkinson's disease In&#xD;
      some Parkinson's disease patients the investigators see a loss of acetylcholine in the brain.&#xD;
      In previous studies the investigators have shown that this loss of acetylcholine is related&#xD;
      to impaired balance and gait function in Parkinson's disease. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      will take a closer look at this finding.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Balance and gait problems cause severe impairments for people with Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      significantly affect their quality of life. Several changes occur in the brains of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease patients. The hallmark change is a loss of a neurotransmitter (&quot;chemical&#xD;
      messenger&quot; between brain cells) called dopamine. To alleviate Parkinson's disease symptoms&#xD;
      doctors prescribe dopamine replacement therapy, for example Sinemet (levodopa). Although&#xD;
      effective for some of the symptoms, it typically does not sufficiently alleviate balance and&#xD;
      gait problems. This study focuses on other changes in the brain that occur in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease that may contribute to balance and gait problems. In particular we will be looking at&#xD;
      another neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. In some Parkinson's disease patients we see a&#xD;
      loss of acetylcholine in the brain. In previous studies we have shown that this loss of&#xD;
      acetylcholine is related to impaired balance and gait function in Parkinson's disease. In&#xD;
      this study we will take a closer look at this finding.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 50 and above (M/F).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. PD diagnosis (with or without mild cognitive impairment; MCI) will follow the UK&#xD;
             Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Research Center (UKPDSBRC) clinical diagnostic&#xD;
             criteria for PD (47), consistent with the typical nigrostriatal denervation pattern on&#xD;
             VMAT2. Absence of significant dementia confirmed by neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
             Modified Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-4 (48, 49).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. PSP diagnosis will follow the NINDS-PSP clinical diagnostic criteria (50, 51).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All PD subjects will be required to have nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation as&#xD;
             demonstrated by [11C]DTBZ PET imaging (52, 53). Subjects with Parkinsonism and absence&#xD;
             of this PD-typical pattern will be re-categorized .&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Presence of significant dementia. 2. Disorders which may resemble PD or PSP, such&#xD;
             as dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus,&#xD;
             multiple system atrophy, corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, or toxic causes of&#xD;
             parkinsonism. The use of the UKPDSBRC and NINDS-PSP clinical diagnostic criteria will&#xD;
             mitigate the inclusion of patients with atypical parkinsonism.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Subjects on neuroleptic (except for low dose quetiapine 25-50 mg/d),&#xD;
             anticholinergic (trihexyphenidyl, benztropine), cholinesterase inhibitors. Subjects&#xD;
             with prior exposure to disallowed medications may be eligible if there has been an&#xD;
             interval of &gt; 2 months off these medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Evidence of a large vessel stroke in a clinically relevant area (cerebral cortex,&#xD;
             basal ganglia, thalamus) or mass lesion on structural brain imaging (MRI or CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Participants in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is contraindicated including,&#xD;
             but not limited to, those with a pacemaker, presence of metallic fragments near the&#xD;
             eyes or spinal cord, or cochlear implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Severe claustrophobia precluding MR or PET imaging. 7. Subjects limited by previous&#xD;
             participation in research procedures involving ionizing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Pregnancy (test within 48 hours of each PET session) or breastfeeding 9. History of&#xD;
             deep brain stimulation surgery.&#xD;
