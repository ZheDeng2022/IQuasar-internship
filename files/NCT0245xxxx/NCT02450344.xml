      Objectives The aims of this study are to test the effectiveness of an online quiz competition&#xD;
      in changing adolescents' alcohol-related attitudes and behaviour and to explore the&#xD;
      feÂ¬asibility of using Internet viral marketing to reach a significant number of adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses to be tested&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The present online quiz competition is more effective in changing adolescents'&#xD;
           alcohol-related attitudes and behaviours than traditional health promotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Internet viral marketing is effective in reaching a significant number of adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects The study will constitute a cluster randomised controlled trial for 20&#xD;
      secondary schools (6,720 Grade 7 to 9 students). Schools will be randomised to intervention&#xD;
      or control arm with equal likelihood. Students in intervention schools will be invited to&#xD;
      take part in the Internet campaign whereas those in control schools will receive relevant&#xD;
      promotional leaflets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instrument An alcohol attitude and behaviour survey will be compiled with reference to&#xD;
      standardised, validated instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Participants will log into the website and answer alcohol-related&#xD;
      multiple-choice questions. They will be encouraged to promulgate the campaign to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures Alcohol-related attitude and behaviour will be the primary outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Multilevel regressions will mainly be used to evaluate the difference in&#xD;
      attitude and behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The results of the proposed study will provide evidence on the efficacy of&#xD;
      an Internet intervention in modifying adolescents' attitudes and behaviour and guide further&#xD;
      investigation into the prevention of and intervention in such risk behaviours as underage&#xD;
      drinking.&#xD;

      Intervention Arm: Internet Quiz Competition Campaign&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is designed based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. Participants will gain&#xD;
      alcohol-related knowledge through the participation of the intervention, which would in turn&#xD;
      alter their attitude concerning drinking and alcohol use. According to the Theory of Planned&#xD;
      Behavior, such knowledge and attitude improvement would reduce participants' intention to&#xD;
      drink and thus change or prevent their drinking behavior. To promote the intervention, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a briefing session and a demonstration session for all eligible&#xD;
      students in participating schools in the intervention arm. Campaign promotion brochures and&#xD;
      posters will be distributed within those schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Campaign Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the campaign will receive a referral code from those who refer them to the&#xD;
      online quiz website; starters of the campaigns will receive the code directly from the&#xD;
      research team. These referral codes, sets of 8-digit numbers, will be unique to each user and&#xD;
      used to track the referral process. During registration, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      provide basic demographic information and their referral code. After registration, their&#xD;
      baseline attitudes and behavior will be assessed using the Alcohol Attitudes and Behavior&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The campaign will last for 30 days, starting from the day of the school promotion session.&#xD;
      The aim of the competition from the participants' perspective will be to obtain the highest&#xD;
      score possible to win a prize. They will have two ways of doing so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first way will be to answer the online quiz questions. The po-ints gained in this way&#xD;
      will constitute the &quot;answer score.&quot; Alcohol-related multiple-choice questions will be&#xD;
      presented on the webpage one by one in random non-repeated order. Each correct answer will&#xD;
      result in 10 points being awarded to the user's account. Giving an incorrect answer or&#xD;
      skipping a question will not result in any points being deducted. Users will be shown the&#xD;
      correct answer immediately after they have chosen their own. The purpose of this design is to&#xD;
      promote correct alcohol-related knowledge and attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second way of accruing points to obtain a high score will be to make referrals, a step&#xD;
      designed to enhance the effectiveness of the Internet viral marketing strategy. Upon a&#xD;
      successful referral, the referrer will receive all of the answer scores of their direct&#xD;
      referrals (which will constitute their &quot;referral score&quot;). To minimize the chance of&#xD;
      self-referrals, users will receive no points from making a successful referral. Furthermore,&#xD;
      to ensure campaign competitiveness, the referral scores of lower-level users will not be&#xD;
      added to starters' accounts. The answer score and referral score will be summed into a total&#xD;
      score that will be used for prize distribution. Figure 2 illustrates the point system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The campaign website will be based on our previous Internet viral marketing campaign, which&#xD;
      has shown satisfactory user acceptance. The investigators will make necessary modifications&#xD;
      such as enhancing the user interface and preventing duplicate registrations for our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting the quiz questions will be guided by the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) of&#xD;
      persuasion. The quiz questions will be designed by youth volunteers to convey accurate and&#xD;
      interesting facts based on international and local sources such as World Health Organization&#xD;
      and Hong Kong Department of Health reports and research articles from peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
      The questions will be concrete, specific, and of personal relevance to the participants so&#xD;
      that they will be more likely to adopt a &quot;central path&quot; of message processing, which the ELM&#xD;
      predicts will induce a more sustainable effect. An experienced clinician and a research&#xD;
      assistant will examine every set of 100 questions and discuss them with the question setters&#xD;
      to ensure language accuracy and information reliability. This process will be repeated until&#xD;
      a total of 1000 quiz questions are generated. Finally, all of the questions will be&#xD;
      proofread, refined, and approved by a local alcohol research team from the School of Public&#xD;
      Health, University of Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm: Information Package&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive package on alcohol-related information will be distributed to all students in&#xD;
      the control arm. The information package will contain both printed promotional leaflets from&#xD;
      the Department of Health and an electronic guideline for understanding alcohol-related&#xD;
      information. The electronic guideline sent through the school intranet system would serve as&#xD;
      a unidirectional knowledge transfer medium, which would include a brief summary of the most&#xD;
      recent research regarding alcohol and a comprehensive list of relevant website and&#xD;
      information sources. The investigators will use these relevant websites and information&#xD;
      sources in setting the quiz questions for the intervention arm. As a result, both&#xD;
      intervention and control arms could have comparable accessibility to alcohol-related&#xD;
      information and the sole contrast between the two groups would be the method of presentation&#xD;
      (interactive online quiz competition vs unidirectional information package).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the referral nature of the Internet campaign, it is possible that a small portion of&#xD;
      students in the control group school would be referred to participate in the quiz&#xD;
      competition, which could in turn dilute the effect size estimate. As a result, the&#xD;
      investigators will ask the students in the control group in the postintervention survey&#xD;
      whether they have participated in the Internet quiz competition campaign and exclude those&#xD;
      who participate in subsequent data analysis.&#xD;
