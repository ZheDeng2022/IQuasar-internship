      This study compares the results of current standard coagulation measurement devices to the&#xD;
      Quantra System, a new device, using small amount of extra blood obtained during routine blood&#xD;
      draws in cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HemoSonics is developing a novel POC diagnostic device, the Quantra System, to perform whole&#xD;
      blood coagulation analysis and which is suitable for use in surgical and intensive care&#xD;
      settings. The Quantra System employs a patented technology named sonorheometry, which was&#xD;
      invented at the University of Virginia. Sonorheometry uses ultrasound pulses to characterize&#xD;
      the dynamic changes in viscoelastic properties of a blood sample during coagulation and clot&#xD;
      lysis. The initial assay performed on the Quantra System will be the surgical assay for&#xD;
      monitoring hemostasis during major surgical procedures in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical study will be conducted to evaluate the analytical performance as well as provide&#xD;
      a preliminary evaluation of the performance comparability of the HemoSonics' device as&#xD;
      compared to existing coagulation monitoring technology in heart surgery. This study will be&#xD;
      performed at HemoSonics and the University of Virginia Health System and will involve&#xD;
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring bypass.&#xD;
