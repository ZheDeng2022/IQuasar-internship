  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles,&#xD;
      Body Weight and Health Care is to use clinical data from electronic health records (EHR) and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes (PRO) to answer questions of clinical importance to patients,&#xD;
      providers, and other stakeholders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to create the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of&#xD;
      Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care, which will allow the conduct of&#xD;
      patient-centered observational studies on weight across the multiple institutions of the PaTH&#xD;
      network. Creating the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles,&#xD;
      Body Weight and Health Care will involve:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruiting patients with longitudinal weight data in the EHR to participate in the PaTH&#xD;
           Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and&#xD;
           Health Care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Administering surveys to the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy&#xD;
           Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care approximately every 6 months to collect patient&#xD;
           reported outcomes (PROs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collecting individual patient health record data into the PaTH Clinical Data Research&#xD;
           Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care database&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identifying potential participants for future research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Tracking whether the patient participant has biospecimens in a PaTH site biorepository&#xD;
           and prepare for possible sharing of biospecimens in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to use the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of&#xD;
      Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care to answer patient-centered research questions&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) How do survey response rates, sample demographics and survey responses differ by&#xD;
      recruitment technique? (2) What are patients' weight management strategies? How much are&#xD;
      health care providers contributing to their weight management approaches? Do these&#xD;
      relationships vary by weight status, region, age, sex, or race; (3) What are patients'&#xD;
      reasons for seeking bariatric surgery and expectations in terms of weight change?; (4) Among&#xD;
      patients seeking bariatric surgery, what proportion with high risk for sleep apnea by survey&#xD;
      responses have been evaluated for or diagnosed with this health problem? (5) How does&#xD;
      physical activity vary with patients co-morbidity status?&#xD;

        Potential participants for the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy&#xD;
        Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care will include patients identified through EHRs at&#xD;
        the participating PaTH sites, using the eligibility criteria defined through the PCORnet&#xD;
        Obesity Task Force and described below. We aim to recruit as many patients as possible from&#xD;
        the target population, with one of the recruitment strategies producing a 50% enrollment&#xD;
        rate.&#xD;
