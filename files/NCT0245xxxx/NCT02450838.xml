  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses are mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Each year, dengue viruses infect millions of&#xD;
      people throughout the tropics and subtropics. This study will evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of a tetravalent recombinant subunit dengue vaccine (V180)&#xD;
      in healthy adults who previously received a live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TV003&#xD;
      or TV005).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue fever is caused by any one of four viral serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4)&#xD;
      and infection by any serotype creates life-long immunity against that serotype. V180 is an&#xD;
      experimental tetravalent recombinant subunit dengue vaccine that would protect against all&#xD;
      four serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of adjuvanted (with Alhydrogel™) and nonadjuvanted&#xD;
      formulations of V180 in healthy adults who have previously received the live-attenuated&#xD;
      tetravalent dengue vaccine TV003 or TV005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one intramuscular injection of either&#xD;
      adjuvanted V180, nonadjuvanted V180, or placebo at study entry (Day 1). Participants will&#xD;
      record their temperature and any adverse events for 14 days after receiving the vaccination.&#xD;
      Additional study visits will occur on Days 15, 28 and 180. Visits will include a physical&#xD;
      examination and blood and urine collection. Study staff will contact participants by&#xD;
      telephone at Days 7 and 90 (and at other occasional time points between Days 90 and 180) for&#xD;
      health and safety follow-up monitoring.&#xD;
