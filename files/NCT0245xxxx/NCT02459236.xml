  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant unmet medical need for rapidly acting treatment of subjects with&#xD;
      severe major depressive disorder (MDD) who have not adequately responded to antidepressant&#xD;
      therapy. Alternative therapies require weeks to achieve full efficacy, may have significant&#xD;
      side effects, and still fail in a high percentage of subjects. Rapid reduction of severe&#xD;
      depression by pharmacological therapy is important to reduce the need for hospitalization and&#xD;
      risk of self-harm and mortality. CERC-301, a highly selective, orally bioavailable,&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2B (NR2B), also referred to as Glutamate NMDA&#xD;
      receptor subunit epsilon-2 (GluN2B) antagonist, would be a therapeutic breakthrough if it&#xD;
      provides rapid onset of antidepressant effects and an effect size similar to that seen with&#xD;
      experimental intravenous NMDA modulators.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the antidepressant effect of one or two administrations of two doses&#xD;
      of CERC-301 (12 mg and 20 mg) in subjects with MDD who are currently experiencing a severe&#xD;
      depressive episode despite stable ongoing treatment with a selective serotonin- or&#xD;
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI or SNRI).&#xD;
