      Clinical question and hypothesis In patients with congestive heart failure who experience&#xD;
      episodic activity-induced dyspnea (incident dyspnea), will the administration of intranasal&#xD;
      fentanyl pre-activity result in subjective improvement in dyspnea and objective improvement&#xD;
      in functional capacity? Will there be side effects from this treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that pre-activity treatment with intranasal fentanyl will result in both subjective&#xD;
      improvements in dyspnea ratings as well as an increased measurement of functional capacity.&#xD;
      We also suspect that this treatment will not increase the patient's experienced side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective The primary object of this study is to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of fentanyl on the management of incident dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study design will be a cross over study with a minimum of a one hour wash&#xD;
      out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will be for 2 hours over 1-2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Walking distance from the 6MWT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective rating of dyspnea and side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and participants' general appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size We hope to study 20 patients. Given the paucity of data so far, it is not&#xD;
      possible to statistically calculate the appropriate power for this study and 20 patients is&#xD;
      an approximation based on clinical experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is not enough data available currently for our statistician to find a power calculation&#xD;
      that eliminates type 1 and 2 error. Based on anecdotal evidence and experience with this&#xD;
      medication in the clinical setting, we have estimated that the number needed to determine a&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference is likely around 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population We will study the application of fentanyl in patients ages 18 or older, of&#xD;
      either gender, with either a diagnosis of NYHA Class 3 or 4 heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be experiencing activity-induced incident dyspnea without reversible&#xD;
           causes. They would have controlled background dyspnea without opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be physically able to safely ambulate in order to complete the 6MWT (may&#xD;
           have mobility devices and may use supplement oxygen prescribed pre-study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are unable to perform the 6MWT for any reason or have contraindications to&#xD;
           performing the 6MWT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that have anatomical pathologies that would make intranasal administration&#xD;
           impossible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with known allergies/sensitivities to fentanyl/sufentanil&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Criteria Participants may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time they&#xD;
      feel uncomfortable with the protocol. They will also be withdrawn if they experience chest&#xD;
      pain, palpitations, syncope, presyncope, or worsening dyspnea. Objectively, they will be&#xD;
      withdrawn if blood pressure drops below 90/50, heart rate drops below 60 or rises above 100,&#xD;
      if oxygen saturation drops below 90%, or if respiratory rate drops below 8 or rises above 20.&#xD;
      If any of: oxygen saturation, blood pressure, or respiratory rate drop below the cut off&#xD;
      point and do not recover within 5 min of rest, the antidote, Naloxone will be administered&#xD;
      with a subcutaneous injection. The trial may be stopped early if the treatment arm&#xD;
      statistically demonstrates superiority or increased harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Subjects All patients will do the walk test with and without and fentanyl. They&#xD;
      will be instructed to continue any current medications that have been previously prescribed&#xD;
      and to not make any changes to their medications. Should they be on any medications for&#xD;
      dyspnea such as diuretics, bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, continuous oxygen, opioids&#xD;
      etc., they are to be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first walk test, the patient will be asked to rate their baseline dyspnea,&#xD;
      somnolence, anxiety, pain and nausea using the ESAS VAS scale. The research team will record&#xD;
      baseline heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and describe the patient's general&#xD;
      appearance. The patient will complete the 6MWT under appropriate supervision from our&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will re-measure the study patient's heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and describe their general appearance for comparison to baseline. Any other&#xD;
      adverse effects or symptoms will be recorded. These measures will be repeated at 10 minutes&#xD;
      and 20 minutes post-6MWT to document any resolution of symptoms post activity. Following the&#xD;
      6MWT, treatment for dyspnea will be provided if required. The patient will also rerate their&#xD;
      dyspnea, somnolence, anxiety, pain and nausea using the ESAS VAS scale for an objective&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a minimum of 1 hour (wash out period), they will proceed to the second phase of the&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second phase, the patient will once again be asked to rate their baseline dyspnea,&#xD;
      somnolence, anxiety pain and nausea using the ESAS VAS scale. This is to ensure consistency&#xD;
      among their baseline measures. The research team will record their objective measures as&#xD;
      stated above. The patients will then be given the fentanyl treatment and the 6MWT will be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be administered a spray of 50mcg of fentanyl intranasally as suggested as the&#xD;
      first titration step outlined in the Incident Pain and Dyspnea protocol, developed by the&#xD;
      Winnipeg Regional Health Authority Palliative Care Program&#xD;
      (http://palliative.info/IncidentPain.htm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 6MWT, the patient will again be asked to rate their baseline dyspnea,&#xD;
      somnolence, anxiety and nausea using the ESAS VAS scale. The research team will complete and&#xD;
      record objective measurements. As in phase 1 these measures will be repeated at 10 minutes&#xD;
      and 20 minutes post-6MWT to document any resolution of symptoms post activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Efficacy By collecting data at the time points described above, we will be able&#xD;
      to compare the averaged baseline symptoms with exertion induced symptoms. Most importantly,&#xD;
      the data will allow us to compare the difference in subjective symptoms between&#xD;
      pre-exertional treatment with intranasal fentanyl with symptoms without pre-exertional&#xD;
      treatment. Using the 6MWT, we would be able to objectively assess any change in the study&#xD;
      patient's walking distance, which would represent a change in their functional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Safety Patients will be monitored with a subjective symptom assessment scale&#xD;
      (ESAS) and also with vital sign monitoring. If adverse events occur, the patients will be&#xD;
      monitored by the research nurse with vitals signs taken every 5 minutes until the patient&#xD;
      settles. If the patient does not settle within 5 minutes, as evidenced by an improvement in&#xD;
      vital signs and/or subjective report, the research nurse will determine whether naloxone&#xD;
      should be administered. If naloxone is not indicated, or the patient does not improve with&#xD;
      the administration of naloxone, the research nurse will report the patient's condition to the&#xD;
      patients primary nurse in charge of his/her care on the ward. The research nurse will further&#xD;
      assist the primary nurse in providing standard medical care to the participant as necessary.&#xD;
      If naloxone is administered, the research nurse will inform the primary ward nurse and will&#xD;
      continue to monitor the patient with vital signs every 5 min for an hour. After an hour has&#xD;
      elapsed, it is anticipated the study medication will have cleared from the participants body,&#xD;
      and any unresolved adverse effects will be managed according to standard medical practice by&#xD;
      the ward doctors and nurses. All adverse events will be documented. All serious adverse&#xD;
      events (representing a significant health hazard to the participant) will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      medical monitor and reported to the sponsor and the University of Manitoba Research Ethics&#xD;
      Board and Health Canada accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Comparison of subjective rank data (non-parametric) between phase 1 and&#xD;
      phase 2 will be analyzed using the Wilcoxin rank sum test. Comparison of objective numerical&#xD;
      data (parametric) between phase 1 and 2 will be analyzed using paired t-tests. The 6MWT&#xD;
      interpretation will include both absolute differences and percentage differences.&#xD;
