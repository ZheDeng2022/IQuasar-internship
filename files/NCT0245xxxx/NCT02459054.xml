      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether the 50cc TAH-t can safely support,&#xD;
      and provide probable benefit to, transplant-eligible pediatric patients (aged 10 - 18 years)&#xD;
      and can safely and effectively support transplant-eligible adult patients (aged 19 - 75&#xD;
      years) at imminent risk of death from biventricular failure without experiencing permanent&#xD;
      disabling, stroke-related deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a three-arm trial of the 50cc temporary Total Artificial Heart&#xD;
      (TAH-t) as a bridge to transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Primary Pediatric Arm of the trial will evaluate the safety and probable benefit of&#xD;
           the 50cc TAH-t for transplant-eligible patients 10 through 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Primary Adult Arm of the trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 50cc&#xD;
           TAH-t for transplant-eligible patients 19 through 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Secondary Arm will capture pediatric and adult subjects who did not meet enrollment&#xD;
           criteria for a Primary Arm, but meet the less restrictive Secondary Arm enrollment&#xD;
           criteria, in order to further characterize the use of the device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is the reduced ability of the native heart to pump blood and maintain normal&#xD;
      bodily function. Heart transplantation is the standard of care treatment for end-stage heart&#xD;
      failure but the supply of donor hearts is insufficient to meet the need and many patients are&#xD;
      not eligible for transplantation because of age or comorbid conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 15 October 2004, the SynCardia 70cc temporary TAH-t System received Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) approval for Premarket Approval Application (PMA) #P030011 for&#xD;
      in-hospital use as a bridge to transplant (BTT) in cardiac transplant-eligible candidates at&#xD;
      risk of imminent death from biventricular failure. The system consists of the implantable&#xD;
      TAH-t and an external pneumatic driver. Subsequent to the original approval, two additional&#xD;
      external pneumatic drivers have been approved for use with the 70cc TAH-t.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 30 January 2013, FDA granted a Humanitarian Use Designation (HUD) to the 50cc TAH-t for&#xD;
      use as BTT in pediatric patients with biventricular heart failure who have a body surface&#xD;
      area (BSA) that can sufficiently accommodate the device. To evaluate the ability of the&#xD;
      device to support patients who are too small to be supported with the 70cc TAH-t, SynCardia&#xD;
      will conduct a clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a three-arm trial of the 50cc temporary Total Artificial Heart&#xD;
      (TAH-t) as a bridge to transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Primary Pediatric Arm of the trial will evaluate the safety and probable benefit of&#xD;
           the 50cc TAH-t for transplant-eligible patients 10 through 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Primary Adult Arm of the trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 50cc&#xD;
           TAH-t for transplant-eligible patients 19 through 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Secondary Arm will capture pediatric and adult subjects who did not meet enrollment&#xD;
           criteria for the pediatric arm, but meet the less restrictive Secondary Arm enrollment&#xD;
           criteria, in order to further characterize the use of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric subject data through six months post-implant will be reported to FDA to support a&#xD;
      Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application for an orphan indication in pediatric&#xD;
      patients for which there is no alternative replacement device. Pediatric subjects (enrolled&#xD;
      in the Primary Pediatric Arm or Secondary Arm) who are continuing on TAH-t support at the six&#xD;
      month study visit will continue to be followed under the study every six months until&#xD;
      transplant, withdrawal from the study, all subjects in the respective arm have reached an&#xD;
      endpoint, or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Primary Pediatric Arm of the study is to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      50cc TAH-t can safely support, and provide probable benefit to, transplant-eligible pediatric&#xD;
      patients at imminent risk of death from biventricular failure without experiencing permanent&#xD;
      disabling, stroke-related deficits. Probable benefit will be measured as transplanted during&#xD;
      the first six months, or survival at six months and continuing on support on the initially&#xD;
      placed 50cc TAH-t, without experiencing permanent disabling stroke-related deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by the characterization of the adverse event (AE) profile through&#xD;
      the six month study end date. AEs will be identified by the terms and definitions of the&#xD;
      Pedimacs/Intermacs Registry. The secondary endpoints to establish safety for both the&#xD;
      pediatric and adult arms will be measured by performance goals (based on prior experience&#xD;
      with the 70cc TAH-t) for the four adverse event categories that are likely to delay or&#xD;
      preclude transplant. The four categories are: Major infection (sepsis), Neurological event&#xD;
      (CVA), Chronic renal dysfunction, Major device failures/malfunctions per the&#xD;
      Pedimacs/Intermacs AE definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patient data through six months post-implant will be reported to FDA to support a&#xD;
      Premarket application (PMA) for treatment of small-statured adult patients who are unable to&#xD;
      accommodate the 70cc TAH-t in their chest cavity and for whom there is no alternative&#xD;
      replacement device. Adult subjects (enrolled in the Primary Adult Arm or the Secondary Arm)&#xD;
      will be followed through six months post-implant and, if continuing on support at that time,&#xD;
      will continue to be followed under the study every six months until transplant, withdrawal&#xD;
      from the study, all subjects in the respective arm have reached an endpoint, or death,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first.&#xD;
