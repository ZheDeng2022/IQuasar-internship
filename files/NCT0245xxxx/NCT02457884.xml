  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is a sight-threatening problem for diabetic patient who has&#xD;
      swelling in macula. Patients with DMO can receive laser treatment and achieve good acuity&#xD;
      finally. However, some patients still have difficulties in reading even after proper&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators aimed to explore the effectiveness of different training&#xD;
      paradigms in improving reading performance in patients with DMO.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO), after receiving laser photocoagulation, achieved&#xD;
      good outcomes in distance acuity. However, some patients, particularly those developing&#xD;
      parafoveal scotoma, still had difficulty in reading. Inability to read or reading very slowly&#xD;
      leads to the potential loss of job, as well as the enjoyment of reading for leisure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effectiveness of reading&#xD;
      rehabilitation using perceptual learning paradigms in enhancing reading performance in&#xD;
      patients with reading difficulties due to DMO. Also, the fundamental mechanisms explaining&#xD;
      the reading problems in patients with DMO reading Chinese will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the perceptual training would show an improvement in&#xD;
      reading. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that temporal visual processing speed and&#xD;
      spatial visual span will be improved after perceptual training. The investigators' secondary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the reading speed and fixation stability will be improved after training.&#xD;
