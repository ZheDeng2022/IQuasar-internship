    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, observational study to further evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of the Proxifuse Hammer Toe Device when utilized for bone fixation.&#xD;
      Approximately 4 US sites will participate. The primary endpoint will evaluate the 6 month&#xD;
      post surgery change from baseline in the PROMIS Pain Interference computerized adaptive test&#xD;
      (CAT) score.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an observational plan designed to obtain clinical experience and follow up data on&#xD;
      the use of the ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device for the fixation of osteotomies and reconstruction&#xD;
      of the lesser toes following correction procedures for hammertoe, claw toe and mallet toe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of data on patients treated with the FDA 510k approved ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device&#xD;
      will assist Cartiva in further evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of the ProxiFuse&#xD;
      Hammer Toe Device when utilized for bone fixation per the specified indications. The&#xD;
      ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device is currently approved for commercial distribution and use in the&#xD;
      country in which this protocol is being administered (FDA 510k approval K142490). . Given&#xD;
      that the product is approved for distribution and use, the product is being used within its&#xD;
      approved indication for use, and the data being collected is not burdensome or outside the&#xD;
      standard of care, it is determined that no additional regulatory requirements are applicable&#xD;
      to this data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device consists of three components: the implant, deployment&#xD;
      instrumentation, and bone awl. The implant is comprised of 2-0 suture, two Nitinol anchors&#xD;
      with PEEK Inserts, and a PEEK Stabilizing Body. The device is delivered through a&#xD;
      specifically designed instrument. The method of delivery allows for a shifting of the PEEK&#xD;
      Body which limits the amount of traction required to place the middle phalanx over the&#xD;
      device. The suture utilized in the device serves to shift the PEEK Body and to apply tension&#xD;
      between the Nitinol anchors which in turn stabilizes the proximal interphalangeal joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with guidelines as outlined in ISO 14155, ICH GCP, and 21 CFR Part 50, each&#xD;
      patient must grant documented informed consent and authorization of disclosure of&#xD;
      identifiable health information prior to the collection of clinical data. Each patient should&#xD;
      be informed of the procedures to be performed and that data will be collected. It is the&#xD;
      intent to use de-identified research data for the potential purposes of product development&#xD;
      and publication in marketing literature, journals, and peer-reviewed medical journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the signed informed consent document should be provided to the patient and the&#xD;
      original should be maintained as part of the patient's clinical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authorization to use the information collected has no expiration. Cartiva and its&#xD;
      affiliates may continue to rely on this authorization to obtain and use the information&#xD;
      unless the patient revokes/cancels the authorization in writing. Confidential information&#xD;
      will not be shared with anyone outside of Cartiva and its affiliates. Patient names or&#xD;
      identifying information will not be used in any reports, publications, or presentations. All&#xD;
      data will be de-identified and maintained by University of Rochester .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will occur at baseline and the following time points after the surgical&#xD;
      procedure: 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. The study will last for 6 months&#xD;
      following each patient's surgical procedures, until the last subject is seen at the 6 month&#xD;
      follow up visit, or is withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline/preoperative information and assessments should be performed once the subject is&#xD;
      consented and enrolled. All operative, discharge, and rehabilitation information should be&#xD;
      captured on the eCRFs. Any additional procedures performed during the operation should be&#xD;
      documented as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator should complete a foot exam and the subject should complete the PROMIS&#xD;
      questionnaires at all clinical follow up visits. The PROMIS data that is collected in this&#xD;
      study will be compared to historical AOFAS hammertoe data from the PROMIS database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight bearing anteroposterior and lateral x-rays of the treated toe(s) should be taken at&#xD;
      the 1 and 6 week follow up visits. The Investigator should perform a radiographic assessment&#xD;
      to observe the presence of any displacements or complications.. Any findings should be&#xD;
      captured on the eCRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be captured on electronic case report forms (eCRFs):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline / Preoperative Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Operative&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRFs are to be completed by the treating physician or designated clinical representative.&#xD;
      Every attempt should be made to provide all CRFs to University of Rochester completed in&#xD;
      their entirety for each patient. Where information is not directly available from the&#xD;
      patient, a review of the patient's clinical records should be conducted in order to complete&#xD;
      as much information as possible on the CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this study is based on the analysis of the primary endpoint. A minimum of&#xD;
      70 patients will be enrolled with the goal of at least 59 patients completing the 6 month&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables will be analyzed using the intent-to -treat (ITT) data set. The ITT data set&#xD;
      will include all enrolled patients who receive the ProxiFuse Hammer Toe device in at least&#xD;
      one qualifying toe. No methods will be used to impute values for missing data. Adverse events&#xD;
      will be summarized by presenting the number and percent of patients reporting each event.&#xD;
