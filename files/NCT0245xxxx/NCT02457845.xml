      This study is a clinical trial to determine the safety of injecting G207 (a new experimental&#xD;
      virus therapy) into a recurrent or progressive brain tumor. The safety of combining G207 with&#xD;
      a single low dose of radiation, designed to enhance virus replication and tumor cell killing,&#xD;
      will also be tested. Funding Source - FDA OOPD&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Outcomes for children with recurrent or progressive supratentorial malignant brain tumors are&#xD;
      very poor, and there are a lack of effective salvage therapies once a patient fails standard&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G207 is an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV) that has been successfully engineered to&#xD;
      introduce mutations in the virus that enable it to selectively replicate in and kill cancer&#xD;
      cells, but not normal cells. Replication of G207 in the tumor not only kills the infected&#xD;
      tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus&#xD;
      particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor&#xD;
      cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct&#xD;
      oncolytic activity, the virus engenders an anti-tumor immune response; the virus is&#xD;
      immunogenic and produces a debris field which exposes cancer cell antigens to immune cells&#xD;
      which can target other cancer cells. Thus, the oncolytic effect of the virus and the immune&#xD;
      response that the virus stimulates provide a one-two punch at attacking cancer cells. In&#xD;
      preclinical studies, a single 5 Gy dose of radiation within 24 hours of virus inoculation to&#xD;
      the tumor increased virus replication and tumor cell killing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Alabama at Birmingham has conducted three phase I trials of G207 injected&#xD;
      into the recurrent tumor alone or combined with a single dose of radiation in adults with&#xD;
      recurrent high-grade gliomas. In these trials, high doses (up to 3 x 10^9 plaque-forming&#xD;
      units) of virus were safely injected directly into the tumor or surrounding brain tissue&#xD;
      without serious toxicities. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence of an antitumor&#xD;
      response was seen in some patients. Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that a&#xD;
      variety of aggressive pediatric brain tumor types are sensitive to G207.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase I, open-label, single institution clinical trial of G207 alone or&#xD;
      combined with a single low dose of radiation in children with recurrent or progressive&#xD;
      supratentorial brain tumors. The primary goal is to determine safety. The secondary aims are&#xD;
      to obtain preliminary information on the effectiveness of and immune response to G207.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A traditional 3 + 3 design will be used with four patient cohorts. The first two cohorts will&#xD;
      receive G207 at one of two doses, and the second two cohorts will receive G207 at one of two&#xD;
      doses followed by a 5 Gy dose of radiation.&#xD;
