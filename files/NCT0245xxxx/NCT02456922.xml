    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, prospective single-sample correlational design&#xD;
      without controls. A total of up to 310 previously-diagnosed type 1 or 2 diabetes subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in order to have 160 subjects complete frequent sample testing at up to 17&#xD;
      centers. Subjects will wear Harmony 1 sensors used with the Guardian Mobile application.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is 2-75 years of age at time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A clinical diagnosis of type 1 or 2 diabetes for a minimum of 12 months duration as&#xD;
             determined via medical record or source documentation by an individual qualified to&#xD;
             make a medical diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate venous access as assessed by investigator or appropriate staff&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects participating in the high and low glucose challenges must have an established&#xD;
             insulin carbohydrate ratio(s) and insulin sensitivity ratio. (The term &quot;established&quot;&#xD;
             refers to a ratio that has been previously defined and tested prior to screening&#xD;
             visit). Subjects without established ratios may participate under observation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject will not tolerate tape adhesive in the area of Harmony 1 Sensor placement as&#xD;
             assessed by qualified individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of Harmony 1 Sensor or&#xD;
             device placement (e.g., psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device) wherein&#xD;
             they have received treatment from an investigational study (drug or device) in the&#xD;
             last 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is female and has a positive pregnancy screening test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child bearing age and who are sexually active should be excluded if they&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has had hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness within the past 6&#xD;
             months prior to screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) within the past 6 months&#xD;
             prior to screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of a seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has central nervous system or cardiac disorder resulting in syncope&#xD;
&#xD;
