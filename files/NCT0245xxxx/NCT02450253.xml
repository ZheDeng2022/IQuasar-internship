      Could Tadalafil improve blood flow in deep brain tissue and potentially improve cognitive&#xD;
      function in patients with cerebral small vessel disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (VCI), which in its most severe form manifests as vascular dementia (VaD). SVD is a fibrous&#xD;
      thickening of small penetrating arteries in deep brain nuclei (basal ganglia, thalami) and&#xD;
      subcortical white matter.Clinical studies suggest that pure VCI/VaD contributes approximately&#xD;
      8-15% of dementia in older people Reduced CBF is well established in VCI. Improved blood flow&#xD;
      in the vasculature of the deep white and grey matter is therefore an attractive mechanism for&#xD;
      slowing the pathology of VCI and is a valuable biomarker for an initial proof of concept&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the likelihood of success in a full scale clinical trial of tadalafil in VCI,&#xD;
      this study will test the effects of single dose tadalafil on cerebral blood flow in subjects&#xD;
      with SVD using ASL-MRI. A strict definition of SVD will be used that combines clinical and&#xD;
      MRI criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) specifically degrades cGMP within cells; limiting activation of&#xD;
      protein kinase G. Guanylyl cyclase enzymes generate cGMP, downstream from NOS-nitric oxide&#xD;
      signalling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDE5 inhibitors in SVD. PDE5 blockade is a plausible strategy to improve local cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow (CBF), in the deep brain areas afflicted by SVD. By augmenting the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway,&#xD;
      PDE5i drugs are expected to be vaso-relaxant in small artery myocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with pulmonary hypertension sildenafil improved cerebral vascular reactivity in&#xD;
      response to hypercapnic challenge, indicative of an improvement in neurovascular coupling.&#xD;
      Similar increased reactivity was recorded 60 min after administration of sildenafil in ED&#xD;
      patients. By contrast, healthy volunteers showed no change in MCA blood flow following&#xD;
      sildenafil, similar to healthy rodents, where vasodilation occurred only at high&#xD;
      concentrations of drug. Overall it appears that PDE5i may have little effect on &quot;healthy&quot;&#xD;
      cerebral arteries in rodents and humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior human studies have been single dose studies of PDE5i in healthy humans, have only used&#xD;
      sildenafil and have in general estimated CBF from Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) blood flow&#xD;
      using Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD). MCA blood flow may not reflect local blood flow in the&#xD;
      microvasculature of the deep white and deep grey matter. One study examined the effect of&#xD;
      single dose sildenafil on CBF using SPECT in patients with vascular risk factors with or&#xD;
      without a history of stroke. Non-stroke patients exhibited an overall increase in CBF.&#xD;
      However, no distinction was made in this study between large vessel and lacunar stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, pre-clinical studies support a CBF-enhancing action of PDE5i in cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease, while human studies to date have been limited to sildenafil and have not&#xD;
      specifically addressed effects on CBF in people with SVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tadalafil (Cialis®) is widely-used as an oral agent for sexual dysfunction. As an inhibitor&#xD;
      of the enzyme PDE5, tadalafil has a well-established pharmacological profile as a small&#xD;
      vessel vasodilator. Side-effect profile and pharmacokinetics are well known and the drug is&#xD;
      well-tolerated in the target population, over a range of oral doses and regimens. The choice&#xD;
      of tadalafil over other PDE5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, Viagra®) is based on potency,&#xD;
      selectivity for PDE5, plasma half-life and documented brain penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) specifically degrades cGMP within cells; limiting activation of&#xD;
      protein kinase G. Guanylyl cyclase enzymes generate cGMP, downstream from NOS-nitric oxide&#xD;
      signalling. The PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil (Viagra®; discovered at Pfizer, Sandwich UK) raised&#xD;
      the profile of PDE5 as a therapeutic target. Tadalafil (Cialis®; licence holder: Eli Lilly)&#xD;
      is widely prescribed on an &quot;as required&quot; basis for ED in men. It is also licensed for regular&#xD;
      daily use at a dose of 5 mg for benign prostatic hyperplasia and 40 mg for pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension. Tadalafil is well tolerated and its side effect profile is well-established&#xD;
