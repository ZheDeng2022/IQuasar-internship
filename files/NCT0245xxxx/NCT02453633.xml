    <textblock>
      The project will be done at the ear, nose and throat outpatient department at Lovisenberg&#xD;
      Diakonale Hospital (LDS) in 2015-2016. About 12% of patients with appointments at the&#xD;
      surgical outpatient clinic at LDS do not attend their appointment even after receiving both&#xD;
      letters and shot message service (SMS) reminders. Persuasion theory suggests that the SMS&#xD;
      reminders may be more effective if the text appeals more to the patient's feelings. The&#xD;
      project is designed as a randomized controlled trial in which the control group receives the&#xD;
      standard text that has neutral content and the intervention group receives a more&#xD;
      emotion-based SMS reminder. The aim is to determine whether the more emotional text reduces&#xD;
      the proportion of patients who do not show up for their scheduled appointment at the surgical&#xD;
      outpatient clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies from Norway's Health South East (HSØ) show that the number of patients who do not&#xD;
      attend their scheduled appointments account for 200 000 to 250 000 outpatient consultations&#xD;
      each year. For comparison, there are 270,000 patients waiting for treatment. It has thus been&#xD;
      recommended that regional health authorities take measures to reduce the number of patients&#xD;
      who do not attend their scheduled appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate whether short message service (SMS) appointment reminders that&#xD;
      appeal to the patient's emotions are more effective for reducing non-attendance to scheduled&#xD;
      outpatient appointments at the ear, nose, and throat outpatient clinic at Lovisenberg&#xD;
      Diakonale Hospital in Oslo, Norway. The study will be designed as randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      in which 2000 patients are randomly assigned to either the intervention group (emotional SMS&#xD;
      text) or the control group (standard SMS text with neutral content). Because theory suggests&#xD;
      that emotion-based text messages will be more effective reminders, it is hypothesized that&#xD;
      they will result in a 50% reduction in the number of patients who do not show for their&#xD;
      appointment compared to the control group.&#xD;
