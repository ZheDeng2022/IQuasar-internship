    <textblock>
      This observational prospective single arm cohort study is designed to assess overall&#xD;
      survival, symptomatic skeletal event free survival and quality of life of metastatic&#xD;
      Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) patients receiving Radium- 223 under real life&#xD;
      conditions. In addition, time to next tumor treatment (TTNT), mobility, quality of life and&#xD;
      selfcare, independence in activities of daily living and safety will be assessed.&#xD;
