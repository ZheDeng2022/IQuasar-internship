      This study is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study that will be run in 2&#xD;
      parts: a safety run-in part to determine the dose of azacitidine and then a second part to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of that dose in children and young adults with acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      in molecular relapse after their first complete remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication Treatment of children and young adults with molecular relapse of acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) after first complete remission (CR1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary Objectives Safety Run-in Part To establish a safe and tolerable dose of&#xD;
      azacitidine to be used in the randomized part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Part To evaluate the effect of azacitidine treatment in AML subjects at molecular&#xD;
      relapse after CR1 when compared to no treatment with regard to the progression-free rate&#xD;
      (PFR) at Day 84 (±4 days) post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Safety Run-in Part To establish azacitidine plasma pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      parameters in subjects with molecular relapse AML after CR1 and to assess efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Part To evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of azacitidine&#xD;
      treatment in subjects with molecular relapse AML after CR1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The population of this trial consists of children and young adults with AML who&#xD;
      achieved a complete response (CR) with molecular remission, defined as Minimal Residual&#xD;
      Disease (MRD) less than 5 x 10-4, following their initial induction therapy and who&#xD;
      subsequently have a molecular relapse (defined as increase in MRD level by at least 1 log&#xD;
      [10-fold] to a level greater than or equal to 5 x 10-4 despite a normal percentage [&lt;5%] of&#xD;
      myeloblasts in the bone marrow [BM] aspirate and peripheral blood [PB], and in the absence of&#xD;
      proven histological extramedullary relapse). Eligible subjects have a documented diagnosis of&#xD;
      AML with at least one of the following molecular aberrations t(8;21), RUNX1-RUNX1T1, inv(16),&#xD;
      CBFb/MYH11, t(9;11), MLL-AF9, NPM1 mutation, or FLT3-ITD mutation. Enrolled/randomized&#xD;
      pediatric subjects will be followed with regular MRD testing in order to detect a molecular&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the safety run-in part, up to 12 subjects aged 3 months to less than 18 years will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Six subjects will be enrolled in the first cohort of 100 mg/m2 azacitidine&#xD;
      administered intravenously (IV) on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle. Six additional subjects&#xD;
      could be enrolled into a second cohort of 75 mg/m2 azacitidine administered IV on Days 1 to 7&#xD;
      of a 28-day cycle depending on the safety and tolerability results of the 100 mg/m2 cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomized part of the study at least 68 subjects will be randomized (or more&#xD;
      depending on whether at least 64 subjects are evaluable for the primary endpoint), with at&#xD;
      least 60 of the subjects being less than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both parts of the study, the safety run-in part and the randomized part, will contain 3&#xD;
      periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the follow-up period. The screening&#xD;
      period will last no more than 10 days in the safety run-in part after which the subjects may&#xD;
      be enrolled and treated. In the randomized part, the screening period will last an indefinite&#xD;
      amount of time until detection of a molecular relapse in the PB followed by confirmation of&#xD;
      the relapse in both PB and BM aspirate, at which point the subject may then be randomized.&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated with azacitidine (safety run-in part) or in accordance to their&#xD;
      assigned treatment arm (randomized part). Upon discontinuation from the treatment period,&#xD;
      subjects will enter into the follow-up period which will last up to 2 years from last patient&#xD;
      enrolled/randomized.&#xD;

      Study Population Subjects with AML in molecular relapse after CR1, aged 3 months to less than&#xD;
      18 years of age for the safety run-in part, and 3 months to less than 21 years of age for the&#xD;
      randomized part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Study duration is estimated to last up to approximately 9 years from the time&#xD;
      of the first subject enrollment until completion of the follow-up period for all subjects&#xD;
      enrolled/randomized. Estimated duration is based on expected duration of the study&#xD;
      treatment/'watch and wait' period (3 months) and completion of the follow-up period (2 years&#xD;
      from randomization of last subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to&#xD;
      complete the study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that&#xD;
      is required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as pre-specified in the&#xD;
      protocol and/or the Statistical Analysis Plan, whichever is the later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatments Safety Run-in Part Intravenous azacitidine 100 mg/m2 with a possible&#xD;
      decrease to a cohort of 75 mg/m2, Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle for a maximum of 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Part Intravenous azacitidine dose established during the safety run-in part on&#xD;
      Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle for a maximum of 3 cycles (for subjects randomized to the&#xD;
      azacitidine arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Efficacy Assessments The primary endpoint of the randomized part, PFR at Day 84&#xD;
      (±4 days) post randomization, will be assessed at Day 80 to 88 (approximately end of Cycle 3&#xD;
      of active treatment) post randomization for both the control and the experimental arm. In&#xD;
      case of clinical relapse, the investigator will be asked to document it and to evaluate the&#xD;
      morphology and immunophenotyping in BM aspirate and PB. This must be done according to&#xD;
      standardized diagnostic procedures contained in the AML BFM 2012 guidelines (Creutzig, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Safety Assessments Subject safety will be assessed at each visit during the&#xD;
      study. Any AE will be reported and recorded in an AE electronic case report form (eCRF). For&#xD;
      serious adverse events (SAEs) an expedited reporting procedure will be used in addition to an&#xD;
      AE eCRF. The rate of AEs and SAEs, including second malignancies and cardiovascular events&#xD;
      which are events of special interest for this study, and abnormal laboratory values and vital&#xD;
      signs (NCI CTC Criteria version 4.0 to be used to grade AEs) will be collected while the&#xD;
      subject is on study therapy and during the 'watch and wait' period. Once the subject starts&#xD;
      the next-line therapy or has a HSCT, only SAEs related to study treatment (experimental arm)&#xD;
      or HSCT will be collected for the safety analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Statistical Methods Subjects from both the safety run-in part and randomization&#xD;
      part shall be used for analysis of the safety and efficacy endpoints which are common to both&#xD;
      parts of the study. In addition, a PK analysis will be performed on subjects from the safety&#xD;
      run-in part, and analysis of the PFR endpoint and all other endpoints unique to the&#xD;
      randomized part will only be performed on randomized subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One interim analysis for futility of the primary endpoint is planned during the randomization&#xD;
      part of the study once the first 32 (50% of 64) randomized subjects become evaluable for the&#xD;
      primaryendpoint analysis. The study will be stopped if the criteria for futility is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject demographic and baseline characteristics, disposition, and safety data will be&#xD;
      presented by study part as well as treatment dose (safety run-in part) and study arm&#xD;
      (randomized part) as well as in aggregate for all subjects receiving azacitidine regardless&#xD;
      of study part. All efficacy based endpoints will be presented by treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First data analysis and reporting of the safety run-in part will be conducted once the final&#xD;
      dose assessment SMC meeting has been held (final safety run-in SMC date = data cut-off of&#xD;
      initial analysis of safety run-in part). This analysis will consist of the safety run-in&#xD;
      primary endpoint and the PK secondary endpoint only. All other safety run-in part secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be analyzed at the time of analysis and reporting of data from the randomized&#xD;
      part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to PK data analysis, all other secondary endpoints can only be analyzed and&#xD;
      reported as and when required based on subjects who have had at least 6 months from&#xD;
      enrollment (safety run-in part) or randomization (randomization part).&#xD;

          4. Documented diagnosis of AML, according to WHO classification with at least one of the&#xD;
             following molecular aberrations below that is determined by the central laboratory to&#xD;
             be present using BM aspirate from initial diagnosis,:&#xD;

&#xD;
        Randomized Part (criteria must be checked at Predrug Verification Visit and re-checked at&#xD;
        randomization):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Predrug verification visit should occur within 7 days of detection of molecular&#xD;
             relapse in the PB by RQ-PCR during the screening period. Molecular relapse is defined&#xD;
             as an increase in MRD level of a subject-specific fusion gene or aberration by at&#xD;
             least 1 log (10-fold) to a level of at least 5 x 10-4. For subjects who are MRD&#xD;
             negative, the rise should be at least 1 log (10-fold) greater than previous&#xD;
             sensitivity to a level of 5 x 10-4 or above. An increase in PB must be confirmed in PB&#xD;
             and BM aspirate by RQ-PCR. Confirmation of a molecular relapse is given if the MRD&#xD;
             positivity is at the same level or higher in the PB and BM sample compared to the PB&#xD;
             MRD levels at the detection of the relapse and in the absence of clinical relapse&#xD;
             (defined as at least 5% blasts in PB and/or BM and/or proven histological&#xD;
             extramedullary relapse).&#xD;
