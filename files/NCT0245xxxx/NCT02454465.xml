  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With an increase of over 38% in neurological related hospital admissions between 2008-13,&#xD;
      there are now over 12.5 million cases of individuals with neurological conditions in the UK.&#xD;
      Following diagnosis of a neurological condition, there is often a period of adjustment to new&#xD;
      life circumstances, with changes to relationships, ability to work and leisure activities.&#xD;
      With a future often fraught with uncertainty, psychological difficulties such as Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression are common. It is estimated that following diagnosis of a neurological condition,&#xD;
      up to 60% of individual's will experience mental health difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been gaining popularity in supporting those with&#xD;
      neurological conditions. ACT is based on emotional acceptance and supporting individuals to&#xD;
      live a valued life, despite ongoing symptoms. Research into the use of ACT with this&#xD;
      population has found it to be effective in reducing levels of psychological distress and&#xD;
      increasing psychological flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With limited resources and an ever increasing desire to improve interventions offered to&#xD;
      patients, services are now looking at new and innovative ways of offering increasingly&#xD;
      effective and satisfactory treatments. Therefore, in early 2014, the author devised a six&#xD;
      week ACT group intervention for adjustment following diagnosis of a neurological condition.&#xD;
      The intervention provides a combination of ACT techniques, in addition to a space for group&#xD;
      members to build relationships and share their difficulties, to help individuals increase&#xD;
      acceptance of their difficulties and reduce psychological distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an initial pilot, findings illustrated that participants' psychological distress&#xD;
      reduced and psychological flexibility increased. Therefore, this research project aims to&#xD;
      further evaluate the intervention under controlled conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A variety of psychological approaches have been developed in order to support this&#xD;
      population. One of the most popular approaches to working psychologically with this&#xD;
      population is through the use of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). However, research&#xD;
      suggests that the use of CBT in this population has varying levels of effectiveness with some&#xD;
      evidence of negative outcomes (Lincoln and Flannagan, 2003). Therefore, it would be&#xD;
      worthwhile investigating other models of working with this population, such as Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy (ACT). ACT which has been gaining popularity and is a growing area in&#xD;
      supporting those with neurological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to widespread symptom reduction approaches such as CBT, the use of ACT is based on&#xD;
      emotional acceptance and supporting individuals to live a valued life, despite ongoing&#xD;
      symptoms. It appears under the umbrella of &quot;third-wave&quot; approaches and focuses on altering an&#xD;
      individual's relationship with their thoughts and feelings, rather than focusing on altering&#xD;
      the content of such experiences. In addition to this, ACT aims to support people to&#xD;
      experience their internal processes in a non-judgemental and mindful manner, which enables&#xD;
      them to participate in meaningful action. In order to do this, the ACT model focuses on six&#xD;
      core concepts which each contribute to helping an individual to develop their Psychological&#xD;
      Flexibility. Psychological Flexibility is defined by the ability to connect with the present&#xD;
      moment and act according to one's set of values. In a move away from experiential avoidance&#xD;
      (ie. avoiding ones thoughts and feelings), the ability to be flexible offers individuals the&#xD;
      choice to commit to their values and change their actions or persist with those which are&#xD;
      working for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that ACT may be particularly helpful for those adjusting to&#xD;
      neurological conditions as it works to enable emotional acceptance and an integration of an&#xD;
      individual's impairments into their new self-concept. This has been supported by research&#xD;
      investigating the effectiveness of ACT in working with those with adjustment difficulties&#xD;
      following traumatic and acquired brain injury. One such study investigated the use of ACT in&#xD;
      the promotion of psychological adjustment following Traumatic Brain Injury. Findings&#xD;
      indicated reduced psychological distress and increased Psychological Flexibility following&#xD;
      the ACT intervention. One reason ACT is more desirable for this population is through the use&#xD;
      of more experiential methods and less reliance on verbal expression, as verbal abilities can&#xD;
      sometimes be compromised by a neurological condition. Rather than attempt to reduce&#xD;
      symptomatology, techniques such as mindfulness encourage the individual to notice their&#xD;
      difficulties and experience these with curiosity and openness. In addition to this, there is&#xD;
      evidence that the use of acceptance based techniques support individuals to adapt their&#xD;
      behaviour and reintegrate socially in a way that is meaningful to them. As a result, this may&#xD;
      enable the individual to adjust to their new circumstances and enable them to reconnect with&#xD;
      their values and commit to moving their life in a direction they value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the use of ACT is a promising intervention for individuals adjusting following a&#xD;
      diagnosis of a neurological disorder. However, with a limited number of studies investigating&#xD;
      the topic, further research is required into the effectiveness of ACT within&#xD;
      neuro-rehabilitation.&#xD;
