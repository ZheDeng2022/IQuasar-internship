      The goal of this study is to determine the pattern of early neurodegenerative changes in WFS&#xD;
      (Wolfram Syndrome). The investigator will perform cross-sectional and longitudinal&#xD;
      assessments of youth with WFS, targeting sensitive neural systems with quantified&#xD;
      neuroimaging and behavioral measures. In addition, the investigator will establish the&#xD;
      utility of a WFS severity rating scale (WFS Unified Rating Scale or WURS). Preliminary data&#xD;
      support the feasibility of this approach and its potential to generate important new&#xD;
      information about neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative patterns in WFS. This work is&#xD;
      necessary to position the field for future clinical trials to test interventions for WFS&#xD;
      neurodegeneration. Ultimately, a better understanding of the trajectory of neurodegeneration&#xD;
      in WFS and the development of effective interventions may be relevant to other more common&#xD;
      neurodegenerative and endocrine (Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes) diseases in which ER stress has&#xD;
      been implicated.&#xD;

      Specific Aims: Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare (1 in ~770,000) autosomal recessive genetic&#xD;
      disease characterized by early childhood onset insulin dependent diabetes, optic nerve&#xD;
      atrophy, vision and hearing loss, diabetes insipidus and neurodegeneration, resulting in&#xD;
      death in middle adulthood, typically due to brainstem atrophy-induced respiratory failure 3.&#xD;
      There are no interventions to slow or stop this devastating deterioration. However, much is&#xD;
      known about the mechanisms underlying these effects. The causative gene (WFS1) was identified&#xD;
      by the investigators group in 19984, and a number of loss-of-function mutations have been&#xD;
      described 4-6. Cell 7 and animal models 8 have determined that WFS1 encodes an endoplasmic&#xD;
      reticulum (ER) membrane-embedded protein called wolframin 9, and that mutant forms of the&#xD;
      WSF1 protein lead to disturbances of ER calcium homeostasis, driving ER stress-mediated&#xD;
      apoptosis 10-12. This process kills insulin producing pancreatic Î²-cells, leading to&#xD;
      diabetes. WFS1 is also expressed throughout the brain, and cell death via ER stress is&#xD;
      thought to underlie neurodegeneration in WFS 6,13, as well as being implicated in more common&#xD;
      neurodegenerative and endocrine (Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes) diseases 14. Work in animal&#xD;
      models of WFS is progressing rapidly towards the identification of viable interventions for&#xD;
      the ER stress related cell death12. Some neurological features of the disease may be feasible&#xD;
      to target and monitor in clinical trials, due to the fact that diabetes is already present&#xD;
      when a patient is diagnosed with WFS. Unfortunately, there is limited information on the&#xD;
      pattern of brain changes associated with WFS. Although clinical retrospective data suggest&#xD;
      that neurological features occur late (15-30 yrs of age; Fig 10) in the disease process15,16,&#xD;
      direct measurements (Preliminary Data) suggest that certain neurological abnormalities are&#xD;
      present at the earliest time point assessed, suggesting altered neurodevelopment, whereas&#xD;
      others follow a more neurodegenerative pattern. These distinctions are fundamentally new&#xD;
      insights into this disease and may shape treatment, biomarker selection and the investigators&#xD;
      understanding of the impact of ER stress on the developing brain. A better understanding of&#xD;
      the neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental changes in early WFS is a necessary first step&#xD;
      towards being ready for future clinical trials. Thus, the primary goal of this proposal is to&#xD;
      determine the pattern of brain alterations in WFS over time. Only by understanding the&#xD;
      natural history of brain functional and structural changes in WFS will the investigator be&#xD;
      prepared to evaluate any benefits of novel treatments. The investigator will perform&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments of youth with WFS, targeting sensitive neural&#xD;
      systems with quantified neuroimaging and relevant behavioral measures. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigator will validate a new WFS severity rating scale (WFS Unified Rating Scale or&#xD;
      WURS), which will have utility in future multi-site or treatment studies. Preliminary data&#xD;
      support the feasibility of this approach and its potential to generate important new&#xD;
      information about neurologic patterns in WFS. A better understanding of the trajectory of ER&#xD;
      stress-mediated brain changes in WFS may be relevant to other more common diseases. Specific&#xD;
      aims follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the pattern of neurologic impairment in WFS and its association with&#xD;
           disease severity in a cross-sectional sample. The investigator hypothesizes that&#xD;
           specific brain measures will be altered earlier and will associate more closely with&#xD;
           overall disease severity than others in WFS. The investigator proposes that regional&#xD;
           white matter microstructural integrity in the cerebellum, optic nerve area, brain stem&#xD;
           volume, balance and possibly anxiety will distinguish individuals with early WFS from&#xD;
           controls and will correlate with severity on a standardized rating scale. To test this&#xD;
           hypothesis, the investigator will perform quantified neuroimaging, cognitive, motor,&#xD;
           psychiatric, visual and auditory evaluations on individuals with WFS, preferentially&#xD;
           recruiting those earlier in the disease process, (n=30; age 5 and older, within 10 years&#xD;
           of diabetes onset) and on matched healthy controls (n=30) and controls with Type 1&#xD;
           Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM; n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the longitudinal pattern of neurologic deterioration in WFS. The&#xD;
           investigator hypothesize that measures specified in Aim 1 will show detectable change,&#xD;
           and that the most sensitive measures will show change in the early Wolfram patients&#xD;
           compared to control groups. To test this hypothesis, WFS, T1DM and control participants&#xD;
           will be re-assessed annually for 3 years. Variables of interest identified in&#xD;
           cross-sectional analyses will be targeted and compared between groups and correlated&#xD;
           with change in disease severity as measured with the investigators standardized rating&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore brain structure-function relationships within WFS. To determine if&#xD;
           neuroimaging measures identified in Aims 1 and 2 have functional correlates, the&#xD;
           investigator will explore how differences (cross-sectional data) or change (longitudinal&#xD;
           data) in neuroimaging variables correlate with differences or change in selected&#xD;
           functional measures. Such data would help build hypotheses about the neural&#xD;
           underpinnings of functional changes in WFS. For example, the investigator speculates&#xD;
           that the integrity of the brainstem and cerebellum will be related to gait and balance&#xD;
           and that optic nerve area will be related to visual acuity.&#xD;

      A skin biopsy will be obtained from which the investigator will sequence all the exons and&#xD;
      exon-intron junctions of the WFS1 gene. In some cases, the investigator will also sequence&#xD;
      other genes related to Wolfram syndrome including WFS2, MANF, and Caspase-12. If the&#xD;
      investigator doesn't find mutations in these genes, a whole-exome sequencing may be&#xD;
      performed. The genetic test provided has the potential to create a uniquely-identifiable&#xD;
      fingerprint that could possibly identify a participant.&#xD;
