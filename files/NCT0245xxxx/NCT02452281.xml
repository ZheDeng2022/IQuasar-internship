  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if the combination of HSPPC-96 and ipilimumab is&#xD;
      safe and effective in the treatment of advanced melanoma. HSPPC-96 is an investigational&#xD;
      vaccine created from tissue from the patient's tumor. The vaccine is designed to capture the&#xD;
      cancer's &quot;fingerprint.&quot; Injection of the vaccine may cause the patient's immune system to&#xD;
      recognize and attack any cells with the specific cancer fingerprint. Ipilimumab is a drug&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma that boosts immune response.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label, single-center, phase I-II trial to determine the safety,&#xD;
      feasibility and immunogenicity of combination treatment of HSPPC-96 and ipilimumab in&#xD;
      patients with therapeutically unresectable Stage III or Stage IV malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to assess whether the administration of the combination of&#xD;
      ipilimumab and HSPPC-96 is safe. The rationale for combining the two treatments resides in&#xD;
      their respective roles on the immune system as described below and based on the clinical&#xD;
      experience collected so far. HSPPC-96 is able to initiate a tumor specific immune response&#xD;
      that ipilimumab could theoretically amplify by blocking a checkpoint that naturally&#xD;
      down-regulates T cells.&#xD;
