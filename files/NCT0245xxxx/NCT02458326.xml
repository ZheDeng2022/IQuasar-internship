  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia and migraine are diseases with high prevalence in women between the age group of&#xD;
      30-60 years, which seem to share the same pathophysiological mechanism; both originate from&#xD;
      neuroendocrine disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in the central nervous system,&#xD;
      and are therefore closely related. In addition to the strong relationship with migraine,&#xD;
      fibromyalgia can also be associated with sleep disorders, chronic fatigue and psychological&#xD;
      disorders. The combination of these factors decreases the quality of life and contributes to&#xD;
      increased sedentary this population. It is known that physical exercise promotes positive&#xD;
      changes in pain pathophysiological pathway to increase the release of endorphins&#xD;
      neuroendógenas, improving the symptoms of fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to analyze whether the application of an aerobic exercise&#xD;
      program may result in the reduction of the frequency, duration and intensity of migraine&#xD;
      attacks in women with fibromyalgia. For this, a clinical trial will be conducted randomized&#xD;
      double-blind clinical trial comparing two groups of women diagnosed with fibromyalgia and&#xD;
      migraine. Initially, all answer questionnaires assessing quality of life, impact of headache,&#xD;
      level of depression and anxiety, sleep quality, physical activity level, and; will be held&#xD;
      ergospirometry for research in exercise tolerance. The experimental group will implement the&#xD;
      protocol consists of heating, aerobic exercise according to the heart rate established for&#xD;
      training by spirometry and slowdown; and the control group will hold the heat on low speed&#xD;
      and heart rate will next baseline. Both groups will be followed for 12 weeks, with a&#xD;
      frequency of three weekly meetings lasting 30 minutes and re-evaluated every 4 weeks. At the&#xD;
      end of the protocol, the groups will have their results were compared and statistically&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

      This study is classified as a randomized double-blind clinical trial. Will be held in the&#xD;
      Department of Physiotherapy of the university clinic of the Federal University of Pernambuco,&#xD;
      located in University City, Recife-PE. Data for the survey will be collected during the&#xD;
      course of the Masters in Physiotherapy, from April 2015 to September 2015, for further&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyzed groups shall consist of women aged 30-50 years referred to the Department of&#xD;
      Physical Therapy - UFPE, with clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia and migraine performed by&#xD;
      doctors of Rheumatology clinics and Neurology, Hospital das Clinicas, UFPE. Being invited to&#xD;
      participate and informed about its content, saying their participation by signing a Term of&#xD;
      Consent. Data collection is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and will begin&#xD;
      after the project was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research on Human beings of the&#xD;
      Federal University Health Sciences Center of Pernambuco, in accordance with Resolution&#xD;
      466/2012 of the National Research Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health, the body that&#xD;
      regulates research involving human subjects. The study will be registered in the digital&#xD;
      Clinical Trials platform after obtaining the registration number of the Ethics Committee.&#xD;
      Initially there will be a pilot study with 20 women, then the results will be used to&#xD;
      calculate the sample size using the G Power (version 3.1.9.2, Germany), considering a&#xD;
      statistical power (β) of 80% with a significance level (α) of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be excluded those that have some other rheumatologic disease, cardio-respiratory or&#xD;
      cardiovascular that prevents the realization of aerobic exercise protocol; low attendance&#xD;
      during the implementation of the exercise program (over three consecutive absences);&#xD;
      cognitive impairment or neurological disease that compromises the understanding and the&#xD;
      exercises; Body mass index ≥ 30.0 (obesity, according to the World Society of Health);&#xD;
      pregnant women and patients classified as level of active or very active physical activity by&#xD;
      IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, patients will undergo will a simple randomization through the site&#xD;
      www.randomization.com, resulting in two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aerobic Training: Submitted to a protocol consisting of heating, aerobic training with&#xD;
           adequate heart rate and slowdown;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control Training: Heating Protocol with speed and low intensity (heart rate will next&#xD;
           basal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by an examiner A, not research participant to ensure&#xD;
      allocation concealment (patients and principal investigator will not be aware of which group&#xD;
      are allocated). All women will be evaluated (both groups) through questionnaires and&#xD;
      spirometry before the start and the end of the exercise protocol. Every four weeks, the&#xD;
      patients will be submitted to revaluations through the questionnaires. The evaluation of&#xD;
      these volunteers will be conducted by an examiner B (principal investigator), blinded to&#xD;
      randomization; and the exercise protocol implementation will be the responsibility of the&#xD;
      examiner C, only one will know to which group the patients belong. Corroborating the&#xD;
      double-blinding, the evaluator to perform statistical analysis of the data will not know to&#xD;
      which group belongs the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio-demographic questionnaire Prepared by the researcher to characterize the groups,&#xD;
           which answer questions for identification and history (name, date of valuation,&#xD;
           telephone, address, date of birth, age, weight, height, body mass index / BMI,&#xD;
           profession, education, marital status, physical activity and frequency, use of&#xD;
           medication, type of medication, medication time). One minunciosa history regarding the&#xD;
           use of drugs will be held: types, frequency, duration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of the impact of migraine Will be evaluated by the Migraine Disability&#xD;
           Assessment Test (MIDAS), which contains five items that measure the amount of days lost&#xD;
           in the activities of daily living (ADLs) and professional (AVPs) due to the presence of&#xD;
           migraine in the last three months; the patient declares the amount of days and, from the&#xD;
           result of the sum of the scores, ranks the degree of disability of the individual (0-5&#xD;
           points: grade I / minimal disability; 6-10 points: grade II / mild disability; 11-20&#xD;
           points: grade III / moderate disability;&gt; 20 points: grade IV / severe disability).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical characteristics of the headache Will be filled the journal Headache, based on&#xD;
           criteria established by the International Headache Society (ICHD-III beta version,&#xD;
           2013); assesses the amount and duration of migraine attacks over a period of 30 days,&#xD;
           pain intensity, symptoms associated with headache, medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigation of sleep quality The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), used to&#xD;
           measure the subjective quality of sleep; consists of 19 items divided into seven&#xD;
           components that punctuate 0-3 (total score of 0-21 points, the higher the score, the&#xD;
           worse the quality of sleep). Was adapted and validated for the Brazilian population by&#xD;
           Bertolazi and colleagues (2011), with a high reliability (α Cronbach = 0.82).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life assessment Measured by the FIQ (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire),&#xD;
           consisting of 19 questions divided into 10 items: the first item has 10 sub-items with&#xD;
           four response options ranging from 0-4 points; the second and third items, the patient&#xD;
           should choose an option on a scale of 0-7; in the other, is given a score of 0-10 in&#xD;
           response (the higher the score, the greater the impact of fibromyalgia on quality of&#xD;
           life). Adapted and validated for the Brazilian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tracking of symptoms of anxiety and depression The presence of depression will be&#xD;
           assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), consisting of 21 questions that add up&#xD;
           to a maximum score of 63 points (level of depression: 0-9 points = No; 10-18 points =&#xD;
           mild depression; 19- 29 points = moderate depression;&gt; 30 points = severe depression).&#xD;
           It is validated and adapted for the Brazilian population, with a Cronbach's alpha of&#xD;
           0.81. The Beck Anxiety (BAI) will be used to identify and classify anxiety; consists of&#xD;
           23 statements that have the maximum score of 63 (0-10 points: minimum Anxiety, 11-19&#xD;
           points: Light Anxiety, points 20-30: moderate anxiety,&gt; 31 points: severe anxiety), is&#xD;
           validated and adapted to Brazilian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the level of physical activity Proposed by the World Health Organization&#xD;
           (1998), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) aims to measure the&#xD;
           total physical activity level (AFT) from the energy expenditure (METs.min-¹). Will be&#xD;
           used to short IPAQ (version 8), which consists of 4 questions with two sub-items (b) on&#xD;
           activities of daily living, professional life activities and practice of walking; where&#xD;
           the frequency and duration respond if (days and hours / minutes) of activities and its&#xD;
           intensity (moderate or vigorous = 3.3-4 METs = 5.5 to 8 METs) for one week. From the&#xD;
           data obtained, sum up the frequency and duration of activities (walk + moderate +&#xD;
           vigorous intensity) and, from this result, classifies individuals in: sedentary;&#xD;
           irregularly active; active or very active. This questionnaire is validated and adapted&#xD;
           for the Brazilian population, with excellent reproducibility (ICC = 0.79).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of exercise tolerance Ergospirometry or cardio-pulmonary function test&#xD;
           assesses precisely, the cardio-respiratory capacity and metabolic by direct measurement&#xD;
           of maximum oxygen consumption and determining the maximum ventilatory thresholds. He is&#xD;
           currently considered the gold standard for evaluation of exercise tolerance by providing&#xD;
           non-invasive and very precise exercise intensities featuring aerobic or anaerobic&#xD;
           metabolism (anaerobic threshold - LA). It is the most appropriate test for prescription&#xD;
           of aerobic exercise intensity in sedentary individuals or with regular physical&#xD;
           activity. Oxygen consumption (VO2 max) appears to be the most accurate indicator of&#xD;
           exercise capacity. The test will be performed on a treadmill, coupled with a spirometer&#xD;
           and a computer system in a climatically standardized environment. To minimize air&#xD;
           leakage, will be employed the use of face masks with tiny dead-space. The main&#xD;
           parameters obtained in the test are the ventilatory thresholds: anaerobic threshold (AT)&#xD;
           and respiratory compensation point, which will characterize the aerobic and anaerobic&#xD;
           workouts. The variables obtained during the test, with clinical relevance are: maximal&#xD;
           oxygen uptake (VO2 max), carbon dioxide release (VCO 2), rate of gas exchange (R),&#xD;
           estimated lactate threshold, expired minute volume (VE) , ventilatory reserve (RVE),&#xD;
           ventilatory equivalents, end-expiratory pressures (PEF), ventilatory pattern, arterial&#xD;
           gas tensions / oxyhemoglobin saturation, physiological dead space, electrocardiograms,&#xD;
           heart rate, peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2) and blood pressure (BP ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The responses to the cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) are obtained by means of an&#xD;
      incremental protocol, which consists in progressive load increases at predetermined time&#xD;
      periods. A typical incremental protocol should provide: a resting phase (2-3 minutes or&#xD;
      more), in which we observe a lack of hyperventilation before starting the test; a heating&#xD;
      period with zero charge (2-3 minutes); incrementing a time (8-12 minutes) and an active&#xD;
      period of recovery with no load (3-6 minutes if possible). For the intervention protocol,&#xD;
      heart rate obtained just below the anaerobic threshold, recommended for proper intensity to&#xD;
      gain fitness with greater security and compliance will be used. Generally, oxygen consumption&#xD;
      levels in the anaerobic threshold are lower in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Re-Reviews Initially, will be held the evaluation of patients through questionnaires and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary stress test to investigate exercise tolerance before the start of exercise&#xD;
      protocol (review 1). Every 4 weeks, the patients of both groups will be reassessed by the&#xD;
      re-application of all questionnaires: 4 weeks - review 2; 8 weeks: evaluation 3. At the end&#xD;
      of the 12 weeks of training, the review 4 will be held, with repetition of the questionnaires&#xD;
      and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Intervention protocol The intervention protocol will be made by the examiner C, one who&#xD;
      is not blind to the research. After randomization and evaluation, patients will be allocated&#xD;
      to one of the groups: experimental or control. After the evaluation of cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      capacity of patients, will be established starting parameters appropriate to the level of&#xD;
      physical activity each based on heart rate obtained just below the anaerobic threshold&#xD;
      (ensuring aerobic work).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will follow the following protocol: performing heating for 5 minutes&#xD;
      at low speed on a treadmill; after heating, the speed is increased gradually until the&#xD;
      patient reaches the proper heart rate for aerobic training obtained during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise testing, maintaining the same for 20 minutes to perform the aerobic workout;&#xD;
      completed, the velocity will be decreased to regain speed heating maintained for 5 minutes&#xD;
      and finishing training. It is envisaged that in practice using the FC to ensure proper&#xD;
      aerobic exercise for 20-60 minutes at a frequency of 3-5 times per week are effective in&#xD;
      increasing the functional capacity of individuals with low fitness (American College of&#xD;
      Sports Medicine - ACSM, 2006). In the control group, these women will be guided to perform 10&#xD;
      minutes of heating on the treadmill with a low speed that does not cause patient effort&#xD;
      (monitored by the Borg scale and FC close to the basement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be followed for 12 weeks, with a driving frequency of 3 times per week.&#xD;
      Heart rate and saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) will be continuously monitored through&#xD;
      the use of finger pulse oximeter during the course of all practices of all the volunteers of&#xD;
      research to ensure that HR is within the established for each group&#xD;
