    <textblock>
      Early HIV diagnosis followed by linkage to treatment soon after HIV infection can reduce&#xD;
      mortality and prevent new HIV infections. To obtain the full benefit of early HIV diagnosis,&#xD;
      the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that high risk groups get tested&#xD;
      for HIV regularly, every three to six months. This study will examine the feasibility of a&#xD;
      strategy to promote regular HIV testing and HIV risk reduction among Latino men at risk for&#xD;
      HIV which, if successful, will help to identify Latino men unaware of their HIV status,&#xD;
      benefitting them and the society.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the US, the HIV epidemic largely affects clusters of interconnected persons with high HIV&#xD;
      prevalence and undiagnosed HIV infections that must be reached to reduce incidence. Latino&#xD;
      men who have sex with men (LMSM) are overrepresented in these clusters. Following African&#xD;
      Americans, LMSM have the highest HIV incidence rate and are the next most likely to be&#xD;
      unaware of their HIV infection. Between 2005 and 2008, nearly one-quarter of the HIV positive&#xD;
      LMSM were unaware of the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High HIV prevalence in LMSM networks and lack of strategies to promote regular HIV testing&#xD;
      may explain why many LMSM are not benefiting from early diagnosis. Many LMSM face social and&#xD;
      legal challenges that hinder their access to healthcare services and outreach. They often&#xD;
      have little understanding of HIV treatments, experience discrimination, and hold mistaken&#xD;
      assumptions about HIV risk, including beliefs that motivate them to seek sexual partners&#xD;
      within their high prevalence in-group as a form of preventing infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A social network approach can address the demands of engaging LMSM in regular HIV screening&#xD;
      and reduce their collective risk. LMSM often rely on other LMSM who are sources of advice and&#xD;
      referrals and who partially shield them from the double jeopardy of being a sexual and ethnic&#xD;
      minority. Network interventions can capitalize on these relationships to promote access to&#xD;
      resources and foster norms that reward regular testing and encourage collective safety. This&#xD;
      project uses social networks to promote regular HIV testing and risk reduction among LMSM.&#xD;
      Rather than delivering risk reduction messages and opportunities for HIV testing, the&#xD;
      intervention will penetrate networks of LMSM through well positioned members. Unlike&#xD;
      strategies that target personal networks or social groups within venues, the intervention&#xD;
      will recruit three-ring networks of interconnected LMSM and isolate their ties. Three&#xD;
      recruitment rings will help to find less visible LMSM; and isolating their ties will identify&#xD;
      who can reach them. In addition to informing and motivating their peers to reduce risk, key&#xD;
      network members will be trained to be links to prevention resources, deliver tailored prompts&#xD;
      to HIV testing, and support peers' testing behaviors to encourage repetition.&#xD;
