  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amygdala Retraining Treatment (ART) is a new and promising therapy for patients with Chronic&#xD;
      Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Fibromyalgia (FM), however, randomized controlled trials (RCT) are&#xD;
      scarce. The investigators have added mindfulness to this therapy, based on preliminary&#xD;
      reports of its efficacy on patients, obtaining Amygdala Retraining Treatment with Mindfulness&#xD;
      (ART+MF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other therapy that has been assessed in many psychiatric and medical disorders during the&#xD;
      last years has been Compassion Therapy (CT). There are no studies on its efficacy in FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of both ART+MF and CT on the general&#xD;
      function of the patients with FM. A secondary objective is to assess the effect of these&#xD;
      therapies on psychological (pain, depression, anxiety, etc.) and biological variables (some&#xD;
      biomarkers related with inflammation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design: Randomized, controlled trial with three arms: a) ART+MF, b) CT and c) Relaxation&#xD;
           as control intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample: A sample (N=60 patients, about N=20 for each arm) will be recruited from primary&#xD;
           care settings at the city of Zaragoza, Spain.&#xD;
