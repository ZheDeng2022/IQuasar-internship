  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure if the drug called Everolimus effects mTOR signaling&#xD;
      (an electrical activity signal in the brain) in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex&#xD;
      (TSC) and Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) with treatment resistant epilepsy (TRE) who will be&#xD;
      undergoing brain surgery. One group of patients will be treated with Everolimus, and another&#xD;
      will not. Researchers will determine if there is a difference in mTOR signaling between the&#xD;
      patients who were treated with Everolimus and those who were not. Previous studies have&#xD;
      suggested that Everolimus may reduce seizure activity in TSC patients by decreasing mTOR&#xD;
      signaling. Since patients with FCD may also have excess mTOR signaling brain activity,&#xD;
      Everolimus may also reduce seizure activity in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug Everolimus is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat specific types&#xD;
      of breast, pancreatic, and kidney cancer, a kidney tumor called an angiomyolipoma (common in&#xD;
      patients with TSC), and TSC patients who have a brain tumor called a subependymal giant cell&#xD;
      astrocytoma (SEGA). However, in this research it is considered to be an investigational since&#xD;
      it is not approved for reduction in mTOR signaling and a decrease in seizure frequency.&#xD;
      Researchers believe that Everolimus may be useful in reducing something called cortical&#xD;
      hyperexcitability, which is the excess brain activity that can contribute to seizures.&#xD;

      This is a single center open-label pilot clinical trial of patients with TRE, ages 1 to 40&#xD;
      years old, with TSC or FCD who are scheduled for epilepsy surgery. Patients will be treated&#xD;
      with everolimus for 7 to 28 days prior to epilepsy surgery with extension of time from 7 to&#xD;
      28 days in successive cohorts of patients. The initial cohort of at least three patients will&#xD;
      be treated for 7 days and after the safety of therapy is assured for this group, there will&#xD;
      be an extension of the treatment to 14 days for at least three patients. This will be&#xD;
      extended at one week intervals/three patient groups to a maximum treatment duration of 28&#xD;
      days. Resected brain tissue will be analyzed for activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling&#xD;
      pathways, glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurotransmission using histochemistry, genetic&#xD;
      analysis, as well as extracellular field recordings in acute ex-vivo brain slices from&#xD;
      surgery. A blood sample, collected at the time of surgery, will be analyzed for everolimus&#xD;
      levels and VEGF-D. All patients will undergo standardized intra-operative ECoG recordings&#xD;
      over the primary epileptogenic region and reviewed blindly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be in the study for 7-28 days. The investigators will study variables listed in&#xD;
      specific aims 1 and 2 in TSC and FCD patients treated with 7 to 28 days of everolimus and&#xD;
      compare these to untreated control patients with TRE and TSC or FCD. A concurrent comparison&#xD;
      group of 12 subjects will also be enrolled. They will all be undergoing routine surgery for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of TRE with TSC or FCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will be performed at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (CEC) with the&#xD;
      exception of the surgery, which will be performed at Tisch Hospital.&#xD;
