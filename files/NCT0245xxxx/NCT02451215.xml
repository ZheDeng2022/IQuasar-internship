    <textblock>
      Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive surgical technique that&#xD;
      allows for biopsy and thermal ablation of brain tumors. Pediatric patients with brain tumors&#xD;
      who are eligible and enroll in the trial will undergo LITT at the time of diagnosis or at the&#xD;
      time of recurrence/progression rather than undergo an open craniotomy and tumor&#xD;
      resection/biopsy. LITT will include a stereotactic biopsy followed by thermal ablation of the&#xD;
      tumor. This study will monitor the safety and efficacy of LITT for the treatment of pediatric&#xD;
      brain tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric brain tumors have a variety of surgical options depending on the location and type&#xD;
      of tumor. Complete or near complete surgical removal of pediatric brain tumors usually&#xD;
      results in the best chance of survival or long-term control of the tumor. Surgical resection&#xD;
      through an open craniotomy is the most common surgical treatment for accessible brain tumors.&#xD;
      For tumors that are not surgically accessible or that are resistant to surgical intervention,&#xD;
      treatment is limited to radiation and or chemotherapy, which can have significant long term&#xD;
      toxicity in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) offers a minimally invasive surgical option to&#xD;
      treat central nervous system (CNS) tumors. LITT uses laser energy delivered to a target (i.e.&#xD;
      CNS tumor) through a fiberoptic catheter, which results in damage to intracellular proteins&#xD;
      and DNA, and subsequent cell death. LITT provides a sharp demarcation between ablated and&#xD;
      unharmed tissue, which, when combined with the ability to monitor and control the ablation&#xD;
      via MR thermal imaging, results in a high level of precision and control. LITT may offer a&#xD;
      treatment option for patients with deep brain lesions that are surgically inaccessible, such&#xD;
      as tumors located in the thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia and brainstem. LITT may also&#xD;
      be a potential treatment for brain tumors which have recurred or persist despite conventional&#xD;
      therapies including craniotomy. The MRI-guided laser probe used in LITT utilizes a much&#xD;
      smaller surgical corridor through the brain to reach a deep lesion, potentially reducing the&#xD;
      risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will offer LITT, rather than open craniotomy, for the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      newly diagnosed pediatric brain tumors located in difficult to surgically access regions of&#xD;
      the brain and for the treatment of recurrent/resistant pediatric brain tumors located&#xD;
      anywhere within the brain. The primary aim of this study is to determine if LITT is effective&#xD;
      in reducing (or at least maintaining current rates of) tumor re-growth while lowering rates&#xD;
      of post-surgical complications and improving quality of the procedure (i.e. shorter&#xD;
      hospitalization and less use of pain medication compared to standard surgery for tumor&#xD;
      removal/biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the following goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the frequency of post-operative side-effects in pediatric patients with newly&#xD;
           diagnosed, difficult to surgically access CNS tumors or resistant/recurrent CNS tumors&#xD;
           in any location who receive LITT treatment for tumor ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the role of LITT in controlling newly diagnosed difficult to surgically access&#xD;
           CNS tumors or resistant/recurrent pediatric CNS tumors in any location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the correlation between the extent of tumor ablation and the rate of local tumor&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Characterize the MRI changes that occur in a pediatric tumor following LITT ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled on this study will require routine post-LITT follow-up, including&#xD;
      intermittent physical exams to assess for side effects and MRIs to monitor the status of the&#xD;
      tumor. The follow-up is similar to that performed following an open craniotomy and does not&#xD;
      involve any extra studies. The side effects and rate of tumor control for each brain tumor&#xD;
      patient enrolled on the trial will be compared to disease matched historical controls to&#xD;
      learn more about the morbidity and efficacy of LITT in this population of patients compared&#xD;
      to patients who underwent open craniotomy for resection/biopsy.&#xD;
