    <textblock>
      This is a phase I safety, PK and food effect study of the CMV drug. In part 1 of the study,&#xD;
      subjects will receive one of four dosage strengths of MBX-400 (100 mg once daily, 350 mg once&#xD;
      daily; 750 mg once daily; and 1000 once daily) for 7 days and safety and PK will be assessed.&#xD;
      Subjects must be 18 to 65 years of age, male or female; if female, be surgically-sterilized&#xD;
      or post-menopausal; if male, have undergone vasectomy; have a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to&#xD;
      32 kg/m^2; not be a user of nicotine-containing products; be willing to abstain from&#xD;
      nicotine-containing products, alcohol and illicit drugs during the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 28 days post dosing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common cause of viral illness in children and adults. CMV is also&#xD;
      an important congenital infection with complications including deafness, developmental delay,&#xD;
      and cerebral palsy. The proposed study design is a standard multiple ascending dose&#xD;
      escalation study. Four cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 active; 2 placebo) will be enrolled&#xD;
      sequentially. MBX-400 will be administered orally once daily for 7 days, in the form of&#xD;
      capsules, by study staff while the subject is an inpatient in a research unit. The study&#xD;
      doses will be 100, 350, 750, and 1,000 mg daily. Up to 32 healthy male and female&#xD;
      (non-pregnant, non-lactating) volunteers ages 18-65 in one site, will be consented and&#xD;
      allowed to participate in the study if upon screening they meet the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Subjects will be enrolled into one of four sequential cohorts groups: Cohort 1 will&#xD;
      receive 100 mg PO once daily for 7 days, Cohort 2 will receive 350 mg PO once daily for 7&#xD;
      days, Cohort 3 will receive 750 mg PO once daily for 7 days, and Cohort 4 will receive 1000&#xD;
      mg PO once daily for 7 days of MBX-400. Two members of each cohort will receive placebo. The&#xD;
      study duration for each subject is expected to be approximately 80 days (screening period,&#xD;
      administration of daily dose, and follow-up). Each subject may be admitted to the unit 1 day&#xD;
      prior to the first dose, and will remain in the unit until the day after the 7th daily dose.&#xD;
      Subjects will return for follow-up visits after the last dose. Safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics will be assessed. The overall study duration across all study groups is&#xD;
      expected to be approximately 18 months. The primary objective evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of multiple ascending doses of 100, 350, 750, and 1000 mg PO once daily for 7&#xD;
      days of MBX-400 in healthy subjects. The secondary objective determine the plasma and urine&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of multiple doses of 100, 350, 750, and 1000 mg PO once daily for 7&#xD;
      days of MBX-400 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
