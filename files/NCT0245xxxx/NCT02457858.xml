  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of antioxidant BMX-010 to&#xD;
      perfusion solution, digestion solution and culture medium during islet isolation process, can&#xD;
      lead to greater preservation of islet mass and metabolic function, such as improved islet&#xD;
      yield, viability, and functional potency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will involve up to 10 participants from the islet transplant waiting list at&#xD;
      the Clinical Islet Transplant Program. All participants will receive islets isolated with the&#xD;
      medication BMX-010. This is to assess the primary safety of BMX-010 on pancreata and islets.&#xD;
      BMX-010 will be used only in the islet isolation process, and will not be given to&#xD;
      participants as medication.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Islet Transplantation is a procedure used in people with difficult to control Type 1&#xD;
      Diabetes. Insulin producing cells (islets) are isolated from a deceased donor pancreas. After&#xD;
      the cells are carefully isolated from the donor pancreas, the islets are transplanted into&#xD;
      the recipient's liver. These transplanted islets may produce insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges with islet transplant is the death of some of the islet cells during&#xD;
      isolation and storage while awaiting transplant. This is caused, in part, by inflammation and&#xD;
      &quot;oxidization&quot; of the islet tissue. Oxidization is a process that causes chemical stress on&#xD;
      living cells. We are looking for medications that would reduce inflammation, reduce&#xD;
      oxidization and minimize cell death during the isolation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMX-010 is a new drug that we believe will help fight oxidization. It is an antioxidant that&#xD;
      has been shown in lab studies to help islet cells survive isolation and keep them healthy and&#xD;
      functioning. BMX-010 has not been used in human islet transplants in Canada before this&#xD;
      study. BMX-010 has been used once in a patient who needed his pancreas removed - the islets&#xD;
      were isolated and treated with BMX-010, then transplanted back into the patient (auto-islet&#xD;
      transplant). These results are promising and there have been no significant side-effects&#xD;
      reported. There have also been studies using human islets, treated with BMX-010, transplanted&#xD;
      into mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 10 patients will receive islets treated with BMX-010. This is to assess the&#xD;
      primary safety of BMX-010 on pancreata and islets. For pancreata and islets treated with&#xD;
      BMX-010, BMX-010 will be added in the steps of pancreas perfusion, pancreas digestion and&#xD;
      islet culturing. Participants in the study will receive their islet transplants under&#xD;
      standard of care islet transplant for all aspects of peri- and post-transplant management&#xD;
      including immunosuppression. Islet transplant patients are followed as part of their standard&#xD;
      of care, therefore the data collected for this study will be measured as part of routine&#xD;
      clinical care, requiring no extra study specific clinic visits. We will review data collected&#xD;
      up to day 30 post-transplant and will include the following: patient and graft survival data,&#xD;
      biochemical data from routine blood work, routine and for cause imaging, metabolic testing,&#xD;
      initiation of interventions to treat complications, and reporting of any adverse or serious&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
