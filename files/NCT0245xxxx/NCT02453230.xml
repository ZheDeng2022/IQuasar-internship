    <textblock>
      Since the 1960's, perinatal mortality in the United States has been declining at a steady&#xD;
      rate. This decline has thought to be the result of improved surveillance of normal and&#xD;
      abnormal fetal behavior and using that information to determine those babies at risk for&#xD;
      stillbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many tools available for surveillance. One of these tools, the bio-physical profile&#xD;
      (BPP), incorporates a non-stress test (NST) with ultrasound assessment of fetal behavior .&#xD;
      This test has been used for about the last 30 years with good safety and efficacy. The&#xD;
      ultrasound evaluation includes monitoring fetal breathing, fetal gross and fine movement and&#xD;
      amniotic fluid evaluation. NST and BPP have been found to have similar ability to predict&#xD;
      fetal well-being, with similar safety and ease of performance. Several studies have observed&#xD;
      the effect of sound as well as light on the NST and have found that it can shorten testing&#xD;
      time without altering its ability to be interpreted properly or affecting fetal safety.&#xD;
      However, similar studies have not been done with the BPP. Light stimulation has been proven&#xD;
      to be safe for both the mother and the fetus with no harm having been demonstrated when used&#xD;
      with NST.&#xD;

      with NST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1960's, perinatal mortality in the United States has been declining at a steady&#xD;
      rate. This decline has thought to be the result of improved surveillance as well as neonatal&#xD;
      and infant care. However, there is still a large percentage of mortality that is related to&#xD;
      antenatal fetal and maternal complications. There has been much research in this area, to&#xD;
      help predict which fetuses are more likely to have a poor outcome, and may benefit from&#xD;
      intervention, such as early delivery. Several tests have been developed to help monitor fetal&#xD;
      behavior and differentiate between fetal well-being and identify those at risk for adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. Some of these tests include the contraction-stress test (CST) and the bio-physical&#xD;
      profile (BPP), which incorporates the NST with ultrasound assessment of fetal behavior. These&#xD;
      tests accurately reflect the acid-base status of the fetus as well as the level of fetal&#xD;
      oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biophysical profile was originally developed as a method of assessing fetal health and&#xD;
      help determine whether or not a complication of pregnancy was severe enough to warrant&#xD;
      delivery. The time length needed to complete a biophysical profile is variable. The test is&#xD;
      considered completed if the fetus meets all criteria. The test consists of four ultrasound&#xD;
      components, and electronic fetal monitoring component: fetal heart rate reactivity by&#xD;
      non-stress test, fetal breathing movements, fetal gross body movements, fetal tone/posture&#xD;
      and amniotic fluid evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These components are scored as a &quot;2&quot; for present and &quot;0&quot; if not present. This makes for a&#xD;
      maximum score of 10. Scores of 8 or greater are generally considered reassuring. A score of 6&#xD;
      is considered equivocal and requires further evaluation and follow-up. A score of 4 is&#xD;
      concerning and delivery plan should be initiated soon. A score of 2 or 0 should means the&#xD;
      fetus should be delivered immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal heart rate reactivity is assessed with a fetal non-stress test using a external&#xD;
      electronic fetal monitor. The mother has an external tocodynomometer and a small doppler&#xD;
      device placed over the area of the fetal chest placed on her abdomen. The test is considered&#xD;
      &quot;reactive&quot; when there are two defined accelerations of the fetal heart rate above the&#xD;
      baseline rate during the 20 to 30 minute testing period. The size of the acceleration&#xD;
      required depends on the gestational age of the fetus. Testing time can be extended up to 60&#xD;
      minutes to obtain reactivity if the fetus happens to be in a passive sleep state during the&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal breathing movements have been seen by ultrasound beginning in the early second&#xD;
      trimester. The consist of intermittent &quot;practice&quot; breathing by the fetus where the diaphragm&#xD;
      can be seen moving similarly to adults. These movements last greater than 30 seconds but are&#xD;
      not continuous. This is the first finding to be lost when fetal hypoxemia is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body or limb movements are generally decreased in fetuses that are hypoxic. This corresponds&#xD;
      to decreased activity level for metabolic conservation in those fetuses that are compromised.&#xD;
      Three or more discrete movements are required for this to be considered present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal tone and posture are demonstration of active extension with rapid return to flexion of&#xD;
      fetal limbs and brisk repositioning or trunk rotation. Opening and closing of hand or mouth,&#xD;
      kicking, and so on. One example must be observed for this to be considered present during the&#xD;
      exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amniotic fluid evaluation is considered present when at least one pocket of fluid is seen on&#xD;
      ultrasound measuring greater than 2 centimeters without umbilical cord present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response of fetuses to light stimulation has been known since 1975 when Polishuk reporting&#xD;
      fetal movement after 26 weeks gestation in fetuses stimulated by light. In 1980, Peleg and&#xD;
      Goldman performed amnioscopy and noted an acceleration in the fetal heart rate in 80% of&#xD;
      patients after being exposed to the light of the amnioscope. Caridi et al. noted that fetuses&#xD;
      stimulated with halogen light took less time to become reactive on a non-stress test than&#xD;
      fetuses that were not stimulated. No study has noted an adverse maternal or fetal event from&#xD;
      use of light stimulation.&#xD;
