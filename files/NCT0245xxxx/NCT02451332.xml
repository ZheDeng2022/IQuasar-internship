      Preventing poor perinatal outcomes is the goal of all prenatal care, yet just who will go on&#xD;
      to develop preeclampsia or have a growth-restricted baby is notoriously difficult to predict.&#xD;
      A growing body of evidence suggests inflammatory markers can help predict poor outcomes, even&#xD;

      robust inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP), to a safe immune provocation&#xD;
      recommended for all pregnant women (the seasonal influenza vaccine), and to find out whether&#xD;
      CRP response is associated with increased risk for gestational hypertension, preeclampsia,&#xD;
      preterm delivery, or birth weight. This work will help inform whether inflammatory markers&#xD;
      should become part of routine prenatal care.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventing poor perinatal outcomes is the goal of all prenatal care, yet just who will go on&#xD;
      to develop preeclampsia or have a growth-restricted baby is notoriously difficult to predict.&#xD;
      A growing body of evidence suggests inflammatory markers can help predict poor outcomes, even&#xD;
      prior to, and beyond, the current pregnancy. C-reactive protein (CRP) is manufactured by the&#xD;
      liver in response to an immune provocation, and helps activate the complement system. Because&#xD;
      it is easily assayed via phlebotomy and the less invasive capillary blood spot collection, it&#xD;
      is a favoured marker to study inflammation in fields as diverse as immunology, obstetrics and&#xD;
      gynecology, primary care, anthropology, and epidemiology. Pregnancy is a pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      state, and reproductive physiology studies have shown that CRP is higher in pregnant women&#xD;
      than in age-matched non-pregnant women, and higher still in viable pregnancies than in&#xD;
      spontaneous abortions or ectopic pregnancies. But a look at the ecology of CRP variation&#xD;
      shows trends with clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRP is higher in obese pregnant women than in their leaner counterparts, and is positively&#xD;
      correlated with body fat, waist-hip ratio, and HDL. While CRP does not appear to be related&#xD;
      to insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic pregnant women, for pregnant women with type I&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, CRP is positively correlated with higher HgBA1C and progression of&#xD;
      retinopathy. CRP rises with prenatal iron therapy, during labour, and during the post-partum&#xD;
      period. It is higher for women who have had Cesarean sections than for women who delivered&#xD;
      vaginally. And physiologic states are not the only variables associated with CRP variation.&#xD;
      In a study of 52 women in Denver, Colorado, higher CRP was associated with higher&#xD;
      second-trimester life stress scores and lower third-trimester social support scores. In a&#xD;
      study of 775 women in North Carolina, higher CRP was associated with self-reported black&#xD;
      race, qualifying for food stamps, lack of private insurance, being unmarried, previous&#xD;
      preterm birth, and maternal weight. Does an elevated inflammatory marker also correspond to&#xD;
      maternal or fetal morbidity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most research suggests it does. While one study of 32 Finnish women showed no difference in&#xD;
      CRP between who had premature prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) and gestational&#xD;
      age-matched controls, and one study of pregnant teens in New York showed CRP was associated&#xD;
      with neither gestational age at birth nor birth weight, most studies of women in the USA,&#xD;
      Ecuador, Colombia, the Netherlands, Hungary, Turkey, India, and South Korea have shown that&#xD;
      higher third-trimester CRP is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia, intrauterine&#xD;
      growth restriction, and preterm delivery. It also appears that elevated inflammatory markers&#xD;
      may be associated with long-term maternal and infant morbidity. When CRP was tested in a&#xD;
      prospective cohort of post-partum women who underwent diabetes screening at 3 months and 12&#xD;
      months post-partum, those women who developed diabetes had higher CRP at 3 months. And in&#xD;
      Spain, high maternal CRP in the first trimester was associated with greater risk of infant&#xD;
      wheezing and respiratory tract infections at 14 months (controlling for sex, birth weight,&#xD;
      prematurity, maternal smoking and alcohol consumption, parity, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI,&#xD;
      maternal total IgE, daycare attendance, and breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So while data on the prognostic value of CRP during pregnancy has been accumulating for more&#xD;
      than a decade, this variable is not widely investigated in clinical obstetrics practice.&#xD;
      Furthermore, most research has focused on static measures of CRP, not on a woman's dynamic&#xD;
      response to an immune challenge during pregnancy because of the myriad ethical concerns with&#xD;
      clinical trials involving pregnant women: it is possible that a woman's inflammatory response&#xD;
      to a challenge is more clinically relevant than her baseline CRP level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to answer both of the above research gaps by measuring CRP response&#xD;
      to a controlled provocation that is part of the standard of prenatal care in Canada&#xD;
      (influenza vaccination), and to follow the results to delivery. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators wish to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the variation in CRP values in a cohort of pregnant women at low risk of&#xD;
           obstetrical complications in Calgary, Alberta?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How does CRP respond to a standard immune provocation during pregnancy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does that response vary with age of the mother, ethnicity, gestational age, parity, BMI&#xD;
           prior to pregnancy, and weight gain during pregnancy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does the response vary with risk of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm&#xD;
           delivery, or birth weight?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a quantitative prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: At the beginning of 2015 flu season, the investigators will recruit participants&#xD;
      through the low-risk prenatal clinic serving the South Health Campus in Calgary, Alberta,&#xD;
      where the seasonal influenza vaccine is suggested as part of routine prenatal care, and where&#xD;
      Dr. Kidd works. When women check in for their appointments, they will be given a flyer&#xD;
      informing them of the study. Women who wish to participate in the study will be asked to&#xD;
      present to a dedicated clinic room after their prenatal appointment, Dr. Kidd will obtain&#xD;
      informed consent, as well as the patient's name and Alberta Health Care Number for the&#xD;
      purpose of data retrieval. Using the standard protocol the physician will collect a capillary&#xD;
      whole blood spot sample on Whatman #903 filter paper following a finger stick, and assign an&#xD;
      anonymous code, e.g. 001-0. Dr. Kidd or a clinic nurse will then administer the flu vaccine.&#xD;
      On day 3, a research assistant will obtain a second capillary blood spot sample, at the&#xD;
      participant's home, or other convenient location. The same anonymous code will be used, e.g.&#xD;
      001-3. Both sets of blood spot samples, xxx-0 and xxx-3, will be sent to the Laboratory for&#xD;
      Human Biology Research at Northwestern University, for analysis under the direction of Dr.&#xD;
      McDade; lab personnel will not have access to participant information. Eight months later&#xD;
      (when all participants' pregnancies will have completed), prenatal records with completed&#xD;
      delivery information will be obtained from the electronic medical record in the clinic.&#xD;
      Prenatal records will provide independent variables (ethnicity, gestational age, parity, BMI&#xD;
      prior to pregnancy, and weight gain during pregnancy) and dependent variables (systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, diastolic blood pressure, gestational age at delivery, method of delivery, and&#xD;
      birth weight). Any proteinuria results will be obtained through the provincial EMR, Netcare.&#xD;
      Once datasets are complete, participants' information will be de-identified. CRP results will&#xD;
      be added to the dataset as an additional dependent variable. The investigators will am for a&#xD;
      convenience sample of 100 women with pre- and post-vaccination blood spots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis: The investigators will analyze blood samples for CRP (mg/L) using an&#xD;
      improved version of a high sensitivity ELISA protocol developed specifically for dried blood&#xD;
      spot (DBS) samples. Prior validation of assay performance indicates that the method has&#xD;
      excellent sensitivity, precision, and reliability, and a high correlation between matched&#xD;
      plasma and DBS samples across the entire assay range (Pearson R=0.96). For all analyses the&#xD;
      investigators will apply standard laboratory quality control procedures, including running&#xD;
      samples in duplicate, inspecting calibration curves for fit and day-to-day variation, and&#xD;
      measuring quality control samples with each assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be kept confidential and stored in a secure location in the Department of&#xD;
      Family Medicine at the University of Calgary. Electronic data will be password-protected.&#xD;
      Only Dr. Kidd will have access to participant medical records, and only the research team&#xD;
      will have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of CRP values is likely to be skewed at baseline and day 3, and values will&#xD;
      therefore be log transformed (base 10) to normalize the distribution. However, descriptive&#xD;
      analyses and statistical tests will be implemented using untransformed as well as transformed&#xD;
      results to confirm similar patterns of results. Non-parametric tests of differences in&#xD;
      medians will be implemented using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks and rank sum tests, and&#xD;
      Spearman rank-order correlation will be used to assess strength of association.&#xD;
      Log-transformed results will be subjected to paired t tests, Pearson correlation, and&#xD;
      ordinary least squares regression analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be use to characterize baseline concentrations of CRP, and the&#xD;
      CRP response to vaccination, in relation to prior research. Bivariate analyses will&#xD;
      investigate the association between CRP/CRP response and the following independent variables:&#xD;
      maternal age, ethnicity, BMI prior to pregnancy, weight gain in pregnancy, gestational age,&#xD;
      and parity. Bivariate analyses will also investigate the association between CRP/CRP response&#xD;
      and pregnancy complications and birth outcomes, including: systolic blood pressure, diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, proteinuria, gestational age at delivery, and birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate regression analyses will investigate the associations between maternal factors&#xD;
      and CRP/CRP response, independent of potential confounding influences. Similarly, regression&#xD;
      analyses will investigate CRP/CRP response as independent predictors of birth outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of the study include the relatively small sample size, although prior research in&#xD;
      this area has drawn conclusions from smaller samples. An additional limitation is the&#xD;
      potential for loss to follow-up at two junctures: women may not be available for a research&#xD;
      assistant to obtain a DBS on day 3, and some women's prenatal care will be transferred to&#xD;
      obstetricians when complications arise and therefore their complete records will not be&#xD;
      available to the research team. If it seems that too much attrition is happening before day&#xD;
      3, the investigators will begin asking women to collect their own DBS with disposable lancets&#xD;
      the investigators will provide. The investigators will not be able to control for the women&#xD;
      who are transferred to obstetrics, though Dr. Kidd's experience at the clinic is that this&#xD;
      happens for less than 20 per cent of women initially considered to be at low-risk of&#xD;
      complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers have no conflicts of interest to disclose. Health risks to participants are&#xD;
      limited to minimal risk associated with routine vaccinations, for example pain, redness or&#xD;
      swelling at the injection site or low-grade fever. More serious risks include allergic&#xD;
      reaction to the vaccine (dyspnea, hives, hypotension), and Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare&#xD;
      ascending paralysis that affects approximately 1 in 1 million flu vaccine recipients. Risks&#xD;
      of maternal and fetal complication from influenza are thought to far exceed risks from&#xD;
      potential flu vaccine reaction. Risks of blood spot collection are limited to discomfort&#xD;
      associated with a finger prick. Participants' information will be de-identified and&#xD;
      participants will not be identified by name in any presentation or publication of study&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELEVANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work has important public health implications as it may help us better predict and&#xD;
      prevent poor perinatal outcomes. For example, women with high CRP values, or high CRP&#xD;
      responses, might benefit from closer fetal surveillance, or might need to go on medical leave&#xD;
      earlier in their pregnancy - few guidelines are currently available to help with this&#xD;
      clinical decision. Going forward, as new research continues to show that baseline pregnancy&#xD;
      levels of CRP are correlated with pre-pregnancy levels, awareness of inflammatory markers in&#xD;
      prenatal care may help us identify pre-pregnancy conditions that may lead to poor perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes, such as social inequity and adversity. Perhaps CRP might one day be used to monitor&#xD;
      the &quot;readiness&quot; of a woman contemplating pregnancy, much in the way that pre-pregnancy BMI&#xD;
      can help predict risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
