      Introduction :Oral lichen planus (OLP) is one of the most common disorders of the oral cavity&#xD;
      which is basically a chronic and inflammated mucocutaneous .There is no cure for OLP&#xD;
      currently. The main focus of treatment is to reduce the duration and severity of the&#xD;
      symptoms. This study was designed to determine and compare the parameters of improvement in&#xD;
      patient symptoms and lesions caused by oral lichen planus by using triamcinolone acetonide&#xD;
      mucoadhesive film and licorice mucoadhesive film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials :The study was randomized by double-blind clinical trial . Patients&#xD;
      with symptomatic OLP who referred to the Oral Medicine School of Dentistryin Medical Sciences&#xD;
      in Isfahan University participated voluntarily. The patients were divided into two groups&#xD;
      that were including 30 samples in each group. The first group was treated with triamcinolone&#xD;
      mucoadhesive film and the second group were treated with licorice mucoadhesive film. Data&#xD;
      were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney test and t-test in SPSS software.&#xD;

      Introduction OLP is a chronic and inflammatory disease that frequently involves the oral&#xD;
      mucosa. Clinical symptoms of OLP are various from white keratotic lesions without pain to&#xD;
      erosion and painful injury (1). OLP episodic symptoms range from pain and irritation of the&#xD;
      mouth that can affect the normal function and causes physical and mental pressure to&#xD;
      patients.OLP can be seen in two main forms of reticular and erosive. Erosive OLP have been&#xD;
      seen as injured Arytmatozo that enclosed by keratotic striae .These lesions are often follow&#xD;
      by episodic symptoms of pain and irritation to severe discomfort and can cause a major&#xD;
      negative impact on performance of oral system and l quality of life .So, being aware of the&#xD;
      Clinical symptoms and management of these lesions are very important for the clinician.&#xD;
      (4,3,2,1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, these lesions rarely are life-threatening , discomfort and pain associated with&#xD;
      abnormal caloric intake lead to nervosa, dehydrated in short order and malnutrition. It also&#xD;
      increases the risk of infection and reduce the quality of life in patients greatly.(2,3). The&#xD;
      main treatment for symptomatic OLP is prescribing systemic or topical corticosteroids . (1,3)&#xD;
      and its strong type like triamcinolone has been increasingly used in the treatment of OLP&#xD;
      (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lichen planus is a chronic mucocutaneous disease and relatively common in middle-aged that&#xD;
      affected 2- 0.2% of the population. Men and women are almost equally affected. In the mouth,&#xD;
      white bilatera lesions sometimes cause wound The most common clinical pattern is linear (9-5)&#xD;
      .There is a limited study in the frequency and clinical forms of OLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be mention to Esmaeili etal study that patients in men and in fourth decades is most&#xD;
      common and Hypertrophic and classic type are more and the type of reticular in oral lesions&#xD;
      is more prevalent (10)and in another study by Khalili etal reported that the most common form&#xD;
      of clinical lesion is ulcerated lesion and the average time spend 18.4 months, most commonly&#xD;
      involving mucosa is the buccal and then the tongue and gums .White spots, lines Wickham and&#xD;
      mucosal erythema are the most common clinical features of the lesion (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no cure for OLP. The main focus of treatment is to reduce the duration and&#xD;
      severity of symptoms. The most common and acceptable treatment for symptomatic OLP lesions&#xD;
      and systemic corticosteroids or topical is to modulate the host immune response .In mild to&#xD;
      moderate lesions the main treatment is by topical corticosteroids such as clobetasol gel,&#xD;
      betamethasone gel and triamcinolone ointment (2, 3, 12). Due to the persistence of the drug&#xD;
      at the site of the lesion may be used new dosage form of mucoadhesive such as tablets or&#xD;
      film. Films are from mucoadhesive drug delivery systems that have been used in the&#xD;
      manufacture of mucoadhesive polymers and have received considerable attention in recent years&#xD;
      .The films can be attached on the oral wound healing and cause to reduce pain and&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases. (4, 13)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Licorice plant have been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of aphthous&#xD;
      ulcers, gastric ulcers, hepatitis C, cough, Asthma, Addison and skin diseases. Clinical&#xD;
      pharmacology studies have shown that this herb also contains beneficial anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      components, antiviral and antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer and modifying the immune&#xD;
      system is .Licorice contains a provision, glycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrhizin which helps in&#xD;
      healing wounds (14,15,16) In 2008, Martin et al. examined the effects of oral patch&#xD;
      containing licorice extract (Licorice) for the treatment of aphthous ulcers and found&#xD;
      positive effects on the size of the lesion and the patient's report of pain. (15) Chan et&#xD;
      al., investigated palliative treatment of patients with symptomatic OLP such as steroids,&#xD;
      Cyclosporine and topical retinoid in a systematic review and concluded that there are only&#xD;
      weak evidence for the superiority of this treatment compared with placebo . The authors also&#xD;
      expressed several studies has been faced with restrictions in which various compounds with&#xD;
      potentially useful results on the OLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conducted studies were not enough strong , the control group was small, making blind about&#xD;
      the researcher or patient didn't do in them or have been made errors in designing the study.&#xD;
      There would be special need to statistically powerful studies in order to determine the value&#xD;
      of new compounds in the prevention or treatment of mucositis .(17)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find a way to reduce pain and inflammation in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic OLP On the one hand and reduce the risk of infection, reduce the need for pain&#xD;
      medication and ultimately improve the quality of life by using triamcinolone mucoadhesive&#xD;
      films or licorice in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a clinical trial and randomized as double-blind. Sampling was done randomly&#xD;
      Patients with symptomatic OLP who referred to the Oral Medicine School of Dentistryin Medical&#xD;
      Sciences in Isfahan University participated voluntarily.. In this study, patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic OLP over 18 years both men and non-pregnant women enrolled in the study and . All&#xD;
      patients were examined for dental Prophylaxis and oral hygiene and recommendations about&#xD;
      compliance with oral health have been done for all patients . After filling written consent ,&#xD;
      the patients were divided into two groups randomly :first group I (n = 30) will be treated&#xD;
      with triamcinolone Mucoadhesive film and the second group (n = 30) will be treated with&#xD;
      licorice mucoadhesive film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent a complete dental examination and diagnosis of patients with oral&#xD;
      lichen planus lesions initially marked by physical examination and conducted by interviewing&#xD;
      with patients and then confirmed by histologic evaluation .The duration of treatment or&#xD;
      recovery of lesions was two weeks as the weekly visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Triamcinolone Mucoadhesive film with 1 mg was prepared and provided to patients in one&#xD;
      group. And another group was given licorice mucoadhesive film by Afnogel brand name .The drug&#xD;
      dose was determined three times a day after meals and before bed time that patients put it in&#xD;
      the upper part of gum after eating and washing mouth and the patient can do common function&#xD;
      like talking and eating and drinking within releasing the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity and recovery rate of lesions were measured in each visit in accordance with the&#xD;
      criteria that set in Buajeeb etal(18) from 0 to 5 degrees .The rate of pain in patients that&#xD;
      created by Mucositis assessed by ruler and VAS method and it was given a number from 0 to 10&#xD;
      according to the rate of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury or burning ,pain on waking, eating, drinking, talking, pain when swallowing, dry&#xD;
      mouth, tingling or numbness after taking the studied medication and using the products&#xD;
      containing caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol in the questionnaire registered by the patient .The&#xD;
      compliance of patients were evaluated based on the returned mucoadhesive at the end of each&#xD;
      week and based on the number of patients' visits to physicians. The patient withdrew from the&#xD;
      study for any reason, pregnancy, drug interactions, compliance less than 70% patients about&#xD;
      taking the medicine o has been done by referring to the doctor .All of the cases were&#xD;
      collected and analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
