    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial with two interventions: control group and&#xD;
      intervention interdisciplinary group, without cross-over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group (CG): In this type of intervention, the focus will be the development of skills&#xD;
      through educational activities on health using the pedagogy of transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interdisciplinary Intervention Group (IG): In this type of intervention, the focus will be&#xD;
      the development of skills through educational activities on health that provide the&#xD;
      development of autonomy and empowerment for behavior change, based on interdisciplinary&#xD;
      motivational strategies. All topics will be focused on the major cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      considered modifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The staff is trained to the techniques of motivational interviewing and transtheoretical&#xD;
      model of change and the health issues related to the modification of lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So this interdisciplinary intervention with adolescents seeks to measure the result of an&#xD;
      educational proposal using the techniques of motivational interviewing and transtheoretical&#xD;
      model of change, for all professionals involved independent training in health issues related&#xD;
      approach to lifestyle modification and the inclusion of family in this process.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized clinical trial with two interventions: control group and&#xD;
      intervention interdisciplinary group, without cross-over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions will take place at the Rehabilitation Hospital São Lucas Center (CR), will have&#xD;
      12 sessions for each of the following ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group (CG): In this type of intervention, the focus will be the development of skills&#xD;
      through educational activities on health using the pedagogy of transmission. The meetings&#xD;
      will be weekly with 45 minutes duration on a schedule of lectures about cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors and prevention.The sample is 60 adolescents with overweight or obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interdisciplinary Intervention Group (IG): In this type of intervention, the focus will be&#xD;
      the development of skills through educational activities on health that provide the&#xD;
      development of autonomy and empowerment for behavior change, based on interdisciplinary&#xD;
      motivational strategies. Therefore, group meetings will be performed in the presence of a&#xD;
      member of the nursing staff, physiotherapy, nutrition and psychology. The meetings are&#xD;
      weekly, lasting 1 hour and 45 minutes. In the first 1 hour and 15 minutes will be addressed&#xD;
      health issues related to lifestyle modification (self-care, healthy eating and physical&#xD;
      activity) using the fundamentals of motivational interviewing technique. All topics will be&#xD;
      focused on the major cardiovascular risk factors considered modifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The staff is trained to the techniques of motivational interviewing and transtheoretical&#xD;
      model of change and the health issues related to the modification of lifestyle. During the&#xD;
      sessions the team members address the health issue so that the knowledge of a professional&#xD;
      complements the other. At the same time occur the integration of knowledge between these&#xD;
      professionals from different areas aiming to encourage teens to lifestyle modification based&#xD;
      on the techniques of motivational interviewing and transtheoretical model of change.&#xD;
      Likewise, it is envisaged to include a time of physical activity (30 minutes) oriented in&#xD;
      conjunction with the research team. This activity aims to motivate adolescents to include&#xD;
      other physical activity sessions during the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So this interdisciplinary intervention with adolescents seeks to measure the result of an&#xD;
      educational proposal using the techniques of motivational interviewing and transtheoretical&#xD;
      model of change, for all professionals involved independent training in health issues related&#xD;
      approach to lifestyle modification and the inclusion of family in this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run in: There will be a meeting with the parents of the IG and CG (separately) in order to&#xD;
      inform them about the participation of children in the program and guide them about the&#xD;
      procedures of the research protocol.&#xD;
