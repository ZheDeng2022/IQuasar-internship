  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new drug, IPH2201, to see what effects&#xD;
      it has on this type of cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because there is no treatment that will cure this type of cancer.&#xD;
      Although some types of chemotherapy may cause this cancer to shrink for a time, better&#xD;
      options are needed. In laboratory tests and animals, IPH2201 has been shown to have effects&#xD;
      which result in shrinkage of tumours. IPH2201 has been studied in people with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis but it has not yet been studied in people with cancer and the investigators do not&#xD;
      know if it can offer better results than standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease could include surgery, chemotherapy or&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed gynecologic&#xD;
             malignancy including high-grade serous ovarian/fallopian tube or peritoneal carcinoma,&#xD;
             cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) or endometrial cancer (adenocarcinoma), that&#xD;
             is advanced/metastatic/recurrent or unresectable and for which no curative therapy&#xD;
             exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with HGSC: For Part 2 of this study, patients will be classified as&#xD;
             either platinum resistant or platinum sensitive, as defined by their previous response&#xD;
             to platinum-based therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The platinum resistant cohort will include patients with disease progression&#xD;
                  within 6 months of the last line of platinum-based therapy dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The platinum sensitive cohort will be defined by progression 6 months or longer&#xD;
                  since last platinum-based therapy dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have an available formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block&#xD;
             (from their primary or metastatic tumour) and must have provided informed consent for&#xD;
             the release of the block (or slides), as well as for samples for correlative studies&#xD;
             and banking.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • At least 4 patients registered to each cohort in Part 2 must also have provided&#xD;
             informed consent for and be willing to undergo a tumour biopsy prior to treatment&#xD;
             (after registration) and after treatment with IPH2201. Note: During accrual to Part 2,&#xD;
             it may be necessary to restrict accrual to patients who are suitable for, and have&#xD;
             consented to, tumour biopsy before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. All radiology studies&#xD;
             must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization/registration (within 35 days&#xD;
             if negative).&#xD;

             been platinum-based. Patients may have received no more than 3 prior regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other systemic therapy: All patients may have received other therapies including&#xD;
             immunotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, PARP inhibitors or signal transduction&#xD;
             inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from all reversible toxicity related to prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy or systemic therapy and have adequate washout as follows:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  5 half lives for investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Standard cycle length of standard therapies&#xD;

               -  Radiation: Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 28&#xD;
                  days (4 weeks) have elapsed between the last dose of radiation and date of&#xD;
                  randomization/registration. Exceptions may be made for low-dose,&#xD;
                  non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy after consultation with NCIC CTG.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgery: Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4&#xD;
                  weeks) have elapsed between any major surgery and date of&#xD;
                  randomization/registration, and that wound healing has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have recovered from any treatment related toxicities prior to&#xD;
        randomization/registration (unless grade 1, irreversible, or considered by investigator as&#xD;
        not clinically significant).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and&#xD;
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to&#xD;
             randomization/registration in the trial and prior to tests which are considered to be&#xD;
             study specific to document their willingness to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or&#xD;
             those physically incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into&#xD;
             the study. Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have&#xD;
             the document signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be&#xD;
             provided with a full explanation of the study before consent is requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this&#xD;
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there&#xD;
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance)&#xD;
             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure&#xD;
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete&#xD;
             documentation of the treatment, response assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In accordance with CCTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working days&#xD;
             of patient randomization (Part 1) or registration (Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of other active or current malignancies that require active&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with serious illness or medical conditions that might be aggravated by&#xD;
             treatment or limit compliance including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;

             mg prednisone. Note: Topical applications (e.g. rash), inhaled sprays (e.g.&#xD;
             obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular)&#xD;
             are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving cytokines and/or growth factors.&#xD;
