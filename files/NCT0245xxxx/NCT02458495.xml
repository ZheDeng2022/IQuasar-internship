  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant percentage of persons with diabetes fail to properly take their prescribed oral&#xD;
      hypoglycemic agents (OHA) and insulin. Non-adherence to medications among diabetes patients&#xD;
      is associated with poor health outcomes including suboptimal glycemic control,&#xD;
      diabetes-related complications, elevated health costs and increased risk of hospitalization&#xD;
      and mortality. Given the substantial impact of non-compliance on the health of patients,&#xD;
      prior studies have sought to draw links between medication adherence and patient factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research shows that web-based interventions that support patients' medication-related&#xD;
      knowledge, motivation and skills effectively improve compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a patient web portal (PWP)-delivered&#xD;
      medication adherence promotion intervention on medication adherence and glycemic control&#xD;
      among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The intervention aims to (1) increase&#xD;
      self-reported adherence to glucose lowering agents (GLAs) and (2) improve diabetes health&#xD;
      outcomes (decreased HbA1c) by increasing patients' medication adherence-related knowledge,&#xD;
      motivation and skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will greatly enhance the investigators' understanding of medicine compliance&#xD;
      and the factors that effectively improve adherence among high-risk patients with diabetes.&#xD;
      Knowledge gained from this work may inform future internet-based patient portals that support&#xD;
      disease management and medication adherence more broadly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [Background]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication non-adherence is a major public health issue for patients with diabetes.&#xD;
      Approximately one third of patients with T2DM are non-compliant with their diabetes&#xD;
      medication. This is problematic since suboptimal medication adherence has been shown to&#xD;
      contribute to inferior glycemic control, increased healthcare costs, hospitalization and&#xD;
      premature death. The aforementioned ramifications of nonadherence to chronic medication are a&#xD;
      product of barriers to diabetes self-care behavior including patient-related factors&#xD;
      associated with glycemic control. Dr. Chandra Osborn and colleagues have identified&#xD;
      targetable patient factors related to patients' medication-adherence related knowledge (e.g.,&#xD;
      information about medication purpose and dosage), motivation (e.g., awareness of medication&#xD;
      benefits, social support for adherence) and self-efficacy or skills (e.g., ability to&#xD;
      remember dosages and obtain refills). Said factors map onto the&#xD;
      Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills (IMB) model, which has informed effective adherence&#xD;
      promotion interventions among individuals with other chronic illnesses and may have utility&#xD;
      in promoting medication adherence among patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention content will be informed by a validated theory of medication adherence.&#xD;
      Interventions are seldom informed by empirically established theories. This is problematic&#xD;
      since theory-based interventions (i.e., interventions that draw upon theories that are&#xD;
      relevant to the target population) have proven to be more effective than atheoretical&#xD;
      interventions. Few published intervention studies specifically address medication adherence&#xD;
      among adults with T2DM and of these limited studies, only one is grounded in theory. The&#xD;
      study's web-based intervention is driven from the aforementioned IMB model of adherence. This&#xD;
      model incorporates central components of other theoretical models and has been validated in&#xD;
      cross-sectional and intervention research among patients with acquired illnesses.&#xD;
      Furthermore, recent empirical findings indicate the IMB model's success in predicting&#xD;
      outcomes in our target T2DM population. Thus, it is reasonable to believe an intervention&#xD;
      (i.e., Diabetes MAP) that delivers IMB model-based content to a T2DM population may&#xD;
      successfully improve medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient web portal (PWP)-delivered medication adherence promotion interventions are a&#xD;
      practical tool for relaying health-related information and resources. The magnitude of the&#xD;
      consequences associated with nonadherence to chronic medications makes web-based&#xD;
      interventions imperative as they aim to reduce the impact of barriers to medication-taking&#xD;
      practices. While there are few medication adherence promotion interventions specifically&#xD;
      designed for patients with T2DM, the literature suggests barriers to medication adherence&#xD;
      practices may be reduced with the use of interactive behavior change technologies (IBCT) that&#xD;
      provide patients with access to resources, web tools and health knowledge. While there can be&#xD;
      limitations to patient websites (e.g., poor design), the usability of the web-based health&#xD;
      intervention Diabetes MAP has been previously evaluated in relation to ease of interaction&#xD;
      and accessibility to individually-tailored components aimed at increasing diabetes-related&#xD;
      knowledge, motivations and skills. This study aims to leverage the use of Diabetes MAP to&#xD;
      help T2DM patients overcome barriers to self-care and promote medication adherence behavior&#xD;
      and improve diabetes outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personality measures may moderate adherence and effectiveness of a PWP-delivered&#xD;
      intervention. In an attempt to broaden our understanding of self-care behavior, the study&#xD;
      implements an additional instrument, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), to obtain&#xD;
      a personality measure of mindfulness. Mindfulness is a psychological construct of Buddhist&#xD;
      origin that draws together deliberate attention to moment-to-moment occurrences and the&#xD;
      cultivation of knowledge, positive emotions and ethical behavior. The MAAS is a validated&#xD;
      15-item scale designed to measure an individual's awareness and ability to attend to what is&#xD;
      occurring in the present moment. Studies indicate that the quality of mindfulness targeted by&#xD;
      the MAAS is related to, and predictive of, certain self-regulation and well-being constructs.&#xD;
      More specifically, mindfulness has been linked to increased subjective well-being, reduced&#xD;
      psychological symptoms and reactivity, and improved behavioral regulation, all of which may&#xD;
      be correlated with self-care behavior and better decision making regarding health (i.e.,&#xD;
      diet, exercise). Therefore, study participants with high baseline levels of self-awareness&#xD;
      may draw even greater benefits from use of the Diabetes MAP website and therefore display&#xD;
      greater medication adherence and lower A1c levels than those scoring lower on the MAAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Study Objective/Aim]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to evaluate a web-based medication adherence promotion&#xD;
      intervention that uses patient-specific information (e.g., diabetes medication, survey&#xD;
      responses) to deliver tailored content via the Diabetes MAP website to adults with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim is to evaluate the ability of an existing PWP-delivered medication adherence&#xD;
      promotion intervention (Diabetes MAP) to improve medication adherence and glycemic control&#xD;
      among patient participants with T2DM. Investigators will randomly allocate patients to a&#xD;
      treatment (website intervention or no intervention) and subsequently test the website's&#xD;
      ability to increase self-reported adherence to glucose lowering agents (GLAs) and improve&#xD;
      diabetes health outcomes as demonstrated by lowered HbA1c levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Significance]&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project evaluates the effect of the PWP-delivered medication adherence promotion&#xD;
      intervention, Diabetes MAP, on patient adherence to glucose lowering agents (GLAs) and&#xD;
      patient HbA1c. The study serves to fill the gap in the current literature by focusing on the&#xD;
      power of interactive and individually-tailored technology to support medication adherence and&#xD;
      the subsequent health benefits that arise when T2DM patients properly adhere to their&#xD;
      prescribed medical regimen. In addition to reducing personal costs (e.g., hospitalization,&#xD;
      mortality, healthcare fees), improving medication adherence among T2DM patients may benefit&#xD;
      society by reducing the burden said individuals' health status places on the broader&#xD;
      population. Ultimately, the tools and techniques utilized and the data collected from this&#xD;
      study will provide insight for future studies that may seek to utilize web-based&#xD;
      interventions to reach and impact medically afflicted individuals.&#xD;
