      Background/Purpose of the Study Doxycycline is an antibiotic used for infection prevention&#xD;
      before surgical pregnancy termination, and a side effect of it is nausea/vomiting. The&#xD;
      investigators' study explores whether or not taking the anti-emetic ondansetron prior to&#xD;
      doxycycline decreases rates of nausea/vomiting. Patients enrolled in the investigators' study&#xD;
      will take either ondansetron or a placebo before they take doxycycline to see if ondansetron&#xD;
      decreases their nausea/vomiting. Reducing nausea/vomiting may prevent more infections, and&#xD;
      decrease the rates of general anesthesia, patient risks and hospital costs. Decreasing&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting will also improve patient experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This will be a randomized controlled trial. Data will be collected by&#xD;
      administrating surveys and a log where patients will record the timing of their medications&#xD;
      and episodes of nausea/vomiting. The primary outcome is nausea/vomiting after taking the&#xD;
      anti-emetic/placebo and doxycycline. 400 eligible patients will be enrolled over two years,&#xD;
      200 in the intervention group and 200 in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Study Design A randomized controlled trial will be used to determine the&#xD;
      effects of the anti-emetic ondansetron on rates of nausea/vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Characteristics Patients will be pregnant females, 18-45 years old, who are&#xD;
      undergoing surgical termination of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design 1-2 days before the procedure, patients will complete a demographic questionnaire and&#xD;
      a survey about symptoms of nausea/vomiting. They will use a log to record symptoms they&#xD;
      experience between taking the anti-emetic/placebo and when they present for their procedure.&#xD;
      When patients come to the hospital, they will fill out a repeat survey rating their&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting.&#xD;

        1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Purpose of the study The goal of this study is to determine if administering the&#xD;
           anti-nausea medication ondansetron prior to doxycycline will decrease the rates of&#xD;
           nausea and vomiting in patients taking doxycycline for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to&#xD;
           undergoing surgical pregnancy termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Background The use of prophylactic antibiotics are standard of care to prevent&#xD;
           surgical site infections in gynecologic surgery 1. Doxycycline is the recommended&#xD;
           antibiotic of choice for surgical pregnancy termination and completion of spontaneous&#xD;
           abortion given its effectiveness, low cost, and rare occurrence of allergic reaction 2.&#xD;
           Previous studies have shown that a common side effect of doxycycline is nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting, with reported rates as high as 30-40% 3. Nausea and vomiting may be reduced by&#xD;
           taking the antibiotic with food 4. Doxycycline given on an empty stomach the morning of&#xD;
           a surgical pregnancy termination resulted in nausea and vomiting in 50% of patients and&#xD;
           this rate was decreased to 15% when it was taken with food the night before surgery 5.&#xD;
           It is not known whether the use of scheduled prophylactic anti-emetics prior to&#xD;
           doxycycline use would further reduce the rate of associated nausea and vomiting. The&#xD;
           goal of the investigators' proposed study is to determine this.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators' study will be a double blinded randomized controlled trial that will&#xD;
           examine whether the use of scheduled prophylactic anti-emetics prior to doxycycline use&#xD;
           reduces the incidence of associated nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting is&#xD;
           distressing to patients and it affects their perioperative care. It is well documented&#xD;
           that minor gynecologic procedures, such as uterine evacuations, can be performed safely&#xD;
           with moderate and deep sedation without an endotracheal tube 6. At the investigators'&#xD;
           institution, patients experiencing nausea and vomiting prior to a surgical procedure&#xD;
           receive general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, due to their symptoms, not&#xD;
           because that would be the preferred route of anesthesia. For minor gynecologic&#xD;
           procedures, the time for general anesthesia induction can be as long as the duration of&#xD;
           the entire surgical procedure would be without general anesthesia. The use of general&#xD;
           anesthesia increases the duration of time in the operating room, which increases the&#xD;
           costs of operating room and anesthesia time, as well as recovery time for the patient 7.&#xD;
           General anesthesia also poses possible risks such as impairment of cardiovascular&#xD;
           function and development of pneumonia 8,9.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to anesthesia risks and patient discomfort, nausea and vomiting many also&#xD;
           affect antibiotic efficacy due to reduced serum levels. Reeves' et al. showed lower&#xD;
           serum doxycycline levels in patients with emesis within one hour of doxycycline&#xD;
           administration. A serum level greater than 0.8 mg/L has been shown to provide adequate&#xD;
           antibiotic prophylaxis. Vomiting after ingestion of doxycycline decreased serum levels&#xD;
           by an average of 0.26 mg/L5.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reducing the rates of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing minor gynecologic&#xD;
           procedures may increase the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis, and decrease the rates&#xD;
           of general anesthesia, patient risks and hospital costs. Most importantly, decreased&#xD;
           nausea and vomiting will certainly improve patient experience and is clinically relevant&#xD;
           because doxycycline is an antibiotic commonly used for many gynecologic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Overview This will be a randomized controlled trial. Data will be collected by&#xD;
           asking patients to fill out a demographic questionnaire and a baseline visual analog&#xD;
           scale rating their nausea, pain and anxiety at their clinic appointment 1-2 days prior&#xD;
           to their procedure. Patients will then take either ondansetron or a placebo 30 minutes&#xD;
           prior to taking doxycycline the night before their procedure. They will then fill out a&#xD;
           symptom/medication log recording their symptoms from the time that they take the study&#xD;
           medication to the time that they present for their procedure. When they present for&#xD;
           their procedure, patients will fill out a second identical visual analog scale rating&#xD;
           nausea, pain and anxiety. The primary outcome is nausea and vomiting after taking the&#xD;
           study drug and doxycycline the night prior to surgery. Doxycycline prophylaxis the night&#xD;
           prior to surgery is the current standard of care. Eligible patients will be enrolled&#xD;
           over the course of two years. Patients will also have a tube of blood drawn at the time&#xD;
           of the procedure so that doxycycline serum levels can be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Rationale for Study Design A randomized controlled trial was selected in order to&#xD;
           study ondansetron's effect on the rates of nausea and vomiting in the investigators'&#xD;
           particular population, so that patient's will not know if they are being given&#xD;
           ondansetron or placebo before taking doxycycline. Some potential barriers that are&#xD;
           expected in the study include that the patients may not fill out their&#xD;
           symptom/medication log as this will be done at home. There are approximately 450&#xD;
           patients undergoing surgical termination of pregnancy at the University of Rochester&#xD;
           each year. In order to attain the investigators' goal sample size of 300 patients, the&#xD;
           investigators would have to enroll a large portion of the total patients. The primary&#xD;
           hypothesis is that the rate of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing surgical&#xD;
           pregnancy termination will be decreased in the group receiving ondansetron versus the&#xD;
           group receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CHARACERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Subject Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1.1 Number of Subjects: 300 total subjects are expected to participate in the study.&#xD;
           150 total subjects will be randomized to receive ondansetron, while 150 total subjects&#xD;
           will be randomized to receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1.2 Gender and Age of Subjects: Patients included in the study will be pregnant&#xD;
           females that are ages 18-45 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1.3 Racial and Ethnic Origin: There will be no racial or ethnic restrictions to&#xD;
           participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1.4 Vulnerable Subjects: The women included in this study will be pregnant, although&#xD;
           the study interventions are surveys and the administration of a medication that is both&#xD;
           safe in pregnancy and commonly used in pregnancy, ondansetron.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.1 Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pregnant women seeking care at the University of Rochester's Women's Health&#xD;
                Practice Family Planning Clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ages 18-45 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Undergoing second trimester surgical termination of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proficient in reading, writing, and comprehending English&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Able to give informed consent 3.2.2 Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Less than 18 years old or older than 45 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Not proficient in reading, writing, or comprehending English&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Not able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Already taking antiemetics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Doxycycline allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hyperemesis gravidarum&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of gastroparesis or cyclical vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unable to swallow pills&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3 Discussion of Subject Population Pregnant women ages 18-45 years old were selected&#xD;
           for this study, as they will already be taking doxycycline as the standard of care when&#xD;
           they present for abortion care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION, RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment Patients presenting for a surgical&#xD;
           termination of pregnancy at Women's Health Practice will be offered the opportunity to&#xD;
           participate in the study, after they have consented for a pregnancy termination. The&#xD;
           investigators offering participation to patients would otherwise have routine contact&#xD;
           with these patients, as they will be caring for them regardless of whether or not they&#xD;
           participate in the study. If a subject is interested in participating, they will then be&#xD;
           screened to determine if they are eligible. Patients will be assigned a random number&#xD;
           for the study that will link together their demographic questionnaire, the two visual&#xD;
           analog scales, their study drug, and their symptom/medication log.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Process of Consent Patients will be consented by either Dr. Sarah Betstadt, Dr. Amy&#xD;
           Harrington, research assistant Keelin Abbott, Allison Carletta, NP. The patients will be&#xD;
           given a written consent form to sign that will be extensively reviewed with the&#xD;
           individual consenting them. The written consents will be stored in a locked filing&#xD;
           cabinet, and only Keelin Abbott or Dr. Sarah Betstadt, or Dr. Amy Harrington will be&#xD;
           able to access them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. METHODS AND STUDY PROCEDURES During their clinic visit 1-2 days before the procedure,&#xD;
           patients will fill out a demographic questionnaire regarding their age, race,&#xD;
           relationship status, income and education level, pregnancy history, gestational age, and&#xD;
           symptoms of nausea and vomiting thus far in the pregnancy. This questionnaire will also&#xD;
           include questions regarding cigarette and THC use, as well as any diagnoses of&#xD;
           gastroesophageal reflux disease or hyperemesis gravidarum. They will then fill out a&#xD;
           baseline visual analog scale rating their nausea, pain and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients will then be given a symptom/medication log to take home. The patients will&#xD;
           use the log to record symptoms they experience from the time they take the ondansetron&#xD;
           or placebo to the time that they present for their procedure. The log will include the&#xD;
           timing of the study medication, doxycycline, whether the doxycycline was taken with food&#xD;
           (and the time of/type of food if applicable), pain medications, and misoprostol. The log&#xD;
           will also include the time of nausea and vomiting, and the severity of the nausea and&#xD;
           pain (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
           When patients present to the hospital for their procedure, research assistant Keelin&#xD;
           Abbott, Dr. Amy Harrington, or Dr. Sarah Betstadt will give them a second visual analog&#xD;
           scale to fill out which asks them to rate their nausea, pain and anxiety. This scale&#xD;
           will be identical to the one they filled out at their clinic visit. This scale will be&#xD;
           filled out prior to their procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will have a tube of blood drawn for a doxycycline serum level upon arrival to&#xD;
           the hospital on the day of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Safety Assessments A comprehensive medical history will be obtained at the patient's&#xD;
           clinic visit, and a physical exam will be performed as well to ensure that patients are&#xD;
           not only fit and able to undergo their procedure, but also to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Assessment of Subject Compliance Compliance with the demographic questionnaire and&#xD;
           baseline visual analog scale will be assessed by nature of them both being filled out&#xD;
           and turned in in clinic. Compliance with taking the study medication will be assessed by&#xD;
           asking the patient if and when they took either the ondansetron or placebo when they&#xD;
           present for their procedure. Compliance with completing the symptom/medication log will&#xD;
           be assessed by asking the patient to turn in their log when they present for their&#xD;
           procedure. Compliance with the second visual analog scale will be ensured by asking the&#xD;
           patient to complete it in the hospital before their procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Costs to the Subject Subjects will not incur any additional costs by participating&#xD;
           in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4 Payment for Participation Patients will not be reimbursed to participate in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. CONCOMITANT AND DISALLOWED MEDICATIONS As per standard of care (and irrespective of the&#xD;
           research study), in addition to doxycycline, patients will take 400 mcg of misoprostol&#xD;
           buccally 3 hours before their procedure. It is also standard of care that patients are&#xD;
           able to take either Ibuprofen or Tylenol #3 as needed for pain before their procedure.&#xD;
           They will also be permitted to take any other medications that they take on a daily&#xD;
           basis. None of these medications are part of the research protocol. They will be&#xD;
           instructed not to take any antiemetics. The investigators will record any medications&#xD;
           that are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. SUBJECT WITHDRAWALS Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they themselves request&#xD;
           to do so, or if they fail to take the study medication or the doxycycline. They will not&#xD;
           be withdrawn if they fail to complete the demographic questionnaire, the baseline visual&#xD;
           analog scale, the symptom/medication log, or the second visual analog scale. In the&#xD;
           event that a patient does not complete one of these forms, the investigators' research&#xD;
           assistant Keelin Abbott will help her complete them. No additional study activities will&#xD;
           be completed prior to subject withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. SAFETY AND REPORTABLE EVENTS 8.1 Adverse Event Definition An adverse event is any&#xD;
           symptom, sign, illness, or experience which develops or worsens during the course of the&#xD;
           study, whether or not the event is considered related to the study survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 Serious Adverse Event&#xD;
&#xD;
           A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse medical experience that results in any&#xD;
           of the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  death;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  is life-threatening;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or&#xD;
                damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.3 Recording Adverse Events At each subject visit the site study staff will assess&#xD;
           adverse events by recording all voluntary complaints of the subject and by assessment of&#xD;
           clinical and laboratory features. At each study visit, the subject should be questioned&#xD;
           directly regarding the occurrence of any adverse experience since her last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All adverse events, whether observed by the Investigator, elicited from or volunteered&#xD;
           by the subject, should be documented. Each adverse event will include a brief&#xD;
           description of the experience, the time of onset, the time of resolution, the duration&#xD;
           and type of experience, the severity, the relationship to the study, contributing&#xD;
           factors, and any action taken with respect to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recording of adverse events will take place from the time that the subject signs the&#xD;
           consent until the subject completes the study (1-2 days after signing the consent) or&#xD;
           withdraws from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.4 Responsibilities for Reporting Serious Adverse Events All serious adverse&#xD;
           experiences that occur during the study period will be recorded. The recording of&#xD;
           experiences will occur from the time of signing of the consent until the subject&#xD;
           completes the study or withdraws from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.1 Risk Category: Greater than minimal risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.2 Potential Risks Potential risks to subjects include the possibility of an adverse&#xD;
           reaction to either ondansetron or placebo, and the potential risk of a patient's greater&#xD;
           realization of the nausea and vomiting they are experiencing due to doxycycline. The use&#xD;
           of doxycycline is already standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.3 Protection Against Risks The only additional risk may be loss of confidentiality.&#xD;
           Study materials will be kept in a locked file cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.4 Potential Benefits to Subjects A potential benefit to subjects participating in this&#xD;
           study is a decrease in their nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.5 Alternatives to Participation Patients who decline to participate in the study will&#xD;
           receive the standard of care at the investigators' clinic for termination of pregnancy,&#xD;
           which involves the use of doxycycline as a prophylactic antibiotic the night before the&#xD;
           procedure, as well as misoprostol the morning of the procedure. They will also be able&#xD;
           to take Ibuprofen or Tylenol #3 for pain. They will not fill out any surveys or logs or&#xD;
           take the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA AND INFORMATION STORAGE 10.1 Subject data will be identified in&#xD;
           the research data set by random unique identifiable code. Research assistant Keelin&#xD;
           Abbott will maintain the code to that information and it will be used to re-identify&#xD;
           patients when they present for their procedure, in order to link together their&#xD;
           demographic questionnaire, the two visual analog scales, their study medication, and the&#xD;
           symptom/medication log. The research data will be secured in a locked filing cabinet&#xD;
           during the study. No identifying information will be included in the research database&#xD;
           except for the subject's ID number, any identifying information will be kept separately&#xD;
           from the research database. Research files will be locked up when they are unsupervised,&#xD;
           and only Keelin Abbott, Dr. Sarah Betsadt, or Dr. Amy Harrington will be able to access&#xD;
           the files.&#xD;

       11. RESEARCH INFORMATION IN MEDICAL RECORDS No research data will be included in the&#xD;
           subject's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. DATA ANALYSIS AND MONITORING 12.1 Sample Size Determination Based on Reeves' study as&#xD;
           well as anecdotal data from the investigators' clinic population, the investigators&#xD;
           expect vomiting to occur in approximately 30% of the investigators' patients who take&#xD;
           their doxycycline the night before their procedure. To have 80% power to detect a 50%&#xD;
           decrease in nausea and vomiting, the investigators will need 122 patients in each arm of&#xD;
           the study. In order to account for subject withdrawal or non-compliance, the&#xD;
           investigators intend to enroll 150 patients in each arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.2 Planned Statistical Analysis Our primary outcome of vomiting, will be analyzed using&#xD;
      chi-square analysis. All dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed using chi-square analysis.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be examined using t-tests. If demographic variables are found to be&#xD;
      confounders with significance, they will be placed into a logistic regression model. SPSS&#xD;
      software will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
