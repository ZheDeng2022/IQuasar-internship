      The investigators will test the value of an internet self-help package (E-Couch) for&#xD;
      alleviating social anxiety symptoms in the general population. The investigators will&#xD;
      undertake a trial of about 2000 participants to compare the effect of the E-Couch&#xD;
      intervention compared to a wait-list control condition. Over a period of 12 months the&#xD;
      investigators will measure the effect of using E-Couch self-help on social anxiety symptoms,&#xD;
      as well as on mental wellbeing, and other secondary outcomes including quality of life,&#xD;
      depression and general anxiety, and their use of other sources of help.&#xD;

      DESIGN The study will involve a large, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial of the&#xD;
      internet-based self-directed E-Couch social anxiety module versus a wait-list control&#xD;
      condition for the reduction of sub-clinical social anxiety symptoms, among a general&#xD;
      population sample recruited using direct-to-consumer advertisements on national websites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT Participants in this study will be recruited using advertisements placed on&#xD;
      websites such as the NHS website. Individuals expressing an interest in the online&#xD;
      advertisement by clicking on a web link will be directed to a University website containing&#xD;
      full information on the trial and the opportunity to ask questions of the study team by email&#xD;
      or telephone. Participants will be advised in the information sheet that they are free to&#xD;
      withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without it affecting their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT Interested participants will be asked to indicate their willingness to participate in&#xD;
      the screening and/or the trial by clicking on Yes in response to the online consent&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING Users who provide their consent will be invited to complete screening questions&#xD;
      which will determine whether they are eligible for participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION Inclusion criteria for this trial include age 18 years and over,&#xD;
      resident of England and a score of 13 or more on the SPIN social anxiety measure, and a&#xD;
      willingness to provide a working email address and mobile phone number (to respond to a&#xD;
      confirmation email and receive reminders). People who are currently receiving&#xD;
      therapist-guided treatment for social anxiety disorder will be excluded from participation as&#xD;
      will those with a self-reported diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASURES Following completion of the screening survey eligible participants will be advised&#xD;
      that they are eligible to participate in the trial and asked to provide their email address&#xD;
      and mobile phone number. Once these details have been submitted they will be advised that in&#xD;
      24 hours they will receive an e-mail providing a link to an online baseline survey. The&#xD;
      e-mail will link to a battery of demographic and self-report mental health measures. Measures&#xD;
      will be taken at baseline and, for those randomised, at all or most of the follow up points&#xD;
      including post-intervention, 3-, 6- and 12-months. At each follow-up point both Intervention&#xD;
      and Control participants will receive notification of follow-up measures by email and by text&#xD;
      message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION Participants who complete baseline measures within one week of receiving the&#xD;
      survey link via email, will be randomised using an automated computer algorithm to the&#xD;
      E-Couch social anxiety tool (Intervention) or to a Wait list control condition. Participants&#xD;
      will be advised of the condition to which they have been allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACCESS TO INTERVENTION Intervention participants will be asked to set a password associated&#xD;
      with their email address, and provided with access to the Intervention. Intervention&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to access and use the self-guided intervention over a period&#xD;
      of up to 6 weeks (although they can chose to work through the program at their own pace).&#xD;
      Access will be via secure login on the research trial website, using their email address and&#xD;
      password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION The E-Couch social anxiety module which is based on cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy principles. This module contains a literacy section and 5 toolkits comprising&#xD;
      exposure practice, cognitive restructuring (modifying your thinking), attention practice,&#xD;
      social skills training and relaxation. E-Couch is designed to be completed at the&#xD;
      participant's own pace. It is free to use, browser-based and widely accessible on a range of&#xD;
      connected devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL The Control group will be placed on a wait list to receive the intervention in 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS The risks to the participants are likely to be minimal. The study uses standard&#xD;
      well-tested measures or tools modified from these measures. Participants are referred to a&#xD;
      source of help in the Information Sheet in case of distress. The intervention has been&#xD;
      employed without problems in publically accessible form across the world since 2008.&#xD;
