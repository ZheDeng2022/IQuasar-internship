      The primary objectives of the LIFE Study are to demonstrate the clinical cost and benefits&#xD;
      associated with using the Ovation Prime Abdominal Stent Graft System under the least invasive&#xD;
      conditions defined in the Fast-Track EVAR protocol. The key elements of the Fast-Track EVAR&#xD;
      protocol include: appropriate patient selection, bilateral percutaneous access, no general&#xD;
      anesthesia, no ICU admission post procedure, and next day discharge.&#xD;
