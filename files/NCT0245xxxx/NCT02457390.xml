    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic ultrasound examination performed during surgery for primary cancer of the colon&#xD;
      and rectum (CRC) has been shown to be able to detect liver metastasis that are not recognized&#xD;
      by conventional computer tomography (CT scan) prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today most of the colorectal cancer resections are performed by laparoscopy, but robotic&#xD;
      technology is gradually developed in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations&#xD;
      characterized by laparoscopy. The use of contrast enhanced laparoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      examination (CE-LUS) of the liver during robot-assisted CRC surgery has not been studied, and&#xD;
      this despite the fact that it seems technically possible to perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project we will investigate whether CE-LUS associated with robotic surgery for CRC&#xD;
      is technically feasible and whether it will be able to detect synchronous liver metastases&#xD;
      that have not been detected on the preoperative imaging modalities.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value of contrast enhanced laparoscopic ultrasound examination during robot-assisted&#xD;
      resection for primary colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following project evaluates the value of contrast enhanced Laparoscopic Ultrasound&#xD;
      examination (CE-LUS) in robot-assisted surgery for CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project &quot;The value of contrast enhanced laparoscopic ultrasound examination during&#xD;
      robot-assisted resection for primary colorectal cancer surgery&quot; is a part of a Ph.D study at&#xD;
      the University of Southern Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1: The primary purpose is to investigate whether the use of contrast enhanced ultrasound&#xD;
      examination in connection with LUS procedure increases the number of detected liver&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2: As a secondary objective; an evaluation of the technical feasibility of the CE-LUS&#xD;
      procedure during robot-assisted resection for primary colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic surgery for cancer in the colon or rectum seems to be equal standing to open&#xD;
      surgery with regards to the morbidity, mortality and the oncologic results (radicality and&#xD;
      re-lapse frequency and long-term survival). Laparoscopic surgery for CRC is now a&#xD;
      well-understood and well-established surgical method, but there are only few randomized&#xD;
      trials dealing with the long-term results. The latest inventory work calls for better&#xD;
      documentation of long-term results and calls for further randomized studies. Despite this,&#xD;
      the number of laparoscopic operations for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Denmark is increasing,&#xD;
      and laparoscopic surgery has become established as standard treatment for CRC. The&#xD;
      development of minimally invasive surgery is not stopped by the laparoscopic approach, and&#xD;
      robotic surgery is currently under evaluation in particular rectal surgery for CRC. Robot&#xD;
      technology has been developed in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations that&#xD;
      characterize the laparoscopic surgery. The establishment of a stable platform with&#xD;
      instruments witch have increased rotating movements is an essential part of the robotic&#xD;
      surgery. A motion-scaling and filtering makes sure that the image does not shake during the&#xD;
      operation. The picture resolution is enhanced with 3D visualization and have visual&#xD;
      magnification of the operating field. A combination of these features allows more precise&#xD;
      dissection of tissue, suturing and improved bleeding-control compared to conventional&#xD;
      laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver metastases are frequent in patients with CRC and about 15-20% of patients already have&#xD;
      metastases at the diagnosis (synchronous metastases). Ultrasound examination during open&#xD;
      surgery (IOUS) has shown to be an important diagnostic tool with high sensitivity (98%) and&#xD;
      positive predictive value (86%) for detection liver metastases that are undiagnosed on&#xD;
      preoperative CT or positron emission tomography (PET-CT). IOUS is considered as the gold&#xD;
      standard for hepatic metastases within open surgery for CRC. In laparoscopic surgery this&#xD;
      option disappears, but it is likely that laparoscopic ultrasound examination (LUS), may&#xD;
      provide the same information as found by IOUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound examination (LUS) is well established in the&#xD;
      staging and treatment of upper gastrointestinal cancers, this method is only sparsely&#xD;
      evaluated in the treatment of CRC. There are only very few and older data dealing with the&#xD;
      use of LUS in the TNM staging in patients with cancer in the colon and rectum. Several small&#xD;
      studies have investigated the use of LUS to evaluate the M-stage in laparoscopic colorectal&#xD;
      surgery and all studies show an increased detection of liver metastases. Overall, seems LUS&#xD;
      to be better than the current pre-operative image modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prospective and blinded studies a percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination&#xD;
      (CEUS) of the liver proved to be able to detect significantly more liver-metastases from CRC&#xD;
      than conventional percutaneous ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the new second-generation contrast agents CEUS seems to be equivalent to the&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced CT and (magnetic resonance imaging) MRI for detection liver-metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver metastases are frequent in patients with CRC and the use of intraoperative ultrasound&#xD;
      (IOUS) during open surgery for CRC, has previously been regarded as the gold standard.&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced IOUS (CE-IOUS) during open surgery for CRC is only sparsely evaluated, but&#xD;
      has been shown to increase sensitivity for detection liver-metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with rectum cancer receive pre-treatment with chemotherapy and radiation&#xD;
      therapy, and chemotherapy may make it difficult to identify existing metastases in the liver.&#xD;
      Studies have shown an increased detection of metastases with contrast-enhanced ultrasound&#xD;
      after pretreatment with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity of ultrasound examination can be improved by use of contrast enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound.There is a single pilot study dealing with contrast-enhanced laparoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (CE-LUS) during primary CRC resection and the study revealed an improved detection&#xD;
      of metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same manner as in the laparoscopic resection of CRC, there is a need in the robot-&#xD;
      assisted surgery to be able to compensate for the lack of intraoperative palpation and IOUS.&#xD;
      The use of CE-LUS associated with robotic surgery in CRC patients has not been studied and&#xD;
      this despite the fact that it appears technically possible to carry out the procedure for the&#xD;
      robot procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project we want to elucidate whether the use of CE-LUS in robot-assisted surgery&#xD;
      for CRC will increases detection rate for liver metastases and evaluate the technical&#xD;
      feasibility of the CE-LUS procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a prospective, descriptive study with 50 consecutive patients scheduled for&#xD;
      robot-assisted surgery for primary CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients had, prior to the scheduled surgery, completed a contrast enhanced CT of the&#xD;
      chest and abdomen, as part of their Tumor, Lymph node and Metastases (TNM) evaluation. The CT&#xD;
      scan was made according to current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the surgery the patient will get the LUS examination by a specialist with&#xD;
      skills in contrast-enhanced ultrasound. All liver segments are systematically scanned and any&#xD;
      findings will be recorded on a registration form. After the LUS examination of the liver the&#xD;
      procedure will supplied with a contrast enhanced examination. CE-LUS is performed with a&#xD;
      contrast agent SonoVueÂ® containing Sulphurhexafluoride which is a according to the&#xD;
      department's instructions for CE-LUS procedure. A bolus of 2.5 ml is injected into a&#xD;
      peripheral vein followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline. The liver is then systematically&#xD;
      scanned in 3 phases (arterial, venous and parenchymatous phase) searching for unrecognized&#xD;
      liver metastases. The procedure is repeated after 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time it takes to do the LUS and CE-LUS is measured and any technical challenges are&#xD;
      reported. Time, challenges and findings of liver metastases (number, segment and size) are&#xD;
      entered on a registration form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there at the CE-LUS examination is found undiagnosed liver metastases, then the patient&#xD;
      get an intraoperative LUS-guided fine-needle aspirations- biopsy (FNA) or tru-cut biopsy&#xD;
      performed by a liver surgeon specialist and the lesion will be marked with a little silver&#xD;
      pin. The latter is used for follow-up after pretreatment and to locate potential rest tumor.&#xD;
      The patient will then be sent to the Department of Surgery A, Odense University Hospital, for&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary tumor conference (MDT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other patients follow the Departments usual routines for adjuvant therapy. All patients&#xD;
      included in the project will undergo a three-phase control CT scan 3 months after surgery.&#xD;
      This is to evaluate whether there might be overlooked metastases during the CE-LUS&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the information about the patients are entered and recorded in a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project was reviewed and approved by the Science Ethics Committee, Project No:&#xD;
&#xD;
      S- 20140154. The project is reported to the Data Protection Agency. The studies will be&#xD;
      registered in ClinicalTrials.com database. Participation in the project is voluntary, and&#xD;
      patients may at any time withdraw their commitment to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date no reports of serious or life-threatening complications of LUS examinations or its&#xD;
      probe is reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LUS instrument/ probe is introduced into the abdominal cavity through the small holes&#xD;
      (&quot;gates&quot;) that the surgeon uses to do the operation with. Patients are not getting more scars&#xD;
      / sores on the stomach than usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a specialist with expertise in ultrasound scanning, which handles the actual scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there during the ultrasound scan is found spread of the cancer, which was not known before&#xD;
      surgery, it may be necessary to take tissue samples from the suspicious area and perhaps mark&#xD;
      this with a small silver pin. This is in order to regain these areas later, and to determine&#xD;
      whether it is about the spread of cancer. In this case the patient will be further diagnosed&#xD;
      and treated by the department's usual guidelines in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contrast agent used in this context is not associated with any serious risks and is a&#xD;
      well-known and approved contrast agent. The ultrasound scan itself is not dangerous, and the&#xD;
      contrast agent can give temporarily problems in form of headaches and nausea (prevalence&#xD;
      1-10%), and, rarely, transient weakness, vasodilation, hyperglycemia, sensory disturbances,&#xD;
      rash and visual disturbances (frequency 0.1-1%). The contrast medium circulates only briefly&#xD;
      in the body and the patient is monitored and are in general anesthetic, when administered.&#xD;
      [26].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a minimal risk of bleeding in connection with a tissue sampling, but otherwise there&#xD;
      are no side effects associated with the operation or construction of a small silver pin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the follow-up there is included an extra CT scan in relation to the department's usual&#xD;
      procedure. There is a theoretical, but very modest risk- 0.01% in order to develop a new&#xD;
      cancer disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time and place The project is carried out at The RAK-Center at the department of Surgery A,&#xD;
      Odense University Hospital, and the management at Department of Surgery A, Odense University&#xD;
      Hospital, approves the project.&#xD;
