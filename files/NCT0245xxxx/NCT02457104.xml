    <textblock>
      The investigators long-term goal is to understand how PPIs influence energy balance in both&#xD;
      obese and normal-weight individuals. The overall goal of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      PPI use causes detrimental changes in the composition and functional properties of the gut&#xD;
      microbiome, and whether any such effects are mediated by altered responses of human fatty&#xD;
      acid receptors (e.g., GPR41/43).&#xD;

      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without gastrointestinal symptoms scheduled for a screening or surveillance&#xD;
      colonoscopy (for colorectal cancer) at the UCH endoscopy lab will be screened for the study&#xD;
      based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients who consent to the study&#xD;
      will have height, weight, and demographic information measured and recorded. They will&#xD;
      complete a weight/diet history questionnaire. Patients will undergo the&#xD;
      screening/surveillance colonoscopy per routine clinical care. Residual stool is standardly&#xD;
      aspirated through the colonoscope to ensure full visualization of the mucosa to enhance polyp&#xD;
      detection. We will take stool aspirates from three separate locations: sigmoid colon, cecum,&#xD;
      and terminal ileum. Evidence suggests that a bowel preparation (prior to colonoscopy) does&#xD;
      not significantly change the composition of the intestinal microbiota for the majority of&#xD;
      subjects. We will also take four small, pinch biopsies at each of these three sites. Stool&#xD;
      aspirates and biopsy specimens will be snap-frozen in liquid N2 and frozen at -80C until&#xD;
      required for their assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll a total of 48 subjects divided equally between four groups: OB/PPI,&#xD;
      OB/non-PPI, NW/PPI, and NW/non-PPI. Approximately 40-50 patients per week meeting the above&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria undergo a screening/surveillance colonoscopy at UCH, making&#xD;
      recruitment of 2-3 patients/week over 6-9 months realistic to reach targeted enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine the effects of PPI use on the gut microbiota in the colon and terminal&#xD;
      ileum of normal-weight (NW) and obese (OB) patients. Intestinal microbiomes will be profiled&#xD;
      by 16S rRNA sequencing to identify PPI-associated alterations in gut biodiversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separate sterile specimen collection containers will be used for the stool aspirates and&#xD;
      mucosal biopsies from the sigmoid colon, cecum, and terminal ileum. High-throughput DNA&#xD;
      sequencing for microbiome analysis will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiome 16S rRNA Profiling Total community genomic DNA will be prepared from intestinal&#xD;
      specimens and 16S rRNA genes PCR amplified as previously described. Paired-end, multiplexed&#xD;
      sequencing will be performed. 10-20 million DNA sequences will be generated in a single run&#xD;
      and 100,000 rRNA reads generated per sample to ensure &gt;99% sequence coverage. Demultiplexing,&#xD;
      quality filtering, chimera-removal and sequence classification (using SINA/Silva) will follow&#xD;
      previous publications. Similar sequences are grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs)&#xD;
      based on taxonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiome Data Analysis The main outcome is the percent relative abundance (PRA) of&#xD;
      microbial groups, and we hypothesize this will differ between PPI users and non-users of acid&#xD;
      suppression medications. Specific microbial groups (species/genera/phyla) that differ between&#xD;
      experimental groups will be identified using a non-parametric two-part statistic.40&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be assessed at = 0.05 and p-values corrected for false discovery&#xD;
      rate (FDR).41 Results will be validated by species-specific QPCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether PPI use alters the relative amount of gut bacterial RNA dedicated&#xD;
      to the fermentation cycle in NW and OB individuals. We will perform shotgun sequencing of&#xD;
      bulk RNA prepared from intestinal microbiomes to identify microbial metabolic pathways&#xD;
      differentially expressed in patients on PPIs. Stool aspirates from the terminal ileum, cecum,&#xD;
      and sigmoid colon will be obtained as detailed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA Isolation and Sequencing Microbial RNA will be extracted from 50 mg of fecal aspirates&#xD;
      using the RiboPure Bacteria extraction kit (Life Technologies Inc., USA). For this pilot, we&#xD;
      will assay specimens from a total of 48 subjects divided equally between four groups: OB/PPI,&#xD;
      OB/non-PPI, NW/PPI, and NW/non-PPI. Host and microbial rRNA will be removed using the&#xD;
      Ribo-Zero bacteria and Ribo-Zero mouse kits (Epicentre, Inc, USA). RNA samples will be&#xD;
      prepared for sequencing using the ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq (bacteria) kits (Epicentre, Inc, USA).&#xD;
      Sequencing will be performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (UC-Denver Microarray and&#xD;
      Genomics Core), which provides high depth of coverage. For quality assurance of&#xD;
      reproducibility, two mRNA samples of each specimen will be pooled and sequenced. In this&#xD;
      pilot experiment, we will generate ~20x106 single-end 150-base reads per sample for each&#xD;
      microbial meta-transcriptome dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metatranscriptome Data Analysis Annotation and enumeration of bacterial transcripts will be&#xD;
      performed at the peptide level using BLASTX searches against the approximately 1800 bacterial&#xD;
      genome sequences currently available in GenBank as well as the NCBI non-redundant protein&#xD;
      database using an E-value cutoff of &lt;10-5.44 Broad-level functional differences between&#xD;
      samples will be assessed using annotations generated through the COG,47 KEGG48 and RAST/SEED&#xD;
      tools.49, 50 Statistical analysis of enteric microbial transcriptomes will focus on the&#xD;
      identification of metabolic pathways that are differentially expressed between groups.44&#xD;
      Genes with high-quality annotations (E&lt;10-5) will be used to construct an NxM matrix of genes&#xD;
      (M) by subjects (N) recording the number of sequence reads annotated for a given gene and&#xD;
      subject. A similar NxM matrix of gene categories (M) by subjects (N) will be constructed to&#xD;
      tabulate the distribution of sequence reads assigned to functional categories. Genes or gene&#xD;
      categories that differ in prevalence or abundance between treatment groups will be identified&#xD;
      by the Fisher exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively, applied to each gene/category&#xD;
      in the matrix. Significance will be assessed at = 0.05, following correction for FDR.41&#xD;
      P-values will be used to prioritize a candidate gene list for follow-up validation using QPCR&#xD;
      to screen for gene expression across the entire patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the extent to which PPI use alters expression of GPR41, GPR43, and their&#xD;
      effector genes in the colon and terminal ileum of NW and OB patients. Biopsy specimens will&#xD;
      be subjected to a panel of RT-QPCR assays to monitor expression of target genes impacted by&#xD;
      microbial SCFA production. Biopsies from the terminal ileum, cecum, and sigmoid colon will be&#xD;
      obtained as detailed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis Total RNA will be extracted using&#xD;
      the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and ISOGEN (WAKO). Complementary DNAs will be transcribed using&#xD;
      RNAs as templates with Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).&#xD;
      cDNAs will be amplified by PCR with Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) using the appropriate&#xD;
      primers. qRT-PCR analyses will be performed using DNA Engine Opticon-2 (MJ Research). The&#xD;
      expression will be quantified in duplicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 24 NW and 24 obese (OB) participants. Half of the NW and OB groups will be PPI&#xD;
      users and half will be non-users of acid suppressing medications. The primary outcome for Aim&#xD;
      1 is the difference in the PRA of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. A two-way ANOVA (factors of&#xD;
      BMI category and PPI use) will be used. Based on our preliminary data, we will have 94% power&#xD;
      to detect a difference in the PRA of Firmicutes (72% vs 52% with SD of 20%) and 95% power to&#xD;
      detect differences in the PRA of Bacteroidetes (16% vs 5% with SD of 5%) between PPI users&#xD;
      and non-users. The primary outcome for Aim 2 is the difference in bacterial RNA dedicated to&#xD;
      the fermentation cycle while the outcome for Aim 3 is the difference in expression of GPR 41&#xD;
      and GPR 43. Based on the expected differences in the gut microbiota profile and subsequent&#xD;
      SCFA production, we expect a 25% difference between PPI users and non-users for both&#xD;
      outcomes, giving us 99% power for both Aims 2 and 3). We will also perform subgroup analyses&#xD;
      within the NW and OB groups.&#xD;
