      This study evaluates possible effects of two different NICU designs; by comparing traditional&#xD;
      and Family Centered Care in terms of infant nutrition, health and growth, and coping by&#xD;
      family.&#xD;

      Two Norwegian neonatal intensive care units (NICU) participate in this study; Haukeland&#xD;
      University Hospital (HUH) and Vestre Viken Hospital Trust (VVHT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NICU at HUH was built around 1980 as a traditional unit. It is crowded, has no single&#xD;
      rooms or access to rooming in with the parents. The NICU at VVHT opened in April 2012 and it&#xD;
      is unique in its kind both in a Norwegian and European context. A shift from traditional NICU&#xD;
      to a FCC unit involves both physical structural changes and involves the entire&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team around the individual families. The main difference is firstly the&#xD;
      involvement of parents and their right to be present together with infant and secondly the&#xD;
      establishment of parents as the responsible caregivers for the infant, even when the infant&#xD;
      is hospitalized. This comprises so-called &quot;minimal handling&quot;, the number of medical&#xD;
      procedures are reduced to the very strictest necessities, and restructuring the common&#xD;
      nursing interventions. The infant is given Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) skin-to-skin rather&#xD;
      than being in an incubator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first question raised and discussed is whether the FCC - with parents present in Single&#xD;
      Room Care 24 hours and performing KMC - will affect the preterm infant's growth and&#xD;
      attainment of breastfeeding. The second question raised and discussed is whether the&#xD;
      surroundings in FCC-unit - with parents present - will affect parents' reports on parental&#xD;
      health in relation to psychological stress, anxiety and depression, also in a longitudinal&#xD;
      perspective. The purpose of the study is to evaluate possible effects of these two different&#xD;
      NICU designs; the traditional open bay unit with limited space and no possibilities for&#xD;
      parents to continuously stay with their infant, and the novel model physically and culturally&#xD;
      optimized for parent-infant interaction 24 hours a day 7 days a week from birth to discharge.&#xD;
      Although an intriguing novel asset to neonatal intensive care, the effects of FCC on the&#xD;
      child's and family's somatic and mental health, on NICU staff and cost of care, have not been&#xD;
      scientifically scrutinized. There is so far lack of valid knowledge about effect of FCC in a&#xD;
      single room unit with parents present to the extent we can offer in Nordic countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled study (RCT) in a single unit would be ethically and methodologically&#xD;
      impossible to conduct, e.g. since it will be impossible to avoid &quot;contamination&quot; between&#xD;
      groups, and a Cochrane review argued that comparison between different units would be the&#xD;
      most valid method. This recommended approach will be followed in the present study, and the&#xD;
      challenge is to minimize factors that may act as confounders. To minimize confounding the&#xD;
      following details on design will be adhered to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment of comparable infant - parent dyads&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strict definitions of independent and outcome variables, e.g.nutrition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective registration: Parental presence and duration of KMC, infant nutrition,&#xD;
           growth, investigations and occurrence of morbidity will be prospectively and similarly&#xD;
           registered during the hospital stay under supervision by a designated research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data on growth will be transferred to z-scores based on standardized growth charts for&#xD;
      Norwegian infants for pre and post term growth. Relevant statistical methods for comparisons&#xD;
      will be applied and statistical methods will be chosen in cooperation with a biostatistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is weight at 34 weeks and 40 weeks post menstrual age (PMA), basically&#xD;
      calculated as z-score increments between 34 and 40 weeks. Judged from a pilot study it is&#xD;
      actually sufficient with only ten children in each group to detect a difference in weight of&#xD;
      100 gram 34 Gestational age (GA) weeks with a power of 80% at a significance level of less&#xD;
      than 0.05. However, due to the other variables and analyzes (among other mixed model) it is&#xD;
      appropriate with about 100 infants, 50 in each group. An important secondary outcome is&#xD;
      length of stay in terms of PMA at discharge. From data at HUH a difference in PMA at&#xD;
      discharge of 5 days (which is considered clinically relevant) will require 42 infants in each&#xD;
      leg (calculated from a standard deviation of 13 days, power of 80% and p &lt; 0.05). From these&#xD;
      data one year recruitment will be sufficient in that, in our experience, more than 90% will&#xD;
      agree to participate. We will consider expanding inclusion to 1 Â½ years (75 infants in each&#xD;
      branch) to allow for power to assess effects of other explanatory variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents who agree to participate are registered in a database containing name, personal&#xD;
      identification number, a code number which corresponds to other files, information relating&#xD;
      to the date the questionnaires are sent or received, and whether or not reminders have been&#xD;
      sent. No other information is stored in this database. The data will be stored at the&#xD;
      respective Research servers at VVHT and HUH according to the requirements of the hospitals&#xD;
      and the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (de-identified study file&#xD;
      and a file with a key to the study file). Transfer of data from HUH to VVHF will be performed&#xD;
      as encrypted files according to requirements. All participants will be asked to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent form at the enrolment in the study.&#xD;
