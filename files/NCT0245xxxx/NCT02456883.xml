  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 14C-labeled gilteritinib, in&#xD;
      particular, the routes of excretion and extent of metabolism of gilteritinib following&#xD;
      administration of a single dose of 14C-labeled gilteritinib after repeated doses of&#xD;
      gilteritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the safety of repeated oral administration of gilteritinib in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumors as well as identify the metabolic profile of gilteritinib&#xD;
      in plasma, urine and feces after a single oral dose of 14C-labeled gilteritinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be admitted for evaluation to the clinical research unit on day 14 for&#xD;
      potentially up to 14 days (day 29). At approximately days 36 and 45 participants will return&#xD;
      to the clinic (for 3 days) for additional sample collection.&#xD;
