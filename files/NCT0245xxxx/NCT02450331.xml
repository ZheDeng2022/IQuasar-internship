  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase III, open-label, randomized, multicenter study is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab compared with observation in participants with&#xD;
      muscle-invasive UC who are at high risk for recurrence following resection. Eligible&#xD;
      participants were randomized by a 1:1 ratio into atezolizumab group or control group.&#xD;

    <measure>Disease-Free Survival (DFS), as Assessed by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to first occurrence of DFS event (up to approximately 50 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DFS is defined as the time from randomization to the time of first occurrence of a DFS event. DFS events include: local (pelvic) recurrence of UC (including soft tissue and regional lymph nodes); urinary tract recurrence of UC (including all pathological stages and grades); distant metastasis of UC; or death from any cause. Tumor assessment will be performed using radiographic evaluations.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization until death due to any cause (up to approximately 50 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause, regardless of whether the death occurs during study treatment or following treatment discontinuation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Disease-Specific Survival (DSS), as Assessed by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization until death due to UC (up to approximately 50 months)</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-Urinary Tract Recurrence-Free Survival (NURFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to time of first occurrence of a NURFS event (up to approximately 50 months)</time_frame>
    <description>NURFS is defined as the time from randomization to the time of first occurrence of a NURFS event. NURFS events include: local (pelvic) recurrence of UC (including soft tissue and regional lymph nodes); distant metastasis of UC; or death from any cause.

    <time_frame>Day 1 of Cycle 1 up to approximately 50 months (Cycle length = 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic preference-based HRQoL questionnaire that provides a single index value for health status and is used to inform pharmacoeconomic evaluations and to measure general health status. Visual analog scale (VAS) allows the patient to indicate, on a scale of 0-100, how his or her health is on the day of assessment, with 100 being the &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and 0 being the &quot;worst imaginable health state.&quot;</description>
