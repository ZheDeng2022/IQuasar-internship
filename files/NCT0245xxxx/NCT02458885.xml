      Aim of investigators is to conduct a registry of acute myocardial infarction including a&#xD;
      broad network of critical care / coronary care unit throughout Argentina to increase the&#xD;
      knowledge about treatments, timing of reperfusion therapy and outcomes, both in-hospital and&#xD;
      during short-term follow up.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the world and in Argentina, as&#xD;
      well as a cause of disability and loss of work capacity in adults. Treatment of various forms&#xD;
      of serious diseases such as acute ischemic events and heart failure are now supported by&#xD;
      scientific studies and allow a markedly reduction in disability and mortality. Access to&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic strategies require proper coordination of the health system and&#xD;
      far exceed the role of specialists. Given the frequency of these diseases, it is essential to&#xD;
      have information on the prevalence and treatment, and the various barriers to access to&#xD;
      diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Both for the basic knowledge to evaluate the relevance&#xD;
      and effectiveness of corrective action a record of pathologies is required, with information&#xD;
      accurate enough to enable the adoption of public policies, and adjusted to national needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific societies in cardiovascular field, Argentine Society of Cardiology and Argentine&#xD;
      Federation of Cardiology, have a long history of registers and educational programs to&#xD;
      improve cardiovascular care. However, these tasks are limited to institutions with academic&#xD;
      programs and probably do not reach the majority of our population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A national survey of high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, starting with acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation, together with the authorities of the&#xD;
      National Ministry of Health, would put Argentina at the level of most developed countries in&#xD;
      this subject. Knowledge of general and local barriers will allow a rapid implementation of&#xD;
      corrective measures and the evaluation of their impact through the permanent record.&#xD;
      Improving the quality of cardiovascular patient care, optimizing adherence to standards of&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment can be achieved through different paths as self-knowledge of the&#xD;
      institutions of their level of performance and dissemination of coordination measures,&#xD;
      generating systematic referral and care networks, diagnostic support systems such as&#xD;
      telemedicine, and others that can be assessed globally or regionally according to the&#xD;
      identified problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Networking will also enable the implementation of initiatives that will result in an increase&#xD;
      in the quality of care and generate epidemiological research projects that enhance patient&#xD;
      care and outcomes. In conclusion, it will allow to know the problems in depth and adopt&#xD;
      measures to improve the quality of care and reduce morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the survey is to register at national level, in the broadest possible&#xD;
      way trying to reach the &quot;universe&quot; of care for this disease in Argentina, aspects of&#xD;
      clinical, delays, treatment schedules and results, with sufficient information to quickly&#xD;
      allow the adoption of policies to improve the quality of care and subsequent control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its fulfilment arises in stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a national survey of myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation, aimed at&#xD;
           characterization of current evolutions and possible barriers to be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Based on the results, configure an advisory group for public policies in this area to&#xD;
           suggest global and regional measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Upon completion of the survey, consolidation of a permanent network of cardiovascular&#xD;
           disease registry to assess the impact of public policies and their progressive&#xD;
           adjustment under the Federal Cardiovascular Disease Registry A national survey of all&#xD;
           AMI with ST segment elevation admitted to intensive care areas across the country will&#xD;
           take place over a period of 3 consecutive months in each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients admitted with AMI and ST-segment elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AMI evolved with new Q waves less than 36 hours evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspected inferoposterior AMI (horizontal ST depression in V1 to V3, suggestive of acute&#xD;
           circumflex coronary artery occlusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New or presumed new left bundle branch block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation or non-Q AMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myocardial infarction of more than 36 hours of evolution. Data on patient&#xD;
           characteristics (age, gender, risk factors, history, comorbidities), of the clinical&#xD;
           conditions (infarct location, Killip on admission, duration of symptoms), treatments&#xD;
           (antiplatelet drugs, reperfusion therapy, adjuvant treatment) and in-hospital (heart&#xD;
           failure, post-infarction angina, shock, death) and 30-day evolution will be collected.&#xD;
           Emphasis will be placed on the delays for effective treatment. 30 days follow-up will be&#xD;
           done by telephone or in person by each centre investigator or through the central&#xD;
           coordinating committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will take place in an electronic record specially designed, via web,&#xD;
      allowing constant monitoring of the input data. The survey data will be verified or&#xD;
      confronted with source documents in at least 30% of the patients included in the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analysis will be conducted by a committee of representatives of the organizing&#xD;
      researchers of Scientific Societies and the Ministry of Health, presented in relevant&#xD;
      scientific meetings and published in the journals of both Societies.&#xD;
