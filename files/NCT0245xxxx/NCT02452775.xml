      This is a randomized pilot trial to test the addition of 2 investigational agents, Montanide&#xD;
      and poly-ICLC (a TLR3 agonist) to a backbone of autologous oxidized tumor cell lysate vaccine&#xD;
      (OC-L) administered with GMCSF in subjects with primary epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube,&#xD;
      or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
