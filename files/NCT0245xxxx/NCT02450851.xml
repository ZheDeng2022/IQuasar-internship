      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Without an explanation for severe and sometimes life-threatening symptoms, patients and&#xD;
      their families are left in a state of unknown. The NIH helped create a network of medical&#xD;
      research centers, called the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), to provide care and answers&#xD;
      for these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To improve diagnosis and care for people with undiagnosed diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with undiagnosed diseases, and their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will travel to one of the UDN medical centers for a 5-day clinical and&#xD;
           research visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  As part of the visit, UDN healthcare providers may ask participants to have:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Clinically indicated tests and procedures performed including:&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  A physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  A review of health and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  X-rays and body scans&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Photographs of the face and body&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  A special diet to see if the body can handle the food without having a&#xD;
                          reaction, like vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Video or voice recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Other tests and procedures to help reach a diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Research tests and procedures performed including:&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  A skin biopsy. For this, a small piece of skin will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Other tests and procedures for research that may not be related to a&#xD;
                          diagnosis or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most participants will be asked to give samples for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be contacted after their visit to discuss test results. They may also&#xD;
           be contacted in the future for interviews and surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relatives of participants may be asked to give samples for genetic testing. They may be&#xD;
           asked to have parts of their visit recorded and to have additional tests. They may also&#xD;
           be contacted in the future for interviews and surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and research information collected will be stored in a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information and samples collected will be shared with others for research purposes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Without an explanation for severe and sometimes life-threatening symptoms, patients and their&#xD;
      families are left in a state of unknown. Many individuals find themselves being passed from&#xD;
      physician to physician, undergoing countless and often repetitive tests in the hopes of&#xD;
      finding answers and insight about what the future may hold. This long and arduous journey to&#xD;
      find a diagnosis does not end for many patients- the Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR)&#xD;
      notes that 6% of individuals seeking their assistance have an undiagnosed disorder. In 2008,&#xD;
      the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) was established&#xD;
      with the goal of providing care and answers for these individuals with mysterious conditions&#xD;
      who have long eluded diagnosis. The NIH UDP is a joint venture of the NIH ORDR, the National&#xD;
      Human Genome Research Institute Intramural Research Program (NHGRI-IRP), and the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center (CRC). The goals of the NIH UDP are to: (1) provide answers for patients with&#xD;
      undiagnosed diseases; (2) generate new knowledge about disease mechanisms; (3) assess the&#xD;
      application of new approaches to phenotyping and the use of genomic technologies; and (4)&#xD;
      identify potential therapeutic targets, if possible. Prior to formation of the Undiagnosed&#xD;
      Diseases Network (UDN), the UDP had evaluated 3300 medical records, admitted 750 individuals&#xD;
      with rare and undiagnosed conditions to the NIH Clinical Center, and identified more than 70&#xD;
      rare disease diagnoses and several new conditions. The success of the NIH UDP prompted the&#xD;
      NIH Common Fund to support the establishment of a network of medical research centers, the&#xD;
      UDN, for fiscal years 2013-2022. The clinical sites perform extensive phenotyping, genetic&#xD;
      analyses, and functional studies of potential disease-causing variants. The testing performed&#xD;
      on patients involves medically indicated studies intended to help reach a diagnosis, as well&#xD;
      as research investigations that include a skin biopsy, blood draws, and DNA analysis. In&#xD;
      addition, the UDN is furthering the goals of the UDP by permitting the sharing of personally&#xD;
      identifiable phenotypic and genotypic information within the network. By sharing participant&#xD;
      information and encouraging collaboration, the UDN hopes to improve the understanding of rare&#xD;
      conditions and advance the diagnostic process and care for individuals with undiagnosed&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
