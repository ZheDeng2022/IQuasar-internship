  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational registry to further characterize the safety profile of patients with&#xD;
      chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CP-CML), accelerated phase (AP-CML), blast&#xD;
      phase (BP-CML), or Ph+ALL treated with Iclusig (ponatinib) in routine clinical practice in&#xD;
      the US. The registry is focused on analysis of vascular occlusive events.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry is being conducted in an effort to better understand rates, risk factors, and&#xD;
      outcomes associated with vascular occlusive events in patients treated with Iclusig&#xD;
      (ponatinib) in real world settings. This registry study will collect information about&#xD;
      patient demographics, leukemia diagnosis, previous anti-cancer treatments, history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, risk factors for vascular complications, and concurrent medications&#xD;
      (including antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents).&#xD;
