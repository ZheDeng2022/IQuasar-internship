      Absorption and metabolism of carotenoids from two types of spinach preparations will be&#xD;
      investigated in two study groups, short bowel/ileostomy and healthy, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a randomised, controlled, 2-way crossover study in 24&#xD;
      participants (12 in each group), randomized to two sequences (1-2, 2-1) of interventions with&#xD;
      a more and a less bio-accessible spinach preparation. The serum, chylomicron and&#xD;
      fecal/effluent levels of lutein and beta-carotene will be determined.&#xD;

      Absorption and metabolism of carotenoids from two types of spinach preparations will be&#xD;
      investigated in two study groups, short bowel/ileostomy and healthy, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a randomised, controlled, 2-way crossover study. Twenty four&#xD;
      participants (12 in each group) will be randomized to two sequences (1-2, 2-1) of&#xD;
      interventions with a more and a less bio-accessible spinach preparation (differentiates only&#xD;
      on the basis of particle size).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention period is sub-divided into three parts: run-in period (48 hours) with a&#xD;
      standardized low-carotenoid diet, 0-24 hours (follow-up period 1 (FP1)) and 24 hours - 2&#xD;
      weeks (FP2). The intervention periods will be separated by a wash-out period of at least 14&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At start of each intervention, the intervention meal (breakfast) is served, followed by&#xD;
      standardized, carotenoid-free meals in the following 24 hours. Participants will in FP1 and&#xD;
      FP2 receive an intervention meal every second day. Participants will otherwise keep their&#xD;
      habitual diets during these follow-up periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants are asked to collect urine during 24 hours before and after the first&#xD;
      intervention meal in each period. They will also collect feces/ileostomy efflux for 24 hours&#xD;
      before and after initiation of the intervention for short bowel/ileostomy patients and for 48&#xD;
      periods in the healthy volunteers, respectively. Overnight-fasting serum samples are drawn at&#xD;
      day 1, 7 and 15 of each intervention period. On day 1 plasma samples are drawn at 0,1, 3, 4,&#xD;
      6, 7, 9 and 24 hours post first intervention meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma and effluent levels of lutein and beta-carotene will be determined and chylomicrons&#xD;
      are also separated from these samples for determination of carotenoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers also have their macula examined for density of the yellow spot before and after&#xD;
      the intervention. Plasma and effluent levels of other carotenoids as well as fat-soluble&#xD;
      vitamins are also determined. The samples will also be subjected to metabolic profiling for&#xD;
      further exploration and hypothesis generation.&#xD;
