  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and&#xD;
      everolimus work in treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer with tumors predicted&#xD;
      insensitive to standard chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pegylated liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Bevacizumab may stop or slow breast cancer by blocking the growth of new blood&#xD;
      vessels necessary for tumor growth. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pegylated liposomal doxorubicin together&#xD;
      with bevacizumab and everolimus may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine excellent clinical response rates (pathologic complete response [pCR]/residual&#xD;
      cancer burden [RCB]-0 or minimal residual disease [RCB-I]) in patients with&#xD;
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy insensitive, localized triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)&#xD;
      who receive 4 cycles of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, bevacizumab, and&#xD;
      everolimus (DAE) following anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine response rate after 4 cycles of DAE using radiographic imaging. II. Determine&#xD;
      toxicity associated 4 cycles of DAE in the neoadjuvant setting. III. Pathologic response&#xD;
      rates to 4 cycles of DAE in mesenchymal tumors versus (vs.) non-mesenchymal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Compare pathologic response rates in mesenchymal tumors to 4 cycles of DAE vs. 12 weeks of&#xD;
      weekly paclitaxel (using data collected from standard of care treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the correlation between vimentin expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and&#xD;
      the presence of mesenchymal gene signatures at the time of initial tumor biopsy prior to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the correlation between mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN or NF2 or PTEN loss by IHC&#xD;
      and the presence of mesenchymal gene signatures at the time of initial tumor biopsy prior to&#xD;
      NACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine rates of pCR in patients with mesenchymal tumors identified by gene signatures&#xD;
      and compare to pCR rates in non-mesenchymal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlate pathologic response with degree of vimentin expression as measured by IHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine rates of pCR in patients whose tumors contain mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN or NF2&#xD;
      or PTEN loss by IHC and compare to pCR rates in patients whose tumors lacks mutations in&#xD;
      these genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over about&#xD;
      3 hours on day 1, bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1, and everolimus orally (PO) once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will not receive bevacizumab during&#xD;
      cycle 4 of therapy. Patients then undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days of surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Potential biomarkers of response will be correlated with pathologic response to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, bevacizumab, and everolimus using appropriate statistical analyses for the biomarker of interest. For genomic mutations, multivariate logistic regression models will be fitted to the data that include three explanatory variables; namely dichotomous variables for treatment (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, bevacizumab, and everolimus versus paclitaxel), gene mutation, and the interaction. The interaction will be examined to investigate if excellent pathologic response (residual cancer burden-0 or 1) due to a therapy is associated with gene mutation status. Statistical significance will be defined as p &lt; 0.05.</description>
