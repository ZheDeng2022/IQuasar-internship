  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test how well Regorafenib controls disease progression in urothelial cancer&#xD;
      (cancer occurring in the urinary bladder, ureters, or renal pelvis) following previous&#xD;
      therapy with chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) has a poor long-term prognosis. The disease has not seen&#xD;
      improved outcomes despite research efforts in over two decades. Novel therapeutic options are&#xD;
      needed. Regorafenib is a novel oral multikinase inhibitor but is more potent than a similar&#xD;
      multikinase inhibitor drug that treats advanced renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. Regorafenib has been shown to have a broader capacity to inhibit blood supply to&#xD;
      tumor sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial evaluates a proof-of-concept using Regorafenib in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      progressive urothelial carcinoma following chemotherapy but still have a high level of&#xD;
      activity performance in their daily living. The initial dose of Regorafenib will be 120 mg&#xD;
      daily and then be escalated to 160 mg daily before gradually tapering.&#xD;
