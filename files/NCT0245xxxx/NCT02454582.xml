      SUMMARY AND AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proper management of brain oxygenation is an essential component of all anaesthesiologic&#xD;
      procedures. Nevertheless, the brain remains one of the least monitored organs in the&#xD;
      perioperative phase and intensive care therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INVOS Brain Oxymeter (IBO) is a reliable trend monitor for changes in regional cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation (rSO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a current assumption that rSO2 directly correlates with Sa02, which can be influenced&#xD;
      by different ventilation assistance systems, e.g. CPAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims at investigating changes of rSO2 in patients undergoing CPAP therapy for&#xD;
      max. 15 minutes, in order to evaluate the effect of CPAP on cerebral oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS measurement (with IBO) will be performed on the temporoparietal cortex on both sides of&#xD;
      the head. The trial will consist of two parts i.e. with or without ventilatory assistance.&#xD;
      The order of starting the study with or without CPAP therapy will be randomized. During each&#xD;
      part the measurements will be performed until reaching a steady state (no change in rSO2 ± 2%&#xD;
      for 3 min) but with a maximum duration of 15min. After each interval a BGA (blood gas&#xD;
      analysis) will be performed.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method for the measurement of blood flow&#xD;
      in tissues, first used for cerebral tissue oxygenation in 1977. 1 NIRS is a spectroscopic&#xD;
      technique, which uses electromagnetic waves (700-950nm), an emitter and a detector. In the&#xD;
      last 20 years there was an enormous development in the instrumentation and application of&#xD;
      NIRS. This technique now allows for measuring the oxygenation of the brain tissue. 2-13 The&#xD;
      INVOS Brain Oxymeter (IBO) is a reliable trend monitor for changes in regional cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation (rSO2) and correlates with the hemoglobin saturation in venous, capillary and&#xD;
      arterial blood, using an algorithm based upon the Beer-Lambert law. 4,14 The IBO system uses&#xD;
      light, with wavelengths between 730-810 nm, that penetrates layers of the human body, among&#xD;
      them the skin, the scull and the brain. It is either scattered within the tissue or absorbed&#xD;
      by present chromophores. In the rather transparent near infrared region, there are many&#xD;
      absorbing light chromophores, but only three are important as far as the oxygenation is&#xD;
      concerned, namely hemoglobin (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) and cytochrome oxidase (CtOx).&#xD;
      Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb light at different wavelengths, allowing a&#xD;
      differentiation of these two forms of hemoglobin.15 The sensors, (&quot;SomaSensors&quot;), are applied&#xD;
      to the patient's forehead with an integrated medical-grade adhesive.16 The method is applied&#xD;
      by using two source-detector distances in the sensor: a &quot;near&quot; one (shallow), 3 cm from the&#xD;
      source and a &quot;far&quot; one (deep), 4 cm from the source. Both samples penetrate the tissue&#xD;
      beneath the light source equally well, with the difference that the 4cm source-detector&#xD;
      measures signals deeper in the brain.8,17 The subtraction of the near sample from the far one&#xD;
      should leave a signal originating predominantly from the brain cortex. 16 The proper&#xD;
      management of brain oxygenation is an essential component of all anaesthesiologic procedures.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the brain remains one of the least monitored organs during the perioperative&#xD;
      phase and intensive care therapy. Up until now, the anaesthesiological application of NIRS as&#xD;
      a method for measuring the cerebral oxygenation has only been investigated in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery or cerebrovascular surgery, elderly patients undergoing major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery and neonatal infants. 18-21 These studies indicate that the measured&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation is affected by the relative proportion of blood in the arterial or&#xD;
      venous part of the capillary bed, the hemoglobin concentration and the systemic saturation in&#xD;
      addition to the cardiac output. The precise consequences of alterations in the systemic&#xD;
      saturation (SaO2) on the cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) remain unknown. It is a current&#xD;
      assumption that rSO2 is directly associated with Sa02, so that an increase of SaO2 also leads&#xD;
      to an increase of rSO2. The amount of oxygen in the arterial blood depends on the inspired&#xD;
      oxygen and the pulmonary gas exchange. These two parameters are primarily affected by the&#xD;
      individual's respiratory ventilation. Patients with chronic respiratory failure, or just a&#xD;
      temporary (acute) breathing deficiency (e.g. after general anesthesia), are routinely treated&#xD;
      with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. It is also commonly used in the&#xD;
      treatment of sleep apnea and in neonates (especially premature infants). In these patients&#xD;
      CPAP ventilation may prevent the need of tracheal (re-) intubation, or enable earlier&#xD;
      extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP therapy was developed by Dr. George Gregory and colleagues in the neonatal ICU at the&#xD;
      University of California, San Francisco in 1971 22, and then modified by Professor Colin&#xD;
      Sullivan at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia, in 1981. 23 Initially the CPAP&#xD;
      therapy was mainly used for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea at home. Nowadays it is&#xD;
      commonly applied in ICUs as a form of non-invasive mechanical ventilation. There it is&#xD;
      usually reserved for subgroups of patients where the oxygen treatment via a facemask is&#xD;
      insufficient. Patients on CPAP therapy are closely monitored in the ICU setting. The&#xD;
      treatment supports the patient's spontaneous breathing by building up a positive end&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEEP). The pressure required by most patients ranges between 5 and 12&#xD;
      cmH2O. The patient can individually determine his or her own respiratory frequency as well as&#xD;
      the depth of respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study goal is the investigation of the effect of CPAP therapy on rSO2 in relation&#xD;
      to the vital parameters, hemoglobin, SaO2 (analyzed by BGA) and SpO2. These combined&#xD;
      measurements can be used to further describe the effect of CPAP therapy on rSO2. So far, this&#xD;
      kind of study has not been performed on patients in the ICU. Therefore, this project aims at&#xD;
      gaining new insights into the influence of CPAP therapy on the cerebral saturation.&#xD;
      Additionally, differences in SaO2 and vital parameters will be correlated to the rSO2. Also&#xD;
      the occurrence of vomiting and nausea, headache and agitation during the CPAP therapy will be&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be measured, calculated and noted in the CRF (case report&#xD;
      form):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate (HR) and rhythm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rSO2 (left and right hemisphere)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BGA: arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BGA: pH, Electrolytes (Na, K, Ca), Glucose, Lactate, SaO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BGA: Hb, Hk, MetHb, CoHb, SO2, pCO2, BE, SBC&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Statistical methodology Randomized observational experimental single-center clinical&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired t-test, mean of difference: 5%, SD of difference: 10%; Effect size of 0.5; an error&#xD;
      probability two-sided: 0.05; Power: 0.9; total sample size: 50 patients. (5% drop-out rate&#xD;
      included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This randomized clinical study will include 50 subjects from 18 years onwards&#xD;
      undergoing treatment on an ICU of the Medical University of Vienna (13C1, 13C2, 13C3, 13B1,&#xD;
      13I1, 9D, E11 (Neurosurgical ICU), requiring intermittent CPAP therapy. Neither the&#xD;
      applicant, nor the clinical investigator will be involved in the decision about the&#xD;
      indication for CPAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki (1964), and good&#xD;
      clinical practice (GCP) guidelines, and the Equator network website recommendations including&#xD;
      current revisions. The study protocol will be submitted to the Ethics Committee of Medical&#xD;
      University of Vienna for ethical approval. The study will be registered with&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov. The participation in the clinical study will occur independently of the&#xD;
      medical indication for the patient's stay on the ICU. Before being admitted to the study, the&#xD;
      subject must have consented to participate, after the nature, scope and possible consequences&#xD;
      of the procedure have been explained in a form understandable to him or her. The patient must&#xD;
      give consent orally and in writing. The individual's consent will be confirmed with the&#xD;
      signature of the investigator. All subject names will be kept secret in the investigators'&#xD;
      files. Subjects will be identified by documentation and evaluation throughout the number&#xD;
      allotted to them during the study. The participants will be informed that the entire study&#xD;
      data will be stored and handled confidentially. A data protocol by means of a case report&#xD;
      form will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the trial is 30min. The study starts 15min before CPAP and ends when the&#xD;
      patient's rSO2 reaches a steady state (no change in rSO2 ± 2% for 3 min, maximal 15min) under&#xD;
      CPAP therapy. The participants are not required to participate in any follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out on patients with good access to the forehead. The NIRS&#xD;
      measurement (IBO) will be performed on the frontal cortex on both sides of the head. Emission&#xD;
      and detection probes have to be connected after wiping the patients forehead with a soft&#xD;
      cloth or cotton pad. During the whole investigation the SaO2, the blood pressure&#xD;
      (continuously invasive or non invasive in 3 minute-intervals) and the ECG will be recorded.&#xD;
      These vital signs are a part of the routine ICU monitoring. The trial will consist of two&#xD;
      parts i.e. with or without ventilatory assistance. The order of starting the study with or&#xD;
      without CPAP therapy will be randomized. During each part the measurements will be performed&#xD;
      until reaching a steady state (no change in rSO2 ± 2% for 3 min) but with a maximum duration&#xD;
      of 15min. The examination is safe, non-invasive, pain-free and can be carried out very&#xD;
      flexibly, quickly and cost efficiently by portable equipment. Data is collected from both the&#xD;
      right and left hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device system is to be used only in accordance with the approved investigational plan and&#xD;
      the CE-Certificate, on subjects who receive CPAP therapy and have signed an informed consent&#xD;
      form. The use of the device is limited to the approved study investigators. After each&#xD;
      examination interval a BGA will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason why this study is conducted on ICU patients is the following. Patients who suffer&#xD;
      from respiratory deficiencies and are in need of ventilatory assistance are rarely located on&#xD;
      normal hospital wards due to the fact that the installation of a ventilatory machine with&#xD;
      additional CPAP mode has to be performed by specialized personnel. In addition, these&#xD;
      patients require close monitoring, which can be guaranteed in an ICU setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women, as well as individuals with severe valvular or neurological diseases will not&#xD;
      be included in the observation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the indication for CPAP-therapy is verified and the in- and exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      checked, the patients will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided in two data collection parts, both taken in one session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 15min before CPAP:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  starting to collect data of either continuous arterial blood pressure measurement&#xD;
                (ABP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  or non invasive (NIBP) until end of study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  starting NIRS measurement on both brain hemispheres (INVOS 5100C) until procedure&#xD;
                is completed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  drawing an arterial our venous (according to available access) blood sample for a&#xD;
                blood gas analysis (BGA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 15min with CPAP:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  measurements performed in point 1. (ABP/NIBP, NIRS) will be continued&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  taking of another arterial our venous (according to available line) blood sample&#xD;
                for a BGA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of point 1. and 2. (without or with CPAP) will be randomized into group 1 and group&#xD;
      2 in the same patient.&#xD;
