      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the prevalence of CD in a cohort of men and women referred to fertility&#xD;
           treatment in Danish fertility clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare individuals diagnosed with CD to individuals without the disease to&#xD;
           investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  possible predictive symptoms of CD (fertility history, gastrointestinal symptoms,&#xD;
                co-morbidity)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  semen quality among men&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of a gluten free diet on semen quality (DNA fragmentation) in&#xD;
           men diagnosed with CD before and after 3 months treatment with a gluten free diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate correlation between sCD163 and histological changes in the small-bowel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the correlation between level of sCD163 and level of macrophages in&#xD;
           biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the performance of a rapid point-of-care serologic CD screening test in a&#xD;
           population of men and women referred to fertility treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesises of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD increases the risk of infertility in both men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predictive symptoms of CD can be identified and used to select future risk-groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Untreated CD in men has a negative effect on semen quality and semen quality improves by&#xD;
           treatment with a gluten free diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of sCD 163 correlates with degree of inflammatory lesions in the small-bowel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of sCD163 correlate with level of macrophages in the mucose-tissue of the&#xD;
           small-bowel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rapid point-of-care test is an efficient tool for CD case finding in an adult&#xD;
           population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study measuring the prevalence of Celiac disease in a population of couples&#xD;
      (men and women) referred to treatment in Danish fertility clinics. Analysis of data from&#xD;
      study questionnaires, serological tests, semen specimens and small-bowel biopsies will be&#xD;
      performed and one year follow-up on fertility treatment outcome of all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A realistic sample size to recruit in 2 years is 600 women and 600 men (600 heterosexual&#xD;
      couples) newly referred to two Danish public fertility clinics. Both the male and female part&#xD;
      will be asked to participate when they attend the clinic for pre-assessment. Patients with a&#xD;
      prior biopsy confirmed CD will not be screened, but will count in the prevalence result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving informed consent patients will be asked to answer a questionnaire about&#xD;
      gastrointestinal function (The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, GSRS (26)), fertility&#xD;
      history and co-morbidity (appendix I). The GSRS questionnaire is a validated,&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire that includes 15 questions, which assess severity of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms using a 7-point Likert scale in five domains: indigestion,&#xD;
      diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain and reflux. The severity of symptoms reported in the&#xD;
      GSRS increases with increasing score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After answering the questionnaire a blood sample will be drawn and send to the laboratory and&#xD;
      analysed for IgA Antitissue Transglutaminase (IgA TG ), total IgA and IgG Deamidated Gliadin&#xD;
      Peptid (DGP) if IgA deficit and sCD163. At the same time an in vitro rapid screening test for&#xD;
      CD will be performed (Simtomax®). Simtomax® will indicate CD and IgA deficiency (based on&#xD;
      Deamidated Gliadin Peptid and total IgA). The cut off value for CD positive tests and&#xD;
      referral to gastroscopy with small- bowl biopsy is IgA TG &gt; 7 kU/L and for the Simtomax® the&#xD;
      test results &quot;celiac positive IgA normal&quot; and &quot;celiac positive IgA deficient&quot; together with&#xD;
      clinical symptoms (questionnaire). For Total IgA cut off value is &lt; 0,80 g/L. Simtomax® has a&#xD;
      high negative predict value (&gt;90%) on CD. The cut off value for IgG DGP is &gt; 3 KU/L. One CD&#xD;
      positive test is enough for referral to small-bowel biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of sCD163 will be measured but level of sCD163 has no consequence for further referral&#xD;
      or diagnose of CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serological tests will be sent to Department of Biochemistry at Horsens Hospital, who is&#xD;
      responsible of handling all serological tests in this study. Serological material will be&#xD;
      destroyed immediately after analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up algorithm after serological tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients, who tests negative for CD in IgA TG, IgG DGP and Simtomax® will, by telephone&#xD;
           or consultation in the fertility clinic, be informed by the study nurse or doctor of the&#xD;
           results. Results will be available within 5 days. The patients will continue fertility&#xD;
           treatment as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If IgA TG or IgG DGP (or Simtomax® with clinical symptoms) exceeds the cut off value,&#xD;
           indicating CD, the patient will be contacted by the investigator and informed of the&#xD;
           results and invited to a consultation and gastroscopy by the responsible specialist&#xD;
           doctor at Department of Endoscopy, Horsens Hospital. The patient will receive verbal and&#xD;
           written information about preparation before gastroscopy and risk and complications of&#xD;
           the procedure and small-bowel biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biopsy material will be send to pathology analysis to determine histology classification&#xD;
      (Marsh-classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small-bowel biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies will be taken from the small-bowel (duodenum and duodenal bulb 5-6 biopsies). The&#xD;
      classic pathology changes of CD in the small-bowel are categorised by the &quot;Modified Marsh&#xD;
      criteria&quot; determining the histological changes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marsh stage 0: normal duodenal mucosa&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marsh stage 1: increased number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs), usually&#xD;
           exceeding 25 per 100 enterocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marsh stage 2: Stage 1 + crypt hyperplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marsh stage 3 (a,b,c): Increased IELs, crypt hyperplasia and partial, subtotal or total&#xD;
           villous atrophy A Marsh stage 3 (a,b,c) is the classic lesions of CD and confirms a&#xD;
           diagnose of CD. Stage 1 and 2 is indicating milder lesions of the small-bowel,&#xD;
           indicating CD. A Marsh 0 but positive serology are rare but may indicate latent CD.&#xD;
           Patients with a Marsh 0 classified biopsy will not be classified as having CD. Patients&#xD;
           with 1-3 (a,b,c) classified biopsy and elevated IgA TG or IgG DGP will in this study be&#xD;
           considered as having CD (27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of sCD163 will be compared with Marsh stage to determine if levels of sCD 163&#xD;
      correlate with the inflammatory lesion of the small-bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies will, after determination of Marsh stage, undergo coloring to identify macrophages.&#xD;
      Biopsies will be destroyed at study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up algorithm after biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be informed of the pathology answer by telephone by the responsible&#xD;
      specialist doctor and be offered follow-up according to this algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with positive serology but negative biopsy will be offered a consultation with&#xD;
           a specialist doctor at Horsens Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with biopsy confirmed CD will be offered consultation with a specialist doctor&#xD;
           and dietary counselling by a hospital dietician at Horsens Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a biopsy confirmed CD will be offered new consultation in the fertility&#xD;
           clinic planning their further fertility treatment (they are recommended a strict gluten&#xD;
           free diet of at least three months before fertility treatment take place (both male and&#xD;
           female patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a biopsy confirmed CD will be offered three month follow-up with a&#xD;
           specialist doctor at Horsens Hospital. Here the patient will be asked to answer the&#xD;
           second part of the questionnaire again, new serological tests (IgA TG, IgG DGP, sCD163)&#xD;
           and male patients to deliver a new semen specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semen specimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All male patients will as a routine procedure deliver semen specimens for semen quality&#xD;
      analysis (based on motility, morphology, semen concentration) at consultation in the&#xD;
      fertility clinics. This study uses the results from the routine semen quality analysis for&#xD;
      all male participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men with a biopsy confirmed CD will be asked to collect a semen specimen before starting on a&#xD;
      gluten free diet and to collect a semen specimen again after 3 months on a gluten free diet.&#xD;
      These semen specimens will be frozen and tested for chromatin fragmentation. The semen&#xD;
      quality is measured by the degree of chromatin fragmentation within the sperm cell using&#xD;
      Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay (SCSA). Semen quality is expressed in a DNA fragmentation&#xD;
      index, expressing the percent of damaged sperm. The before and after gluten free diet DNA&#xD;
      fragmentation index will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biobank for future research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study contains a biobank. Patients will be asked to give separate informed consent to&#xD;
      store blood material in a biobank for future research. If they consent, one extra glass of 10&#xD;
      ml full blood will be drawn at inclusion, and for patients diagnosed with CD also one extra&#xD;
      glass of 10 ml at 3 months follow-up. The Danish Data Protection Agency has given permission&#xD;
      to establish a biobank. The biobank is for future research and material can only be used with&#xD;
      new permission from a regional committee on health research ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analysed using STATA 13.To calculate sample size the formula n= Z2P(1-P)/d2&#xD;
      (24) is used: With a confidence interval (CI) of 95% (Z=1.96), precision of 1% (d=0.01) and&#xD;
      an expected prevalence for women of 2,5% (P=0.025), the minimum sample size required is 600&#xD;
      women. For men with P=0.01 and d=0.005 sample size =1521 with CI of 95%. With expected&#xD;
      prevalence for couples: (1-(0.975*0.99)) = 3.5% and d=0.0175, CI 95%, sample size = 420&#xD;
      couples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants included in this study could benefit directly from the study if they have an&#xD;
      undiagnosed CD. It is evident that an untreated CD in women can have negative consequences in&#xD;
      pregnancy. The risk of drawing blood is minimal. If blood tests are indicating CD the risk of&#xD;
      actually having CD is more than 50%. Undergoing small-bowel biopsy is unpleasant but not&#xD;
      painful. It is a standard procedure. Participants will be informed of risks before&#xD;
      consenting. Clinical advisor, senior consultant in gastroenterology Thomas Møller Jensen,&#xD;
      Horsens Hospital is responsible for the medical and clinical management and follow-up of&#xD;
      patients detected with CD positive serological test. The approval from the Regional Committee&#xD;
      on Health Research Ethics, Central Denmark and The Danish Data Protection Agency has been&#xD;
      obtained before study start. The study will be carried out in accordance with the Helsinki II&#xD;
      declaration and oral and written informed consent will be obtained from all patients&#xD;
      participating. Consent to store blood in a biobank for future research is given separately.&#xD;
      The processing of data is in accordance with the Danish regulation. All information will be&#xD;
      kept confidentially and locked up in the fertility clinics until data are collected by&#xD;
      investigator and then kept locked up (double lock) in the Department at Horsens Hospital. At&#xD;
      the end of the study all identifiable personal data will be concealed in a code only&#xD;
      accessible by investigator who is also responsible of the biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Department of Medicine, Horsens Hospital has taken initiative to this study. There is no&#xD;
      economical incentive related to this study for any of the project participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Simtomax® in vitro test will be funded by the pharmaceutical company Tillotts Pharma&#xD;
      (1200 tests). The agreement has been authorized through The Technology Transfer Office at&#xD;
      Aarhus University. A deficit guarantee on salary to investigator Louise Grode has been given&#xD;
      by Horsens Hospital before study start. All costs will be sought funded by private and public&#xD;
      funding. A research account administered by Horsens Hospital will hold any funding related to&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No payment is given to patients participating in the study.&#xD;
