      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Methylphenidate on neural activity&#xD;
      underlying inhibitory control and error monitoring in healthy adults. More specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to establish the baseline modulatory effect of Mehtlylphenidate on&#xD;
      bottom-up and top-down aspects of these cognitive processes. This work will further our&#xD;
      understanding of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Methylphenidate, and executive&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methylphenidate (MPH) is the stimulant medication most commonly used in the treatment of&#xD;
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). MPH suppresses the reuptake of dopamine by&#xD;
      blocking dopamine transporter, which is elevated in ADHD. However, the precise mechanism by&#xD;
      which suppressed dopamine transporter activity relieves ADHD symptoms is not fully&#xD;
      understood, partly because dopamine pathways are implicated in various processes that could&#xD;
      play a role in the deficits of ADHD and other disorders. MPH-induced dopamine variation has&#xD;
      extensive effects in the brain and influences various executive functions in unknown ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibitory Control: The investigators predict that MPH should increase the top-down activity&#xD;
      in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex associated with response restraint during go-phases&#xD;
      and bottom-up activity in caudate and right inferior frontal cortex associated with response&#xD;
      cancellation during successful stop trials. A greater modulation of top-down or bottom-up&#xD;
      activity would imply a selective effect of MPH on one pathway over the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Error Processing: The investigators predict that MPH should increase the intensity of&#xD;
      deactivation in the bottom-up dopamine pathway on error detection (substantia nigra, dorsal&#xD;
      striatum and ACC), and increase the intensity of deactivation in the top-down pathway on&#xD;
      post-error slowing (caudal OFC, ventral striatum, ventral substantia nigra). A greater&#xD;
      modulation of top-down or bottom-up activity would imply a selective effect of MPH on one&#xD;
      pathway over the other.&#xD;

    <description>oral dose of methylphenidate. The MPH dose was selected based on previous studies in healthy adults (Mehta et al., 2000; Volkow, Fowler, Wang, Ding, &amp; Gatley, 2002) and adults with ADHD (Aron et al., 2003). MPH reaches its peak plasma concentration 1-3 hours after an oral dose, and has a plasma half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours.</description>
