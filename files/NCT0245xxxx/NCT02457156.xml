  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different techniques of performing a pancreatic&#xD;
      anastomosis; Cattell-Warren versus Blumgart to determine if a Blumgart anastomosis reduces&#xD;
      pancreatic remnant leak, post-operative complications and overall length of hospital stay.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled, phase III, double blinded, multicentre clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing Cattell-Warren (CWA) versus. Blumgart (BA) methods of pancreaticojejunostomy&#xD;
      following pancreaticduodenectomy for supected malignancy of the pancreatic head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to establish if the Blumgart anastomosis reduces&#xD;
      pancreatic remnant leak and in turn complications, hospital stay, cost and promote enhanced&#xD;
      recorvery programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      506 patients (253 patients per treatment arm) will be recruited from approximately 7 centres&#xD;
      throughout the United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recommended for resection who provide written informed consent will be randomised to&#xD;
      one of the following treatment arms on the day of surgery by the surgeon:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Blumgart method of panreaticojejunostomy. Arm B: CattellWarren method pf&#xD;
      pancreaticojejunostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be undertaken intra-operatively, following pancreatic head excision, just&#xD;
      prior to pancreatic head remnant reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed post operatively on days 3 to 7 and on day of dishcharge from&#xD;
      hospital. Patients will continue to be followed up in the outpatient setting at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All laboratory and physical assessments performed will be in line standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for the translational study will be taken subject to informed consent&#xD;
      pre-operatively and post-operatively 5 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A histological (H&amp;E stained) slide of the pancreatic transection margin should be taken as&#xD;
      routine. This will be requested from each patient for central pathology review to assess the&#xD;
      amount of fibrosis.&#xD;
