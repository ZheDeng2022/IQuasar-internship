  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacogenetics is an area of Pharmacology that studies the contribution of genetic factors&#xD;
      to individual responses to drugs. This branch of science involves the variability in&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics through the study of polymorphisms in genes encoding&#xD;
      receptors, as well as in drug metabolism, where this area of Pharmacology has been growing&#xD;
      and achieving its first results with clinical use. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      (NSAIDS) are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) family, predominantly CYP2C9. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the different gene haplotypes for the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      piroxicam after third lower molar surgery for pain, edema and trismus, adverse reactions,&#xD;
      need of rescue medication, patient satisfaction regarding the drug and the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of the drug between the different gene haplotypes for CYP2C9 that are found in this&#xD;
      population. Therefore, 60 patients will be genotyped and phenotyped for this gene and their&#xD;
      postoperative data will be confronted with the data found in the Brazilian population. For&#xD;
      the analysis of the proposed gene, saliva will be collected and serve as a source of genomic&#xD;
      DNA. For the molecular analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with tests validated and&#xD;
      produced by Applied Biosystems® will be performed. For the pharmacokinetics, saliva samples&#xD;
      will be collected at various times according to protocols available in the literature, and&#xD;
      piroxicam concentrations in the samples will be measured by high pressure liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS). The analysis of&#xD;
      the results will be described with a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;

      Lower third molars (with high degree of difficulty) surgeries will be performed in Clinical&#xD;
      Pharmacology Laboratory at the Bauru School of Dentistry - University of São Paulo (FOB-USP),&#xD;
      which will be provided to patients daily doses of piroxicam 20 mg 4 days. Thus collect data&#xD;
      related to pain, swelling, trismus, amount of rescue medication required by patients, overall&#xD;
      assessment and satisfaction about taking medicine, saliva samples for the analysis of the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of the drug, genotyping and phenotyping of the subjects of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global clinical evaluation along with genotyping and phenotyping these individuals can&#xD;
      show us if there is an influence not only in adverse effects, but also in the therapeutic&#xD;
      effects of the drug in the Brazilian population. Research of this nature are rare in this&#xD;
      area of Clinical Pharmacogenetics and can be of great help in prescribing these drugs to&#xD;
      control pain and inflammation.After the removal of third molars will make collecting 6 mL of&#xD;
      saliva in several post-surgical moments for analysis of the pharmacokinetics of the drug&#xD;
      piroxicam and 10 mL of saliva for the analysis of genetic material. It is noteworthy that&#xD;
      this project will initiate the nucleation of a new line of research in college, the first in&#xD;
      Pharmacogenetics area conducted in FOB / USP.Will be assessed the following parameters in all&#xD;
      patients after surgery of at least a third lower molar with a high degree of difficulty&#xD;
      (Annexes 1, 2 and 3): 1) onset and duration of surgery after the administration of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic, 2) open mouth prior to surgery, on the 2nd day after the surgery and on the 7th&#xD;
      day after surgery (removal of stitches); 3) measured the facial edema in the second day after&#xD;
      surgery and on the 7th day after surgery (compared to the measurements obtained before&#xD;
      surgery); 4) body temperature before surgery, on the 2nd day after the operation and on the&#xD;
      7th day after surgery (removal of stitches); 5) incidence, type and severity of adverse&#xD;
      reactions, 6) plug pain (VAS - visual analog scale) filled by patients for 4 days after&#xD;
      prescription Piroxicam; 7) amount of rescue medication required by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparative analysis of the data, along with data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug,&#xD;
      genotyping and phenotyping the CYP2C9 gene, provide the basis for evaluation of the influence&#xD;
      of the gene in clinical efficacy, side effects and need for relief medication required by&#xD;
      patients after surgery third- molars with a high degree of difficulty, which was prescribed&#xD;
      as anti-inflammatory piroxicam.&#xD;
