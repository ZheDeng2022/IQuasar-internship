  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether the investigators&#xD;
      modernized IMPACT intervention for depression (eIMPACT), delivered before the onset of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), reduces the risk of future CVD. Participants will be primary&#xD;
      care patients who are depressed but do not have a history of CVD. Half of the participants&#xD;
      will receive standard depression treatment in primary care (usual care), and the other half&#xD;
      will receive one year of eIMPACT, a collaborative stepped care program including&#xD;
      antidepressants and computerized and telephonic cognitive-behavioral therapy. To evaluate&#xD;
      change in CVD risk, the investigators will measure artery function using ultrasound before&#xD;
      and after the 1-year treatment period. It is hypothesized that patients who receive the&#xD;
      eIMPACT intervention will have greater improvements in artery function than patients who&#xD;
      receive usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of American men and women, and its&#xD;
      economic burden is substantial and on the rise. Adults with depression are at elevated risk&#xD;
      of CVD events and poor CVD prognosis. Unfortunately, past trials of depression treatments&#xD;
      have not observed the anticipated cardiovascular benefits. A novel explanation for these null&#xD;
      results is that the interventions in these trials, which all involved patients with&#xD;
      preexisting CVD, were delivered too late in the natural history of CVD. To begin to evaluate&#xD;
      our hypothesis that treating depression before clinical CVD onset could reduce CVD risk, the&#xD;
      investigators are conducting a phase II randomized controlled trial of 216 primary care&#xD;
      patients aged â‰¥ 50 years with a depressive disorder and CVD risk factors but no clinical CVD.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one year of eIMPACT, our modernized IMPACT intervention, or&#xD;
      usual primary care for depression. eIMPACT is a collaborative stepped care intervention&#xD;
      involving a multidisciplinary team delivering evidenced-based depression treatments&#xD;
      consistent with patient preference. The investigator shave modernized our intervention by&#xD;
      incorporating computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy and delivering other treatment&#xD;
      components via telephone. Our central hypothesis is that eIMPACT will improve endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, which is considered a barometer of CVD risk, in depressed adults by decreasing&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and platelet activation.&#xD;
      The investigators will test our central hypothesis by carrying out these specific aims: (1)&#xD;
      to determine whether eIMPACT reduces the excess CVD risk of depressed patients (primary&#xD;
      outcome: endothelial dysfunction; exploratory outcome: incident CVD events) and (2) to&#xD;
      examine candidate mechanisms underlying the effect of eIMPACT on CVD risk (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes: depressive symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and platelet&#xD;
      activation). A positive trial would generate the mechanistic rationale, efficacy evidence,&#xD;
      and effect size estimates needed to justify and design a multisite, event-driven, phase III&#xD;
      trial to confirm eIMPACT's efficacy in reducing CVD risk. Demonstrating that depression&#xD;
      treatment reduces CVD risk, the primary expected outcome of this line of research, would have&#xD;
      a substantial positive impact. It would identify a novel target (depression) for CVD&#xD;
      prevention efforts, and it would equip providers with a new disseminable and scalable tool&#xD;
      (eIMPACT) to simultaneously treat depression and manage the CVD risk of a large cohort of&#xD;
      high-risk patients. Collectively, these changes to clinical practice should translate into&#xD;
      reduced CVD morbidity, mortality, and costs.&#xD;

    <description>Patients undergo ultrasound assessment of brachial FMD in accordance with established guidelines. After a 10-minute supine rest, high-resolution baseline images of the brachial artery will be obtained from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles. Next, the forearm cuff will be inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes and then will be rapidly deflated. At 60 and 90 seconds post-deflation, images from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles will be acquired. FMD values will be computed as the % change (positive values=increase; negative values=decrease) in brachial diameter at either 60 or 90 seconds after cuff deflation.</description>

It is a collaborative care intervention in which a multidisciplinary team delivers established depression treatments consistent with patient preference. It uses a stepped, flexible, treat-to-target approach that modernizes the IMPACT intervention by harnessing technology to minimize staff and space requirements. Interventions are Beating the Blues, Problem Solving Treatment in Primary Care, and select FDA-approved antidepressants. The treatment team consists of a depression clinical specialist, a supervising MD with expertise in primary care and IMPACT, and the patients' primary care providers.</description>

    <description>BTB is a widely used, empirically supported, stand-alone CBT program for depression designed for primary care patients and appropriate for adults with little computer experience and a 5th-6th grade reading level. BtB utilizes an interactive, multimedia format to deliver eight 50-minute, weekly therapy sessions. Although sessions are tailored to each patient's problems, general topics include challenging dysfunctional thoughts, activity scheduling, problem solving, graded exposure, task breakdown, sleep management, and relapse prevention. Patients are also assigned tailored homeworks that are customized to their needs and reviewed at the start of each session.</description>

    <description>The IMPACT treatment manual provides guidelines for using antidepressants, such as selecting a medication, titrating, switching to another medication, managing side effects, and avoiding drug interactions. To optimize eIMPACT for CVD risk reduction, we have restricted the IMPACT list of antidepressants to SSRIs (sertraline, escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram), duloxetine, bupropion, and mirtazapine. These medications are FDA approved for the treatment of depression and are the safest from a cardiovascular perspective.</description>

This letter also provides a list of local mental health services.

          <description>Patients undergo ultrasound assessment of brachial FMD in accordance with established guidelines. After a 10-minute supine rest, high-resolution baseline images of the brachial artery will be obtained from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles. Next, the forearm cuff will be inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes and then will be rapidly deflated. At 60 and 90 seconds post-deflation, images from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles will be acquired. FMD values will be computed as the % change (positive values=increase; negative values=decrease) in brachial diameter at either 60 or 90 seconds after cuff deflation.</description>

It is a collaborative care intervention in which a multidisciplinary team delivers established depression treatments consistent with patient preference. It uses a stepped, flexible, treat-to-target approach that modernizes the IMPACT intervention by harnessing technology to minimize staff and space requirements. Interventions are Beating the Blues, Problem Solving Treatment in Primary Care, and select FDA-approved antidepressants. The treatment team consists of a depression clinical specialist, a supervising MD with expertise in primary care and IMPACT, and the patients' primary care providers.</description>

      <time_frame>For each participant, adverse event monitoring occurred from each participant's randomization date until 9/1/20 (the date of the last EHR for all randomized participants). Thus, the adverse event monitoring period varied across participants but averaged 3.5 years.</time_frame>
      <desc>Potential adverse events are identified by conducting EHR searches every 6 months and by reviewing self-report adverse event questionnaires from mid-treatment, post-treatment, and the annual follow-up calls. We investigate, rate, and write up all events plausibly related to depression, depression treatment, suicidal ideation, or any study procedures. We adjudicate all deaths. For all other captured events, we provide counts and will investigate further if there is evidence of group imbalance.</desc>
