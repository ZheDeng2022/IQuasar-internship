    <textblock>
      Breathlessness, the sensation of breathing discomfort, is a major problem in people with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Breathlessness that persists despite optimal&#xD;
      management of the underlying disease(s) is said to be refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests that a small, regular dose of morphine helps to reduce safely&#xD;
      the sensation of breathlessness. However, this research on morphine for breathlessness has&#xD;
      not defined the best way to adjust the dose of the medication, or refined which people are&#xD;
      most likely to have benefit, no response or side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind phase III trial in people with COPD and significant&#xD;
      refractory breathlessness, which will explore several important questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are regular, low dose opioids (morphine) at four possible doses over 3 weeks more&#xD;
           effective than placebo medication (containing no active ingredient) at improving&#xD;
           breathlessness?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the medication have any effect on daily activity, breathlessness, and quality of&#xD;
           life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the common side effects of this intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the benefit from the drug outweigh the side effects it produces?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there specific characteristics of people who are more likely to receive benefit from&#xD;
           sustained release morphine?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated to receive three weeks of morphine sulfate (and laxative,&#xD;
      docusate with senna), or placebo (and placebo laxative). The dose of morphine may be&#xD;
      increased each week for weeks two and three. All medicines will appear the same (blinded) and&#xD;
      neither the doctor nor the participant will know which medication the participant is&#xD;
      receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical interview, physical examination to collect some general&#xD;
      health information, and baseline measurements including; daily activity, symptoms, and&#xD;
      quality of life. A small amount of blood may be required to check eligibility. Further blood&#xD;
      samples may be taken at week 1 and 3 to enable testing on how individuals respond to opioids,&#xD;
      further consent will be obtained for these samples. Data on benefits, side effects, and&#xD;
      medical care will be collected during comprehensive weekly visits. Participants will also&#xD;
      fill out a simple diary twice daily for weeks one to three of the study, and for one day each&#xD;
      week during an optional 3 month extension stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of this study may enable better management of symptoms and activity in people&#xD;
      COPD with medicines that are shown to be effective and safe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Three hundred thousand (300,000) Australians are breathless at rest or on minimal&#xD;
      exertion, often for years, despite optimal treatment of the underlying cause(s). This&#xD;
      includes more than 70,000 people who are too breathless to leave their homes often for long&#xD;
      periods of time. Underlying causes for such severe and ongoing breathlessness include chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, heart failure,&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases such as motor neurone disease and cachexia from any cause. The&#xD;
      prevalence of chronic refractory breathlessness will continue to increase as the population&#xD;
      ages because the chronic progressive diseases where breathlessness is common are increasing&#xD;
      in prevalence. Nearly one half of all people experience distressing breathlessness during the&#xD;
      last year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Thoracic Society defines breathlessness as &quot;a subjective experience of breathing&#xD;
      discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity&quot;. The&#xD;
      term 'dyspnoea' is used interchangeably with breathlessness, shortness of breath, breathing&#xD;
      difficulty and laboured breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internationally, no medication is registered for the symptomatic reduction of chronic&#xD;
      refractory breathlessness despite recommendations from the American Thoracic Society, the&#xD;
      American College of Physicians, the Canadian Thoracic Society and the American College of&#xD;
      Chest Physicians that regular, low-dose morphine is the evidence-based pharmaceutical option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To enhance the evidence base for the pharmacological treatment of chronic refractory&#xD;
      breathlessness using potential therapies compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To compare the difference of the net clinical effect (benefits and side&#xD;
      effects) on chronic refractory breathlessness in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) taking once daily, sustained release morphine at two different doses when&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are regular, low dose oral opioids safe, including when the dose is titrated upwards, in&#xD;
           a population of people with refractory breathlessness and COPD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do people whose breathlessness is helped by regular, low dose oral morphine get&#xD;
           additional benefit by further increasing the dose of morphine?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Over what period of time does benefit continue to increase once a dose level with&#xD;
           benefit is achieved?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What percentage of people derive clinically significant benefit at each of four dosing&#xD;
           levels over and above placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At the lower doses, is there evidence that any benefit does not last the full 24 hours?&#xD;
           (end-of-dose failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Can we predict response, benefit and side effects from baseline demographic and clinical&#xD;
           data&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Does the treatment of breathlessness with regular, low dose morphine have any effect on&#xD;
           general health status and quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Determine if there is a change in activities of daily living in those treated with&#xD;
           opioids when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Assess any effects of each treatment on anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Understand the longer term benefits and side effects from sustained release morphine in&#xD;
           people with COPD when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Do participants, while still blinded, have any preference at the end of the three week&#xD;
           study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters that may help to predict which&#xD;
           individuals will achieve the greatest benefit in week one of therapy (8mg/day,&#xD;
           16mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify pharmacogenomic variations in opioid receptors and signaling that may help to&#xD;
           predict clinical response (benefit, side effects or no response).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study the effect on sleep in people participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare the within trial incremental cost and cost effectiveness of the therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate any changes in total testosterone from baseline to the end of the three month&#xD;
           extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: In people who have COPD with refractory breathlessness, there is no&#xD;
      difference in breathlessness intensity with the addition of regular, low dose oral sustained&#xD;
      release morphine when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: The addition of regular, low dose oral sustained release morphine&#xD;
      reduces the intensity of breathlessness in people with COPD and that this occurs safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A five stage, national, multi-site, double-blind, parallel arm, block randomised, placebo&#xD;
      controlled factorial (dose increment) phase III study of opioids for chronic refractory&#xD;
      breathlessness in people with COPD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 0 - baseline (2 days); Stage 1 - randomisation #1 (1 week); Stage 2 - randomisation #2&#xD;
      (1 week); Stage 3 - randomisation #3 (1 week); and Stage 4 - an optional blinded extension&#xD;
      arm (up to 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 0. Baseline assessment: All consenting participants will complete 2 full days of&#xD;
      baseline diary (morning and evening) in order to become accustomed to completing the diary&#xD;
      regularly and to provide stable baseline data regarding breathlessness, symptoms and function&#xD;
      (as measured by activPALR actigraphy). At completion of the 2 days, the participant will be&#xD;
      reviewed, complete the remaining baseline assessments (questionnaires, measures and baseline&#xD;
      safety data), and will then be eligible to be randomised the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: Two full days (4 diary entries)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1. Randomisation #1: Randomisation to mane orally: placebo OR 8mg KapanolR OR 16mg&#xD;
      KapanolR. Twice daily diary. Participants randomised to KapanolR will also receive blinded&#xD;
      docusate with sennosides, while those randomised to placebo will receive identical placebo.&#xD;
      This is the primary outcome (end point) of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2. Randomisation #2: While continuing the arm assigned in Stage 1, add a randomisation&#xD;
      to mane orally: placebo OR 8mg KapanolR. Twice daily diary. Participants who were randomised&#xD;
      to placebo in Stage 1 and KapanolR in Stage 2 will have blinded docusate with sennosides&#xD;
      replace placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3. Randomisation #3: While continuing the arm assigned in Stages 1 and 2, add a third&#xD;
      randomisation to mane orally: placebo OR 8mg KapanolR. Twice daily diary. activPALR&#xD;
      accelerometer worn this week. Participants who were randomised to placebo in Stages 1 and 2&#xD;
      and KapanolR in Stage 3 will have blinded docusate with sennosides replace placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4. Extension (optional for each individual participant): Continue double blind&#xD;
      medications from Stages 1, 2 and 3 for up to three months. Diary one day each week. A blood&#xD;
      test at the end of the three months will be taken for total testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: up to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: This study is for people with optimally treated people with mild, moderate&#xD;
      or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome and its assessment: Change from baseline average intensity of breathlessness&#xD;
      over the previous 24 hours, measured each morning on a 11 point numerical rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The study will answer several practical questions including whether opioids&#xD;
      have a net benefit in people with COPD in reducing refractory breathlessness, whether dose&#xD;
      increases beyond initial response provide a greater net benefit, the pattern of symptomatic&#xD;
      response in the days after successful titration, and the proportion of people who derive a&#xD;
      clinically meaningful symptomatic benefit at each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan: All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. All analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted with Stata version 13.1. Missing data will be imputed using multiple&#xD;
      imputation with 50 resamples drawn. The primary comparisons on which the study is powered are&#xD;
      at the end of week 1: placebo compared to 8mg KapanolR daily; and placebo compared to 16mg&#xD;
      KapanolR daily. Change in breathlessness in the first week between these groups will be&#xD;
      evaluated using a random effects mixed model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations: All calculations assume Type I (familywise error rate (FWER)) error&#xD;
      rate of 5% and Type II error rate of 20% (power of 80%) respectively. In order to account for&#xD;
      attrition of 20% by the end of week 1, the study will recruit 144*100/ (100-20) = 180&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
