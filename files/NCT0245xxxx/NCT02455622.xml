      This long-term study will provide Elaprase treatment to children enrolled in this study and&#xD;
      will utilize data from both enrolled patients and Hunter Outcome Survey (HOS) patient&#xD;
      registry data to conduct the primary growth analysis to assess changes in height and weight&#xD;
      in patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter syndrome) MPS II.&#xD;
