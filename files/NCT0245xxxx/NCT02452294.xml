             for 16 weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a child in&#xD;
             this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm. A condom&#xD;
             is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the&#xD;
             drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and&#xD;
             through at least 4 weeks after the final dose of study treatment c. Highly effective&#xD;
             contraception is defined as either: i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the&#xD;
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
             ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception].&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case&#xD;
        of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
        follow up hormone level assessment iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate&#xD;
        post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study&#xD;
        subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient] iv.&#xD;
        Use a combination of the following (both a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/ film/ cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not&#xD;
             allowed as buparlisib decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
        (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For women with therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH&#xD;
        and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH)&#xD;
        agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian&#xD;
        suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        18. Patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (glycosolated hemoglobin &gt; 8%) or&#xD;
        poorly controlled steroid-induced diabetes mellitus (glycosolated hemoglobin &gt; 8%)&#xD;
