  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease, which affects an estimated 300,000 people in Ireland and over 50&#xD;
      million people in the developed world, is responsible for a considerable burden of premature&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. All patients with chronic kidney disease are recommended low salt&#xD;
      diets, i.e. less than a teaspoon of salt per day (which is &lt;5-6g of salt, which contains&#xD;
      &lt;2-2.3g of sodium). The average intake in the general population is double the recommended&#xD;
      intake, between 1-2 teaspoons per day, which is considered 'moderate' intake. In patients&#xD;
      with hypertension, reducing from moderate (average) to low intake is associated with a small&#xD;
      reduction in blood pressure. However, achieving this low target salt intake is difficult, and&#xD;
      can have a negative knock-on effect on other healthy dietary factors and kidney hormones. In&#xD;
      addition, there is no convincing research to show that patients with chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      and normal blood pressure benefit from low salt intake. In fact, the small amount of research&#xD;
      that does exist shows that the change in kidney function is the same in people who consume&#xD;
      low salt diets (&lt;1 teaspoon) and moderate (1-2 teaspoons=average intake) salt diets.&#xD;
      Moreover, there are some small studies that report that low-salt diets may increase the risk&#xD;
      of death due to heart disease. Given that all patients with chronic kidney impairment are&#xD;
      recommended a low-salt diet, it is important that we confirm that this recommendation truly&#xD;
      benefits patients. In this randomized controlled trial, we hope to determine whether&#xD;
      recommending a low salt intake, compared to average/moderate intake, is associated with a&#xD;
      slower rate of decline in kidney function in patients with chronic kidney impairment. The&#xD;
      results of this study will provide information to guide future research that will have&#xD;
      critical implications for management of patients with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
