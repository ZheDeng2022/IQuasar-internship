  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness of a permanent synthetic&#xD;
      mesh versus a biologic prosthesis for the repair of ventral hernias in the setting of&#xD;
      clean-contaminated (Class 2) or contaminated (Class 3) surgical procedures. The findings of&#xD;
      this study will have a major impact on the field of hernia surgery as it will provide&#xD;
      objective guide to mesh selection, optimize surgical approaches for complex ventral hernia&#xD;
      repair, and ultimately significantly improve patient outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing 253&#xD;
      patients with clean-contaminated (Class 2)or contaminated (Class3) abdominal wall ventral&#xD;
      hernias undergoing single staged repair. Soft Mesh by CR Bard, a macroporous monofilament&#xD;
      polypropylene permanent mesh will be compared to Strattice mesh by Lifecell, a non-cross&#xD;
      linked porcine dermal biologic graft for the single stage open reconstruction of&#xD;
      clean-contaminated and contaminated abdominal wall defects. The primary outcome variable will&#xD;
      be the absence of surgical site occurence requiring procedural intervention and the absence&#xD;
      of a hernia recurrence from the time of surgery up to 24 months of postoperative follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing open ventral hernia repair for clean-contamination and contaminated&#xD;
      abdominal wall hernias meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive a synthetic&#xD;
      mesh or a biologic mesh. Randomization will be carried out using computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization blocks at the time of enrollment. Stratified randomized will be used with the&#xD;
      strata formulated by medical center then by clean-contaminated or contaminated surgical site&#xD;
      class. The Investigator will be blinded to patient randomization assignment until the point&#xD;
      of intra-operative device use following final CDC wound classification, whereas patients and&#xD;
      co-investigators responsible for data analysis will remain blinded to patient randomization&#xD;
      until the conclusion of the study period. As such, a double-blinded study protocol will be&#xD;
      maintained. Patients randomized to synthetic mesh will receive SoftMesh™ (CR Bard, Murray&#xD;
      Hill, NJ) and those patients randomized to biologic mesh will receive Strattice™ (Lifecell,&#xD;
      Branchburg NJ). The use of biologic and synthetic mesh in contaminated fields is considered&#xD;
      experimental however the selection of these prosthetics was based on a careful review of the&#xD;
      multiple animal models, preclinical data, and our own clinical experience with each of these&#xD;
      materials placed in both clean and contaminated abdominal wall reconstructions. Surgical&#xD;
      wounds will be classified based on CDC(Centers for Disease Control) criteria and only Class 2&#xD;
      and 3 wounds will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively patients will be evaluated for signs and symptoms of complications along with&#xD;
      presence or absence of Surgical Site Infections per CDC guidelines, presence or absence of&#xD;
      surgical site occurrences (SSOs) and any procedural interventions required to treat these&#xD;
      SSOs, presence or absence of hernia recurrence and any reoperations, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      discharge date, time to return of bowel function and any readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active participation in this study will last for 24 months and will involve one preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation visit, one operative procedure visit, and 4 follow up visits. Participants will&#xD;
      complete two brief survey questionnaires regarding quality of life, activities and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second outcome will be to demonstrate that a macroporous light-weight polypropylene mesh&#xD;
      is more cost effective strategy than a biologic prosthetic in clean-contaminated and&#xD;
      contaminated abdominal wall reconstruction&#xD;
