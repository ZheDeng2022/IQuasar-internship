      The studies proposed in this protocol aim to explore the anxiolytic properties of floating as&#xD;
      it relates to the central and autonomic nervous system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human brain is constantly bombarded with sensory information from the external world.&#xD;
      This series of studies aim to explore the effects of reducing environmental stimulation using&#xD;
      specially designed floatation pools that minimize visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive,&#xD;
      and thermal input to the brain. Previous research has shown that &quot;floating&quot; in this unique&#xD;
      setting can significantly reduce levels of anxiety, stress, blood pressure, and cortisol,&#xD;
      while significantly increasing levels of both subjective and physiological forms of&#xD;
      relaxation. Much of this past research contained various methodological weaknesses, including&#xD;
      small sample sizes, lack of a control group, and no longitudinal follow-up. Moreover, very&#xD;
      little is known about the potential benefits of floating in clinical populations, and&#xD;
      essentially nothing is known about the effects of floating on the brain. The studies proposed&#xD;
      in this protocol aim to further explore floating's potentially salubrious effect on the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system, while beginning to investigate its largely unknown effect on the&#xD;
      central nervous system. The researchers have attempted to improve upon the weaknesses of past&#xD;
      research by using larger sample sizes, a control group, and a longitudinal design. The&#xD;
      current project is focused on documenting the subjective, behavioral, physiological and&#xD;
      neural effects of floating in healthy and anxious populations. The subjective effects of&#xD;
      floating will be examined using self-report measures and the experience sampling method. The&#xD;
      behavioral effects of floating will be examined using measures of interoceptive awareness and&#xD;
      distress tolerance. The physiological effects of floating will be examined using waterproof&#xD;
      and wireless tracking of blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, and movement, in addition&#xD;
      to collecting measures of cortisol and magnesium. A portable electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
      system will be used to measure sleep during the nights before and after a float experience.&#xD;
      The neural effects of floating will be examined using waterproof and wireless EEG collected&#xD;
      during the float experience, as well as using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      collected before and immediately after floating. Using a longitudinal within-subject design,&#xD;
      the researchers have a unique opportunity to assess not only functional brain changes, but&#xD;
      also structural brain changes induced by repeated exposures to floating. An active control&#xD;
      condition aims to control for the effects of simple relaxation by collecting all of the same&#xD;
      measures while participants lay supine in a zero-gravity chair situated in a quiet, dimly lit&#xD;
      room. This program of research constitutes the first systematic investigation of floating on&#xD;
      the body and the brain, and the findings have the potential to illuminate the physiological&#xD;
      and neural correlates of the deep relaxation induced by the floating experience.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must be between 18-55 years of age, free of any current or past&#xD;
             neurological or psychiatric illness, and capable of performing all tasks during each&#xD;
