  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an HIV prevention intervention&#xD;
      called Project AIM (Adult Identity Mentoring) to delay onset of sexual activity and reduce&#xD;
      sexual risk behaviors among students (approximate ages 12- 17 years) in junior secondary&#xD;
      schools (Form 1 - 3) in Eastern Botswana.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few behavioral intervention models exist that focus on pre-sexually active adolescents in&#xD;
      high-prevalence environments. As a result, there is a paucity of scientific research on HIV&#xD;
      education models that impact risk factors among pre-sexual adolescents or that address the&#xD;
      underlying causes and contextual factors associated with the sexual risk behaviors that leave&#xD;
      adolescents vulnerable to HIV infection. Project AIM (Adult Identity Mentoring) is an&#xD;
      evidence-based youth development HIV prevention intervention designed for youth ages 11-14&#xD;
      years. The goals of Project AIM are to provide youth with the motivation to enact safe&#xD;
      choices and to address social barriers to sexual risk prevention such as hopelessness, peer&#xD;
      pressure, and risk opportunities in low income environments. Results of a United States&#xD;
      (U.S.)-based behavioral study have demonstrated a positive effect in reducing sexual&#xD;
      intentions and increasing sexual abstinence. Project AIM has not previously been evaluated&#xD;
      for use in an African context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this 50 site, stratified, cluster, randomized control trial is to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy of Project AIM to delay onset of sexual activity and reduce sexual risk behaviors&#xD;
      among students (approximate ages 12- 17 years) in junior secondary schools (JSS) in Eastern&#xD;
      Botswana.The study will involve enrolling a longitudinal cohort consisting of Form 1 students&#xD;
      who will be randomized to either the intervention (Project AIM) or control condition and&#xD;
      followed from the start of the Form 1 year to the end of the Form 3 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed through participant self-report of sexual risk behavior and HSV-2&#xD;
      testing as a biomarker of self-reported sexual activity. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      behavioral survey three times (baseline, 12 months, and 24 months) and HSV-2 testing two&#xD;
      times (baseline and 24 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective implementation of Project AIM as part of the school health curriculum in Botswana&#xD;
      would provide an evidence-based, in-school program option to aid and inform HIV prevention&#xD;
      efforts for young adolescents across southern Africa. Implementation of the program will also&#xD;
      build on existing programmatic efforts and infrastructure and attempt to demonstrate how the&#xD;
      addition of an evidence-based, multi-component HIV prevention program will strengthen current&#xD;
      youth HIV prevention policies and programming. In addition, rates of herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      type 2 (HSV-2) from the study will provide the region with sexual risk behavior data and&#xD;
      HSV-2 prevalence estimates for young adolescents in Eastern Botswana, which can inform public&#xD;
      health recommendations as well as national policies for sexual/reproductive health and&#xD;
      education among this population.&#xD;
