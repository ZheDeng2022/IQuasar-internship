    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of afatinib dimaleate when given&#xD;
      together with capecitabine in treating patients with solid tumors, pancreatic cancer, or&#xD;
      biliary cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or&#xD;
      controlled with treatment and has not responded to previous treatment. Afatinib dimaleate may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them&#xD;
      from spreading. Giving afatinib dimaleate together with capecitabine may be a better&#xD;
      treatment for solid tumors, pancreatic cancer, or biliary cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of afatinib dimaleate (afatinib) in combination with capecitabine in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors (phase I) and pancreatico-biliary cancers (phase Ib). (Phase I/Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate biomarkers of response from tumor biopsies, including markers related to the&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#xD;
      pathways via OncoPlex or other equivalent gene sequencing assay. (Phase I/Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate rates of response and stable disease, duration of response, time to progression,&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival. (Phase I/Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of afatinib dimaleate followed by a phase&#xD;
      Ib study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and capecitabine&#xD;
      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.&#xD;
