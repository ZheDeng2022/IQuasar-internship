  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the efficacy of Roflumilast in addition to LAMA/LABA therapy will be assessed&#xD;
      using Functional Respiratory Imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 40 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, Global Initiative for&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages C and D, who are stable on LABA/LAMA therapy&#xD;
      and who are prone to dynamics hyperinflation will be included in this study. To indicate the&#xD;
      susceptibility to dynamics hyperinflation patients should have a baseline Borg Fatigue score&#xD;
      after the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) above 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized in such a way that 1 out of 2 patients will receive placebo&#xD;
      and 1 the active component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image parameters will be assessed and the correlation with lung function and health related&#xD;
      quality of life will be checked before and after treatment.&#xD;
