    <textblock>
      Currently, opioids are widely used for pain relief, but they often provide sub-optimal&#xD;
      analgesia with occasional serious side effects. Preservative-free ketamine hydrochloride was&#xD;
      introduced as a spinal anesthetic more than twenty years ago and found to have advantages&#xD;
      over local anesthetics. Intrathecal dexmedetomidine provides an analgesic effect in&#xD;
      postoperative pain without severe sedation. The objectives of this study were to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of intrathecally administered dexmedetomidine, ketamine, or their&#xD;
      combination when added to bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia in major abdominal cancer&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      This study was approved by the ethics committee of South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut&#xD;
      University, Assiut, Egypt. After obtaining a written informed consent, 90 American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesia (ASA) I-II patients aged 30-50 years and scheduled for major abdominal cancer&#xD;
      surgery were included in the study. Patients with a known allergy to the study drugs,&#xD;
      significant cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic disease, coagulation disorder, infection&#xD;
      at the site of intrathecal injection, drug or alcohol abuse, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 , and psychiatric&#xD;
      illnesses that would interfere with perception and assessment of pain were excluded from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, patients were taught how to evaluate their own pain intensity using the&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS), scored from 0 -10 (where 0 = no pain, and 10 = the worst pain&#xD;
      imaginable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral diazepam (5 mg) was taken the night before surgery. Up on arrival at the operative&#xD;
      theatre, a 16-gauge catheter was introduced intravenously at the dorsum of the hand; lactated&#xD;
      Ringer's solution 10 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 10 min. before initiation of spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia. Basic monitoring probes (electrocardiography, non invasive blood pressure, O2&#xD;
      saturation, and temperature) were applied. Patients were placed in the setting position and a&#xD;
      25-gauge Quincke needle was placed in the L2-3 or L3-4 interspaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided, by selecting sealed envelopes into one of three groups 30&#xD;
      patients each:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dexmedetomidine group (group I) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2&#xD;
           ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine in 1 ml volume intrathecally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ketamine group (group II) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml&#xD;
           volume and 0.1 mg/kg ketamine in 1ml volume intrathecally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexmedetomidine + Ketamine group (group III) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine&#xD;
           0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine plus 0.1 mg/kg of Ketamine in 1 ml volume&#xD;
           intrathecally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after their intrathecal injection, the patients were placed in the supine&#xD;
      position. After successful spinal anesthesia, general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl&#xD;
      1.5-2 µg/kg, propofol 2-3 mg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. Endotracheal intubation was&#xD;
      facilitated by cis-atracurium 0.15 mg/kg. Heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
      were recorded at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180 minutes. Anesthesia and muscle relaxation were&#xD;
      maintained by isoflurane 1- 1.5 MAC in 50% oxygen/air mixture and cis-atracurium 0.03 mg/kg&#xD;
      bolus given every 30 min. respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed by neostigmine 50 µg/kg and atropine 20&#xD;
      µg/kg. Patients were extubated and transferred to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and were&#xD;
      monitored for vital signs (heart rate, non invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, and O2&#xD;
      saturation) immediately postoperative and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS scores were assessed at the same time points. Rescue analgesia represented by&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous morphine with an initial bolus of 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg once pain was expressed by the patient, or if VAS was 3 or more (VAS ≥ 3) followed by 1&#xD;
      mg boluses with a lockout period of 5 min. The time of first request of analgesia and total&#xD;
      analgesic consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's level of sedation was assessed at the same time points using a modified&#xD;
      Observer's Assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale (where 6 = agitated, and 0 = doesn't&#xD;
      respond to deep stimuls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attendant anesthesiologist, the patient-care giver, and the data collection personnel&#xD;
      were all blinded to patient assignment to a specific group. Postoperative adverse effects&#xD;
      such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias were recorded and&#xD;
      treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension was defined as a 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline.&#xD;
      Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate slower than 50 beats per minute or a decrease in&#xD;
      heart rate of 20% or more from baseline; whichever is lowest. Hypoxia was defined as an&#xD;
      oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Hypotension was treated with intravenous boluse of&#xD;
      ephidrine 0.1 mg/kg and normal saline 5ml/kg; the same doses were repeated as required.&#xD;
      Bradycardia was treated with intravenous atropine 0.01 mg/kg.&#xD;
