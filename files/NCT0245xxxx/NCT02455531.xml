    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare direct and indirect measures of right ventricular&#xD;
      (RV) systolic and diastolic function between 11 year old subjects who had been randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive a right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) vs. a modified&#xD;
      Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) at the time of the Norwood operation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) trial was the first multicenter, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to compare two operations in the field of congenital heart disease.8,11&#xD;
      Children with HLHS and other related single RV lesions were enrolled and randomized to&#xD;
      receive either a MBTS or a RVPAS at the time of the initial Norwood procedure. This landmark&#xD;
      study provided extraordinary insight not only into the consequences of both shunt types, but&#xD;
      also into the course, treatment responses and short- and mid-term outcomes for these&#xD;
      medically complex patients. Through the SVR Trial and SVR Extension Study (SVR II), outcomes,&#xD;
      including but not limited to the primary outcome of transplant-free survival, have now been&#xD;
      evaluated in this patient cohort when the last enrolled patient reached 12 months and again&#xD;
      at 3 years of age. While early post-operative transplant-free survival during the interstage&#xD;
      period7 and at one year8 was better for those children randomized to a RVPAS, survival by the&#xD;
      3-year evaluation appeared equivalent between the two shunt types. Moreover, RVEF was&#xD;
      somewhat diminished and the number of interventions was higher in the RVPAS group.12 These&#xD;
      findings raised concern that the RV dysfunction in the RVPAS group may be progressive,&#xD;
      leading to significantly worse long-term outcomes; if so, the benefits of the RVPAS for&#xD;
      short-term survival may be outweighed by longer-term morbidity and mortality. Thus, the&#xD;
      optimal surgical approach for newborns with HLHS and related single RV lesions remains&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) Investigators have a unique opportunity and responsibility&#xD;
      to analyze the effect of the type of systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt placed during the&#xD;
      Norwood procedure on longer-term survival, as well as to define its effect on other long-term&#xD;
      outcomes in this multi-institutional cohort of exquisitely characterized subjects with single&#xD;
      RV lesions. As subjects enrolled in the SVR cohort approach a decade of age, the&#xD;
      investigators aim: 1) to determine if shunt type at the time of Norwood operation is&#xD;
      associated with any long-term differences in cardiac function, survival, or contributors to&#xD;
      quality of life; and 2) to characterize long-term outcomes and determine risk factors other&#xD;
      than shunt type for adverse long-term outcomes in children with HLHS and other related single&#xD;
      ventricle anomalies.&#xD;
