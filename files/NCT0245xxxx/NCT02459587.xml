  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (n = 301) of a new single-session intervention,&#xD;
      called Crisis Line Facilitation (CLF), compared to an enhanced usual care condition on&#xD;
      utilization of the Veterans Crisis Line and other mental health services as well as suicide&#xD;
      attempt(s). All participants were recruited during an inpatient psychiatric stay for the&#xD;
      treatment of a recent suicidal crisis and will be re-assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-months post&#xD;
      baseline. If successful, the proposed study will provide key data on the potential efficacy&#xD;
      of a brief tool to improve the utilization of an existing resource, the Veterans Crisis Line,&#xD;
      to reduce suicidal behaviors in VHA patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients are at a significantly elevated risk for fatal&#xD;
      and non-fatal suicide attempts and identifying strategies to reduce the risk of suicidal&#xD;
      behavior among members of the military and Veterans is a high national priority. The VHA has&#xD;
      invested extensively in suicide prevention and, as part of these efforts; the Veterans Crisis&#xD;
      Line was developed as an important resource for Veterans and their families. Utilization of&#xD;
      the Veterans Crisis Line has expanded steadily since it first opened and, currently, it&#xD;
      receives over 20,000 calls per month. Despite high utilization of the Crisis Line, no data&#xD;
      are currently available on whether use of the Veterans Crisis Line reduces an individual's&#xD;
      likelihood of a suicide attempt or death and it is not feasible to test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      Crisis Line in a randomized controlled trial because it is nationally available to all&#xD;
      Veterans and their families. More importantly, the Veterans Crisis Line may not reach those&#xD;
      individuals at most acute risk for suicide. The investigators' study team conducted a small&#xD;
      survey of Veterans treated for recent suicidal crisis in a VHA inpatient psychiatric unit and&#xD;
      found that less than half had ever utilized the Veterans Crisis Line and less than a third&#xD;
      had used it within the past year. Consequently, the investigators have developed and gathered&#xD;
      pilot data on a brief intervention designed to increase utilization of the Veterans Crisis&#xD;
      Line among high risk patients, called Crisis Line Facilitation (CLF). This single-session&#xD;
      intervention involves a discussion of the patient's perceived barriers of crisis line use&#xD;
      during periods of suicidal crisis. The CLF session ends with the patient calling the Crisis&#xD;
      Line with the therapist in the room as a way for Veterans to practice the logistics of making&#xD;
      the call and to have direct experiences that may counter any negative beliefs about Veterans&#xD;
      Crisis Line use. This study recruited 301 participants who were treated for a suicidal crisis&#xD;
      in VHA inpatient psychiatric but had not recently used the Veterans Crisis Line. This study&#xD;
      is a randomized controlled trial of the impact of CLF compared to enhanced usual care (EUC)&#xD;
      on utilization of the Veterans Crisis Line and other mental health services as well as&#xD;
      suicide attempt(s). All participants will be re-assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-months post&#xD;
      baseline. Analyses will also examine the extent to which post-baseline Crisis Line use&#xD;
      mediates the effect of random assignment to CLF on subsequent suicidal behaviors. Qualitative&#xD;
      interviews at the end of the study will help understand barriers and facilitators of future&#xD;
      implementation of the CLF intervention. If successful, the proposed study will provide key&#xD;
      data on the potential efficacy of a brief intervention to improve the utilization of an&#xD;
      existing resource, the Veterans Crisis Line, to reduce suicidal behaviors in VHA patients.&#xD;
      Developing a brief and effective approach to encourage use of the Crisis Line has the&#xD;
      potential to have a significant and substantial impact on suicide rates within the VHA and&#xD;
      could be modified and exported to other populations and settings.&#xD;

    <description>The primary data source for information regarding use of the VCL was collected via researcher-administered interview questions during the TimeLine Follow Back assessment. Participants were asked to recall how many times since the last assessment in which they contacted the VCL for any reason. For contacts that occurred, participants were asked to recall the date of these contacts and the type of contact that was made (e.g. phone call, text, or chat).</description>

    <measure>Number of Suicide Behavior Events Per Days at Risk</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary data source for suicidal behaviors was the TimeLine Follow Back, a semi-structured researcher-administered interview. Participants were asked to report actual, interrupted, and aborted attempt events that occurred since the last study assessment. Definitions for these events were derived from the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Suicidal Behaviors subsection [also administered during the assessment], and dates for these events were entered into the TimeLine Follow Back.</description>

    <description>The primary data source for general mental health treatment service utilization was a modified version of the Treatment Services Review, an researcher-administered structured interview.

    <description>Those in the EUC condition received the same promotional items and information about the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) as the CLF condition. Participants were encouraged to seek help via a provider or the VCL if they felt suicidal in the future. Research staff briefly explained key information about the VCL to those in the EUC condition (e.g., the links between the VCL and the VA, the 24/7/365 availability, etc.).</description>
