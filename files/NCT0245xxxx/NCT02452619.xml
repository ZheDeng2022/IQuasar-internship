  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our institute there is ongoing treatment of brain injury patients with Hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
      therapy. These patients undergo neuro-cognitive function tests in addition to brain imaging&#xD;
      studies before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the perfusion and microstructure changes seen in MRI in&#xD;
      addition to the cognitive tests before and after the treatment.&#xD;

      Retrospective analysis of patients suffering from chronic neuro-cognitive damage due to TBI&#xD;
      treated at Sagol center for hyperbaric medicine and research, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center,&#xD;
      Israel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included if they had at least two perfusion MRIs + DTI and two neurocognitive tests,&#xD;
      before and after Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT). The study was approved by the&#xD;
      institutional review board of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are treated with 50-70 daily hyperbaric sessions, 5 days per week. Each session&#xD;
      consists of 60 minutes exposure to 100% oxygen at 1.5 ATA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that underwent MRI before and after HBOT. The MRI protocol included DSC, DCE,&#xD;
      DTI, FLAIR, T2 and SWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scans sequences parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * DSC: 50 T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) volumes were acquired, 2&#xD;
      repetitions before a bolus injection of Gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA), 48 repetitions after&#xD;
      injection of Gd-DTPA. Sequence parameters: TR=2,300 ms, TE= 40ms, flip angle = 30Â°, voxel&#xD;
      size = 1.8 x1.8, Matrix = 128x128, No. of slices = 25, Slice thickness = 3.9 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DCE: three T1 weighted Fast Low Angle SHot (FLASH) volumes were acquired with different&#xD;
           flip angles (2, 7 and 15 degrees) followed by 70 dynamic T1 weighted FLASH volumes with&#xD;
           flip angle of 15 degrees after bolus injection of Gd-DTPA. Sequence parameters: before&#xD;
           injection: TR=4.09, after injection - TR=4.86 ms, TE= 1.76 ms, Voxel size = 1.5x1.5,&#xD;
           Matrix = 192X192, No. of slices = 26, Slice thickness = 3.5mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DTI: 30 diffusion weighted images were scanned with different gradient directions&#xD;
           (b=1000) and one volume without diffusion weighting, with the following parameters:&#xD;
           TR=10,300 ms, TE=89 ms, Voxel size = 1.8X1.8, Matrix = 128 X 128, No. of slices = 63,&#xD;
           Slice thickness = 2.2mm&#xD;
