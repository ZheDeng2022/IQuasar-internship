  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Global and regional initiatives have been launched for the dual elimination of&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and syphilis. As one of the important components&#xD;
      in the initiatives, early detection and timely intervention of pregnant women infected with&#xD;
      HIV and/or syphilis is critical. In order to improve the number of women tested and treated,&#xD;
      innovative strategies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serologic tests are the diagnostic tests of choice for HIV and syphilis. There are two types&#xD;
      of serological tests (treponemal and non-treponemal tests) for diagnosis of syphilis. These&#xD;
      generally require venous blood for screening of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. In&#xD;
      addition, these tests are technically demanding, and require laboratory equipment which is&#xD;
      not widely available in most resource-limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that can be used at point-of-care for simultaneously&#xD;
      detecting antibodies to HIV and syphilis (dual HIV &amp; syphilis treponemalRDTs) using&#xD;
      serum/plasma, venous whole blood, or finger-stick whole blood have been developed and are now&#xD;
      commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In low-resource settings, a combination of two or three rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), in&#xD;
      which one screening test with a second test to confirm initial positive results or two RDTs&#xD;
      in parallel with a third test as a tiebreaker for discordant samples, can be used to diagnose&#xD;
      HIV on finger-stick blood. To date, there are few data on the implications of using these&#xD;
      RDTs in the antenatal clinic settings, although they have been evaluated in laboratory-based&#xD;
      studies and shown encouraging sensitivities and specificities as compared with reference&#xD;
      laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this research is to assess the uptake of syphilis testing after the&#xD;
      introduction of dual HIV/syphilis rapid testing as compared to single rapid syphilis testing&#xD;
      in antenatal clinics in Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are: To determine the uptake of treatment of syphilis&#xD;
      after the intervention, To determine the uptake of HIV testing in ANC attendees after the&#xD;
      intervention, To explore the acceptability of dual HIV/syphilis RDTs by ANC attendees and&#xD;
      health workers, To assess the organizational and socio-cultural advantages and barriers to&#xD;
      introduction with a aim of sustainable adoption of dual HIV/syphilis RDTs in antenatal&#xD;
      services, To determine the workload and cost implications of introduction of dual&#xD;
      HIV/syphilis RDTs in antenatal services&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desing: Cluster randomized trial including and quantitative component, a qualitative&#xD;
      component (in-deep interviews)and a time and cost estimation component in the antenatal care&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Primary health facilities (n=12) in Bogot√° and Cali, Colombia. Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria: Inclusion Criteria: Pregnant women attending first ANC visit at the study sites, or&#xD;
      women not previously tested in this pregnancy,Women aged 14 years old or above, Any woman who&#xD;
      has tested positive for HIV and/or syphilis in the past (will be permitted to enrol), Women&#xD;
      providing a written informed consent.Exclusion Criteria: Women who have already been enrolled&#xD;
      in this study, Women &lt; 14 years of age, Women unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test to be evaluated: Each of the 12 institutions participating in the trial were assigned in&#xD;
      a random way to rapid single test for HIV and Syphilis or dual rapid test HIV/syphilis. The&#xD;
      brand of the rapid test selected for the study, passed throw a process of selection by the&#xD;
      National Health Institute in Colombia, in order to choose the best test according to&#xD;
      desirable performance and operational characteristics. The brand Standard Diagnostics the&#xD;
      Bioline was donated to do the rapid test in the present study with pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CONSORT diagram for the cluster randomized trial will be shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary analysis will be based on intention-to-treat principle, with no facility&#xD;
           excluded from analysis after the random assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline characteristics of clusters (facilities) and of the women enrolled in each arm&#xD;
           will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For qualitative variables frequencies and percentages will be reported. For quantitative&#xD;
           normally distributed variables, the number of subjects, means and standard errors will&#xD;
           be provided, while medians, interquartile range, minima and maxima will be reported for&#xD;
           skewed non-normal quantitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because of the clustered nature of outcomes due to randomization to interventions based&#xD;
           on clusters (facilities), the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) modelling, with&#xD;
           binomial distribution and logit link, will be used to estimate the risk difference (RD)&#xD;
           and odds ratio (OR) of Syphilis testing, Syphilis treatment and HIV testing uptake, with&#xD;
           95% Confidence Interval, adjusted for clustering, between interventions arms A and B.&#xD;
           This model will adjust for any important baseline factors, including whether any testing&#xD;
           in Syphilis or HIV was ever done previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-cluster correlations (ICC) for overall, as well as ICCs stratified for important&#xD;
           baseline factors of interest, will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two-sided tests and 5% significance levels will be used, and 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
           for all relevant parameters. SAS statistical packages will be used for the statistical&#xD;
           analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The results of the study will be used in the design of strategies of&#xD;
      policies/national o local guidelines or even screening antenatal programs for HIV and&#xD;
      syphilis, the development of the best practice to the adoption of the rapid test for HIV and&#xD;
      Syphilis. The information collected will be used to share the experience and the lessons&#xD;
      learned to other countries in order to development guidelines of global, regional and&#xD;
      national policies to implement in order to impact the transmission of maternal-child HIV and&#xD;
      syphilis.&#xD;
