      This is a prospective, post-marketing, non-randomized, multi-center, single-arm clinical&#xD;
      study that will be conducted at up to 15 sites in the United States (US). All subjects will&#xD;
      be treated with the NIRxcell Stent System and followed at 30 days, 9 months and 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
      years post-index stenting procedure. An unscheduled follow up may be conducted as clinically&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;

      The main objective of this study is to collect and analyze additional information about the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the NIRxcell Stent System in the treatment of de novo stenotic&#xD;
      lesions in native coronary arteries in the US population. The primary endpoint will be the&#xD;
      rate of target vessel failure (TVF) at 3 years of treatment with the NIRxcell Stent System.&#xD;
      This rate will be compared with a performance goal derived from a meta-analysis of coronary&#xD;
      stenting with bare metal stents (BMS).&#xD;
