    <textblock>
      Background When first diagnosed, colorectal cancer has already metastasized in about 20% of&#xD;
      patients to the liver or further (termed synchronous disease). For patients with metastatic&#xD;
      disease limited to the liver, major surgery to resect both the primary colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      the liver metastasis provides 5-year survival rates of 25-40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional surgery removes the colorectal primary first, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and then resection of the liver metastasis. Surgical advances make synchronous resection&#xD;
      (removing both primary and liver metastasis together) and liver-first resection possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to show which approach improves morbidity or&#xD;
      survival, and therefore there is no optimum clinical pathway. Treatment is decided at&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings and is dependent on multiple factors: cancer staging,&#xD;
      patient health and preferences, and clinical experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods &quot;Colorectal cancer with Synchronous liver-limited hepatic Metastasis: an Inception&#xD;
      Cohort (CoSMIC)&quot;, will consent and recruit patients with a new diagnosis of synchronous&#xD;
      colorectal cancer limited to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at Manchester Royal Infirmary (a National Health Service (NHS)&#xD;
      regional cancer-network approved Hepato-pancreato-biliary specialist centers over 2 years&#xD;
      using standardized data collection. The sequence of treatment received by each patient, and&#xD;
      factors influencing treatment decisions, will be recorded and evaluated against European&#xD;
      Society of Medical Oncology guidelines. The effect of surgery on patient quality of life,&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and the long-term outcome will be measured and compared for different&#xD;
      treatment sequences adjusted for prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Outputs and Value of Findings Direct comparison of conventional and new surgical&#xD;
      sequences will be explored. Patient engagement, use of standardised recording, identifying&#xD;
      common clinical patterns and decision making, and understanding sources of variation are&#xD;
      essential steps to develop a definite randomized control trial to resolve the optimal&#xD;
      clinical pathway.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who present with metastatic liver disease following treatment of the primary (termed&#xD;
      metachronous disease) receive care focused on this new metastatic disease. In contrast, the&#xD;
      management of patients who present with colorectal cancer and concurrent liver metastases&#xD;
      (synchronous metastasis) is more complex. These patients may have less favourable cancer&#xD;
      biology and thus may be less likely to become long-term survivors. Logically, the management&#xD;
      of patients with colorectal cancer with synchronous metastases can be dichotomised into those&#xD;
      with hepatic disease together with extra-hepatic metastatic disease and those with&#xD;
      liver-limited metastatic disease. In the first category, systemic chemotherapy is the&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment advocated in current guidelines for patients with advanced multi-site&#xD;
      metastatic (liver and systemic metastatic) disease of colorectal cancer origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second category of patients with liver-limited synchronous metastases represents a&#xD;
      complex and common clinical management problem. Traditional management (referred to variously&#xD;
      as the classical or staged approach) comprised resection of the colorectal primary tumour&#xD;
      followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with liver resection being undertaken as a subsequent&#xD;
      operation. Advances in surgery, anaesthesia and critical care have made two alternative&#xD;
      options feasible for patients with synchronous disease. The first is synchronous resection of&#xD;
      the liver metastases and the colorectal primary. This has the attraction of removing the&#xD;
      macroscopic tumour burden with a single operation. However, the morbidity of complex liver&#xD;
      resection combined with major bowel resection may be considerable and there is some evidence&#xD;
      of a negative effect on progression-free survival. The second option in the management of&#xD;
      synchronous disease is resection of the liver metastatic disease as the first step, termed&#xD;
      the reverse or liver-first approach. Liver-first surgery to manage synchronous colorectal&#xD;
      cancer and liver metastatic disease has become more widely utilised because of oncological&#xD;
      and technical developments. Oncologically, evidence of improved outcome in locally advanced&#xD;
      rectal cancer treated by pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy prior to surgical resection creates&#xD;
      a potential &quot;window&quot; in which liver resection may be undertaken. The technical development of&#xD;
      colonic stenting permits symptoms associated with rectal cancer such as partial obstruction&#xD;
      to be palliated without recourse to urgent bowel surgery. The liver-first strategy may be&#xD;
      oncologically advantageous if liver metastatic disease rather than the primary cancer gives&#xD;
      rise to systemic metastasis - although this is not established. A further potentially&#xD;
      important benefit of the liver-first approach is that pelvic surgery may be either avoided or&#xD;
      less extensive in patients with rectal tumours with a complete endoscopic, radiological and&#xD;
      clinical response to chemo-radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, evidence is inadequate to inform the selection of treatment for patients with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer with synchronous liver-limited hepatic metastases. Specifically, in these&#xD;
      patients, optimal pathways are not defined and there is a dearth of prospectively recorded&#xD;
      cohort- defining factors influencing treatment selection or outcome. Given the treatment&#xD;
      permutations to be understood, an inception cohort study would allow us to understand patient&#xD;
      outcomes as a function of clinical decisions and patient/disease characteristics. By limiting&#xD;
      care available to patients to a common evidence-informed pathway, sources of treatment&#xD;
      variation can be minimised and, within a prospective design, data quality be optimised with&#xD;
      respect to patient and treatment characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent and recruitment, data will be collected on patients with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer with liver-limited hepatic metastases including patient variables,&#xD;
      treatment selection, factors influencing treatment, treatment-related morbidity and outcome.&#xD;
      Regression modelling of findings will permit influences of patient and treatment factors upon&#xD;
      outcomes to be quantified. Patterns of clinical decision making will help to understand the&#xD;
      characteristics of patients for whom equipoise exists or is absent.&#xD;

    <description>The first primary outcome measure of CoSMIC is to assess the adherence to an evidence-informed common pathway, using guidelines suggested by the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO). These include early use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as the final stage. The treatment options within the common pathway standardise initial staging, accommodating treatment for liver metastases according to liver involvement and location of disease as well as different treatment requirements for patients with rectal primary cancer compared to those with colonic primary tumours.</description>
