      Prospective multicentre observational study for treatment approaches in at-risk individuals.&#xD;
      Furthermore the purpose of this study is to test feasibility of a clinical staging model and&#xD;
      validate diagnostic tools to identify individuals at risk state for the development of BD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is one out of nine projects and four translational platforms forming the core of&#xD;
      an interdisciplinary consortium to research on the most important areas of uncertainties and&#xD;
      unmet needs in early recognition and diagnostic assessment, prevention of relapse, and&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies of BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this project, currently used diagnostic tools for subthreshold bipolar symptoms&#xD;
      (BPSS-P, EPIbipolar, BAR criteria) will be deployed within the first 24 months in defined&#xD;
      risk groups. Predictive power of individual risk factors/risk constellations will be&#xD;
      determined regarding the manifestation and prodromal development of BD within ≥24 months&#xD;
      (follow-up every 6 months). Potential resilience factors are ascertained. Additionally, the&#xD;
      diagnostic tools will be used in a representative cohort (IMAGEN, to ascertain the prevalence&#xD;
      of clinical/neurobiological at-risk constellations in non-selected youth and young adults,&#xD;
      data from previous follow-ups will be used, suffering/help-seeking behavior will be&#xD;
      assessed). Regarding treatment, at-risk subjects identified will be staged according to a&#xD;
      pilot staging model. Treatment guidance is provided linked to the model, however, the&#xD;
      naturalistic setting allows for individual decision making. Reasons for decisions will be&#xD;
      ascertained, efficacy will be assessed with respect to symptomatology, psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning and conversion to full BD, tolerability/safety will be assessed according to&#xD;
      research standard. Outcomes will be assessed within ≥ 24 months. Using the results, the&#xD;
      clinical staging model &amp; guidance will be refined. The long-term goal is to provide a model&#xD;
      for research and clinical initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synopsis of study goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determination of the predictive power of individual risk factors and risk constellations&#xD;
           in defined risk groups for BD,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of resilience factors,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Integration of results for further development of diagnostic tools and harmonization of&#xD;
           the diagnostic process across centers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigation of the process of treatment decision making, efficacy (acute/preventive&#xD;
           effects) and tolerability/safety in at-risk subjects in a naturalistic setting, testing&#xD;
           the feasibility of a pilot clinical staging model with treatment guidance,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Refinement of the staging model and guidance.&#xD;
