      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individually-administered Problem Solving&#xD;
      Treatment is effective in managing depressive symptomatology in 250 primarily&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking Latino patients ≥55 years of age or older with high medical comorbidity. The&#xD;
      aim is to test if Programa Esperanza improves: a) problem solving skills and behavior&#xD;
      activation; b) depression-related outcomes; and b) physical functioning compared to enhanced&#xD;
      usual care over the course of one year.&#xD;

      The primary aim is to test the comparative effectiveness of Programa Esperanza (Project Hope)&#xD;
      a short-term culturally-modified psychosocial intervention for primarily Spanish-speaking&#xD;
      Latino patients 55 years of age or older with depression and multiple medical&#xD;
      conditions-compared to Enhanced Usual Care (EUC), the alternative choice in real-world care.&#xD;
      The study will address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Question: Among 250 low-income, primarily Spanish-speaking Latinos ≥55 years&#xD;
      of age with high medical comorbidity, will Programa Esperanza improve: a) problem solving&#xD;
      skills and behavior activation; b) depression-related outcomes; and b) physical functioning&#xD;
      compared to EUC over the course of one year?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do moderating conditions exist such that the intervention may be more or less effective&#xD;
           for some patient subgroups compared to others?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will qualitative reports from our patient population and provider stakeholders provide&#xD;
           key insights related to treatment effectiveness, acceptance and satisfaction, as well as&#xD;
           adoption of the intervention within the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) setting?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Among patients, interventionists, and organization leaders, are there high feasibility,&#xD;
           fidelity, and acceptability of training and deployment of nontraditional&#xD;
           interventionists to deliver the psychosocial treatment within the PCMH setting?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Clinical Trial Design. The study will enroll 250 limited-English-speaking Latinos&#xD;
      (55+ years) from the AltaMed Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), a&#xD;
      geriatric patient-centered medical home model in Los Angeles County. Subjects who meet PHQ-9&#xD;
      criteria for depression (i.e., score of 8 or greater) will be randomized to one of two study&#xD;
      arms: either individually administered Problem Solving Treatment (PST) sessions (n=125)&#xD;
      facilitated by bachelor's-level social workers under the supervision of a licensed clinical&#xD;
      social worker; or EUC. Data collected at study enrollment will document past and baseline&#xD;
      patient characteristics including baseline depression and depression severity scores.&#xD;
      Assessment of depression trial outcomes, i.e., depression symptom level (PHQ-9); depression&#xD;
      response and remission rates, and will be taken at 3, 6 and 12 months post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site. AltaMed is a nonprofit, federally-qualified health center and one of the oldest&#xD;
      and largest providers of senior care services for older racial/ethnic minorities in the US&#xD;
      for over 30 years. The sample will be recruited from enrollees across 8 licensed PACE&#xD;
      treatment sites. PACE is an optional, capitated CMS managed care benefit that provides&#xD;
      comprehensive medical and social services to frail people who disproportionately rely on&#xD;
      Medicaid/Medicare services. Typical of other PACE programs, AltaMed offers a PCMH comprised&#xD;
      of intensive health, therapeutic, and social services for adults at risk of nursing home&#xD;
      institutionalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects/ Selection Criteria/ Recruitment and Enrollment. A total of 250 subjects who&#xD;
      meet PHQ-9 criteria for depression (&gt; 8 PHQ-9 score) will be selected for this randomized&#xD;
      trial. for detecting major depressive disorder for cut-off scores as low as 8. Potential&#xD;
      subjects will be selected from the pool of PACE enrollees and identified by AltaMed staff&#xD;
      based on routine PHQ-9 screening conducted face-to-face or by telephone. Those who score&#xD;
      positive for depression (&gt; 8 PHQ-9 score) will be recruited and consented to participate in&#xD;
      the study by either designated AltaMed staff or study research personnel. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      include: English- or Spanish-speaking Latino age 55 years or older; receiving services from&#xD;
      any AltaMed PACE site; positive for depression (&gt; 8 PHQ-9 score). In anticipation of&#xD;
      attrition, the investigators will over-recruit subjects at enrollment by 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures. Following screening of PACE enrollees by AltaMed staff, PACE study consenters&#xD;
      will apprise potential subjects meeting study criteria of the study protocol and their&#xD;
      eligibility and will be responsible for the initial consent procedures. Upon documented&#xD;
      written consent, research personnel will conduct a face-to-face structured baseline interview&#xD;
      as well as review any questions the participant may have regarding informed consent and the&#xD;
      study. Randomization will be conducted at the level of the individual subject. Between 1 to 7&#xD;
      days after the baseline interview, the study program coordinator will contact subjects and&#xD;
      apprise them of their treatment status in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparators. Problem Solving Treatment. Individual, face-to-face PST sessions (as described&#xD;
      above) over a span of 8 weeks will be held at PACE sites. The first session will last one&#xD;
      hour while subsequent sessions will last 45 minutes. After the last PST session, each subject&#xD;
      will have 3 monthly booster sessions (about 15 minutes). The PST protocol is intended to be&#xD;
      highly structured, time-limited, and manual-driven; sessions include PST hand outs and&#xD;
      homework as well as social and behavioral activation strategies, i.e., pleasant activities&#xD;
      scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced Usual Care. EUC patients will receive psychoeducational materials on depression and&#xD;
      depression treatment of older persons. The materials are based on our prior work and are&#xD;
      available in Spanish and English. EUC patients will continue to receive the full complement&#xD;
      of PACE services (medical, rehabilitation, social) including referrals to specialty mental&#xD;
      health services, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. Consented patients will receive a 60 minute face-to-face baseline interview&#xD;
      before randomization to be conducted by study personnel. Outcome interviews (60 minutes) will&#xD;
      be conducted in-person by independent study interviewers. Data will be based on multiple&#xD;
      sources: self-report and clinician-rendered diagnoses, anthropometric measures, medical&#xD;
      records and claims data extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative study design and procedures. In order to address our secondary research questions&#xD;
      the investigators will conduct in-depth and focus group interviews with our respective&#xD;
      stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: During the three post baseline assessment (and after the 3-month quantitative data&#xD;
      collection) the investigators will conduct an open-ended component to assess more in-depth&#xD;
      explorations of the treatment experience, and longer term issues that may emerge with PST or&#xD;
      EUC. This component will be administered based on a guide/questioning route designed to&#xD;
      collect in-depth information on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention based&#xD;
      on the subject's own perceptions and reactions to treatment. Dropouts as well as completers&#xD;
      will be included. Providers (interventionists, AltaMed managers and executive leadership):&#xD;
      The investigators will query providers based on a focus group approach: 2 separate groups of&#xD;
      10 persons each.&#xD;
