      The World Health Organisation predicts that lung disease will be the World's third largest&#xD;
      killer in the future. This research project is looking to see whether the concept of a &quot;home&#xD;
      hospital&quot; using the latest gadgets and iPad technology, can help patients stay well and out&#xD;
      of hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portsmouth Hospitals Trust is collaborating with a Company based in the United Kingdom (UK)&#xD;
      who has developed a test to predict when people with lung diseases, such as; asthma, COPD and&#xD;
      bronchiectasis, who regularly have chest infections, are about to become poorly with another&#xD;
      infection - a form of early warning system. The investigators hope that the test will&#xD;
      eventually be able to be used by the patient at home daily, to help self-manage their&#xD;
      condition. The test measures whether bacteria are present, in sputum, and in what quantity.&#xD;
      This information can be used by the patient's healthcare team to consider providing treatment&#xD;
      earlier, thus controlling the infection sooner and reducing the patient's symptoms so that&#xD;
      patients can stay at home rather than being regularly admitted to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of this &quot;early warning system&quot; that has been developed by the UK Company includes the&#xD;
      daily measurement of a number of indicators of health. These are usually only measured in&#xD;
      hospital or by a General Practitioner, but new devices have been made that are simple enough&#xD;
      for everyone to use at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include 30 participants, with non-Cystic Fibrosis (CF) chronic&#xD;
      respiratory conditions who will be asked to take daily measurements of their blood pressure,&#xD;
      temperature, weight and how well their heart and lungs are working with easy-to-use devices.&#xD;
      They will also measure their physically activity with an activity tracker and report their&#xD;
      wellness and whether they have taken medication daily. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      collect a sample of sputum and urine each morning. Taking the samples and measurements should&#xD;
      only take between 5-15 minutes each day to carry out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sputum and urine will be tested at the hospital and will be recorded and analysed, so&#xD;
      that the researchers can learn what happens well before a person with these conditions falls&#xD;
      sick and needs hospitalisation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether the concept of a &quot;home hospital&quot; using the latest&#xD;
      gadgets and iPad technology, can help patients stay well and out of hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a single centre, non-randomised, mixed methods study. A longitudinal cohort of&#xD;
      patients and their carers (where appropriate) will be asked to collect physiological,&#xD;
      biological and disease outcome data over a 6 month period. Both participants and the&#xD;
      clinicians responsible for patient care and will have no access to the longitudinal data and&#xD;
      this information will not be used to make clinical decisions. The laboratory samples will&#xD;
      also be analysed in a blinded manner. These data will then be analysed to develop a model for&#xD;
      predicting onset of exacerbations which can be built into a self-monitoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative methods will be used to explore participant and carer experiences of using the&#xD;
      technology and performing daily self-monitoring assessments. The expected duration of&#xD;
      participant participation in the cohort will be six months, with an invitation to complete a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire at baseline to inform a face to face semi-structured&#xD;
      interview with patients with, or without carer joint participant at the end of the follow-up&#xD;
      period (six months completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 male and female patients, aged 18 and over will be recruited;&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ 10 with asthma or COPD and 10 with non-CF bronchiectasis&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients with no previously detected PA infection, infected with Haemophilus influenza&#xD;
      (HI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also recruit 10 patients plus/minus their carers from the PA group, 5&#xD;
      patients plus/minus their carers from the HI group into the qualitative part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited from existing asthma, COPD and non-CF bronchiectasis&#xD;
      local patient databases in combination with the local laboratory results systems by the&#xD;
      clinical care team. Potential participants identified will then be contacted by a member of&#xD;
      the local research team who are also the routine clinical care team and invited to attend a&#xD;
      specialist research recruitment clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the research clinic participants will be reviewed by a clinical research fellow and&#xD;
      screened for suitability for the study by the research team. Patients and carers will be able&#xD;
      to view and try out the self-monitoring devices and tablet-based IT system. Capacity to&#xD;
      operate these systems will be assessed as part of the screening. Those who meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be given a Participant Information Sheet and/or Carer information sheet if&#xD;
      participants wish for their carer to assist them in using the self-monitoring devices and&#xD;
      tablet-based IT system daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adequate time to consider and ask questions about the study, participants who are&#xD;
      interested in taking part in the trial will be invited to a screening visit where they will&#xD;
      be asked to sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit, following consent, participants' lung function, blood pressure,&#xD;
      oxygen levels, height, weight and BMI will be recorded and general health questions will be&#xD;
      asked to gain information on medical history, current medications &amp; smoking status.&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete a set of baseline questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the screening visit (up to 10 days after), the research nurse and an technician&#xD;
      from the company ASEPTIKA will deliver and install the study equipment into the participants&#xD;
      home and train the participant on how to use all the technology provided. This training visit&#xD;
      will take approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a period of 6 months, participants will be required to collect a sputum and urine sample&#xD;
      daily and store them in the freezer provided, in their own homes. Participants will be&#xD;
      trained in sample collection at the screening visit by a member of the research team. The&#xD;
      samples will be collected from the participants monthly by the a member of the research team,&#xD;
      or participants can bring the samples into hospital at their routine clinic appointments.&#xD;
      Participants will also need to measure their weight, blood pressure, oxygen level and lung&#xD;
      function and wear an activity monitor daily. These results, as well as a questionnaire, are&#xD;
      recorded on the iPad which sends the data via 3G to a central database. The process should&#xD;
      take no longer than 15 minutes a day. Participants and clinicians will be blind to the&#xD;
      continuous data over the duration of the study but participants will see the values generated&#xD;
      daily on the screens of the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study participants will attend their normal review with the medical team at 3 and&#xD;
      6 months (study completion) which usually involves lung function, sputum sample for culture&#xD;
      and clinical review. These visits will coincide with a short clinic visit to see the research&#xD;
      team to complete disease specific and quality of life questionnaires as well as noting any&#xD;
      changes to treatment and exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and their carers will also have the opportunity to give additional consent to&#xD;
      take part in a qualitative interview, at the same time as the main study consent is sought.&#xD;
      If consent is attained, participants will be given an extra questionnaire to complete at&#xD;
      baseline which will include questions on their expectations and desired outcomes of the&#xD;
      study, worries, concerns and any foreseen barriers to compliance. Participants plus or minus&#xD;
      their carers may then be selected and invited to take part in 1 semi-structured face-to-face&#xD;
      interview, at the end of study (6 months) to discuss what they think about the study and also&#xD;
      what they feel and understand about their health. The interviews will either be conducted at&#xD;
      the participants' homes or at hospital, depending on their preference and will be conducted&#xD;
      by the same research fellow throughout the study to allow consistency. The interviews will&#xD;
      take approximately 45-60 minutes depending on what the participant/carer wishes to share. The&#xD;
      interview can be terminated at any point the participant/carer wishes to stop and this will&#xD;
      not influence their subsequent treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are admitted to hospital during the course of the study they will be asked to&#xD;
      take along their iPad and self-monitoring devices with them. If participants forget their&#xD;
      iPad a member of the study team will visit the patient on the ward and will assist to collect&#xD;
      the patient's daily measurements for the study where appropriate.&#xD;
