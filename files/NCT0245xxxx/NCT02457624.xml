      Experienced endoscopists will perform endoscopy during the study period and the detection&#xD;
      rate of gastric premalignant lesion, correlation between endoscopic and serologic diagnosis&#xD;
      of premalignant lesions and inter-observer agreement rate will be analyzed before and after&#xD;
      the education.&#xD;

      This study is an extension of quality assurance program in Seoul National University Hospital&#xD;
      Healthcare System Gangnam Center. This study is composed of four periods. First, the&#xD;
      detection rate of gastric premalignant lesions and the correlation between endoscopic and&#xD;
      serologic diagnosis of premalignant lesions will be analyzed retrospectively from March 2008&#xD;
      till February 2009 and from March 2013 till February 2014, when the levels of serum&#xD;
      pepsinogen were achieved from the patients. In the second period from March 2015 till April&#xD;
      2015, quality assurance program will be activated. Endoscopists will be educated on the&#xD;
      Kimura-Takemoto classification for chronic atrophic gastritis. After that their diagnosis&#xD;
      will be tested and they will have feedback and discussion all together. In this period,&#xD;
      inter-observer agreement rate will be assessed serially. Third, prospective trial will run&#xD;
      from May 2015 till April 2020, in which all the endoscopists' detection rate of gastric&#xD;
      premalignant lesion, the correlation between endoscopic and serologic diagnosis of&#xD;
      premalignant lesions, and their inter-observer agreement will be analyzed. Finally,&#xD;
      cumulative incidence and mortality rate of gastric cancer and incidence rate of gastric&#xD;
      dysplasia will be investigated until December 2020.&#xD;
