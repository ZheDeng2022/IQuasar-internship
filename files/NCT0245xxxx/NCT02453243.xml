      Many patients at risk for suicide are discharged from the ED with little or no intervention.&#xD;
      Evidence-based suicide prevention interventions, like universal screening and safety planning&#xD;
      should be adopted in clinical practice to help prevent suicidal behavior. This study will&#xD;
      test the long-term sustainability of the nurse administered universal screening implemented&#xD;
      in the original ED-SAFE study. Also, the investigators will test the impact of a new&#xD;
      personalized Safety Planning Intervention guided by Lean has on suicide composite outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ED-SAFE-2 will use a stepped wedge design where the original eight ED-SAFE sites will&#xD;
      collect quantitative and qualitative data during the three phases: Baseline, Implementation,&#xD;
      and Maintenance. Using this data, the ED-SAFE-2 will examine both within and between site&#xD;
      differences for existing screening practices and new care processes, including safety&#xD;
      planning. Most of the data collection on outcomes will be done by retrospective chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Lean Implementation Strategy will be used to ensure that adoption of improved care&#xD;
      processes are fully supported vertically and horizontally within the organization,&#xD;
      infrastructure is built that supports the efforts, and that the protocols fit naturally&#xD;
      within roles, responsibilities, and clinical flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with the RFA's emphasis, the intervention target will be the clinician's behavior,&#xD;
      including, at minimum, screening and safety planning. All emergency mental health and nursing&#xD;
      personnel at the sites will be trained on safety planning, and Lean will be used to help&#xD;
      ensure the safety planning is being implemented properly and consistently. The mechanisms of&#xD;
      action of the combination of the safety planning training and Lean will be studied, allowing&#xD;
      the team to establish both the effect the intervention has on the intervention target but&#xD;
      also on the mechanisms of action comprised of departmental culture change and infrastructure&#xD;
      support.&#xD;

      Suicide risk is much more prevalent among general emergency department (ED) patients than in&#xD;
      the general community but this risk often goes undetected, especially among patients&#xD;
      presenting with non-psychiatric complaints. By definition, universal screening is the only&#xD;
      way to identify occult risk among patients presenting for non-psychiatric complaints. Until&#xD;
      recently, however, little was known about how to implement universal screening in a clinical&#xD;
      ED setting or whether doing so had any effect on detecting risk. The ED-SAFE has shown that&#xD;
      it is feasible to implement universal screening and that the screening increases detection of&#xD;
      suicide risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simply identifying risk is not sufficient; efforts must be taken to mitigate risk and prevent&#xD;
      suicidal behavior. However, many studies have shown that even those patients identified as&#xD;
      having clinically significant risk are often discharged home without receiving any kind of&#xD;
      active intervention during the ED visit, with many not even receiving a psychiatric&#xD;
      evaluation.1-3 Brief interventions that are a good fit for the ED are needed. One such&#xD;
      intervention has received strong research support and has already been accepted as a best&#xD;
      practice in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs: Safety Planning Intervention.4&#xD;
      This intervention, however, has not been adopted in civilian EDs and little is known about&#xD;
      how to effectively implement it, and whether doing so impacts suicide-related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the long-term sustainability of nurse administered universal screening&#xD;
      implemented in the original study across two new time periods. (a) The first is the period&#xD;
      between the original ED-SAFE and the new study (ED-SAFE-2), which represents an ecologically&#xD;
      valid &quot;natural&quot; state without any grant support, hereafter referred to as Baseline. (b) The&#xD;
      second is the Maintenance phase of the new study, which will represent a time period spanning&#xD;
      a minimum of four years after screening was initially implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Primary hypothesis: Sites that sustained high screening rates (intervention target) will&#xD;
      sustain improved suicide risk detection (patient outcome) during each time period examined.&#xD;
      Sustained screening practices will be mediated through ED organizational characteristics and&#xD;
      enabling infrastructure (mechanisms of action).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the impact of implementing the new personalized Safety Planning Intervention for&#xD;
      patients with suicide risk who are discharged from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Primary hypotheses: Clinician training in safety planning, combined with implementation&#xD;
      guided by Lean, is expected to increase safety planning by clinicians (intervention target),&#xD;
      which will result in reduced suicide and suicide-related acute healthcare in the 6-months&#xD;
      post-visit (suicide composite outcome). This will be more likely in sites with organizational&#xD;
      characteristics and infrastructure that supports safety planning (mechanisms of action).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test sustainability of safety planning during the Maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Primary hypotheses: Sustained safety planning will result in sustained reductions in the&#xD;
      suicide composite outcome. Sustained safety planning will be mediated by strong&#xD;
      organizational characteristics and a robust enabling infrastructure supporting safety&#xD;
      planning.&#xD;

    <description>Consistent with the parent ED-SAFE, a completed suicide screen will be defined as any chart documentation of the presence OR absence of suicidal ideation AND presence or absence of a past suicide attempt (0 = None documented, 1 = Partial (+/- ideation OR attempt noted), 2 = Complete (+/- ideation AND attempt noted). The proportion of general ED patients with a complete screen within each study phase will comprise the primary clinician-level outcome for analyses pertaining to screening (Aim 1). Sensitivity analyses will expand the definition to partial OR complete screens.</description>

    <description>Using the parent ED-SAFE criteria, a positive screen (i.e., detection) will be defined as any individual who either endorsed active ideation OR reported a lifetime suicide attempt.
