      This study will examine the cardiopulmonary interactions that occur with increasing&#xD;
      ventilator settings (PEEP and PIP) in neonates after stage I palliation for hypoplastic left&#xD;
      heart syndrome before and after sternal closure. Outcome measures include oxygen delivery and&#xD;
      cardiac output.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to define the impact of variable levels of PEEP and tidal&#xD;
      volume on hemodynamics and lung mechanics around delayed sternal closure after Stage 1&#xD;
      palliation in the single ventricle patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims of this work are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate hemodynamics and lung mechanics across a range of PEEP (2-12 cm H2O)&#xD;
      before and after chest closure, while maintaining consistent ventilation, in infants with&#xD;
      single ventricle physiology who undergo delayed sternal closure after Stage 1 palliation&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate hemodynamics and lung mechanics across a range of tidal volumes&#xD;
      (6-15ml/kg) and before and after chest closure, while maintaining consistent ventilation, in&#xD;
      infants with single ventricle physiology who undergo delayed sternal closure after Stage 1&#xD;
      palliation surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The effects of PEEP and tidal volume on hemodynamics and lung mechanics will be&#xD;
      significantly different before and after sternal closure. We expect that there will be little&#xD;
      effect of PEEP or tidal volume when the sternum remains open. Once the sternum is closed, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that those with shunted single ventricle physiology will have optimal oxygen&#xD;
      delivery and lung mechanics with modest PEEP and tidal volume (U-shaped curves).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Delayed sternal closure is commonly used to prevent tissue tamponade and promote&#xD;
      favorable hemodynamics in critically ill patients following surgery for congenital heart&#xD;
      disease. This technique is frequently employed in shunted single ventricle physiology (i.e.-&#xD;
      Norwood patients). While there have been several studies that have shown that sternal closure&#xD;
      is associated with temporary hemodynamic changes and stiffer lung mechanics, there have been&#xD;
      no prospective studies of the impact of different ventilator strategies on hemodynamics, and&#xD;
      lung mechanics before and after sternal closure. Because these patients are generally among&#xD;
      the most fragile postoperative patients, it is critical to understand if specific ventilator&#xD;
      strategies can help mitigate any negative hemodynamic consequences of chest closure. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to understand the critical cardiopulmonary interactions that occur&#xD;
      with delayed sternal closure in this population, and to determine optimal approaches to&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation under these different circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary interactions differ based on the underlying cardiac anatomy and physiology.&#xD;
      Most studies of cardiopulmonary interactions following surgery for congenital heart disease&#xD;
      have examined the difference between positive and negative pressure ventilation in those with&#xD;
      right ventricular restrictive physiology such as after tetralogy of Fallot repair, or after&#xD;
      cavopulmonary connection surgery. This work consistently shows improvement in cardiac output&#xD;
      and pulmonary blood flow with negative pressure ventilation. It is not practical, however, to&#xD;
      maintain negative pressure ventilation when the sternum remains open and it is not even clear&#xD;
      that the same cardiopulmonary interactions are at play in the absence of significant elastic&#xD;
      recoil forces of the chest wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, while patients with left ventricular dysfunction generally benefit from positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation, there is no data regarding the hemodynamic effects of positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation in left ventricular dysfunction when intrathoracic pressure will not deviate from&#xD;
      atmospheric, which is the situation with delayed sternal closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shunted single ventricle physiology is perhaps the most difficult for which to predict the&#xD;
      effects of different ventilator strategies before and after sternal closure. The combination&#xD;
      of parallel pulmonary and systemic circulations, less than optimal total cardiac output and,&#xD;
      most commonly, at least some pulmonary edema make it difficult to predict the ideal&#xD;
      ventilator strategy. Studies in this population have focused more on the effects of FiO2 and&#xD;
      hyperventilation than on respiratory mechanics and cardiopulmonary interactions.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, this work has shown that the occurrence of pulmonary venous desaturation is&#xD;
      common following stage 1 Norwood surgery, and it remains unknown if there is risk or benefit&#xD;
      from strategies such as lower or higher tidal volumes or lower or higher PEEP on hemodynamics&#xD;
      and oxygen delivery.&#xD;
