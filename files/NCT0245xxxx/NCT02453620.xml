      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat and nivolumab when&#xD;
      given together with ipilimumab in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment&#xD;
      (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer that has spread from where it started to&#xD;
      nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Entinostat may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth (locally&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving entinostat and nivolumab together with&#xD;
      ipilimumab may work better in treating in patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of entinostat and nivolumab&#xD;
      with or without ipilimumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of entinostat and&#xD;
      nivolumab with ipilimumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors and to further confirm the&#xD;
      safety of the combination therapy in subjects with advanced HER2-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether treatment with entinostat alone or in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab results in an increase in the ratio of tumor antigen-specific effector T cells&#xD;
      (Teff) to regulatory T cell (Treg) in tumor biopsies compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe preliminary anti-tumor activity of entinostat and nivolumab in combination&#xD;
      with or without ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity in an expansion cohort of patients with&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer treated at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore changes in immune-related biomarkers (e.g., expression of checkpoint receptors&#xD;
      [PD-1/PD-L1], the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], inflammatory T cell&#xD;
      signature, T cell receptor [TCR] repertoire) in tumor biopsies or peripheral blood&#xD;
      lymphocytes (PBL) pre- and post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate changes in immune-related biomarkers pre- and post-combination therapy with&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure tumor-specific mutations and mutant neo-antigens recognized by patient T&#xD;
      cells in tumor biopsies and to describe association with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate changes in frequency of T cells recognizing tumor-specific mutant&#xD;
      neo-antigens in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) pre- and post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate changes in candidate gene expression, including the azacitidine (AZA) immune&#xD;
      genes (AIM genes) in malignant tissue, gene methylation silencing in circulating&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and malignant tissue pre- and post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To correlate the pharmacodynamic outcomes (e.g., safety, efficacy, and changes in gene&#xD;
      methylation status) with the exposure of entinostat (i.e., pharmacokinetics) when&#xD;
      co-administered with nivolumab with or without ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To conduct pharmacogenomic association analyses to assess the potential clinical utility&#xD;
      of CD86 gene polymorphisms as genetic determinants of immune mediated adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days -14 and -7 and then weekly, nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 and then every 2 weeks, and ipilimumab IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes on day 1 and then every 6 weeks for 4 doses. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease&#xD;
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

                  tyrosine kinase inhibitors)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Trastuzumab &lt; 6 weeks prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Radiotherapy &lt; 3 weeks prior to registration (NOTE: a previously irradiated&#xD;
                  lesion may not be used as a target lesion unless there is evidence of&#xD;
                  post-radiation progression)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgery &lt; 3 weeks prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other approved or investigational agents &lt; 3 weeks prior to registration unless&#xD;
                  otherwise noted by the protocol chair&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received prior epigenetic (e.g., histone deacetylase [HDAC]&#xD;
                  inhibitors such as entinostat, panobinostat, vorinostat, romidepsin or&#xD;
                  demethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine or decitabine) immunomodulatory or&#xD;
                  other checkpoint inhibitors should only be considered after discussion with the&#xD;
                  protocol chair&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Those who have not recovered from acute adverse events to grade &lt; 2 or baseline&#xD;
                  due to agents administered, with exception of alopecia, unless approved by the&#xD;
                  protocol chair&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known sensitivity to or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition entinostat, nivolumab, or ipilimumab; history&#xD;
             of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might&#xD;
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment&#xD;
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded; these include but are not&#xD;
             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia&#xD;
             gravis, systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),&#xD;
             connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's,&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and patients with a history of toxic&#xD;
             epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should&#xD;
             be excluded; patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis&#xD;
             managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible;&#xD;
             patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and&#xD;
             psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such&#xD;
             as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the&#xD;
             presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but&#xD;
             should otherwise be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the&#xD;
             detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity; NOTE: subjects&#xD;
             must have baseline oxygen/saturation level requirements as above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active or untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases are&#xD;
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they&#xD;
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events; NOTE: Patients with previously treated brain&#xD;
             metastases must have stable neurologic status and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
             imaging following local therapy (surgery or radiation) for at least 4 weeks, with no&#xD;
             requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day&#xD;
             prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration&#xD;
             (stable low dose dexamethasone allowed at discretion of protocol chair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents have the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible; patients who have a positive test for hepatitis&#xD;
             B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab)/ribonucleic acid&#xD;
             (RNA) (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection are also ineligible (baseline&#xD;
             testing required); these are because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
             with the study agents; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be&#xD;
             undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease; patients are permitted to&#xD;
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids&#xD;
             (with minimal systemic absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if =&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring concurrent administration of valproic acid are also excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are&#xD;
             known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need&#xD;
             for additional treatment before coming on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Another active malignancy =&lt; 3 years prior to registration with the exception of&#xD;
             non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of any type; NOTE: if there is a&#xD;
             history of prior malignancy, they must not be receiving other specific treatment for&#xD;
             their cancer; any malignancy considered to be indolent and that has never required&#xD;
             therapy may allowed at the discretion of the protocol chair&#xD;
