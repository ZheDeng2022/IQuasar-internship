    <textblock>
      Hip fractures (broken hips) are common in older people, particularly older women with fragile&#xD;
      bones, and usually occur with a simple fall from a standing height. In Canada, over 28,000&#xD;
      hip fractures occur every year, and approximately 900 occur in Edmonton. After a hip&#xD;
      fracture, up to 50% of those who survive their hip fracture do not recover to the same level&#xD;
      of activity that they had before breaking their hip. Managing pain with any broken bone is&#xD;
      very important. For patients with hip fracture, their older age and fragile health makes pain&#xD;
      management even more challenging. Many patients with a hip fracture have reduced ability to&#xD;
      think clearly before the fracture. Some patients who have no difficulty with thinking before&#xD;
      their hip fracture will become confused for a brief period after their hip fracture or can&#xD;
      develop permanent difficulties with thinking. A hip fracture will usually require an&#xD;
      operation, and choosing the right pain medication before and after the operation is important&#xD;
      since many pain medications make confusion more likely. Permanent difficulty with thinking is&#xD;
      a common reason for poor recovery after hip fracture. Our study will look at use of a nerve&#xD;
      block to manage pain before patients have their operation. A nerve block provides local pain&#xD;
      relief without requiring patients to take the medication by mouth (oral) or through an&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) route. A nerve block before surgery may reduce the amount of oral and IV&#xD;
      pain medication needed by the patient both before and after their operation but still provide&#xD;
      good pain control with less confusion. This could lead to better recovery and allow more&#xD;
      patients to return to living in the community rather than long-term care.&#xD;

      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip fracture is a common injury in older people, with over 28,000 hip fractures occurring&#xD;
      annually in Canada. Approximately 900 hip fractures occur in Edmonton each year. More than&#xD;
      90% of hip fractures result from simple low-energy falls. Many patients who survive do not&#xD;
      recover to pre-fracture functional levels and may require permanent long-term care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate goal of treatment is to control pain while preparing the patient for surgery;&#xD;
      greater than 95% of hip fracture patients are treated with surgery to restore mechanical&#xD;
      stability and manage pain. Pain after hip fracture has been associated with delirium,&#xD;
      depression, sleep disturbance, and decreased recovery. However, in the elderly population,&#xD;
      narcotics are also associated with similar side effects such as delirium, cardiovascular and&#xD;
      respiratory depression and nausea. This is complicated further in hip fracture patients, in&#xD;
      whom pre-existing dementia is common - up to 50% of patients will present with altered&#xD;
      cognition. Most studies that examine pain management interventions after hip fracture exclude&#xD;
      those with pre-existing dementia. Further research to determine the feasibility of including&#xD;
      subjects with cognitive impairment in pain management studies is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anaesthesia can reduce post-operative narcotic use. However, few randomized studies&#xD;
      have examined the impact of preoperative regional anesthesia on postoperative outcomes.&#xD;
      Effective pain management can affect long-term outcomes: poorly managed pain is associated&#xD;
      with delayed ambulation, pulmonary complications, and delayed hospital discharge. Our&#xD;
      previous work found limited evidence that nerve blocks may have benefits for hip fracture&#xD;
      patients. Other prospective studies have reported the effectiveness of single nerve blocks in&#xD;
      reducing narcotic use in Emergency rooms. Continuous preoperative femoral nerve blockade&#xD;
      (CFNB) offers the potential benefit of reducing pain in these often frail patients well&#xD;
      avoiding adverse outcomes such as delirium. Further work is needed to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness, timing, and safety of a preoperative CFNB on preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes in the frail hip fracture population, including those with cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of a definitive randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) that examines the effect of preoperative CFNB in patients with hip fracture,&#xD;
      including those with cognitive impairment. Specifically, the investigators will examine 1)&#xD;
      Eligibility/recruitment rates; 2) Treatment fidelity; 3) Outcome selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine the impact of pre-operative CFNB in patients with hip&#xD;
      fracture on the following outcomes within five days of surgery: 1) Proportion of patients&#xD;
      with delirium and duration of delirium; 2) Daily pain levels; 3) Total narcotic utilization;&#xD;
      4) Proportion of patients mobilized on postoperative day 1; 4) Readiness for hospital&#xD;
      discharge; 5) Complications in hospital, including mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that pre-operative CFNB will be feasible in this population and&#xD;
      will decrease: delirium frequency / duration, pain, and narcotic requirement; will increase&#xD;
      the number of patients mobilized on post-operative day 1; and reduce complications and time&#xD;
      to readiness for discharge.Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Framework: A complex intervention framework will be used to explore the impact of&#xD;
      preoperative CFNB in patients with hip fracture on both preoperative and early postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes. The work proposed will undertake initial steps to identify appropriate subjects and&#xD;
      assess feasibility and impact of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Study Design: Inception cohort of 75 participants using a concurrent control group with&#xD;
      2:1 allocation of intervention and control subjects. This will allow comparison of outcomes&#xD;
      between groups as well as sub-analyses within the intervention group (n=50) to examine&#xD;
      treatment fidelity and potential confounding. Although the investigators may be under-powered&#xD;
      in this pilot study, they will determine the numbers needed for a future RCT. The proposed&#xD;
      sub-analyses will allow us to determine if those with cognitive impairment can be&#xD;
      appropriately treated with a CFNB and adequately assessed and if there is an optimal&#xD;
      preoperative time frame in which CFNB should be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Subjects who score â‰¥13 on the MMSE, consent to participate, and are recruited&#xD;
      within 20 hours of ward presentation will be allocated to receive pre-operative CFNB. Twenty&#xD;
      hours was selected as the maximum time that the CFNB could be delayed after presentation to&#xD;
      hospital and expect to have an impact on pain management based on anecdotal experience of our&#xD;
      Acute Pain Service (APS) team members. The APS will administer the CFNB using a standardized&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care (Control group): Subjects enrolled after 20 hours of hospital admission (due to&#xD;
      delays in obtaining consent) will be allocated to the control group provided that a CAM,&#xD;
      required on ward admission as per the hip fracture pathway, was done within 6 hours of ward&#xD;
      admission to assess baseline delirium. The investigators do not anticipate selection bias as&#xD;
      suitable numbers of patients who are consented before and after 20 hours of admission to the&#xD;
      ward should occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral Nerve Blockade: The side of hip fracture is identified and marked. With the patient&#xD;
      lying supine, the groin is exposed and prepared with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate/70% isopropyl&#xD;
      alcohol. A 13-6 MHz high frequency linear ultrasound probe is placed just distal to the&#xD;
      lateral edge of the femoral crease and orientated parallel to the crease. The probe is then&#xD;
      moved medially, inferior and parallel to the femoral crease, to identify the common femoral&#xD;
      artery. The femoral nerve is then identified lateral to the artery and deep to fascia iliaca.&#xD;
      Two milliliters of 1% lidocaine is infiltrated subcutaneously at the lateral edge of the&#xD;
      probe using a 3 mL syringe and a 25G needle to provide anesthesia to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 21G x 95 mm catheter-over-needle assembly is inserted 'in-plane' to the ultrasound probe&#xD;
      from the lateral edge of the probe and directed medially under direct visualization to the&#xD;
      target position - deep to the fascia iliaca, between the femoral nerve and iliopsoas muscle.&#xD;
      The spread of 5 mL dextrose 5% in water injected through the needle confirms correct&#xD;
      position. The catheter needle is removed, and the first dose of 20 mL local anesthetic&#xD;
      mixture (0.5% Ropivacaine and 0.125% Bupivacaine) is bolused through the catheter using a&#xD;
      syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after, the catheter is secured with a Tegaderm dressing and then connected to an&#xD;
      infusion pump programmed to deliver a continuous 1 mL/hr infusion and 4 mL/hr bolus regime of&#xD;
      0.2% Ropivacaine. The infusion/bolus regime is continued until just prior to surgery, at&#xD;
      which point, it is discontinued and the catheter bolused with a further 20 mL of local&#xD;
      anesthetic mixture prior to catheter removal. Following the regional anesthetic intervention,&#xD;
      the subjects are returned to the Orthopaedic ward to await routine surgical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery: Surgery within 24-48 hours of admission reduces morbidity and mortality after hip&#xD;
      fracture. Over 80% of patients at the UAH are treated within 48 hours of admission. Surgical&#xD;
      care will be determined by fracture pattern and patient factors as well perioperative&#xD;
      anaesthesia. Study allocation will not affect surgical priority. Both groups will receive&#xD;
      routine care pre- and postoperatively as per the clinical pathway, aside from the&#xD;
      intervention group receiving the CFNB preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Baseline data will consist of demographic (e.g., age, gender, residence),&#xD;
      medical (cognition (MMSE), delirium (CAM), comorbidities) data and pain using a Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) for those without cognitive impairment and a validated non-verbal pain&#xD;
      scale for those with cognitive impairment. Preoperatively, research staff will collect&#xD;
      narcotic and non-narcotic analgesic consumption, CAM scores that are performed each shift&#xD;
      (i.e., 2 times/day). Pain at rest and with activity will be collected two times/day, between&#xD;
      9-10 am and again between 3-4 pm. During weekend hours, the APS team will collect pain&#xD;
      scores. Post-operative data collection will occur until postoperative day 5 or discharge,&#xD;
      whichever is sooner. Delirium and pain at rest and with activity will be assessed twice daily&#xD;
      as per the preoperative protocol. Narcotic and non-narcotic analgesic utilization will be&#xD;
      recorded. The research staff will record when subjects first mobilize (i.e., got up out of&#xD;
      bed) and subjects' readiness for discharge (as per the clinical pathway). Complications will&#xD;
      also be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process evaluation will assist in determining: 1) Recruitment rate: All patients with hip&#xD;
      fracture admitted during the enrollment period will be screened to determine the recruitment&#xD;
      rate and generalizability of the cohort; 2) Treatment Fidelity: Defined as delivering the&#xD;
      intervention as it was intended, this will be determined by assessing a) the number of&#xD;
      Intervention subjects who received the CFNB as prescribed b) the impact of time to CFNB to&#xD;
      determine if an optimal preoperative window for the CFNB exists, c) the impact of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment on the intervention's effect and the ability to assess outcomes; 3) Outcome&#xD;
      Selection: The investigators will evaluate the following issues around outcomes- a) selecting&#xD;
      a responsive and appropriate primary outcome measure, b) determining the appropriate time to&#xD;
      measure the intervention's impact (i.e., at a single point in time or impact over time), c)&#xD;
      comparability of verbal and non-verbal pain assessment, d) completion rate for the clinical&#xD;
      pathway elements. The intervention evaluation will determine the impact of preoperative CFNB&#xD;
      by comparing outcomes between groups using T-tests and repeated measures analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Our primary&#xD;
      outcome measure for this evaluation will be comparison of delirium between groups using the&#xD;
      CAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following standardized outcome measures will be used: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for&#xD;
      Pain Assessment - Pain at rest and activity will be measured using an 11-point VAS (0-10), a&#xD;
      reliable and valid method of measuring patient-reported pain. The Checklist of Non-verbal&#xD;
      Pain Indicators (CNPI) has been shown to be reliable and valid in the non-verbal assessment&#xD;
      of patients with hip fracture and cognitive impairment. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)&#xD;
      is able to distinguish between dementia and delirium and can detect delirium in the presence&#xD;
      of dementia. Narcotic Consumption - All narcotic medication will be recorded. The total&#xD;
      amount of narcotic used will be measured using a morphine equivalency scale with the&#xD;
      resulting equivalents totaled to give a single score reflecting the total narcotics used.&#xD;
