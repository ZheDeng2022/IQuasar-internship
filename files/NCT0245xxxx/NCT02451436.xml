      Introduction. Over the last 30 years, the obesity rate in adolescents has more than tripled,&#xD;
      and more than one-third of adolescents were obese in 2010. Many of the complications&#xD;
      associated with obesity, including glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and&#xD;
      markers of inflammation such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), are&#xD;
      already present in adolescence. The incidence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents has also&#xD;
      increased, especially in minorities. Current lifestyle interventions for obesity and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes focused on altering energy balance have not shown promising long-term outcomes.&#xD;
      Further research is needed to better understand factors that alter metabolism in order to&#xD;
      create more effective interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As obesity and type 2 diabetes rates have risen, adolescents' sleep duration has decreased.&#xD;
      Despite requiring more sleep than other children, adolescents often do not obtain adequate&#xD;
      sleep. There are many reasons for this decrease in sleep, including delayed circadian rhythm,&#xD;
      increased academic demands and extracurricular activities, minimal parental supervision and&#xD;
      increased media use. Media use among adolescents has increased significantly over the last 5&#xD;
      years and has been shown to affect adolescents' sleep. It has also been found to be an&#xD;
      etiological factor in adolescent obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies with adolescents and adults suggest that inadequate sleep duration and&#xD;
      poor sleep quality are associated with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, increased&#xD;
      ghrelin and increased markers of inflammation. However, no previous study has successfully&#xD;
      examined the effects of a longer-term sleep intervention on factors related to obesity and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. We propose that short sleep and poor sleep quality may lead to obesity and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes through 2 mechanisms: 1) increased ghrelin, which can lead to increased food&#xD;
      intake, decreased energy expenditure and impaired glycemic control, and 2) decreased insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, which also increases insulin. These changes in energy balance and metabolism&#xD;
      could lead to weight gain over time and increase adolescents' risk for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This study aims to assess the effects of a sleep and media use intervention on&#xD;
      adolescent body composition, ghrelin and insulin sensitivity. In a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial, 15-17 year olds who are obese and who do not obtain adequate sleep will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of two groups: a sleep intervention group or a study skills control group. The sleep&#xD;
      intervention group will receive four sessions including cognitive behavioral training aimed&#xD;
      at increasing sleep duration, education on the effects of media use on sleep and problem&#xD;
      solving with the participant and parent about increasing sleep duration and decreasing&#xD;
      nighttime media use. The control group will receive four sessions of study skills training.&#xD;
      Sleep duration will be measured by actigraphy, television use will be measured by the TV&#xD;
      Allowance device (Family Safe Media, Salt Lake City, UT), and cell phone use will be measured&#xD;
      by cellular provider reports and the Break Free mobile application (Mobifolio). Blood draws&#xD;
      will be performed 7 days before and after the intervention and at the 3-month follow-up. Body&#xD;
      composition will be assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses and Specific Aims. Primary Aim. Conduct a two-arm parallel group randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of the relative effects of an intervention for adolescent sleep duration and&#xD;
      media use on adolescents' sleep duration and quality, insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      appetite-regulating hormones and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days after the end of the intervention and at the 3-month follow-up, adolescents in the&#xD;
      sleep intervention group compared to the control group will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Increased sleep duration and sleep quality H2: Increased insulin sensitivity H3:&#xD;
      Decreased ghrelin H4: Decreased percent body fat H5: Associations between sleep duration and&#xD;
      quality and insulin sensitivity, ghrelin and percent body fat Secondary Aim. Evaluate whether&#xD;
      the sleep intervention affects adolescents' nighttime media use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Adolescents in the sleep intervention group will have decreased nighttime media use (cell&#xD;
      phone, internet and television) compared with the control group at both the end of the study&#xD;
      and the 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim. Evaluate the effects of an intervention for adolescent sleep duration and&#xD;
      media use on adolescents' hs-CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future. Results of this preliminary study will shed light on the impact of a sleep and media&#xD;
      use intervention for adolescents in reducing obesity and risk for type 2 diabetes in&#xD;
      adolescents. These data will provide support for a future R01 submission testing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a sleep intervention in the context of a larger, well-powered study. It will&#xD;
      also provide the foundation for further testing of the mechanisms of action in the&#xD;
      relationship between sleep and obesity and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the impact of COVID-19 shutdown and virtual school on health, participants&#xD;
      who had previously completed at least one blood draw and DXA prior to March 2020 were&#xD;
      recruited to complete an additional fasting blood draw and DXA scan in Fall of 2020.&#xD;
