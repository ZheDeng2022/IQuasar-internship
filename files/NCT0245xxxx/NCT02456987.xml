  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted as a pilot to test the feasibility, usability, acceptability,&#xD;
      and clinical utility of using a virtual reality (VR) immersion experience in the inpatient&#xD;
      setting. In addition to determining whether the patients enjoy the experience and would like&#xD;
      to participate in a future more tailored immersion in virtual reality, we will be attempting&#xD;
      to determine whether there are any positive impacts on their visit, including a distraction&#xD;
      from their pain or anxiety associated with their procedures or the reason they have been&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the inpatient population at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) is dynamic and&#xD;
      diagnostically diverse, we intend to develop a series of VR interventions that broadly&#xD;
      address patient concerns. VR has only been tested in select patient populations, so we are&#xD;
      equally interested in the feasibility of deploying VR across the inpatient hospital&#xD;
      environment as we are in demonstrating some effectiveness in reducing pain and anxiety, and&#xD;
      improving satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study has the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapting existing VR environments for inpatients with a variety of impairments,&#xD;
           utilizing cost-effective VR hardware (Phase 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the usability and acceptability of the VR equipment and software by hospital&#xD;
           inpatients by conducting qualitative interviews (Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the clinical utility of the VR intervention by measuring patient reported&#xD;
           outcomes using a modified care satisfaction survey, administered to inpatients receiving&#xD;
           VR and a matched control sample (Phase 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning Aims 2 and 3, we hypothesize the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inpatients will find the VR intervention helpful and enjoyable, and will believe that&#xD;
           its benefits outweigh any difficulties encountered using the hardware or software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inpatients who are exposed to the VR intervention will report significantly improved&#xD;
           pain management, greater satisfaction with their inpatient visit, and greater overall&#xD;
           health compared to matched control inpatients that were not exposed to VR.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent advances in Virtual Reality (VR) technology have made it possible for researchers to&#xD;
      develop interventions for a wide variety of disease states, including obesity, pain, impaired&#xD;
      motor functioning, and anxiety. Over the last decade, improvements in software and hardware&#xD;
      design, as well as associated cost reductions, have made VR a practical tool for widespread&#xD;
      use, rather than an expensive novelty. Interventions that would not be possible or practical&#xD;
      in the real world have been developed in the virtual world, resulting in immersive&#xD;
      multi-sensory (primarily audio-visual) experiences that can distract patients from painful&#xD;
      experiences and motivate them to achieve personal goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR environments allow patients to visualize non-disease states, and practice living more&#xD;
      healthily, whether the focus is stroke rehabilitation, exposure therapy for social anxiety,&#xD;
      or simply interacting with the world with reduced pain levels. A number of studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the efficacy of VR interventions, and all of them are built around this basic&#xD;
      premise. For example, a meta-analysis of diagnosis-specific exposure therapies for anxiety&#xD;
      disorders - PTSD, agoraphobia/panic disorder, social anxiety, and animal phobias) reports&#xD;
      large effects (Cohen's Q-statistic &gt;0.80) for VR interventions on symptom reports at therapy&#xD;
      termination.1 Similarly, a meta-analysis of post-stroke motor rehabilitation VR interventions&#xD;
      reports that, in observational studies, patients experience significantly reduced impairment&#xD;
      (14.7%) and improved motor functioning (20.1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital inpatients will most likely benefit from VR as a distraction from acute pain during&#xD;
      procedures, painful drug infusions, adverse side effects of treatments, or from boredom and&#xD;
      inactivity, which could lead to increased reports of distress and reduced satisfaction with&#xD;
      care. Several areas of research may provide a useful model for bringing VR distraction&#xD;
      interventions to all types of hospital inpatients. A recent review by Li and colleagues&#xD;
      (2012) highlighted advances in these treatment areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the most widely studied form of VR interventions is the reduction of pain and&#xD;
      anxiety associated with burn care. Compared to use of analgesic medication alone, patients&#xD;
      who use VR distraction interventions in combination with analgesic drugs have reported&#xD;
      reduced pain and distress during burn wound care across most studies, and both lower pain&#xD;
      ratings and increased range of motion during physical therapy in some studies. Use of a VR&#xD;
      distraction environment called SnowWorld - developed by H.G. Hoffman and colleagues, and&#xD;
      employed across many of these studies - allows burn patients to move through ice canyon and&#xD;
      play with snow. Additions of VR hypnosis and relaxation modules to SnowWorld have also been&#xD;
      tested in burn patients, with mixed results; patients undergoing hypnosis reported lower pain&#xD;
      and anxiety levels, but those undergoing relaxation while receiving morphine reported higher&#xD;
      pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of cancer patients have demonstrated some efficacy for use of VR in patients&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy and lumbar punctures. Although pain scores are often reduced in a&#xD;
      direction favoring the use of VR, studies to date have not demonstrated conclusive, long term&#xD;
      benefits for symptom reduction. However, patients do report short perceived time in&#xD;
      treatment, reduced physiological arousal during treatment, and lower perceived pain during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During routine medical procedures, VR delivered via a head-mounted display demonstrated some&#xD;
      promising effects. In a study of outpatients having blood drawn, those receiving the most&#xD;
      immersive VR reported lower levels of moderate to severe pain. In a similar study of patients&#xD;
      having an IV placed for CT scan contrast, those receiving VR reported no change in pain&#xD;
      level, compared to standard care patients who reported a four-fold increase in pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR has also been used for the treatment of chronic pain. In a sample of adults with chronic&#xD;
      neck pain, use of a VR mirror visual feedback environment resulted in promising but&#xD;
      non-significant reported pain reductions. In another study of patients with chronic neck&#xD;
      pain, a single session of VR that encouraged increased range of motion (by spraying at&#xD;
      flies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, many of these studies (except for chronic neck pain patients) were conducted using&#xD;
      child and adolescent populations. This group may be more receptive to VR, given common&#xD;
      exposure to video games and screen-based entertainment. Nevertheless, the use of VR for all&#xD;
      patients should be studied further, as the intervention may present a novel and&#xD;
      cost-effective method of improving patient experiences and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR interventions have been used as distractions or diversions during medical procedures. This&#xD;
      study will be one of the first to test the feasibility of deploying low-cost VR interventions&#xD;
      in a nonsurgical inpatient hospital setting. The VR hardware configuration and all software&#xD;
      is currently being developed by AppliedVR, a leader in the development of medical&#xD;
      applications for virtual reality technology, including interventions for weight loss and&#xD;
      health, safety training, education, and personal development.&#xD;
