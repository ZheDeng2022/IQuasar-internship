    <textblock>
      Pain is a subjective sensation which in children can only be experienced and most times not&#xD;
      expressed. Pain management in children thus falls short of their adult counterparts. Acute&#xD;
      pain of surgery causes significant suffering and stress. In children, pain management has&#xD;
      lagged behind because of the belief that children's pain receptors are less well developed&#xD;
      than their adult counterparts. However this has been proven to be false as development of&#xD;
      pain receptors has been shown by 26th week of gestation. Caudal analgesia with plain&#xD;
      bupivacaine has been used for effective post operative analgesia. Resources sometimes limit&#xD;
      acquisition of additives to bupivacaine to be delivered into the intrathecal space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fear of pharmacological adverse effects of opioids has restricted their use especially&#xD;
      among the anesthesia officers who deliver the bulk of anesthesia services in Uganda and this&#xD;
      has led to poor pain management in pediatric populations Mulago national referral hospital is&#xD;
      a resource limited centre with regards to human resource, equipment and drugs. This is mainly&#xD;
      due to lack of sufficient funds and large volume of patients with the nursing staff being&#xD;
      overwhelmed by the patient capacity. Drug administration is often not done on time and&#xD;
      continuous assessment of pain scores in children is not adequate resulting in poor post&#xD;
      operative pain management. Pain control thus will depend on analgesia provided at the time of&#xD;
      operation creating a need for prolonged pain control measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies done have compared intravenous morphine administration versus caudal analgesia and&#xD;
      are mostly focused of sub umbilical surgery however none has been done in our setting.&#xD;
      Bupivacaine and morphine are now more readily available and can be used for post operative&#xD;
      analgesia. However studies on the timing to the next analgesic requirement have not been&#xD;
      compared/done in Mulago national referral hospital.&#xD;

      Patients will be wheeled into the operating theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anaesthesia will be induced using an inhalation anaesthetic (sevoflurane) and&#xD;
           intravenous anaesthetic using propofol or thiopental for the older children (3 years and&#xD;
           above).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance of anaesthesia will be done using either inhalation anaesthetic&#xD;
           (sevoflurane)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-operative analgesia will be maintained with intravenous fentanyl given at the&#xD;
           start of surgery and hourly for surgeries longer than one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring intra and post operatively will be done with WHO standard monitoring. (Blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, saturation, temperature, ECG, End tidal carbon dioxide).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention will be given at the end of surgery after the last stitch has been&#xD;
           placed with patient receiving either caudal bupivacaine or intravenous morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to receive a caudal the baby will be placed in the left lateral position knees and hips&#xD;
           flexed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The skin over the coccyx and sacrum will be cleansed with povidone-iodine solution and&#xD;
           alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After palpation of the sacral cornua, a 22- or 23-gauge needle will be placed into the&#xD;
           sacral hiatus to identify the epidural space by loss of resistance as the needle passes&#xD;
           through the sacral ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspiration will be done to check for cerebrospinal fluid or blood, then a test dose is&#xD;
           administered to rule out intravenous injection then the drug caudal bupivacaine will be&#xD;
           injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients' pain scores will be assessed by the research assistant in the post&#xD;
           anaesthesia care unit after 30 minutes before being discharged to their parent wards and&#xD;
           hourly after the intervention is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  monitoring of pulse rate and saturation on the ward will be done with a pulse oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the ward the pain scores will be assessed every hour by the research assistant and&#xD;
           time to a pain score of 4 recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pain scores and the time to the next analgesic requirement will be recorded and&#xD;
           continuation of analgesia given with intravenous paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The crying, requires oxygen, increased vital signs, expression, sleeplessness (CRIES) pain&#xD;
      tool will be used to score pain in neonates and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and&#xD;
      Consolability (FLACC) pain score used in children above 2 months. Analgesic requirement will&#xD;
      be given if child found to be in pain.&#xD;
