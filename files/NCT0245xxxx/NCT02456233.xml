  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study will assess the safety and efficacy of FIRM-guided ablation&#xD;
      (FIRM+PVI) compared to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) without FIRM, for the treatment of&#xD;
      symptomatic atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects over 2 millions Americans. AF may reduce cardiac performance&#xD;
      and may result in thrombus formation in the left atrium and thromboembolic events, such as&#xD;
      stroke. Ablation to eliminate the causes of this arrhythmia is increasingly performed since&#xD;
      pharmacological therapy is suboptimal. Ablation currently targets triggers, by ablating left&#xD;
      atrial areas outside the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein isolation, PVI) in subjects with&#xD;
      symptomatic AF who have failed drugs. Unfortunately, this has mixed success with the best&#xD;
      outcomes being 50-70% freedom from AF at 1 year post ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major issue with AF therapy is the lack of knowledge about critical regions of the heart&#xD;
      that cause and sustain AF. A recent trial (STAR-AF2) showed that ablating regions empirically&#xD;
      - i.e. without defining their role in AF(lines or fractionated electrograms) - did not&#xD;
      improve patient outcomes compared to PVI alone (Verma et al, NEJM 2015). However, this leaves&#xD;
      us with PVI that had a 50% success rate in that trial and in several other trials even for&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that guiding ablation to critical arrhythmia-targeting zones will improve&#xD;
      success over PVI alone. Specifically, we hypothesize that computational mapping of AF will&#xD;
      find small regions called rotors and focal sources and ablate them, called Focal Impulse and&#xD;
      Rotor Modulation (FIRM) ablation, shows promise at eliminating AF substrates. In many single&#xD;
      center trials, FIRM improves results from PVI alone. This will be among the first randomized&#xD;
      comparisons of FIRM ablation compared to PVI alone, and addresses an important question in&#xD;
      the field.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  hypertension (1 point)&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Patient is willing and able to remain on anti-coagulation therapy for a minimum of 3&#xD;
             months post procedure for all subjects, and potentially indefinitely post procedure if&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Left atrial diameter &lt;or= 5.5cm (CT or MRI preprocedure, or intracardiac&#xD;
             echocardiography, with documented image of largest dimension)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. LVEF &gt;or= 40%&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Sustained AF during procedure: If the patient does not experience spontaneous&#xD;
             sustained AF (&gt;10 min) during the procedure, typically in paroxysmal AF patients,&#xD;
             sustained AF will be induced in routine fashion by burst pacing initially from the&#xD;
             coronary sinus, then from other sites, then with isoproterenol infusion. Using&#xD;
             intensive AF induction methods (Narayan, J Cardiovasc EP; 2012; 23(5): 447-454)&#xD;
             sustained AF is induced in &gt; 90% of paroxysmal AF patients presenting in sinus rhythm.&#xD;
             If AF cannot be sustained, the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
             protocol and the patient will undergo AF ablation per physician direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
