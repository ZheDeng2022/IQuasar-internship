      This protocol is designed to determine if a transition from barrel-shaped cuff designs to the&#xD;
      Taperguard endotracheal tube (ETT) reduces the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in a&#xD;
      prospective evaluation of a large general, vascular, orthopedic, urologic and neurologic&#xD;
      surgical population. The protocol was originally developed as a quality assurance project to&#xD;
      evaluate a practice change that took place December 1, 2012. Data regarding postoperative&#xD;
      pneumonia and related factors will be reviewed for the 18 months prior to the practice change&#xD;
      and compared to data from the 14.5 months following the change. Since the results may be of&#xD;
      interest to a wider audience, we are converting the project to a research study that may be&#xD;
      published in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include data from all adult patients who had surgery at OHSU between June 1,&#xD;
      2011 and February 15, 2014. We anticipate that we will enroll approximately 40,000 subjects&#xD;
      (at least 22,000 in the pre-intervention group and at least 16,000 in the post-intervention&#xD;
      group). Data will be gathered from the OHSU electronic medical record system (Centricity and&#xD;
      Epic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. A multiple logistic regression analysis will be employed to determine the rates of&#xD;
      pneumonia between the use of a standard barrel-cuff designed ETT and the Taperguard ETT for&#xD;
      the defined group of surgical patients. The regression analysis would be adjusted for&#xD;
      confounding variables including ASA status, age, use of paralytic, RSI with cricoid pressure,&#xD;
      weight, pre-existing lung disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication from tracheal intubation and&#xD;
      ventilation. The incidence of this complication is poorly defined but ranges to as high as&#xD;
      21% in surgical intensive care units.1-4 Efforts to reduce these events have evaluated&#xD;
      various endotracheal tube (ETT) configurations and changes in clinical practice. Regarding&#xD;
      endotracheal tubes, the use of supraglottic suctioning offers patient benefit.5-10 However, a&#xD;
      definitive benefit for supraglottic suctioning exists only for patients with prolonged&#xD;
      ventilation11. While there may be benefit to supraglottic suctioning for shorter periods of&#xD;
      ventilation, the lower incidence of pneumonia in this group makes clinical evaluation less&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Taperguard tubeâ„¢ (Covidien, Boulder, CO) is designed to prevent micro aspiration around&#xD;
      channels that otherwise form with a barrel-shaped cuff. Laboratory evidence suggests less&#xD;
      passage of fluid around the tube then conventional barrel-shaped cuffs (Batchelder, IARS&#xD;
      Abstract 2010). Furthermore, a clinical model in pigs suggests less chemical injury from&#xD;
      aspiration compared to a barrel shaped cuff (Lichtenthal, Abstract Critical Care 2010,&#xD;
      14(Suppl 1):P229). Human clinical studies are limited to data on reduced dye leakage compared&#xD;
      to barrel-shaped cuffs (Mulier, ASA abstracts; D'Haese Acta Anaesthesiol Scand 2013).12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no evidence that patients with brief ventilation such as those undergoing&#xD;
      routine surgery may benefit from actual outcomes with this tapered shape compared to regular&#xD;
      tubes. Because the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in these patients is lower than those&#xD;
      with prolonged ventilation, a large clinical data set would be necessary to evaluate any&#xD;
      potential difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2011, Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) has been documenting patient clinical&#xD;
      care in a comprehensive point-of-care electronic medical record system (Centricity, General&#xD;
      Electric, Fairfield, CT; EPIC, Verona, WI). This information can be collated to provide easy&#xD;
      access to co-morbidities, clinical interventions, and ICD-9 discharge codes. In addition,&#xD;
      OHSU is part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP). OHSU has been a&#xD;
      collaborator in this effort since 2006 and collects data on 1,400 patients annually for&#xD;
      vascular and general surgery patients (IRB 4621).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identified incidence of postoperative pneumonia in our NSQIP patients at OHSU is 1.9%.&#xD;
      This incidence is slightly below the national NSQIP average and below the risk-adjusted&#xD;
      expected rate of postoperative pneumonia. With a large surgical population and access to&#xD;
      detailed quality data from our electronic medical record system, OHSU lends itself well to a&#xD;
      clinical investigation to improve patient care. As investigators, we have extensive&#xD;
      experience with management of data systems for detailing patient outcomes.13&#xD;
&#xD;
      On December 1, 2012, OHSU instituted a practice change to transition from endotracheal tubes&#xD;
      with a barrel-shaped cuff design to the Taperguard tube for all surgical patients. A quality&#xD;
      assurance program was set up to monitor patient outcomes, including postoperative pneumonia,&#xD;
      before and after this practice change. The investigators have developed this protocol as an&#xD;
      expansion of the quality assurance program, to determine how this practice change has&#xD;
      affected patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a chart review to collect data from all adult surgical patients at&#xD;
      OHSU for the 18 months prior to the practice change (June 1, 2011 - November 30, 2012) and&#xD;
      compare it to data for all adult patients having surgery during the 14.5 months following the&#xD;
      practice change (December 1, 2012 - February 15, 2014). Subjects will be excluded if&#xD;
      anesthesia was provided using a Hi-Lo, double lumen, reinforced, or laser endotracheal tube&#xD;
      or a laryngeal mask airway. Data will be collected from the OHSU electronic medical records&#xD;
      (Centricity and EPIC). We will gather all ICD-9 discharge coding related to postoperative&#xD;
      pneumonia and link it to pertinent information from the patient's anesthesia record,&#xD;
      including demographic and surgical case information. Postoperative pneumonia will be defined&#xD;
      using the NSQIP definition (listed at the end of this protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that we will enroll approximately 40,000 subjects in the study. The identified&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative pneumonia at OHSU currently is 1.9%. A power analysis was&#xD;
      conducted to determine a meaningful sample size in light of a predicted improvement in&#xD;
      pneumonia outcomes. To demonstrate a risk reduction from 1.9% to 1.5% with 80% power and 0.05&#xD;
      significance, 22,000 patients would need to be enrolled in the pre-intervention group and&#xD;
      16,000 patients in the post-intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary source of data for this study is the electronic medical record. The NSQIP&#xD;
      database may be used for comparison and verification of the data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, there have been no active institutional changes to address&#xD;
      postoperative pneumonia and none are anticipated in the near future. Anesthesia techniques&#xD;
      are not undergoing any major changes to address pneumonia outcomes and compliance with&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotic administration is optimized at OHSU. Similarly, the intensive care&#xD;
      units implement a &quot;bundle&quot; practice to reduce pneumonia that includes GI prophylaxis,&#xD;
      tracheal suctioning, elevated head of bed positioning, sedation vacation with spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing trial once a day, and targeted antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multiple logistic regression analysis will be employed to determine the rates of pneumonia&#xD;
      between the use of a standard barrel-cuff designed ETT and the Taperguard ETT for the defined&#xD;
      group of surgical patients. The regression analysis would be adjusted for confounding&#xD;
      variables including ASA status, age, use of paralytic, RSI with cricoid pressure, weight,&#xD;
      pre-existing lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While patient benefit from potential reduced micro aspiration may be assumed from preliminary&#xD;
      data, additional costs associated with this new technology are not warranted without evidence&#xD;
      of patient care benefit or reduced patient care costs. The ultimate outcome desired when&#xD;
      selecting endotracheal tube and ventilation strategy is a reduction in lung injury,&#xD;
      morbidity, and reduced costs. Because this new technology offers potential benefit, it is&#xD;
      imperative that a large-scale clinical study confirm the hypothesis that pneumonia is reduced&#xD;
      by altering cuff design before a change in practice can be advocated. Estimates of&#xD;
      cost-savings achieved from potential positive data can be constructed. In this manner, the&#xD;
      Taperguard tube has potential to demonstrate savings for hospitals and improved patient care.&#xD;
