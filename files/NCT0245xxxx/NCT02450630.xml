  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uganda's under-five mortality is high, currently estimated at 90/1000 live births (Uganda&#xD;
      Bureau of Statistics 2011). Poor referral of sick children that seek care from the private&#xD;
      sector is one of the contributory factors. The proposed intervention aims to improve uptake&#xD;
      of referral advice for children that seek care from private facilities (registered drug&#xD;
      shops/private clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be implemented in Mukono district, central Uganda selected because a recent&#xD;
      concluded trial in the district showed that drug shop vendors (DSVs) adhere to diagnostic&#xD;
      test results, treat appropriately and refer sick children; although uptake of referral is&#xD;
      poor. The main reasons attributed to the observed poor referral were negative attitude&#xD;
      towards referral forms from drugs shops by the health workers at referral&#xD;
      facilities,perceptions of poor quality of care at referral facilities and costs involved&#xD;
      (Hutchinson. 2012; Hutchinson et al. 2013 in press)..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the proposed project is a follow up to address these factors with the aim to improve&#xD;
      uptake of referral. This project is in line with the Uganda's Health sector and USAID&#xD;
      Mission's health priorities of strengthening the health system. Critical barriers in the&#xD;
      implementation of child survival interventions are poor quality of care in the private sector&#xD;
      and timely referral and uptake of referral advice at community level. These barriers may be&#xD;
      attributed to inadequate training of providers in the private sector (in diagnosis and&#xD;
      management of childhood illnesses); inadequate supervision and regulation; poor linkages and&#xD;
      collaboration between the public and private sectors; and non-existent linkages between&#xD;
      community structures and the private sector. The barriers will be addressed through an&#xD;
      intervention with three components; i) VHTs will be trained to do community sensitization and&#xD;
      initiate community discussions aimed at identifying community support mechanisms for&#xD;
      financial hardship (to be community led and managed) - e.g. communities to be encouraged to&#xD;
      establish community credit/insurance schemes for referral VHTs will register children and&#xD;
      facilitate follow up of sick children ii) supervision of providers in the private sector to&#xD;
      diagnose, treat and refer sick children, iii) regular meetings between the public and private&#xD;
      providers (convened by the district health team) to discuss the referral system.&#xD;

      Research Questions/Goals and Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: The study aims to answer the question whether integrated intervention of&#xD;
      VHT registration of children (registration of children will enable follow up by VHTs),&#xD;
      community sensitization and regular meetings between the public and private providers on&#xD;
      referral of sick children targeting women and men is cost-effective and can improve uptake of&#xD;
      referral advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: The goal of the study is to assess the effect of a strengthened referral system from&#xD;
      the private sector on uptake of referral advice and its cost-effectiveness. The project&#xD;
      addresses poor referral of children as one of the challenges in the reduction of under-five&#xD;
      mortality in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To asses the effect of strengthening the referral system on uptake of referral of sick&#xD;
      children who seek care in the private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore factors which influence the referral or non-referral of sick children from&#xD;
           the private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the cost effectiveness of uptake of referral of sick children who seek care in&#xD;
           the private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Uganda's under-five mortality is high, currently estimated at 90/1000 live births (UDHS,&#xD;
           2011) Poor referral of sick children that seek care from the private sector is one of&#xD;
           the contributory factors. Previous studies in Uganda and elsewhere have found out that&#xD;
           referral of sick children to higher levels of care is poor (Oryema, 2009, Achan et al&#xD;
           2011; Font et al 2002, Kallander et al 2006 ), In Uganda several studies have estimated&#xD;
           referral of children to be as low as 8% (Kallander et al 2006) to 28% (Peterson et al&#xD;
           2004). Several factors have been attributed to the poor referral like long distances to&#xD;
           health facilities, high costs involved in referral, poor attitudes of health workers,&#xD;
           lack of drugs at health facilities and lack of involvement of fathers in the referral&#xD;
           process (Mbonye 2003, Font et al 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A study in Uganda found that of the 70% of patients who sought treatment at private&#xD;
           clinics within 1 week of onset of symptoms only 7% were properly managed (treated&#xD;
           according to National Guidelines). The study concluded that at private facilities&#xD;
           possible strategies include training and social marketing of prepackaged treatment for&#xD;
           STDs (Jacobs et al 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Tanzania, it has been found that in urban private-sector clinics, flexible clinics&#xD;
           hours, prompt services, and efforts to improve respect, privacy and confidentiality may&#xD;
           prove more helpful in increasing visit adherence (Miller et al 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed intervention aims to improve referral and uptake of referral advice of&#xD;
           children that seek care from private facilities by addressing constraints to the&#xD;
           referral of children. The private sector providers participating in this project will&#xD;
           include private clinics and registered drug shops. A recently concluded trial has shown&#xD;
           that staff in drug shops were mainly female, of whom over 50% were qualified health&#xD;
           workers (state enrolled nurse or above). The majority of drug shop vendors had received&#xD;
           no prior training on malaria case management, and had little knowledge at baseline of&#xD;
           ACT as the first-line anti-malarial drug, or what an mRDT was used for (Mbonye et al.&#xD;
           submitted, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project will be implemented in Mukono District, Central Uganda. There is a high&#xD;
           prevalence of diarrhea (22.3%), acute respiratory tract infection (12%) and fever (42%)&#xD;
           among children aged &lt;5 years (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
           This district has been selected because of a recent concluded trial showed drug shop&#xD;
           vendors (DSVs) adhere to malaria diagnostic test results, treat appropriately and refer&#xD;
           sick children; although uptake of referral is poor. Thus proposed project therefore is a&#xD;
           follow up to assess factors that lead to poor uptake of referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main focus of this project is to implement a community-based intervention to&#xD;
           encourage uptake of referral. This is because non-compliance or delayed uptake of&#xD;
           referral threatens child survival. The project targets children aged less than five&#xD;
           years, especially in rural areas who have poor access to health interventions. Three of&#xD;
           the barriers to effective treatment are poor quality of care in the private sector,&#xD;
           timely referral, and uptake of referral advice at a community level . Poor quality of&#xD;
           care in the private sector may be attributed to inadequate training of providers in the&#xD;
           private sector (in diagnosis and management of childhood illnesses); inadequate&#xD;
           supervision and regulation; poor linkages and collaboration between the public and&#xD;
           private sectors. Poor uptake of referral advice may be due to lack of awareness of&#xD;
           severe signs for childhood illnesses and their consequences; and poor preparation of&#xD;
           household's especially inadequate male involvement in child care; and non-existent&#xD;
           linkages between community structures and the public-private sectors. The&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness and sustainability of such innovative ways to scale up interventions&#xD;
           is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed research will be implemented in a district endemic for malaria, pneumonia&#xD;
           and diarrhea with both peri-urban and rural areas. It has numerous registered drug shops&#xD;
           and private clinics that are capable of diagnosing febrile illnesses with RDTs and treat&#xD;
           malaria appropriately and refer sick children (Mbonye et al 2013, submitted). The target&#xD;
           population is children with febrile illness who seek treatment at private outlets. It is&#xD;
           hypothesized that raising community awareness targeting households (women and spouses)&#xD;
           and initiating discussion on saving schemes for referral costs will lead to completion&#xD;
           of referral advice for sick children. The intervention will be supported with&#xD;
           qualitative studies to explore reasons for uptake of referral or not; and lessons for&#xD;
           policy action. The contextual issues to be explored by the qualitative research will&#xD;
           include involvement of community structures (VHTs) in raising awareness, the modalities&#xD;
           of linkages between the community and public-private health facilities, and incentives&#xD;
           for referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first aspect of innovation is using VHTs to register children and do community&#xD;
           sensitization. The second innovation in this project is introducing integrated&#xD;
           management of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea in private outlets, that has been only&#xD;
           implemented at community level and in health facilities. The third aspect of innovation&#xD;
           is to involve the private sector in the referral of sick children. Understanding the&#xD;
           referral system is a new research area that could inform the private-public interactions&#xD;
           with wider public health implications for child survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There will be meetings convened by the district health system between private and public&#xD;
           providers in the study communities to introduce the study and discuss the referral&#xD;
           process. Referral forms will be developed and discussed with all stakeholders; as well&#xD;
           as SOPs for handling referral cases. In the previous trial of RDTs in drug shops in&#xD;
           Mukono district, referral forms were in the local language and health workers despised&#xD;
           them. In this present study the investigators shall modify them and pilot forms in&#xD;
           English, and put in place supporting interventions to foster acceptance of referrals&#xD;
           from the private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The third aspect of innovation is to involve VHTs, an established community structure (&#xD;
           MOH, 1999; MOH 2010) to register all children aged less than 5 years, distribute health&#xD;
           education materials and enlist male heads of households and women to be active in the&#xD;
           care and referral of children. Since men are crucial in decision making and control of&#xD;
           resources, the investigators hypothesize that this innovation is likely to improve&#xD;
           timely referral and uptake of referral advice. VHTs currently have no collaboration with&#xD;
           the private sector thus creating links between VHTs and the private sector is creative&#xD;
           and is likely to provide lessons for future scale up of health interventions. Meetings&#xD;
           between the private and public providers have never taken place and establishing such&#xD;
           interaction would be innovative.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The immediate sustainable impact will be appropriate treatment of sick children. The&#xD;
           long term effect is reduction in child mortality, which may lead to reduction in&#xD;
           fertility as women would embrace more family planning methods once the survival of&#xD;
           children improves. The potential scientific impact of the project will be evaluated by&#xD;
           capturing data on referrals, where sick children are referred, uptake of the referral&#xD;
           compared between the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives &amp; Outcome Measure(s) A. Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess the effect of strengthening the referral system on uptake of referral of sick&#xD;
      children who seek care in the private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore factors which influence the referral or non-referral of sick children from&#xD;
           the private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the cost-effectiveness of timely and uptake of referral of sick children seen&#xD;
           in the private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Study Outcome measure(s) List and describe the primary outcome measure and if applicable,&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures including both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. Discuss the&#xD;
      validity of the selected outcome(s). Provide evidence that selected outcomes will provide&#xD;
      relevant, valid, and reliable measures of all study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The proportion of sick children referred from the private sector that completes the&#xD;
      referral process (seen at higher health facilities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appropriate case management for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea among children in the&#xD;
           private sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cost-effectiveness of timely and uptake of referral of sick children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of sick children seeking care at private outlets within 24 hours of onset&#xD;
           of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time between consultations at private outlets and uptake of referral at health&#xD;
           facilities (referral facilities)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of sick children receiving prompt appropriate treatment from a private&#xD;
           sector outlet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors which influence the referral or non-referral of sick children from the private&#xD;
           sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All private outlets in both arms will be trained to record data on sick children aged less&#xD;
      than 5years who seek care at private outlets:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic (age, sex, relationship to caretaker, marital status of caretaker, education&#xD;
           levels, rural/urban residence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Social-economic data (household income, ownership of household items that determine&#xD;
           expenditure and consumption levels, address and telephone contacts of caretakers));&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Type of illnesses, treatment given, prescription of drugs, referral advice, children&#xD;
           referred and where referred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be captured in patient registers and treatment forms distributed in the&#xD;
      intervention and control clusters.&#xD;
