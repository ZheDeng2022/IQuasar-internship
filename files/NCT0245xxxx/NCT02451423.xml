  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label Phase II study of MPDL3280A, an anti-PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
      administered as neoadjuvant therapy to subjects with either BCG-refractory non-muscle&#xD;
      invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, or muscle-invasive TCC appropriate&#xD;
      for cystectomy and refusing or ineligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Enrolled patients&#xD;
      will be assigned sequentially to dose levels in cohorts of 6 patients per dose level. The&#xD;
      starting dose level is 1200mg x 1 dose and will be escalated in subsequent cohorts to 1200mg&#xD;
      q 3 weeks x 2 doses, and finally 1200mg q 3 weeks x 3 doses to determine the impact of&#xD;
      increasing number of treatments on the modulated immune response with the tumor tissue.&#xD;
      Subjects with adverse pathology (pT3/pT4 or N+) will be offered the option of adjuvant&#xD;
      MPDL3280A for up to 16 cumulative cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all neoadjuvant study therapy is administered, each subject will undergo cystectomy to&#xD;
      evaluate pathologic response to treatment and for immunologic characterization in the&#xD;
      resected tissue. Serum and urine will be obtained as well to characterize circulating immune&#xD;
      responses. After the multi-dose portion of the study has completed accrual two expansion&#xD;
      cohorts of up to 15 patients each with Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) or&#xD;
      Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) will be accrued at the highest dose&#xD;
      level for further characterization of safety, efficacy, and immunologic analysis. Patients&#xD;
      with pT3, pT4, or N+ disease at the time of cystectomy and no metastatic disease will be&#xD;
      offered the option of adjuvant MPDL3280A for up to a total of 16 cumulative cycles. All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed clinically for up to 2 years to assess for disease recurrence.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in CD3+ T cell count/µm2 in the multi-dose cohorts</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The immunologic effect MPDL3280A activity within bladder tissue will be measured by a change in the CD3+ T cell count/µm2 between pretreatment biopsy and cystectomy tissue following MPDL3280A infusions. Tissue will be designated into 3 distinct compartments: benign epithelium, tumor centers, and tumor interfaces. Tumor interfaces will be defined as fields where malignant and benign epithelium are present. Cell count for each compartment will be reported in a table as mean for each of the 5 quantitated fields. For each cohort, change of T cell counts from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be calculated for each compartment as log2 of ratio of post-treatment vs. pre-treatment counts. Two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare difference of change from pretreatment to post-treatment between cohorts to assess if intratumoral immune response associated with increasing numbers of MPDL3280A treatments.</description>
