  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical study of hyperpolarized pyruvate (13C) injection that includes the&#xD;
      acquisition of magnetic resonance (MR) data and will be performed in men with localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Part 1: Five patients will be evaluated for reproducibility of 13C HP MR&#xD;
      imaging measurements obtained 2-3 weeks apart with no interim treatment. Part 2: Five&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated for the change in 13C HP MR imaging measurements after 2 months of&#xD;
      ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13C HP MR data will be acquired in two parts of the study (which can occur simultaneously):&#xD;
      Part 1: Patients will undergo imaging at baseline and will be repeated two to three weeks&#xD;
      later (with no intervention in the interim) to evaluate reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Patients will undergo imaging at baseline, initiate androgen deprivation therapy, and&#xD;
      undergo repeat imaging two months after initiation of ADT to evaluate the ability of the&#xD;
      imaging to reflect a metabolic response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in pyruvate/lactate ratio and lactate levels will be measured and compared to&#xD;
      baseline at these timepoints.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate with intermediate to high&#xD;
             risk disease by UCSF CAPRA scoring and possesses a Gleason 4 component to the tumor.&#xD;
             Subjects will be enrolled either prior to radical prostatectomy (N=5) or prior to 2&#xD;
             months of androgen deprivation therapy (LHRH agonist +/- antiandrogen) followed by&#xD;
             definitive radiation therapy as their primary treatment for prostate cancer (N=5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is able and willing to comply with study procedures and provide signed and&#xD;
             dated informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 5 mm of tumor on biopsy (can have multiple cores to comprise 5 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has concordant MRI/1H MRSI findings from a MR staging exam at UCSF&#xD;
             performed prior to the 13C MRSI exam performed in this study with IMP, or is willing&#xD;
             to undergo MRI/1H MRSI in connection with the study exam.&#xD;
