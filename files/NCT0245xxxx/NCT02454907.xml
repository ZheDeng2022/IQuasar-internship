  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience &quot;relapses&quot; of disease activity during&#xD;
      which they have increased numbness, weakness, visual problems, or other symptoms. If a person&#xD;
      with MS has new symptoms that are concerning to them, their doctor may want to see them in&#xD;
      the office in order to confirm that these symptoms are due to a true &quot;relapse&quot; of activity&#xD;
      before starting relapse treatment. This requirement can be frustrating for patients, who may&#xD;
      have to take time off from work or travel long distances for such unexpected doctors' visits.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will use input from patients with MS and MS physicians to&#xD;
      create a relapse questionnaire that can be used to confirm a relapse has occurred. The&#xD;
      investigators will also evaluate if having a more direct line of communication with the&#xD;
      provider's office improves overall patient care and satisfaction.&#xD;

      This research is being done to study if a relapse questionnaire for people with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS) may help more easily determine if a relapse has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further goal of this study is to determine if receiving periodic messages from the doctor's&#xD;
      office, as well as having the direct contact information of a person in the office, improves&#xD;
      the care of the patients and their experience thereof.&#xD;
