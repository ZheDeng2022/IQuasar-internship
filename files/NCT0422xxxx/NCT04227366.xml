  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BCD-089 is the original therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding the alpha subunit of the IL-6&#xD;
      receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of BCD-089 in combination with&#xD;
      methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis resistant to monotherapy with&#xD;
      methotrexate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BCD-089-3/SOLAR is the international, multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled phase III&#xD;
      clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main period of the study (Weeks 0-24) is blinded; study subjects will receive&#xD;
      BCD-089/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 24 the study will become open-label and all patients will receive BCD-089 once a week&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. At week 28 patients who achieved the RA remission at week 24 will be switched to&#xD;
      BCD-089 Q2W dosing regimen and will receive it through Week 51. Patients who failed to&#xD;
      achieve remission at week 24 will receive BCD-089 once a week through Week 51.&#xD;
