  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms, in patients with a life history of major depressive disorder (MDD), are&#xD;
      very common in the general population, and are especially so in elderly adults undergoing&#xD;
      surgery.Symptoms of depression at the time of surgery is associated with risk for&#xD;
      postoperative complications.Attenuating depressive symptoms in patients undergoing surgery is&#xD;
      thus a plausible but not adequately tested strategy for improving patient postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes. Conventional treatment of depression takes weeks and, therefore, is not always a&#xD;
      realistic option, particularly when surgery is urgent. Importantly, there are currently no&#xD;
      guidelines for diagnosing and managing MDD in surgical patients. Given its association with&#xD;
      complications including perioperative cognitive disorders such as delirium, and over longer&#xD;
      periods of time with dementing disorders, the feasibility and efficacy of quick-acting&#xD;
      treatments for depressive symptoms in surgical patients are direly needed. This need is&#xD;
      particularly acute given the rising number of elderly patients undergoing surgery who are&#xD;
      prone to depression and surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of enrolling patients in a clinical trial where a&#xD;
      sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) is given 1&#xD;
      to 3 days before surgery in the preoperative clinic as a strategy to improve depressive&#xD;
      symptoms during the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To obtain estimates of the variability in improvements of depressive symptoms&#xD;
      (increase from baseline in MADRS score ≥ 2)1 day after surgery for patients given a&#xD;
      sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) 1 to 3 days before surgery compared&#xD;
      with midazolam 0.045 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess for the safety and tolerability of administration of a sub-anesthetic dose&#xD;
      of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) given 1 to 3 days before surgery in the preoperative&#xD;
      clinic (as an outpatient) by assessment of dysphoric symptoms or other complications&#xD;
      including the need for hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Hypothesis: Patients with preoperative depressive symptoms can be identified before&#xD;
      surgery and successfully enrolled in a clinical trial comparing a sub-anesthetic dose of&#xD;
      ketamine versus midazolam for improving perioperative depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Hypothesis: Compared with midazolam, a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine given&#xD;
      preoperatively leads to an improvement in MADRS score ≥ 2 on day 1 after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Hypothesis: Compared with midazolam, a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine is not&#xD;
      associated with dysphoria or other complications.&#xD;
