  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with impaired exercise capacity, quality of&#xD;
      life and right ventricular function.The disease is characterized by an increase of pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to right heart insufficiency. In&#xD;
      later stages of the disease, the right heart is not able to further increase right&#xD;
      ventricular contractility (cardiac index) during exercise. Within the last decade, new&#xD;
      disease-targeted medical therapies have been approved for treatment of pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH). Sequential and upfront combinations of these agents have shown to further&#xD;
      improve symptoms, 6-minute walking distance (6-MWD) and hemodynamics in PAH patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous training studies have suggested that exercise training as add-on to medical&#xD;
      treatment is highly effective improving exercise capacity, quality of life and symptoms.&#xD;
      Prospective studies with a 24±12 months follow-up period suggested that exercise training may&#xD;
      also improve the rate of clinical worsening events as the need for hospitalization,&#xD;
      additional PH-medication, lung-transplantation and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also first data that exercise training may have a positive impact on the right&#xD;
      ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised controlled study aims to assess whether exercise training&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study in patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, who are under stable optimized treatment for at least 2 months, is to examine&#xD;
      the effect of an additional exercise and respiratory therapy on the right heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is the right heart function, measured by cardiac index&#xD;
      during exercise invasively determined by right heart catheterization. More hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters for the determination of the right heart function as well as clinical and&#xD;
      molecular parameters are relevant to record the physiological effect of the training. The&#xD;
      molecular parameters are composed of laboratory parameter and inflammatory parameter as well&#xD;
      as genetic analyses, measurements of epigenetic changes measured by microRNA Expressions and&#xD;
      DNA-methylation and imunohistochemical measurements of the quadriceps musculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study parameters will be assessed in the patient's routine examinations. Clinical&#xD;
      parameters comprise of hemodynamic assessment of pulmonary arterial pressure during exercise,&#xD;
      pump function of left and right ventricle, and further echocardiographic parameters.&#xD;
      Improvement of exercise capacity will be measured by the change of six-minute walking&#xD;
      distance, the breathing economics, the world health organization functional class (WHO&#xD;
      functional class), peak oxygen consumption and blood gas analysis. The quality of life will&#xD;
      be assessedwith the SF-36 questionnaire.Data for survival analysis will be gained by&#xD;
      structured phone interviews . The safety of the training is warranted by long-term, rest- and&#xD;
      stress-ECG, safety laboratory, systemic blood pressure, heart frequency, oxygen saturation&#xD;
      and occurrence of adverse events. In addition to the routine examinations at baseline and&#xD;
      after 15 weeks, a right heart catheterization will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be examined in the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg. Patients of the training group will&#xD;
      take part in a specific, 3-week inpatient training program at the rehabilitation center&#xD;
      Königstuhl Heidelberg right after the baseline examination. The training program consists of&#xD;
      exercise and respiratory therapy as well as a mental gait training. Respiratory therapy will&#xD;
      be performed 5 times/week for 30 minutes. Furthermore, 15-25 minutes low dosed interval&#xD;
      training on a bicycle ergometer, dumbbell training of particular muscle groups with low&#xD;
      weights and supervised walks on ground-level will be scheduled 5-7 times/week. Three- to five&#xD;
      times a week a &quot;mental gait training&quot; is conducted to estimate the patient's individual&#xD;
      physical abilities and limitations. The heart rate during exerciseand the intensity of the&#xD;
      training will be closely monitored and individually adjusted. After three weeks of&#xD;
      in-hospital rehabilitation the patients are asked to continue the training for twelve further&#xD;
      weeks at home. All patients will be examined before the training program, at the end of the&#xD;
      in-hospital phase after three weeks and after 15 weeks. Patients of the control group will&#xD;
      continue with their lifestyle without individual training prescriptions. After having&#xD;
      participated in the study, patients of the control group will also be offered to take part in&#xD;
      the training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control examinations cover the medical history, WHO functional class, physical&#xD;
      examination, ECG, echocardiography at rest and during exercise, spiroergometry, quality of&#xD;
      life, blood-gas analysis, lung function, 6-minute walking distance, oxygen saturation, blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate, laboratory tests. An optional magnet resonance imaging at the&#xD;
      beginning and after three months may also be conducted. At baseline, an optional genetic&#xD;
      assessment will be performed; and at the beginning, after three and 15 weeks the expression&#xD;
      levels of micro RNA and methylation of the DNA will be assessed. A biopsy of the quadriceps&#xD;
      musculature will optionally be carried out at baseline and after 15 weeks. Medication will&#xD;
      remain stable throughout the study.&#xD;
