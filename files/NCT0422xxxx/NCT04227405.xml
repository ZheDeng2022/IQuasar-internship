    <textblock>
      The current study sought to evaluate an intervention to promote healthy couple relationships&#xD;
      and economic stability and mobility for low-income couples living in Northern Virginia (VA)&#xD;
      and Montgomery and Prince George's Counties (MD) by improving personal well-being, couple's&#xD;
      relationships, parenting and co-parenting, financial literacy and capability, employability,&#xD;
      job placement, and retention. The approach proposed integrated two components: (1) a 20-hour&#xD;
      evidence-informed couple group workshop called TOGETHER that integrates relationship&#xD;
      education and financial literacy skills, followed by an optional three-hour booster session&#xD;
      three months after TOGETHER workshop (abbreviated version of TOGETHER workshop) and (2) case&#xD;
      management (assessment of participant needs, development of Individual and Couple Development&#xD;
      Plan (ICDP), referrals for social and mental health services, and referrals and coordination&#xD;
      with job and career enhancement services, linking and coordination of all services as&#xD;
      needed). The 20-hour workshop was offered in sessions of 2 1/2 hours each and facilitated by&#xD;
      couple and financial experts working together in all the sessions. The workshop included&#xD;
      presentation of concepts and skills, hands-on activities to practice skills, and homework.&#xD;
      The facilitators completed fidelity forms, were observed by the curriculum developers, and&#xD;
      were supervised biweekly by the curriculum developers. The project involved subcontracts with&#xD;
      the University of Maryland, Family Services, Inc. (FSI), and The Skillsource Group, Inc. for&#xD;
      the delivery of the TOGETHER program and case management and with the SkillSource Group, Inc.&#xD;
      for job and career enhancement services. Workshops were conducted at Virginia Tech,&#xD;
      University of Maryland, Family Services, Inc., and community organizations that offered&#xD;
      space. In addition to service coordination, case managers incorporated the input of TOGETHER&#xD;
      group facilitators and employment providers to develop Individual and Couple Development&#xD;
      Plans (ICDPs) and assess progress toward meeting goals. The effectiveness of the program was&#xD;
      evaluated through a randomized control trial in which half of the couples were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to a control group and half of the couples were assigned to the intervention group.&#xD;
      Couples in the control group received no intervention but a three-hour financial workshop&#xD;
      after the last assessment was completed whereas the intervention couples participated in the&#xD;
      20-hour interventions and received case management. An independent local evaluator (AVAR,&#xD;
      Consulting) participated in the design, implementation, and most of the data analysis of the&#xD;
      evaluation component. Participants had to be at least 18 years-old, having been living&#xD;
      together for at least a year, and had no severe domestic violence issues, or untreated&#xD;
      substance abuse or severe psychiatric disorders. If both partners were retired, couples were&#xD;
      excluded from participation. After a brief phone screening, couples were invited to&#xD;
      participate in an intake and enrollment meeting in which they were more thoroughly screened.&#xD;
      After screening, couples were enrolled and randomly assigned by a computer generated system&#xD;
      to either the intervention or control group. Couples in both groups completed three sets of&#xD;
      self-report measures. The first one (pre-test) was completed on the day of the first workshop&#xD;
      session or at intake for control couples, the second one was completed on the day of the day&#xD;
      of hte last workshop session, or 8 weeks after the pre-test) for control couples, and the&#xD;
      last one six months after the post-test for both intervention and control couples. After the&#xD;
      six month follow-up assessment, participation in the program was concluded. Reimbursement to&#xD;
      licensed child care providers that provided child care to participants' children was&#xD;
      available. The study was largely funded by a Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood&#xD;
      grant awarded by the Office of Family Assistance, Administration of Children and Families,&#xD;
      U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from the beginning of the study until May 10,&#xD;
      2018. As of May 10, 2018 the funding agency continued to fund the intervention component but&#xD;
      data collection and analysis fro couples that had been randomized by May 10, 2018 and&#xD;
      continued to receive services and to complete assessments were funded by Virginia Polytechnic&#xD;
      Institute and State University. The study was expected to recruit 360 couples in the control&#xD;
      group and 360 couples in the intervention group. However, due to the discontinuation of&#xD;
      funding, 147 couples were enrolled for the control group and 145 couples were enrolled for&#xD;
      the intervention group.&#xD;

      The current project sought to promote healthy couple relationships and economic stability and&#xD;
      mobility for low-income couples living in Northern Virginia (VA) and Montgomery and Prince&#xD;
      George's Counties (MD) by improving personal well-being, couple's relationships, parenting&#xD;
      and co-parenting, financial literacy and capability, employability, job placement, and&#xD;
      retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project was funded in its entirety until May 10, 2018 by the Department of Health and&#xD;
      Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Family&#xD;
      Assistance (OFA) under the Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood (HMRF) program. After&#xD;
      that date, the OFA continued to fund the intervention but not the local evaluation. Data&#xD;
      collection and analysis from couples that had signed the consent form for participation in&#xD;
      the project and had been randomized before May 10, 2018 The evaluation plan that included a&#xD;
      randomized control trial and was approved of by OFA for years 2016, 2017, and 2018 until the&#xD;
      local evaluation was discontinued by OFA included the enrollment of 720 couples, out of which&#xD;
      360 couples would be randomly assigned to the intervention group and 360 couples to a control&#xD;
      group.However, due to the unexpected termination of funding for the local evaluation, the&#xD;
      program was evaluated with 292 couples (145 intervention group couples and 147 control group&#xD;
      couples).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project was developed and conducted by Project Director, Mariana Falconier, Ph.D. at&#xD;
      Virginia Tech and Associate Director, Jinhee Kim, Ph.D. at University of Maryland. Both&#xD;
      universities collaborated for this project and University of Maryland was a subawardee of&#xD;
      Virginia Tech. In addition, Virginia Tech subcontracted with SkillSource Group, Inc. for&#xD;
      delivery of the intervention and University of Maryland contracted with Family Services, Inc.&#xD;
      for delivery of Services. Services were delivered at Virginia Tech, Family Service Inc,&#xD;
      University of Maryland, and in agencies in which we have agreements to use their space (City&#xD;
      of Bowie in Bowie, MD and Ebenezer Baptist Church, Alexandria, VA) The funding agency&#xD;
      required the grantee to have an independent local evaluator and for that purpose Virginia&#xD;
      Tech contracted with AVAR Consulting, which was involved in the implementation and outcome&#xD;
      evaluations until August 31, 2018.. Avar Consulting as well as Dr. Falconier and Dr. Kim will&#xD;
      only used the database without participants' identifying information to conduct their outcome&#xD;
      evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach integrated two components (1) a 20-hour evidence-informed couple group program&#xD;
      called TOGETHER workshop that integrates relationship education and financial literacy skills&#xD;
      and (2) case management (assessment of participant needs, development of Individual and&#xD;
      Couple Development Plan, referrals for social and mental health services, and referrals and&#xD;
      coordination with job and career enhancement services, linking and coordination of all&#xD;
      services as needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goals of this project were to promote healthy couple relationships and economic&#xD;
      stability and mobility for low-income couples in Northern Virginia, Prince George's County,&#xD;
      MD, and Montgomery County, MD. The main objectives were: 1) improve personal well-being; 2)&#xD;
      improve couple's relationship skills; 3) improve parenting and co-parenting; 4) improve&#xD;
      financial literacy and capability; and 5) improve employability, job placement, and retention&#xD;
      skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term outcomes of this project's core intervention were expected immediately after&#xD;
      completion of the last session of the 20-hour relationship/financial education program&#xD;
      (TOGETHER) whereas medium-term outcomes were anticipated six months after that last session.&#xD;
      Expected measurable outcomes among program participants for objective 1 (improved personal&#xD;
      well-being) included increased frequency of positive stress management, reduced psychological&#xD;
      distress, decreased financial stress. Expected measurable outcomes for objective 2 (improved&#xD;
      couple's relationship skills) included increased frequency of positive communication&#xD;
      behaviors, increased frequency of positive conflict management behaviors, increased frequency&#xD;
      of positive dyadic stress management, increased frequency of conjoint problem solving&#xD;
      behaviors, increased satisfaction with couple's relationship, and increased comfort with&#xD;
      financial styles and roles. Expected measurable outcomes for objective 3 (improved parenting&#xD;
      and co-parenting) included increased frequency of positive parenting behaviors, increased&#xD;
      closeness to children, and increased satisfaction with co-parenting. Expected measurable&#xD;
      outcomes for objective 4 (improved financial literacy and capability) include increased&#xD;
      financial literacy skills, increased financial self-efficacy, decreased use of alternative&#xD;
      financial services, and increased financial management behaviors. Finally, expected&#xD;
      measurable outcomes for objective 5 (improved employability, job placement, and retention)&#xD;
      include decreased perceived barriers to employability, increased intentions and motivations&#xD;
      for work, increased confidence in job skills, and increased employability, employment status,&#xD;
      and retention. These outcomes were expected by comparing the intervention and control group&#xD;
      outcomes in the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGET POPULATION Low income couples in Northern Virginia (VA) and Prince George's County and&#xD;
      Montgomery County, Maryland (MD). Even though the target population for this project was&#xD;
      low-income couples, any couple that wanted to participate in the program was accepted as long&#xD;
      as they met the eligibility criteria: residing in Northern Virginia and Prince George's&#xD;
      County and Montgomery County in Maryland, married or cohabiting for at least a year, 18 years&#xD;
      of age or older, and English-speaking. Exclusion criteria included both partners being&#xD;
      retired, physical domestic violence (defined as behaviors that frighten, terrorize,&#xD;
      manipulate, hurt, humiliate, blame, often injure, and sometime kill, a current or former&#xD;
      intimate partner) or feeling unsafe with partner in the last six months, current diagnosis of&#xD;
      a severe psychiatric disorder that required hospitalization in the last 12 months, cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, or/and severe untreated substance abuse disorder. Couples could participate as&#xD;
      long as both partners consent to be part of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT Recruitment activities began on June 1, 2016. Activities included producing and&#xD;
      distributing flyers, brochures, and posters and/or giving presentation in schools, churches,&#xD;
      faith-based community centers, child support agencies, TANF offices, WIC agencies, Head Start&#xD;
      programs, Healthy Start program, child welfare agencies, community centers, libraries,&#xD;
      stores, barber shops, employment centers, Virginia Tech and University of Maryland clinics&#xD;
      and cooperative extension centers, and community events. The Women's Center and Family&#xD;
      Services Inc. concentrated on marketing and recruitment efforts from the network of providers&#xD;
      and partner organization they were part of. In addition, the program was advertised through&#xD;
      social media outlets that would be used for marketing and recruitment purposes and posting&#xD;
      calendars with program activities. The program was also advertised through its own website&#xD;
      (www.togetherprogram.org) and online ads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATABASES The funding agency OFA requires all HMRF grantees to enter information into a&#xD;
      secure system called the Information, Family Outcomes, Reporting, and Management system&#xD;
      (nFORM). The information requested to enter was about (a) program operations (e.g.,&#xD;
      aggregated data without personally identifiable information on outreach and recruitment&#xD;
      activities, enrollment numbers, staff qualifications and training, staff supervision and&#xD;
      observation, and implementation challenges); (b) services (e.g., case management activities,&#xD;
      workshop attendance, and referrals); (c) participants' contact information, demographics, and&#xD;
      outcome measures. The funding agency also required the use of tablets for collecting data&#xD;
      from participants. This tablet was also used to collect additional participants' outcome&#xD;
      measures through Qualtrics (Please see section on measures) Besides nFORM and Qualtrics, two&#xD;
      additional databases were used to collect information about participants and about program&#xD;
      operations. One of them was called the Initial Contact and Screening (ICS) database and was&#xD;
      used to collect contact information about potential participants and screen them to see if&#xD;
      they met inclusion criteria before enrollment in the program. The section with identifying&#xD;
      information such as participants' name, phone number or email address were stored separately&#xD;
      from the answers to the screening questions. This ICS database was cleaned once a month so&#xD;
      that all contact information was erased and only the number of participants that qualified or&#xD;
      didn't qualify for the program could be counted. This system had proper encryption at log in&#xD;
      and data collection pages. The second database was called Participant Tracking System (PTS).&#xD;
      PTS was a secure system that was developed for the purposes of automated randomization,&#xD;
      entering needs assessments and individual and couple development plans..&#xD;
&#xD;
      INITIAL CONTACT AND SCREENING Individuals interested in participating in the program dialed a&#xD;
      1-800-number or could visit the program at any of the program locations (Virginia Tech,&#xD;
      University of Maryland, The Women's Center, and Family Services, Inc.). Program staff (a)&#xD;
      collected contact information from the individual interested in participating, (b) described&#xD;
      the program and the potential compensation, (c) asked for verbal consent to proceed with&#xD;
      screening questions, and (d) performed a 10-minute inclusion screening process of the&#xD;
      potential participant and his/her partner. The program staff spoke with each partner during&#xD;
      the call or visit if both partners are available. Otherwise, the program staff collected&#xD;
      information and screening information about both partners with the only partner that was&#xD;
      present. All potential participants who were eligible after the initial screening and agreed&#xD;
      to participate were scheduled for an Intake and Enrollment meeting with the case managers.&#xD;
      The study procedures were described and additional information was sent upon request.&#xD;
      Potential participants were offered the consent form for them to review prior to the Intake&#xD;
      and Enrollment meeting, given either in person or mailed to them upon request. Potential&#xD;
      participants who were interested enrolling in the Together Program had the option of&#xD;
      completing the screening with an ICS staff member online as well. If potential participants&#xD;
      chose to complete an online screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTAKE AND ENROLLMENT MEETING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I The first part of the Intake and Enrollment meeting lasted 60 minutes. During the&#xD;
      meeting, the case manager (a) presented a detailed program description and obtain voluntary,&#xD;
      informed written consent for program participation from both partners; (b) conducted a formal&#xD;
      assessment of domestic violence with each partner individually for 10 minutes (see Domestic&#xD;
      Violence Protocol section); (c) enrolled participants and collected contact information in&#xD;
      nFORM; (d) assigned couples to intervention or control group through an automated system of&#xD;
      randomization that uses only state of residence (Maryland or Virginia) (PTS); (f) provides&#xD;
      orientation about program procedures (one orientation for intervention couples and one&#xD;
      orientation for control couples, participants were given the &quot;Welcome Letter and Instructions&#xD;
      for Intervention Couples&quot; or the &quot;Welcome Letter and Instructions for Control Couples&quot; and&#xD;
      the &quot;Control Group Flowchart for Participants&quot; or &quot;Intervention Group Flowchart for&#xD;
      Participants&quot;; (g) described participants with detailed explanation about payment procedures&#xD;
      and VA and MD Tax requirements (providing VA and MD Tax requirements letters); and (h)&#xD;
      directed and assisted intervention and control couples to complete applicant characteristics&#xD;
      survey nFORM and demographic information survey in a tablet Part II The second part of the&#xD;
      Intake and Enrollment meeting was different for intervention and control couples. For&#xD;
      intervention couples (90 minutes) , the case manager (a) provided an in-depth description of&#xD;
      the study procedure (this will be supported by presenting couples with The Intervention Group&#xD;
      Flowchart for Participants to enhance understanding; (b) conducted a Needs Assessment in&#xD;
      areas such as health care, employment, housing, childcare, education, legal barrier, income&#xD;
      and financial, transportation, food, relationships, mental health, alcohol abuse, and&#xD;
      substance abuse in order to determine which areas the couple needs support; (c) scheduled the&#xD;
      individual and couple development plan (ICDP) meeting, progress meetings, and exit meeting as&#xD;
      part of case management; (d) enrolled couple in the eight-week TOGETHER workshop (20 hours;&#xD;
      at Virginia Tech, University of Maryland, The Women's Center Family Services, Inc. or&#xD;
      designated agencies/schools/churches) and a booster session which occurred three months after&#xD;
      the completion of the TOGETHER workshop (3 hours); and (e) described child care support and&#xD;
      provided participants with the Child Care Support Letter. The Schedule for Intervention&#xD;
      Couples did not only indicate when and where the scheduled meetings and workshops took place,&#xD;
      but also included the incentives that couples could receive and the content of the meetings.&#xD;
      All of these materials were included in the attachments. For intervention couples that did&#xD;
      not wish to stay for the 90 minutes of the second part of the Intake and Enrollment meeting,&#xD;
      the case manager offered to conduct the Needs Assessment by phone with both partners at a&#xD;
      later time that was agreed upon this meeting. At the end of the meeting the couples were&#xD;
      compensated gift cards for participating in the Needs Assessment. During part II for control&#xD;
      couples, (90 minutes), the case manager (a) provided a detailed description of the procedure&#xD;
      for control group (this was supported by presenting couples with The Control Group Flowchart&#xD;
      for Participants to enhance understanding); (b) oversaw and assisted couples complete&#xD;
      pre-test surveys including the Pre-Program Survey (nFORM) and Pre-test Assessment (Qualtrics)&#xD;
      (both surveys combined took about 90 minutes; (d) scheduled the couple for their post-test&#xD;
      assessment meeting (in 8 weeks) and financial workshop/follow-up assessment (six months from&#xD;
      the date of the post-test assessment meeting months). In the event that control couples could&#xD;
      not stay for this second part of the Intake and Enrollment meeting, they were be offered the&#xD;
      possibility of completing the pre-program survey nForm and pre-test assessment in paper&#xD;
      format. If the couple chose to complete the survey and assessment in paper, they were&#xD;
      provided the questionnaires, the instructions to complete the questionnaire, and a&#xD;
      self-addressed envelope to mail the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL COUPLES: Control Couples: Post-Test Assessment Meeting Eight weeks after the Intake&#xD;
      and Enrollment meeting, control couples would return to one of the program locations to meet&#xD;
      with the case manager, and complete the Post Program Survey in nFORM and the Post-test&#xD;
      Assessment in Qualtrics (both surveys combined would take about 90 minutes). Couples were&#xD;
      reminded about Financial Literacy Workshop (FLW) and follow-up assessment date. For couples&#xD;
      that could attend the meeting in person, the questionnaires were mailed to them with&#xD;
      instructions on how to complete them and return them to the program in a self-addressed&#xD;
      envelope included in the package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL COUPLES: FOLLOW-UP SURVEY/FINANCIAL LITERACY WORKSHOP Six months after control&#xD;
      couples were invited to come 90 minutes before the Financial Literacy Workshop that would&#xD;
      offered for them. Trained program staff would provide tablets for these couples to complete&#xD;
      the follow-up survey in Qualtrics before the beginning of the workshop. Completion of&#xD;
      follow-up survey would take about 90 minutes. The trained program staff would provide the&#xD;
      couple their compensation in gift cards for assessments and will ask partners to sign the&#xD;
      Gift Card Receipt Form. After the participants completed the follow-up survey, they were&#xD;
      invited to attend a three-hour Financial Literacy Workshop (FLW), led by workshop&#xD;
      facilitators. FLW was a three-hour financial management class to improve financial management&#xD;
      knowledge and skills based on Money Smart curriculum by the Federal Deposit Insurance&#xD;
      Corporation. For couples that could attend the meeting in person, the questionnaires were&#xD;
      mailed to them with instructions on how to complete them and return them to the program in a&#xD;
      self-addressed envelope included in the package. Couples could also choose to complete the&#xD;
      follow-up survey online in which case program staff emailed to each partner the link and&#xD;
      their individual passcode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION COUPLES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TOGETHER WORKSHOP TOGETHER workshop is a 20-hour psycho-educational program for couples&#xD;
           that supports the personal well-being, couple relationship, parenting, and financial&#xD;
           literacy and management. TOGETHER was developed by Dr. Mariana Falconier (PI) and the&#xD;
           late Dr. Hayhoe as part of the emerging interdisciplinary field that integrates&#xD;
           relationship education with financial education (Falconier, 2015). TOGETHER adapted the&#xD;
           Couples' Coping Enhancement Training (CCET) program developed by Dr. Guy Bodenmann&#xD;
           (Bodenmann, 1997) and whose effectiveness in improving stress management, communication,&#xD;
           and relationship satisfaction has been supported in various studies (e.g., Bodenmann &amp;&#xD;
           Shantinath, 2004) to financially distressed couples by applying CCET content to&#xD;
           financial issues and incorporating financial education. The workshop aims at reducing&#xD;
           financial stress and improving relationship functioning by providing couples with&#xD;
           knowledge and skills on stress management, communication, conflict resolution and&#xD;
           management, problem-solving, and financial management. The TOGETHER workshop has 9&#xD;
           modules and is designed to be delivered in groups of four to eight couples for 20 hours:&#xD;
           8 weekly sessions of 2.5 hours each. Each session is co-led by two facilitators: a&#xD;
           financial counselor and a couples therapist. Each session includes a warm-up activity,&#xD;
           brief review of past session content and homework, presentation and practice of new&#xD;
           content, summary of all contents covered in the session, and assignment of new homework.&#xD;
           After each session, couples are assigned homework so that the skills learned in the&#xD;
           session can be practiced between sessions. The TOGETHER curriculum has been pilot tested&#xD;
           and results have been published in 2015 in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy.&#xD;
           Below is a list of the introduction and the 9 modules.&#xD;

           Money Management Skills Module 8: Credit and Risk Management Module 9: Improving&#xD;
           Financial Problem-Solving Skills A total of 30 workshops were offered between July 1,&#xD;
           2016 and May 10, 2018. Out of the 145 couples assigned to the intervention group, 106&#xD;
           couples started the workshop. The rest of the couples could not attend any of the&#xD;
           available workshops due to schedule conflicts. As noted earlier, the workshop was&#xD;
           offered in eight sessions (2 hours and 30 minutes each) scheduled on the same day of the&#xD;
           week and at the same time. At the end of each session participants completed a 2&#xD;
           minute-session evaluation and a 2-minute homework evaluation. In the last session they&#xD;
           completed a 5 minute session evaluation+overall workshop evaluation within the session.&#xD;
           At the first TOGETHER session, couples will completed the Pre Program Survey (nFORM) and&#xD;
           the Pre-test Assessment (Qualtrics) before the session began. Completion of the Pre&#xD;
           Program Survey and Pre-test Assessment took about 90 minutes. For participants both&#xD;
           surveys was collectively referred to as &quot;Pre-Test Survey&quot;. Partners were instructed to&#xD;
           complete these surveys in tablets provided by the group facilitators. TOGETHER session&#xD;
           facilitators oversaw the completion of the Pre-Test Survey. Participants that failed to&#xD;
           attend the first session of the TOGETHER workshop were mailed the Pre-Test Survey for&#xD;
           their completion. After the last (eighth) TOGETHER session, couples completed on site&#xD;
           the Post Program Survey (nFORM) and the Post-test Assessment (Qualtrics). Surveys took&#xD;
           about 90 minutes. Participants knew these surveys as Post-Test Surveys and completed&#xD;
           them in the tables. TOGETHER session facilitators oversaw the completion of the&#xD;
           Post-Test survey. Participants that failed to attend the eight session of the TOGETHER&#xD;
           workshop were mailed the questionnaires with instructions on how to complete them and&#xD;
           return them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CASE MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. 1. Individual and Couple Development Plan (ICDP) Meeting: One week after the first&#xD;
      workshop session, intervention couples partook in an ICDP meeting with the assigned case&#xD;
      manager at VT, FSI, UMD, or designated locations for 90 minutes. Based on the information&#xD;
      collected in the Needs Assessment during the IE meeting, the case manager created an ICDP&#xD;
      with the couple that included (a) setting individual and couple goals; (b) agreeing on action&#xD;
      steps and establishing a realistic timeline to meet those goals; (c) discussing possible&#xD;
      barriers participants might encounter; (d) providing referrals as part of the action steps to&#xD;
      meet their goals (i.e., housing, TANF, health care, child welfare, child support services,&#xD;
      mental health services, and job and career enhancement services).. At the end of this meeting&#xD;
      participants were reminded of all of their scheduled appointments. If the ICDP included a&#xD;
      goal within the area of employment/career a first meeting would be scheduled for the partner&#xD;
      in need of those services with an employment case manager to receive services at either the&#xD;
      SkillSource Group, Inc. or a federally funded employment agency in Maryland. In addition, the&#xD;
      participant was invited to sign a release to exchange information between the employment&#xD;
      agency and our program so that information could be exchanged with the employment agency&#xD;
      regarding information collected by our program (Couple's Needs Assessment and the ICDP) and&#xD;
      the employment agency (employment/career services recommended and received, the participant's&#xD;
      eligibility for those services, and the Employment Individual Plan). The present study&#xD;
      provided funding for (a) employment services for those participants that did not meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria to receive services funded through the Workforce Innovation and&#xD;
      Opportunity Act (WIOA) or other state and local funding in those agencies and (b) for&#xD;
      reporting all the employment/career services that participants referred from our program were&#xD;
      recommended (Individual Employment Plan) and actually received (Employment Services and&#xD;
      Trainings Tracking Form) in such agencies. Since this study targeted the low-income&#xD;
      population, it was expected that most participants would meet eligibility criteria to receive&#xD;
      services in those agencies funded through WIOA or state or local programs and not through&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. 2. Progress Meetings and Exit Meeting Five weeks after the ICDP meeting, intervention&#xD;
      couples met with the case manager for their first of five progress meetings (approximately&#xD;
      five weeks between each progress meeting). At each meeting, the case manager (a) checked&#xD;
      progress towards goals established in the ICDP, (b) updated the ICDP if necessary, (c)&#xD;
      addressed barriers towards meeting ICDP goals, (d) checked safety (e.g., presence of domestic&#xD;
      violence), and (e) addressed any program issues (e.g., attendance to employment trainings,&#xD;
      Two of these meetings were in person and three over the phone and each of them lasted around&#xD;
      30 minutes and will require the presence of both partners. However, the two in-person&#xD;
      meetings were conducted over the phone as well if the couple was unable to attend the&#xD;
      meetings in person. Couples had a final meeting with the case manager 6 months after the last&#xD;
      TOGETHER session, which was approximately five weeks after the fifth case management progress&#xD;
      meeting. At this exit meeting, the case manager (a) made with the couple a final progress&#xD;
      assessment toward the goals established by the ICDP, (b) discussed with the couple their plan&#xD;
      for continue working towards the ICDP goals, (c) invited the couple to complete the follow-up&#xD;
      survey in the tablets, (d) provided information about the TOGETHER program's Facebook group,&#xD;
      and (e) presented the couple with a termination/graduation letter. If one or both partners&#xD;
      could not attend the meeting in person, the six-month follow-up survey was mailed to them If&#xD;
      the couple chose to complete this survey online,&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. INCENTIVES FOR WORKSHOP ATTENDANCE At the third progress meeting, case managers provided&#xD;
      the attendance incentives for the TOGETHER workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. BOOSTER SESSION Intervention couples were invited to an optional 3- hour booster session&#xD;
      three months after completing the last session of TOGETHER workshop. These booster session&#xD;
      included up to 16 couples and was be co-led by a UMD or VT marriage and family therapy intern&#xD;
      and a UMD or VT extension specialist. It offered an abbreviated version of the contents&#xD;
      covered in the 20-hour TOGETHER workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE All the program staff that interacted with program participants received&#xD;
      a three-hour training to learn to identify, assess, and response to situations of domestic&#xD;
      violence. A pre-screening for domestic violence took place in the ICS stage before&#xD;
      participants were enrolled in the program. Then, later, after enrollment but before&#xD;
      randomization and entering participants' information into the nFORM a structured screening&#xD;
      for domestic violence took place so that cases of domestic violence could be referred to&#xD;
      appropriate services and participation in the program was discontinued. This structured&#xD;
      screening involved an individual 10-minute meeting with each partner, during which each were&#xD;
      asked questions about any incidents of physical, sexual and/or psychological violence that&#xD;
      had occurred in their relationship. Each partner was asked about whether or not they felt&#xD;
      threatened by their partner, and whether or not they feel safe in participating in the&#xD;
      program with their partner. Additionally, each partner was asked about his/her willingness to&#xD;
      commit to safety and no violence, and his/her willingness to learn strategies to de-escalate&#xD;
      conflict between them in a safe way. Based on the participants' responses, a determination&#xD;
      was made regarding the couples' participation in the program. If both partners provided&#xD;
      responses that indicated a lower risk for domestic violence, then the decision was made that&#xD;
      they could continue participating in the program with no referral for additional services to&#xD;
      directly address domestic violence. However, if either partner provided responses indicating&#xD;
      the presence of domestic violence in the current relationship, describing minor domestic&#xD;
      violence, including pushing, shoving, infrequent domestic violence, and/or incidents which&#xD;
      occurred more than one year ago and no weapons in the home, the decision was made that the&#xD;
      couple may participate in the program, and they would be referred to services that directly&#xD;
      address domestic violence. This decision was made if both partners also indicated a&#xD;
      commitment to no violence and both felt safe participating in the program with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Request to discontinue participation in the program and referral to domestic violence&#xD;
      services could also occur at any point in the participation in the TOGETHER program beyond&#xD;
      the initial structured screening at the Intake and Enrollment meeting in the presence of&#xD;
      domestic violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. PROGRAM TERMINATION Individuals terminated their participation in the program six months&#xD;
      after the second assessment, which took place at the exit meeting (intervention couples) or&#xD;
      before the financial workshop (control group). They could also drop out of the program or be&#xD;
      asked not to participate in the presence of domestic violence or untreated substance abuse or&#xD;
      serious psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. FIDELITY Fidelity to Curriculum: Facilitators received a 25 hour training in the program,&#xD;
      out of which 17 hours focused on the curriculum. In addition they were required to attend a&#xD;
      biweekly one-hour group supervision with the developers of the curriculum, were observed at&#xD;
      least once by the developers of the curriculum, and on the third session by the local&#xD;
      evaluators staff. In addition facilitators completed jointly a checklist to report on the&#xD;
      extent to which they completed the scheduled activities, met all session objectives, used all&#xD;
      materials as outlined in the manual, and spent the time as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fidelity to case management procedures: A checklist was developed to assess the extent to&#xD;
      which case managers were implementing the case management protocol.&#xD;
