  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if adding GLIADEL to the site where the tumor was removed&#xD;
      works as well as just having the tumor removed with radiation treatment done within six weeks&#xD;
      after the surgery to keep the cancer from coming back.&#xD;

      This study is being done to assess the efficacy of GLIADEL (a local chemotherapy) in&#xD;
      preventing local recurrence of a metastatic brain tumor compared to stereotactic radiosurgery&#xD;
      (SRS) after resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 Adult subjects with one to four metastatic brain tumors with one tumor needing resection&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Subjects with prior radiation, lymphoma, small cell, germ cell, unknown&#xD;
      primary, or anaplastic thyroid diagnoses will be ineligible. Life expectancy should be&#xD;
      greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized at the time of surgery to 1) GLIADEL placement at the time of&#xD;
      resection or 2) SRS post-operatively to the resection cavity. Any other tumors (up to three)&#xD;
      will have SRS as their primary treatment after surgery. SRS will take place within 6 weeks&#xD;
      from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated pre-operatively with MRI brain and neuropsychological testing and&#xD;
      will have immediate post-op MRI for extent of resection (EOR) determination. Subjects will&#xD;
      have SRS to the resection cavity if no GLIADEL was placed and all will have SRS to any other&#xD;
      lesions. They will be followed at set intervals to evaluate for local recurrence and&#xD;
      neurocognitive changes. The genome of the metastatic brain tumor will be compared to their&#xD;
      primary and germline for identification of alterations.&#xD;
