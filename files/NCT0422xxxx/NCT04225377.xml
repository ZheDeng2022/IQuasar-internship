      Purpose: To integrate therapeutic exercise and techniques of physical therapy into adapted&#xD;
      physical education courses to improve the limitations and obstacles of the physical body, and&#xD;
      health-related physical fitness training and physical therapy into adapted physical education&#xD;
      courses to improve the limitations and obstacles of the physical body and to improve the&#xD;
      physical fitness performance of the students with physical and mental disabilities. Expected&#xD;
      results: Adapting to physical education curriculum supplemented by physical therapy&#xD;
      techniques can effectively improve the degree of physical and mental impairment, the effect&#xD;
      of add-on fitness training, and make the physical fitness performance of students with&#xD;
      physical and mental disabilities more progressive.&#xD;

      Background: The degree of disorder of college students with physical and mental disabilities&#xD;
      over 18 years old is mostly chronic, and the disease may be stable, the body and mind are&#xD;
      more adaptable to their own disability, but also due to physical disorders, health-related&#xD;
      physical fitness can enter the process of degradation earlier than the average person.&#xD;
      Students with physical and mental disabilities can increase physical activity by adapted&#xD;
      physical education courses, but because of their individual differences, the degree of&#xD;
      disorder and the category are different. It is difficult to progress physical fitness without&#xD;
      further professional intervention. Therefore, if the physiotherapy exercise therapy training&#xD;
      and the hand-on treatment course are combined and integrated into the adapted physical&#xD;
      education course and after-school time, it will be able to effectively improve the physical&#xD;
      fitness performance of students with physical and mental disabilities. Purpose: To integrate&#xD;
      therapeutic exercise and techniques of physical therapy into adapted physical education&#xD;
      courses to improve the limitations and obstacles of the physical body, and health-related&#xD;
      physical fitness training and physical therapy into adapted physical education courses to&#xD;
      improve the limitations and obstacles of the physical body and to improve the physical&#xD;
      fitness performance of the students with physical and mental disabilities. Methods: It is&#xD;
      expected that 20-30 students and students over 18 years old who are involved in physical&#xD;
      education classes will be recruited. One semester of physical education for a total of 18&#xD;
      weeks, 2 lessons per week (100 minutes), each class covers 40 minutes of individualized&#xD;
      physical therapy sports therapy guidance and hand-on treatment and 40 minutes of group&#xD;
      fitness training courses. The physical fitness assessment was conducted before the first week&#xD;
      of each semester and after the 18th week. The &quot;Physical Therapy and Adaptation to Physical&#xD;
      Education&quot; program was implemented for two semesters. The fitness assessment program mainly&#xD;
      includes: cardio endurance, muscle fitness, body composition, softness and balance. Expected&#xD;
      results: Adapting to physical education curriculum supplemented by physical therapy&#xD;
      techniques can effectively improve the degree of physical and mental impairment, the effect&#xD;
      of add-on fitness training, and make the physical fitness performance of students with&#xD;
      physical and mental disabilities more progressive.&#xD;

    <description>The subject sits on a chair with the soles of both feet resting on the ground, holding dumbbells (8 pounds for men, 5 pounds for women) with arms straight and hanging down next to the chair. After the start, the subject will bend his arms to the shoulders and calculate 30 seconds. The total number of correct bends in a second.&#xD;
The subject sits in the middle of the chair with his back straight, hands crossed in front of his chest, after the start, the subject stands up and sits down, and counts the number of standing up and sitting times completed within 60 seconds.</description>
