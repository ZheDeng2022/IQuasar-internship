  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ZM-H1505R is an investigational drug developed by Shanghai Zhimeng Biopharma Inc. for the&#xD;
      treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see how safe the study drug is and how well it is tolerated&#xD;
      after dosing. The study will also test how the study drug is taken up and eliminated by the&#xD;
      body. An additional part of the study is to look at how this could be changed by giving the&#xD;
      study drug with food.&#xD;
