  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The continuing increase in prevalence of obesity in older adults including many older&#xD;
      Veterans has become a major health concern. The clinical trial will test the central&#xD;
      hypothesis that a multicomponent intervention consisting of lifestyle therapy (diet-induced&#xD;
      weight loss and exercise training) plus metformin will be the most effective strategy for&#xD;
      reversing sarcopenic obesity and frailty in older Veterans with obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The growing prevalence of obesity in older adults including many older Veterans, has become a&#xD;
      major concern in the US already strained health care system in general and in the VA in&#xD;
      particular. In older adults, obesity exacerbates the age-related decline in physical function&#xD;
      resulting in frailty, decrease in quality of life, loss of independence, and increase in&#xD;
      nursing home admissions. The investigators' group demonstrated that weight loss from&#xD;
      lifestyle therapy improves physical function and ameliorates frailty but the improvement was&#xD;
      modest at best and most obese older adults remained frail. More importantly, there are&#xD;
      concerns that the weight-loss induced loss of muscle and bone mass could worsen underlying&#xD;
      age-related sarcopenia and osteopenia in the subset of frail obese elderly. Metformin, a&#xD;
      biguanide, is a widely available drug used as first line treatment of type 2 diabetes. Animal&#xD;
      studies suggest that metformin improves health span and increases lifespan, hence may&#xD;
      represent a novel intervention for frailty. Because metformin reduces cellular senescence and&#xD;
      senescence-associated phenotype (SASP), it is believed to retard accelerated aging most&#xD;
      especially in older adults with obesity. The objective is to conduct a head-head comparative&#xD;
      efficacy, placebo controlled, randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      lifestyle therapy + metformin for six months will be more effective than lifestyle therapy&#xD;
      alone or metformin alone in improving physical function and preventing the weight&#xD;
      loss-induced reduction in muscle and bone mass in obese (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) older (age 65 years)&#xD;
      Veterans with physical frailty.&#xD;

    <description>The Physical Performance Test includes seven standardized tasks (walking 15.2 m [50 ft], putting on and removing a coat, picking up a penny, standing up from a chair, lifting a book, climbing one flight of stairs, and performing a progressive Romberg test) plus two additional tasks (going up and down four flights of stairs and making a 360-degree turn). The score for each task ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating better physical performance; a perfect score would be 36.</description>

    <ipd_description>Publications from this research will be made available to the public through the National Library of Medicine PubMed Central website within one year after the date of publication (guidance is provided on the ORD website).&#xD;
MEDVAMC will not provide unrestricted, open public access to large scale health related datasets because of re-identification concerns and the obligation to protect Veterans' private information. However, controlled public access will be provided to the greatest extent possible under specific DUAs or other written agreements, and open access will be provided to the final datasets underlying peer-reviewed publications (aggregated data that can be released with privacy and confidentiality risks).</ipd_description>
