      Prospective, non-randomized, multicenter pre-market early feasibility study (EFS) to evaluate&#xD;
      subjects treated with the BlueLeaf System for the treatment of symptomatic CVI of the lower&#xD;
      extremity&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early feasibility study is to provide information on the BlueLeaf System&#xD;
      for the formation of one or more autogenous vein valves constructed from the vein wall of the&#xD;
      femoral and/or popliteal vein, in subjects with CVI and who meet the specified eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. In particular, the safety and technical feasibility of the procedure will be&#xD;
      validated in patients in the United States, including the procedural steps, operator&#xD;
      technique, and subject characteristics. The study will assess the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the study device acutely and through 5 years.&#xD;

Non-occlusive stenosis in the target vessel (including due to scarring, inflammation, VPT, etc.) leading to persistent worsening of symptoms attributable to venous flow obstruction, or requiring post-procedural surgical or endovascular re-intervention&#xD;
Device or procedure-related venous or arterial injury in the treated limb (such as Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF's), bleeding, pseudo aneurysm) leading to worsening of symptoms that require post-procedural surgical or endovascular re-intervention or requiring transfusion of more than 2 units of blood.

    <criteria>

        Key Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failed at least 6 months of conservative therapy at some point during the course of&#xD;
             their CVI management (symptoms not adequately resolved or patient non-compliant/unable&#xD;
             to tolerate)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deep system venous reflux characterized by &gt;1 second reflux time in two vein segments&#xD;
             (vein segments defined as: proximal femoral, distal femoral, and popliteal), as&#xD;
             assessed by duplex ultrasound (DUS) with patient in the standing position&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of at least two potential target sites within a target vessel as assessed&#xD;
             preliminarily by DUS, with a target site being defined as a segment within the femoral&#xD;
             or popliteal vein that is:&#xD;
&#xD;
             7mm to 11mm in luminal diameter and at least 3cm long and absent features that, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would preclude formation of a monocuspid valve (at any&#xD;
             orientation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the Investigator's opinion, the subject is a good candidate for treatment with the&#xD;
             BlueLeaf System based on their symptoms, quality of life, anatomy, and the likelihood&#xD;
             of benefit from continued conservative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated significant superficial venous incompetence which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may be the primary source of existing symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within 1 year of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deep venous intervention (includes stenting) in the target limb or outflow vessels&#xD;
             within 3 months of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Flow-limiting venous outflow obstruction central to the intended target sites, defined&#xD;
             by a common femoral vein duplex exam found to have a continuous waveform without&#xD;
             respiratory variation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to all protocol specified anticoagulation options&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known and uncontrolled hypercoagulopathy (i.e. hypercoagulopathy that cannot be&#xD;
             adequately managed/controlled with medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women on long-term oral contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-ambulatory patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant peripheral arterial disease with an ankle-brachial index of &lt; 0.70 or with&#xD;
             incompressible vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of right heart failure occurring as a consequence of, for&#xD;
             example, biventricular failure, intrinsic pulmonary disease, chronic thromboembolic&#xD;
             pulmonary hypertension, and other etiologies that result in elevated right-sided&#xD;
             pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Invasive surgical procedure within the last 3 months that in the Investigator's&#xD;
             opinion would interfere with the study procedure or results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine level of ≥ 2mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin level &lt; 9.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &lt; 50,000 or &gt; 1,000,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total white blood cell count &lt; 3,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is enrolled in another clinical study that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may c&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Comorbidity risks or other concerns which, in the opinion of the Investigator, either&#xD;
             limits longevity or likelihood of complying with the protocol and its prescribed&#xD;
             follow up (e.g. recent cancer or stroke); or precludes patient from being transitioned&#xD;
             to open surgery if complication requiring surgical intervention occurs during the&#xD;
             procedure (such as severe vein laceration).&#xD;
