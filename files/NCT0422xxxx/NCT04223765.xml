  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a more effective&#xD;
      treatment. The treatment tested in this study uses modified T-cells called Autologous T&#xD;
      Lymphocyte Chimeric Antigen Receptor (ATLCAR) cells targeted against the kappa light chain&#xD;
      antibody on cancer cells. For this study, the anti-kappa light chain antibody has been&#xD;
      changed so instead of floating free in the blood, a part of it is now joined to the T cells.&#xD;
      Only the part of the antibody that sticks to the lymphoma cells is attached to the T cells.&#xD;
      When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way, it is called a chimeric receptor. The&#xD;
      kappa light chain chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells are called ATLCAR.κ.28&#xD;
      cells. These cells may be able to destroy lymphoma cancer cells. They do not, however, last&#xD;
      very long in the body so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells to increase their ability&#xD;
      to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical&#xD;
      structure carrying your genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e.,&#xD;
      eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an&#xD;
      antibody called an anti-kappa light chain. This anti-kappa light chain antibody usually&#xD;
      floats around in the blood. The antibody can detect and stick to cancer cells called lymphoma&#xD;
      cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called kappa light chains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving the ATLCAR.κ.28 cells is safe and&#xD;
      tolerable and learn more about the side effects and how effective these cells are in fighting&#xD;
      lymphoma. Initially, the study doctors will test different doses of the ATLCAR.κ.28, to see&#xD;
      which dose is safer for use in lymphoma patients. Once a safe dose is identified, the study&#xD;
      team will administer this dose to more patients, to learn about how these cells affect&#xD;
      lymphoma cancer cells and identify other side effects they might have on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time ATLCAR.κ.28 cells are given to patients with lymphoma. The Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA), has not approved giving ATLCAR.κ.28 as treatment for lymphoma.&#xD;
      This is the first step in determining whether giving ATLCAR.κ.28 to others with lymphoma in&#xD;
      the future will help them.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, open-label phase 1 clinical trial designed to determine the&#xD;
      safety of escalating doses of autologous activated T lymphocytes (ATLs) expressing the&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor specific for the kappa-light chain of human immunoglobulins (CAR.κ)&#xD;
      in subjects with relapsed/refractory kappa-positive (κ+) mantle cell and indolent non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphomas (NHL). During dose finding, up to 12 subjects will receive a single infusion of ATL&#xD;
      product expressing the CAR.κ encoding the CD28 co-stimulatory endodomain (CAR.κ.28). The&#xD;
      starting dose will be 5.0 × 105 cells/kg. Up to 3 dose levels of CAR.κ.28 cells will be&#xD;
      tested with at least 3 subjects enrolled in each dose cohort before dose escalation is&#xD;
      considered based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Prior to receiving the&#xD;
      cell product, subjects will undergo lymphodepletion with fludarabine and bendamustine or&#xD;
      cyclophophamide. Dose escalation will be guided by the modified 3+3 design. Any dose level&#xD;
      may be expanded to 4-9 subjects to obtain more data at that dose or to include subjects for&#xD;
      which insufficient cells are manufactured to enroll on their assigned higher dose level. If&#xD;
      due to the expansion the estimated DLT rate at a dose is ≥0.33, the study would not escalate&#xD;
      to the next highest dose level and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) would be exceeded. If&#xD;
      needed, an expansion cohort will enroll up to 8 subjects at the RP2D to further assess safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of CAR.κ.28 cells. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), response rate (RR), duration of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS). The&#xD;
      persistence of CAR.κ.28 cells in the peripheral blood will be assessed as an exploratory&#xD;
      objective. The final RP2D including expansion data will be the dose with the DLT rate closest&#xD;
      to 0.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adoptive transfer of T cells targeting the kappa light chain (CAR.κ) is a promising&#xD;
      treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory κ + NHL and has shown encouraging preclinical&#xD;
      activity [37]. The CD8α stalk incorporated into CD28 signaling domain within the CAR, may&#xD;
      improve the persistence of the CAR.κ T cells. Therefore, subjects in this study are being&#xD;
      infused with this newly modified version of CAR.κ.28 so that persistence and efficacy will be&#xD;
      improved compared to the older version of the CAR.κ molecule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that CAR.κ.28 will be well tolerated in subjects with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      indolent and aggressive lymphomas positive for the kappa light chain and will show efficacy.&#xD;
      We also anticipate that CAR.κ.28 will show fast expansion in the peripheral blood in the&#xD;
      first 2 - 3 weeks, but also longer term persistence than the previous version of CAR.κ.28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase 1 single center study, peripheral blood will be collected for production of&#xD;
      CAR.κ.28 cells prior to conditioning chemotherapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory κ+&#xD;
      indolent lymphoma including follicular lymphoma grade 1-3b, splenic marginal zone lymphoma,&#xD;
      extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, nodal marginal zone&#xD;
      lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. During the approximately 1-2 months necessary for CAR-T&#xD;
      cell production, subjects may undergo standard of care treatment (&quot;bridging therapy&quot;) per&#xD;
      physician's discretion. Subjects must sign consent forms before cells are procured and again&#xD;
      prior to undergoing lymphodepleting chemotherapy and cellular treatment. At 2-14 days&#xD;
      (preferably 2-4 days) after lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine, we will infuse&#xD;
      the CAR.κ.28 cell product. Subjects in this study will receive CAR.κ.28 cell product in one&#xD;
      of the three planned dose escalation cohorts. Dose levels of CAR.κ.28 cells administered will&#xD;
      range between 5.0 × 105 cells/kg and 2 × 106 cells/kg. These doses have been evaluated in&#xD;
      previous phase 1 studies of CAR-T cell lymphocytes [37-39] including a phase 1 trial&#xD;
      targeting the kappa light chain on malignant B cells in which the construct included the CD28&#xD;
      co-stimulatory endodomain [37]. An expansion cohort will enroll up to 8 subjects at the RP2D&#xD;
      to further assess safety and efficacy of CAR.κ.28 cells. In all subjects, we will measure the&#xD;
      persistence of CAR.κ.28 cells in the peripheral blood at different time points by measuring&#xD;
      the level of the transgene and by phenotypic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Procurement Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained&#xD;
      from subjects for cell procurement. In subjects with inadequate lymphocyte count in the&#xD;
      peripheral blood, a leukapheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The&#xD;
      parameters for apheresis will be up to 2 blood volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphodepleting Regimen Subjects will receive a &quot;pre-conditioning&quot; cytoreductive regimen of&#xD;
      bendamustine 70 mg/m2/day administered IV followed by fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered&#xD;
      IV over 3 consecutive days. These agents will be administered per institutional guidelines.&#xD;
      Prophylaxis (e.g., hydration, antiemetics, etc.) needed prior to fludarabine and bendamustine&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be provided per institutional guidelines. At the discretion of the clinical&#xD;
      investigator, subjects with a known history of intolerance to bendamustine may be considered&#xD;
      for lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day administered IV followed by an IV&#xD;
      dose of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered over 3 consecutive days. These agents will be&#xD;
      administered per institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Administration The cellular product consisting of CAR.κ.28 cells will be administered by&#xD;
      a licensed healthcare provider (oncology nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 5&#xD;
      - 10 minutes through either a peripheral or a central line. The volume of infusion will&#xD;
      depend upon the concentration of the cells when frozen and the size of the subject. The&#xD;
      expected volume will be 1-50cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will&#xD;
      receive CAR.κ.28 cells within 2 - 14 days, but preferably within 2-4 days, after completing&#xD;
      the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During dose finding, a single dose of CAR.κ.28 will be given after lymphodepletion. The cell&#xD;
      dose levels that will be evaluated are outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Cohort, CAR.κ.28 will be given after lymphodepletion. Subjects will receive the&#xD;
      RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy in LCCC1811-ATL involves a single cell infusion of ATLCAR cells. Treatment with at&#xD;
      least one infusion will be administered unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up Subjects will be followed for up to 15 years for RCR evaluation or&#xD;
      until death, whichever occurs first. In addition to this follow-up, subjects removed from&#xD;
      study treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or&#xD;
      stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who experience unequivocal disease progression and start alternate therapy after&#xD;
      receiving a cell infusion still be required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures.&#xD;

             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. The two birth control methods can be composed of:&#xD;
             two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
             Female subjects of childbearing potential will also be instructed to tell their male&#xD;
             partners to use a condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be able to participate in&#xD;
        this study (procurement, lymphodepletion and cell infusion):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia or multiple&#xD;
             myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A history of intolerance to bendamustine or fludarabine. Note: subjects with known&#xD;
             history of intolerance to bendamustine may be considered for lymphodepletion with&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide and fludarabine at the discretion of the clinical investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Tumor in a location where enlargement could cause airway obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses ≥10 mg prednisone daily or its&#xD;
             equivalent; those receiving &lt;10 mg daily may be enrolled at discretion of&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active infection with HTLV, HCV (can be pending at the time of cell procurement; only&#xD;
             those samples confirming lack of active infection will be used to generate transduced&#xD;
             cells) defined as not being well controlled on therapy as well as no history of HIV.&#xD;
             Subjects are required to have negative HIV antibody, negative HTLV1 and HTLV2&#xD;
             antibodies, negative hepatitis B surface antigen, and negative HCV antibody or viral&#xD;
