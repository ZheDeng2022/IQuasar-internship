  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized phase II study is a formal comparison of radiotherapy versus&#xD;
      trans-oral surgery as the primary treatment of HPV-negative patients with early-stage&#xD;
      oropharyngeal carcinoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized phase II study. Patients will be randomized between&#xD;
      current standard of care treatment (Arm 1) vs. TOS (Arm 2) in a 1:1 ratio. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients will be stratified according to T stage (T1 vs. T2); N stage (N0/1 vs. N2/3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized phase II design is required for three reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The randomization will provide an appropriate control group to serve as a comparator for&#xD;
           the experimental arm. Historical or contemporaneous non-randomized controls would not be&#xD;
           appropriate due to the multitude of biases that could be introduced by patient selection&#xD;
           and other confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A small sample size will allow for adequate power to assess for progression-free&#xD;
           survival, and also an assessment of quality of life, overall survival and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The results will allow for a decision as to whether a multi-institutional phase III&#xD;
           trial is warranted, and inform the design of such a trial.&#xD;
