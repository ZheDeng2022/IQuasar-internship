  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pain of childbirth is the most severe pain any women can endure in their life time.&#xD;
      Painful uterine contractions lead to maternal hyperventilation and increased catecholamine&#xD;
      concentrations resulting im maternal and fetal hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labour pain when unrelieved can have adverse effect on the course of labour as well as on the&#xD;
      fetal wellbeing. An effective labour analgesia lead to better fetal and maternal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the gold standard in labour analgesia is utilization of epidural services which are&#xD;
      widely used to provide pain-free labour in many parts of the world and and have the advantage&#xD;
      of providing flexibility to meet the needs of each patient . Epidurals have long been&#xD;
      associated with increased oxytocin use, increased fetal malposition, increased rates of&#xD;
      instrumental and cesarian delivery, and longer labour .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of single-shot intrathecal low dose found to be effective . The advantages of this&#xD;
      form of technique include the rapidity of onset and reliability, with minimal hemodynamic&#xD;
      changes and motor block. Spinal block is cheaper as well as less technically challenging when&#xD;
      compared to epidural and combined spinal epidural block. Intrathecal analgesia alone is&#xD;
      useful when duration of labour can be reasonably estimated. Opioid combined with a small dose&#xD;
      of local anesthetic provides rapid analgesia and dissipates when no longer needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine because of its least placental transfer, due to high protein binding and minimal&#xD;
      motor block compared to sensory block in lower doses, has become the popular choice for labor&#xD;
      analgesia. Addition of neuraxial lipid soluble opioids permitted reduction in the dose while&#xD;
      maintaining effective analgesia and minimizing potential adverse effects on the progress of&#xD;
      labor and lower extremity motor block .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levobupivacaine is the S (-) enantiomer of racemic bupivacaine. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that it exhibits a clinical profile similar to bupivacaine with the added advantage of less&#xD;
      motor impairment .&#xD;
