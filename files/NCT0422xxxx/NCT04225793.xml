      The gold standard of colorectal examination is colonoscopy. One of the main purposes of&#xD;
      colonoscopy is detecting bowel neoplasms. Right now there are several methods the bowel&#xD;
      preparation for the colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors can affect the quality of the bowel preparation, such as the kind of oral&#xD;
      laxative, the time after its intake and the diet followed in the days before colonoscopy. In&#xD;
      this randomized clinical trial the investigators aimed to compare the safety and efficiency&#xD;
      of two low-volume laxatives for bowel preparation: potassium, magnesium and sodium&#xD;
      sulphates-based laxative Eziclen (IPSEN, France) and Macrogol-3350 + Sodium Sulfate +&#xD;
      Potassium Chloride+ Sodium Chloride + Ascorbic Acid-based and Sodium Ascorbate-based Moviprep&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The key method of colorectal examination is colonoscopy. The result, diagnostic significance&#xD;
      and therapeutic safety depend a lot on the quality of bowel preparation. One of the main&#xD;
      purposes of colonoscopy is detecting the earliest forms of colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      prognostically meaningful small nonpolyposis neoplasms. The good and perfect bowel&#xD;
      preparation is essential in this case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the bowel preparation for colonoscopy must fulfill the following criterias:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be effective, that means to empty colon of faeces, residual liquid and foamy content&#xD;
           fully and safely;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Harmless, no side effects on the other organs and systems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not cause discomfort nor change to electrolyte balance, well tolerated;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not affect the severity of bowel disease nor cause macro- and microscopic colon&#xD;
           mucose changes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quick response with short preparation period (no more than 24 hours);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easy to use, so patient could perform it independently or with the least medical staff&#xD;
           participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not require special conditions, equipment and staff training (possibility to perform&#xD;
           at home);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not distort the endoscopic image (colour, shape, reflexion);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not limit the use of vital dyes or other means of endoscopic diagnosis and treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not damage the endoscopic equipment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be cheap . Bowel preparation schemes usually include diet (low-residue) and oral&#xD;
           laxative intake. The low-residue diet should last no more than 24 hours before the&#xD;
           colonoscopy according to the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy clinical&#xD;
           recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time factor is essential for quality of bowel preparation. If the colonoscopy is&#xD;
      performed in the first half of day the intake of the part of laxatives (usually a half) on&#xD;
      that day (split-mode or separate) provides a better result in comparison to full dose intake&#xD;
      on the colonoscopy day or the evening before it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel preparation might be fully undertaken (in full volume) in the morning of examination&#xD;
      day for patients undergoing colonoscopy in the afternoon according to some studies. In the&#xD;
      case of laxative intake on the morning of examination day, excellent preparation quality and&#xD;
      good patient tolerance was demonstrated in the Varughese S et al. research assessing 4 liters&#xD;
      bowel preparation scheme efficiency for patients undergoing colonoscopy in the afternoon in&#xD;
      comparison to intake in the evening before colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's somatic status and the urgency should be considered for choosing the bowel&#xD;
      preparation mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyethyleneglycol-based drugs have become more commonly used in clinical practice for&#xD;
      colonoscopy bowel preparation since its appearance in 1980.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug passes through the intestine without being absorbed and metabolized and increases&#xD;
      the bowel liquid volume, as do all osmotic laxatives. Thus, electrolyte balance is not&#xD;
      disrupted and effective intestinal lavage occurs. But patient compliance might be influenced&#xD;
      significantly due to a large volume intake requirement (4 l) and specific organoleptic&#xD;
      feature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of several years, European and Canadian experts have accepted the sodium&#xD;
      picosulfate+ magnesium citrate-based low-volume bowel preparation method (2l) as alternative&#xD;
      option and the FDA has also approved it in July 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This combined intake scheme allows to prepare intestine efficiently for the examination. The&#xD;
      sodium picosulfate has a bowel stimulating effect and as osmotic laxative magnesium citrate&#xD;
      retains water. But the electrolyte balance changes and dehydration may also influence the&#xD;
      patient compliance to laxative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the international clinical recommendations for colonoscopy, 4l&#xD;
      polyethylenуglycol-based laxative in split-mode preparation with an time interval no more&#xD;
      than 4 hours from the end of preparation until colonoscopy is recommended as a standard&#xD;
      method. Low-dose polyethylenуglycol-based laxative intake (2l) combined with ascorbate or&#xD;
      sodium thiosulfate+ magnesium citrate can serve as alternative examination preparation method&#xD;
      (especially for outpatients). Only polyethylenуglycol-based laxative can be recommended for&#xD;
      patients with renal failure as bowel preparation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eziclen - potassium, magnesium and sodium sulphates-based osmotic laxative for colonoscopy&#xD;
      preparation registered in Russia doesn't have a strong evidence base and is not included in&#xD;
      national recommendations yet due to its recent market entry (2018) But according to the&#xD;
      registered multicenter controlled clinical trials assessing the potassium, magnesium and&#xD;
      sodium sulfates vs. 2l polyethyleneglycol with electrolytes efficiency for colonoscopy&#xD;
      preparation in split-mode (n=356) and one-day preparation (n=364) (primary endpoint - bowel&#xD;
      purity degree as &quot;perfect&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;) as well as non-conceded Eziclen efficiency was&#xD;
      identified in comparing to the control group (97,2% vs 96,1% and 84% vs 82,9% respectively).&#xD;
      The side effects frequency was also comparable with control group. There was shown a&#xD;
      comparable rate of effective bowel preparation (97,2% vs 97,7%) on a background of higher&#xD;
      patient compliance (95,7 % comparing to 82,3 %) in a similar study assessing Eziclen&#xD;
      efficiency, safety and patient compliancy in comparison with Macrogol 400 with electrolytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the investigators aimed our study to investigate efficiency, safety and compliance of two&#xD;
      low-volume laxatives Potassium Sulfate+ Magnesium Sulfate+ Sodium Sulfate-based (Eziclen) vs.&#xD;
      relevant volume of Macrogol-3350+ Sodium Sulfate+ Potassium Chloride+ Sodium Chloride+&#xD;
      Ascorbic Acid and Sodium Ascorbate-based (Moviprep) in bowel preparation for colonoscopy.&#xD;
