  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to determine if prolonged use of S&amp;SEs in a whole diet approach (foods and drinks)&#xD;
      improves dietary health and obesity related risk factors and increases compliance to weight&#xD;
      control paradigms in the long term. A randomized, controlled, multicentre trial (RCT) will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize, that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prolonged use of S&amp;SEs in beverages and food matrices will result in improved body&#xD;
           weight control because S&amp;SEs will increase palatability of the diet and thereby increase&#xD;
           compliance to the recommendations for a healthy diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be no safety concerns using S&amp;SEs in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight/obese adults and families where at least one adult (both gender) and one child&#xD;
      (both gender) are overweight/obese will be recruited. The majority of measurements will only&#xD;
      be conducted in the adult population and some measurement will only be done in sub-groups.&#xD;
      The intervention will be performed in four countries: Denmark, Greece, Spain and the&#xD;
      Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 430 participants - approximately 330 adults (18-65 years of age) and 100 children&#xD;
      (6-12 years of age) - will be recruited for the study. All adult participants are first&#xD;
      treated by a low energy diet (LED) for 2 months with an aim to reduce body weight (minimum 5%&#xD;
      weight loss (WL)), whereas children are treated separately with a conventional weight&#xD;
      maintenance (WM) diet, without a specific aim for absolute WL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants - both adults and families - are randomized into two different diet&#xD;
      interventions for 10 months with or without inclusion of S&amp;SEs products (foods and drinks).&#xD;
      For adults, this period aims at preventing weight re-gain and for children maintaining body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI)-for-age. The participants will receive food exchange lists and will be&#xD;
      guided by dieticians. The randomization will be stratified by age, sex and BMI. Adults (not&#xD;
      participating with children) belonging to the same household and all members of a family will&#xD;
      be assigned the same intervention - the randomization will here solely be based on the oldest&#xD;
      adult in the family/household.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adult participants are weighed at months 0, 0.5 and 1, and if needed at month 1.5. They&#xD;
      are supervised during the WL period at months 0 and 1, and if needed at months 0.5 and 1.5,&#xD;
      and throughout the WM period at months 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12. Children will follow a similar, but&#xD;
      less strict time schedule (their participation is preferred but not required for all&#xD;
      dietician meetings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main assessment points are the clinical investigation days (CIDs) at month 0 (baseline,&#xD;
      start of the WL period), 2 (end of the WL period/start of randomized intervention), 6 (6&#xD;
      months from baseline) and 12 (1 year from baseline).&#xD;
