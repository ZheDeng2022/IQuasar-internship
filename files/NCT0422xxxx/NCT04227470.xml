      attack of NMOSD in China&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose exploration study.The investigational drug is HBM9161 injection,&#xD;
      and the indication is NMOSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBM9161(HL161BKN) is a human monoclonal antibody. HBM9161 targets the neonatal Fc receptor&#xD;
      (FcRn) . By blocking the FcRn IgG-Fc binding site and accelerating the degradation of IgG, it&#xD;
      can significantly reduce the total IgG level in blood (including pathological IgG).The serum&#xD;
      aquaporin 4 antibody (AQP4-IgG) associated with NMOSD is a pathological IgG, so the&#xD;
      combination of standard of care which is intravenous methylprednisolone (ivMP) with HBM9161&#xD;
      is expected to rapidly reduce AQP4-IgG levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two dose groups (340 mg and 680 mg) were planned, and each dose group plans to enroll&#xD;
      approximately 6 subjects. All subjects are weekly administered the HBM9161 by subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection for a period of 4 weeks, together with standard of care which is of intravenous&#xD;
      methylprednisolone (ivMP) by subcutaneous for a period of 4 weeks. The study will investigate&#xD;
      the safety, and tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of HBM 9161 in patients with&#xD;
      attack of NMOSD in China.&#xD;
