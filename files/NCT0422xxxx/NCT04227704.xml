    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to randomise participants to receive ketamine or placebo control&#xD;
      subcutaneously or by 40-minute intravenous infusions and will follow them up for 42 days to&#xD;
      assess the incidence of postpartum depression. This feasibility pilot study is designed to&#xD;
      explore the adequacy of the study procedures and tolerability of the interventions.&#xD;

      Postpartum depression (PPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPD is one of the most common perinatal medical complications and can have a detrimental&#xD;
      effect on both mother and baby. Suicide exceeds hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders as a&#xD;
      cause of maternal mortality and maternal psychopathology interferes with the parent-infant&#xD;
      relationship. It has been estimated to have a period prevalence of 19.2% in the first 3&#xD;
      postpartum months. The rapid decline in reproductive hormones is thought to contribute to the&#xD;
      development of PPD in susceptible women, although the specific pathogenesis is unknown. The&#xD;
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that all women should be&#xD;
      routinely screened for depressive symptoms in the perinatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for PPD include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression during pregnancy â€¢ Breastfeeding problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preterm birth/infant admission to neonatal intensive care (NICU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Traumatic birth experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety during pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine's anti-depressant effect&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine, a phencyclidine derivative, is a non-competitive antagonist at the&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor that is commonly used as an anesthetic or sedative&#xD;
      agent and has proven analgesic effect after a variety of surgeries including CD, where it has&#xD;
      also been shown to reduce shivering. It has been demonstrated to have a rapid anti-depressant&#xD;
      effect in treatment-resistant depression outside of pregnancy. The most commonly employed&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) dose for this purpose is 0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes, as single or repeated&#xD;
      infusions. It has been postulated that prolonged blockade of NMDA receptors causes long-term&#xD;
      changes in signal transduction leading to sustained clinical improvement, some investigators&#xD;
      have explored longer term infusions such as those used to treat chronic pain. A recent pilot&#xD;
      study assessing the feasibility of a 96-hour (~0.5mg/kg/hr) infusion compared with a single&#xD;
      40-minute (0.5 mg/kg) infusion suggested a trend toward greater efficacy in the prolonged&#xD;
      infusion but confirmation of a statistically significant result is awaited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine and PPD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This promising anti-depressant effect has prompted investigation of ketamine as a&#xD;
      preventative measure in patients undergoing CD. There have been 2 studies to date, one which&#xD;
      failed to demonstrate any benefit from a bolus dose of 0.25 mg/kg and one which documented a&#xD;
      large reduction (1 and 22% in the treatment and control, respectively) in the (6 week) period&#xD;
      prevalence of postpartum depression after a 4 mg/kg dose of ketamine over 50 hours (~0.08&#xD;
      mg/kg/hr).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prolonged IV infusion, was achieved by adding the ketamine to a sufentanil&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) pump with a background infusion. This PCA pump is a&#xD;
      standard part of their post-cesarean analgesic regimen. In our institution, it is standard&#xD;
      practice to discontinue IV infusions and to remove IV cannulae as early as it is safe to do&#xD;
      so. This practice is essential to the attempts to enhance postoperative recovery and aid&#xD;
      mother's bonding with their babies and facilitate their early-life care. This reflects&#xD;
      patients' expectations and preferences and is in line with other maternity units across North&#xD;
      America and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural course of PPD varies and, although it may resolve spontaneously within weeks,&#xD;
      approximately 20% of women with PPD still have depression at 12 months and beyond. As many as&#xD;
      13% will still have depressive symptoms at 2 years and 40% will have a relapse. Considering&#xD;
      the maternal suffering, disruption to the family, potential impairment of the social,&#xD;
      emotional, and cognitive development of the child, and the rare cases of infanticide and&#xD;
      suicide caused by PPD, the impact on families and society as a whole is difficult to&#xD;
      overemphasize. An intervention that promises such a large reduction in this devastating&#xD;
      disease warrants extensive research. In an attempt to achieve the benefit whilst employing&#xD;
      methods more acceptable to our patients we have designed a pilot study to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of our study design and collect preliminary tolerability and efficacy data on&#xD;
      ketamine administered by two alternative routes: 40-minute IV infusion (i.v.) and&#xD;
      subcutaneous (s.c.) injection.&#xD;
