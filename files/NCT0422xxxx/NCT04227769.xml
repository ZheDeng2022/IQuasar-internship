    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, mixed double- and single-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over&#xD;
      clinical trial to test whether acute treatment with an IL-1 receptor antagonist impacts&#xD;
      insulin secretion over time during the cephalic phase, defined as the first 10 minutes after&#xD;
      the first sensorial contact to food, in healthy individuals in healthy humans (Group 1) and&#xD;
      in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (Group 2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of the immune system in metabolism has been extensively investigated in pancreatic&#xD;
      islets and insulin sensitive tissues. However little attention has been given to a potential&#xD;
      role of the innate immune system in the cephalic phase of insulin secretion. In humans, the&#xD;
      cephalic phase of insulin secretion appear reduced in obesity and in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, randomized, mixed double- and single-blinded, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      cross-over clinical trial we aim to test whether acute treatment with an IL-1 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist impacts insulin secretion over time during the cephalic phase, defined as the&#xD;
      first 10 minutes after the first sensorial contact to food, in healthy individuals in healthy&#xD;
      humans (Group 1) and in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: After screening, subjects will be randomized to two crossover visits with a washout&#xD;
      period of at least 4 days in-between visits and at most two weeks: A) subcutaneous saline&#xD;
      injection 3h before an oral standardized meal, B) subcutaneous injection of 100 mg of the&#xD;
      IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra 3h before an oral standardized meal. Treatments will be&#xD;
      placebo controlled, crossover, double blinded. The study will be performed in a population of&#xD;
      healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Same as for Group 1 with the following addition: after the second study day,&#xD;
      participant in group 2 will be trained to self-inject the medication for 6 days. On the 7th&#xD;
      day, an oral standardized meal test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects from group 1 will be matched for sex and age to the diabetic cohort from&#xD;
      group 2.&#xD;
