      There have been numerous studies demonstrating surgical site infections that arise from&#xD;
      contamination at time of surgery or by seeding from other sites in the body which arise from&#xD;
      organisms normally found on the skin. This has been known to cause complications in spine&#xD;
      surgery, shoulder, hip, and knee arthroplasty. While studies have shown that organisms like&#xD;
      Cutibacterium persists on the skin despite standard surgical preparation, there have not been&#xD;
      studies that examine the organisms found in the fingernail region pre- and post- standard&#xD;
      surgical preparations. This study investigates how thorough fingernails are prepped prior to&#xD;
      the operation. The results of this study would determine whether providers are adequately&#xD;
      cleaning the patient's entire arm, including under the fingernail, prior to surgery. The&#xD;
      results may support continuation of the current practice or adding to the standard surgical&#xD;
      preparation to ensure adequately sterilization of surgical sites and all exposed areas, which&#xD;
      include the fingernails.&#xD;

      It is well known that even with surgical skin preparation, there are some microorganisms that&#xD;
      remain on the patient's skin. There have been numerous studies demonstrating surgical site&#xD;
      infections that arise from contamination at time of surgery or by seeding from other sites in&#xD;
      the body which arise from organisms normally found on the skin. This has been known to cause&#xD;
      complications in spine surgery, shoulder, hip, and knee arthroplasty. While studies have&#xD;
      shown that organisms like Cutibacterium persist on the skin despite standard surgical&#xD;
      preparation, there have not been studies that examine the organisms found in the fingernail&#xD;
      region pre- and post- standard surgical preparations. It is common practice to not cover the&#xD;
      fingernails when patients are undergoing distal upper extremity surgery. Providers tend to&#xD;
      consider them prepped when they have the chlorhexidine or betadine preparations applied;&#xD;
      however, there is uncertainty regarding how much attention is given to the fingernails. This&#xD;
      study investigates how thorough fingernails are prepped prior to the operation. The results&#xD;
      of this study would determine whether providers are adequately cleaning the patient's entire&#xD;
      arm, including under the fingernail, prior to surgery. The results may support continuation&#xD;
      of the current practice or adding to the standard surgical preparation to ensure adequate&#xD;
      sterilization of surgical sites and all exposed areas, which include the fingernails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study design of 20 pediatric patients who are undergoing distal upper&#xD;
      extremity surgery. Ten patients will receive a chlorhexidine prep prior to their operation,&#xD;
      and the other 10 will receive a betadine prep. Patients will be considered for the study if&#xD;
      they are 10 years old or younger and are having either wrist, forearm, or elbow internal&#xD;
      fixation surgeries. Three culture specimens will be sent to microbiology: 1) before the&#xD;
      surgical skin preparation; 2) after the skin preparation but before the operation; and 3)&#xD;
      after the operation. Culture results will be compared pre- and post- surgical prep and&#xD;
      between chlorhexidine and betadine preps.&#xD;
