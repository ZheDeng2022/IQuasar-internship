             related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has symptomatic Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI), Rutherford Becker Clinical&#xD;
             Category 4 or 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject requires primary treatment of up to two de novo or restenotic (treated with&#xD;
             prior PTA) infrapopliteal lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female subject of childbearing potential should not be pregnant and must be on birth&#xD;
             control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done&#xD;
        within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site standard test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Anatomic Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Up to two native infrapopliteal lesions, each lesion located in separate&#xD;
             infrapopliteal vessel in the same limb. Restenotic (from prior PTA) lesions are&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Lesion must be located in the proximal 2/3 of native infrapopliteal vessels, with&#xD;
                  vessel diameter of ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 4.00 mm by investigator visual assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Total scaffold length to completely cover/treat a target lesion must not exceed&#xD;
                  170 mm (total everolimus drug dose of 1790 µg).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The total scaffold length among all target lesions must not exceed 170 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. The target vessel cannot have any other angiographic significant lesions (≥50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Tandem lesions are allowed if they are &lt; 3 cm apart and the total scaffold length&#xD;
                  used to cover the entire diseased segment is ≤ 170 mm. Each tandem lesion is&#xD;
                  considered one lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Target lesion(s) must have ≥ 70% stenosis, per visual assessment at the time of the&#xD;
             procedure. If needed, quantitative imaging (angiography, IVUS, and/or OCT) can be used&#xD;
             to aid accurate sizing of the vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The distal margin of the target lesion must be located ≥ 10 cm proximal to the&#xD;
             proximal margin of the ankle mortise. The vessel segment distal to the target lesion&#xD;
             must be patent all the way to the ankle, with no significant lesion (≥ 50% stenosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Significant lesion (≥ 50% stenosis) in the inflow artery(ies) must be treated&#xD;
             successfully (as per physician's assessment of the angiography) through standard of&#xD;
             care prior to the treatment of the target lesion. Treatment can be done within the&#xD;
             same trial procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Non-target lesion(s) (if applicable) must be located in separate infrapopliteal&#xD;
             vessel(s) from the target lesion, and suitable to be treated per institution standard&#xD;
             of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Guidewire must cross the target lesion successfully. Crossing in an antegrade fashion&#xD;
             is preferred, but retrograde crossing may be used. However, the treatment must be&#xD;
             delivered antegrade.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        General Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             WBC &gt; 15,000 cells/microliter, hypotension) at the time of assessment. Osteomyelitis&#xD;
             of the phalanges or metatarsal heads (as described in exclusion criteria #21a) or&#xD;
             cellulitis of the foot amenable to treatment with IV antibiotics at the time of&#xD;
             revascularization is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject is bedridden or unable to walk (with assistance is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject with extensive tissue loss salvageable only with complex foot reconstruction&#xD;
             or non-traditional transmetatarsal amputations. This includes subjects with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Osteomyelitis that extends proximal to the metatarsal heads. Osteomyelitis&#xD;
                  limited to the phalanges or metatarsal heads is acceptable for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Gangrene involving the plantar skin of the forefoot, midfoot, or heel&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Deep ulcer or large shallow ulcer (&gt; 3 cm) involving the plantar skin of the&#xD;
                  forefoot, midfoot, or heel&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Full thickness heel ulcer with/without calcaneal involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Any wound with calcaneal bone involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Wounds that are deemed to be neuropathic or non-ischemic in nature&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Wounds that would require flap coverage or complex wound management for large&#xD;
                  soft tissue defect&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Full thickness wounds on the dorsum of the foot with exposed tendon or bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subject is unable or unwilling to provide written consent prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Subject has active symptoms and/or a positive test result of COVID-19 or other rapidly&#xD;
             spreading novel infectious agent within the prior 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Anatomic Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Lesions with severe calcification, in which there is a high likelihood that successful&#xD;
             pre-dilatation cannot be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Lesion that has prior metallic stent implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Significant (-≥ 50% stenosis) lesion in a distal outflow artery that would be perfused&#xD;
             by the target vessel and that requires treatment at the time of the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Inflow lesions or non-target infrapopliteal lesions that were treated using paclitaxel&#xD;
             coated or eluting stents or DCB, during the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has had or will require treatment in any peripheral anatomy vessel with a&#xD;
             drug-coated or drug-eluting device &lt; 90 days pre-study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Target or (if applicable) non-target vessel contains visible thrombus as indicated in&#xD;
             the angiographic images.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has angiographic evidence of thromboembolism or atheroembolism in the&#xD;
             ipsilateral extremity. (Pre- and post-angiographic imaging must confirm the absence of&#xD;
             emboli in the distal anatomy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unsuccessfully treated proximal inflow limiting arterial stenosis or inflow-limiting&#xD;
             arterial lesions left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No angiographic evidence of a patent pedal artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Target or (if applicable) non-target lesion location requiring bifurcation treatment&#xD;
             method that requires scaffolding of both branches (provisional treatment, without&#xD;
             intention of scaffolding both branches is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Aneurysm in the iliac, common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal or target artery&#xD;
             of the ipsilateral extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Visual assessment of the target lesion suggests that the investigator is unable to&#xD;
             pre-dilate the lesion according to the vessel diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Target lesion has a high probability that atherectomy will be required at the time of&#xD;
             index procedure for treatment of the target vessel.&#xD;
