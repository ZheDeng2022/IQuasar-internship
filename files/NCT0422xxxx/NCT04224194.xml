  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the real-life patient handling experience with the use of an autoinjector in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who self-inject AVT02&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an autoinjector handling study to assess the ability of patients to self-inject AVT02&#xD;
      with the proposed autoinjector in the normal standard of care setting, and to assess the&#xD;
      reliability of the proposed autoinjector for AVT02.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Week 0 (Day 0) eligible patients will be trained by qualified study site personnel&#xD;
      (Investigator-led trained injection) following the first injection. The patient will return&#xD;
      to the clinic on Week 2 (Day 14) and will be asked to selfinject the second dose (trained&#xD;
      self-injection). The injection will be observed by the study personnel and the patient&#xD;
      provided any assistance necessary to complete an acceptable injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Week 4 (Day 28), Week 6 (Day 42), and Week 8 (Day 56), the patient will return to clinic&#xD;
      and will be asked to self-inject the dose without assistance but under observation of&#xD;
      qualified trial staff (observed self-injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations of autoinjector handling events are recorded independently by both trial site&#xD;
      staff and patients using standardized questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any failures to inject will be investigated to determine if they are mechanical failures of&#xD;
      the device or due to use error of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All failures will be further investigated to determine the root cause, and where necessary,&#xD;
      appropriate mitigation will be developed and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Extension period (Weeks 9 to 56), AVT02 40 mg will be administered every other week&#xD;
      via prefilled syringe (PFS) starting from Week 10 and ending at week 54. The final efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation is expected at Week 56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study report (CSR) will include the data from the 8week active period. The&#xD;
      extension phase CSR will include the data from the 48-week extension period (Weeks 9 to 56).&#xD;
