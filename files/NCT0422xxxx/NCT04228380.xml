    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective study that investigates patient-related factors that&#xD;
      cannot be accessed in registry data, such as frailty, functional level prior to admission,&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, living in a relationship or not, and how these factors influence&#xD;
      decisions about treatment limitations and outcome for critically ill patients in Swedish&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of intensive care is to prevent and treat organ failure in one or more major&#xD;
      organ systems, with the goal that the patient should have a continued that meaningful life.&#xD;
      Due to the aging population, the development of medical knowledge and additional therapies,&#xD;
      the number of patients in need of intensive care, worldwide, has increased. The number of&#xD;
      patients being treated in intensive care units in Sweden increased by 23 % from 2008 to&#xD;
      2015(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive care should be provided based on the patient's condition, needs and available&#xD;
      treatment options. In addition, it is important that patients benefit from the treatment. In&#xD;
      some circumstances, the patient's chronic and / or acute condition is of such a degree that&#xD;
      the patient is not deemed able to benefit from intensive care. In such situations, decisions&#xD;
      must be made to withdraw or withhold intensive care . A decision to withdraw or withhold&#xD;
      intensive care means that life-sustaining treatments such as mechanical ventilation, dialysis&#xD;
      or inotropic drugs is terminated or not initiated .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study from our group, the investigators showed that female gender increases the&#xD;
      odds of making a decision to withdraw or refrain from intensive care by 18% , when&#xD;
      adjustments for age and patient condition had been made ( 2 ). The reason for this is not&#xD;
      known, but can be found in explanations as to the patient's functional status prior to the&#xD;
      current admission, including how well the participants manage daily activities, if the&#xD;
      participants have any type of functional impairment, cognitive impairment or frailty. Frailty&#xD;
      describes a patient's vulnerability , and several scientific reports demonstrate an&#xD;
      association between frailty and impaired outcome after intensive care (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of preadmission functional status has been shown previously in several studies&#xD;
      from Yale University, United States ( 7-9 ). Data is mainly for an older population, from the&#xD;
      US, ( 10-11 ) but for a mixed intensive care population in Sweden there is no such data. A&#xD;
      recent study from the VIP2 group has looked at how factors such as frailty , cognitive&#xD;
      impairment , functional impairment and comorbidities affect outcome in patients over 80 years&#xD;
      of age. It was then found that frailty alone could predict worse outcome (13). Gender and&#xD;
      relationships were not parameters in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to identify factors that may influence clinical decisions about&#xD;
      treatment limitations and outcome.&#xD;
