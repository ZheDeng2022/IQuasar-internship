    <textblock>
      The CAG Bipolar study is a large-scale pragmatic randomized controlled trial aiming to&#xD;
      investigate whether specialized and more centralized treatment (into a clinical academic&#xD;
      group (CAG)) improves lives and outcomes for patients with bipolar disorder (N= 1000&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a complex illness with a complex treatment that differs during manic,&#xD;
      depressed and remitted states, frequently leaving patients with decreased quality of life and&#xD;
      impaired psychosocial function. Traditionally, psychiatry has been sparsely subspecialized in&#xD;
      Denmark as well as internationally during the last four decades leaving patients in&#xD;
      generalized psychiatric settings. At the same time, demands to clinical skills, research and&#xD;
      education have increased, and IT solutions have emerged as a possible way to optimize&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of organizational changes and digital health interventions are rarely investigated&#xD;
      scientifically in health care services. This is a randomized controlled trial conducted in&#xD;
      the entire Mental Health Services, Capital Region of Denmark including all psychiatric&#xD;
      centers in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAG Bipolar study is a large-scale pragmatic randomized controlled trial aiming to&#xD;
      investigate whether specialized and more centralized treatment (into a clinical academic&#xD;
      group (CAG)) improves lives and outcomes for patients with bipolar disorder (N= 1000&#xD;
      patients). Findings from the study will have great impact on future organization and&#xD;
      optimization of treatment within psychiatry in Denmark as well as internationally.&#xD;
