      This is a pilot study for usability and efficacy, and as such it is designed for 15&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the usability of the Monterey&#xD;
      Investigational System in the home setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the usability of the Monterey&#xD;
      Investigational System in the home setting over one week of daily use. Usability will be&#xD;
      determined using a 11 point Likert Scale where a score of 10 is considered very favorable and&#xD;
      a score of 0 is very unfavorable.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Therapy provided by Monterey Investigational system</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be determined by comparing lower limb volume measured prior to commencing therapy and at the conclusion. The truncated cone formula is a well-established measure used for assessing limb volume [1]. The limb is divided into segments as per figure 2, measurements taken and volume in each segment is calculated as per the following formula: Voln = L/12(pi)(C1^2+C2^2+C1*C2)</description>

    <description>The MontereyInvestigational System is a compact pneumatic compression device used for the treatment of either primary or secondary lymphedema. The primary intention in this study is to gather usability design feedback. This will be done by observing how a patient uses the device after a brief demonstration from the clinician. Errors and difficulties will be noted by the ResMed representative observing the trial. The qualitative interview with the patient at the end of the trial will yield additional understanding of the patient experience with the device.</description>
