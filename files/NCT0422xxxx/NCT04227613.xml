      Prospective study of cosmetic outcome and quality of life for women undergoing breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery using patient a reported outcome measure (BREAST-Q) and a computer program validated&#xD;
      to assess cosmetic outcomes after breast cancer surgery (BCCT.core) at baseline and on 1-year&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study with the aim to investigate how breast cancer patient's quality of&#xD;
      life changes after breast cancer surgery, as well as looking at the cosmetic outcomes for the&#xD;
      same patient group. The study is conducted prospectively, with patients being included&#xD;
      forward in time when they are diagnosed with breast cancer in Kristianstad hospital, Sweden.&#xD;
      The study started in January 2019 and is expected to continue enrollment for two years, with&#xD;
      the aim of recruiting 300 patients. The patients fill out a quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      (Breast-Q) at baseline, which is defined as time of diagnosis, and second Breast-Q&#xD;
      questionnaire 1-year post surgery. Photos are also taken of the breasts both preoperatively&#xD;
      and postoperatively and the photos are assessed by a computer program validated to assess&#xD;
      cosmetic outcomes after breast cancer surgery, called BCCT.core, and secondly the cosmetic&#xD;
      results of the breasts are evaluated by the surgeon and patient herself on a 10-grade scale.&#xD;
      In addition study specific items covering for example psychiatric comorbidity, BMI and&#xD;
      smoking are retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that patients undergoing breast cancer surgery overall have a good&#xD;
      quality of life 1-year after their diagnosis, especially if they are treated with a surgical&#xD;
      approach that takes into account both the best oncological treatment as well as the best&#xD;
      surgical technique for cosmetic outcome, so called oncoplastic surgery. The other hypothesis&#xD;
      is that cosmetic results will be overall favorable for the group of patients who are operated&#xD;
      with breast-conserving techniques, and most favorable in those patients who have undergone&#xD;
      oncoplastic surgery. Secondly the study aims to see if there are other patient related&#xD;
      variables that affect the quality of life or cosmetic outcome, for example cytostatic&#xD;
      treatment, a high body mass index, smoking or psychiatric history prior to diagnosis.&#xD;
