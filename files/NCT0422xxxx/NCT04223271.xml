      Patients who are admitted with acutely decompensated heart failure and are receiving&#xD;
      intravenous diuretics will be recruited to undergo testing using the Indicor Device.&#xD;
      Participants will be tested daily while hospitalized and then on the day of discharge during&#xD;
      which time they will be trained how to operate the device. Once discharged, patients will&#xD;
      perform one test in the morning, and one test in the evening for up to 30 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will follow the design of a prospective observational cohort study. Patients who&#xD;
      are admitted with acutely decompensated heart failure and are receiving intravenous diuretics&#xD;
      will be recruited to undergo testing with the Indicor Device for estimating left ventricular&#xD;
      end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Trends in estimated LVEDP will be assessed after thirty days&#xD;
      at home to identify trends that coincided with heart failure events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Indicor is a noninvasive device that assesses cardiac filling pressure based on the long&#xD;
      understood phenomenon that performing a Valsalva maneuver induces changes in pulse pressure&#xD;
      that reflect cardiac filling pressure.Testing with the Indicor consists of blowing into the&#xD;
      device while performing a Valsalva Maneuver for 10 seconds, and the index finger will be&#xD;
      placed inside a PPG sensor during the test. Each test consists of three recorded efforts with&#xD;
      45 seconds rest between efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested daily while hospitalized and then on the day of discharge during&#xD;
      which time they will be trained how to operate the device. In order to proceed with home use,&#xD;
      they will need to demonstrate the ability to properly operate the device and complete testing&#xD;
      without assistance. Demographic and clinical data will also be collected including&#xD;
      laboratories, comorbidities, and heart failure etiology. Once a subject demonstrates proper&#xD;
      operation an Indicor will be provided to them for use at home for the study duration. Once&#xD;
      the subjects are home, they will be asked to perform the test each morning and each evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the AM, subjects will be asked to weigh themselves upon awakening after using the&#xD;
      restroom, and will be asked to perform the device test afterward. Subjects will be asked six&#xD;
      simple, standardized symptom-related questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Have you felt more short of breath during the last day?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Have you noticed more swelling in the last day?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Did you wake up short of breath last night?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Did you sleep in a chair, or prop up with pillows more than usual last night?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Have you had any lightheadedness or dizziness in the last day?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Enter morning weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No recorded data will be analyzed for the duration of the subject's participation, since this&#xD;
      is purely an observational study. It will be stressed to the participant that, as always,&#xD;
      they would need to report to their provider any worsening symptoms or change in weight as&#xD;
      instructed by the discharge team or outpatient provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject enrolled, 1 test twice a day will be obtained for up to 30 days.&#xD;
