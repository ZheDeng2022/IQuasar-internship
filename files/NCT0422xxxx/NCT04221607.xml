  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to help patients address and improve intimacy at the end of treatment for&#xD;
      breast or prostate cancer. It is intended to address the needs of cancer survivors, broadly&#xD;
      defined as paftients and their loved ones or caregivers facing a cancer diagnosis. While we&#xD;
      know sexual health is impacted by the diagnosis and treatments for cancer, we also are&#xD;
      increasingly aware that partners and spouses are also impacted by the experience. Yet, there&#xD;
      are no evidence based interventions that focus on the couple's recovery after the initial&#xD;
      cancer experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to look at the impact of an intimacy intervention at the&#xD;
      completion of cancer treatment for couples facing breast or prostate cancer. We will enroll&#xD;
      patients and their intimate partners in this study in two phases. In the first phase, couples&#xD;
      will receive sensate focus homework, explained to them at a standard survivorship care visit&#xD;
      (SCV) by a study nurse practitioner (NP). The objective in the first phase is to see if this&#xD;
      is something feasible by looking at how many use sensate focus homework in 6 weeks. If it is&#xD;
      not feasible, we will rework the study based on what we learned. However, if it is feasible,&#xD;
      we will reopen the study to a larger group and employ a random assignment to an SCV with or&#xD;
      without sensate focus homework. This phase will give us evidence of efficacy that we will use&#xD;
      to propose a larger randomized trial, potentially in the National Cancer Institute system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to answer questionnaires at baseline, 6 weeks, and then at 12&#xD;
      weeks during phase 2. Those who complete treatment at 12 weeks will be re-contacted 6 months&#xD;
      after protocol enrollment for an optional end of treatment interview to assess what they&#xD;
      thought of the intervention, including sensate focus homework itself and the timing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) identifies sexual dysfunction as a major&#xD;
      issue facing cancer survivors (defined broadly as patients and their caregivers, starting at&#xD;
      the point of the index cancer diagnosis). It is well known that a cancer diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment negatively impacts partner relationships and quality of life (QOL) (for both&#xD;
      patient and partner). Despite this, only about a third of patients seek assistance, and the&#xD;
      figures regarding assistance from caregivers is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of sexual dysfunction is multifactorial and includes problems with sexual desire&#xD;
      and pleasure, hormonal deficiencies, vaginal and penile alterations related to treatment,&#xD;
      delayed or absent orgasm and/or ejaculation, pain with intercourse, erectile dysfunction, and&#xD;
      psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and changes in body-image. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      interventions have largely focused on ways to improve sexual function, although even these&#xD;
      are limited. Additionally, clinicians are often reluctant to address sexual function with&#xD;
      their patients due to their lack of training and discomfort in engaging in these&#xD;
      conversations. Given the well-documented burden of sexual dysfunction, there is a compelling&#xD;
      need to develop interventions to address sexual health, for both patient and partner while&#xD;
      encouraging clinicians to discuss sexual health issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the issues of the individual, couples and families are also impacted by cancer&#xD;
      treatment. A wide body of literature shows that a cancer experience can add additional&#xD;
      demands on couples, especially in the realms of communication, intimacy, and sexuality. A&#xD;
      small study of 8 couples where the female partner had breast cancer identified three themes&#xD;
      of significance: (1) disconnection from the relationship, due to the woman prioritizing her&#xD;
      own needs before those of the partner or of them as a couple; (2) renegotiation of the couple&#xD;
      relationship; and (3) need for support for negotiating going forward as a couple.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, they also comment on the limited evidence-based interventions to aide this&#xD;
      transition, particularly for the couple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators will build upon standard procedures to address intimacy at&#xD;
      the end of curative intent therapy through sensate focusing exercises (SF). SF will be&#xD;
      delivered during a face-to-face survivorship visit using a trial-specific script.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will proceed in two phases. During phase 1, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      feasibility by conducting a prospective pilot study. During phase 2, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized trial comparing survivorship care with or without sensate focusing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has the potential to substantially enhance the care of survivors. By&#xD;
      implementing such an intervention to improve sexual function, we aim to enhance the QOL and&#xD;
      intimacy of cancer survivors.&#xD;
