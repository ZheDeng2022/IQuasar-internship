  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best approach for the treatment of perforated diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon is&#xD;
      still under debate. Concurrent techniques are 1) resection with primary colorectal&#xD;
      anastomosis with or without additional loop ileostomy; 2) end colostomy (Hartmann´s&#xD;
      procedure); 3) Damage control strategy; 4) laparoscopic lavage and placement of a drainage.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized, that the use of the damage control strategy leads to a significant&#xD;
      reduction of the stoma rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The damage control strategy constitutes a two stage procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      limited resection of the diseased colonic segment with oral and aboral blind closure,&#xD;
      abdominal lavage, temporary vacuum assisted abdominal closure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second look surgery (48-72 hours later):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reexploration with&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. definite reconstruction (Colorectal anastomosis -/+ diverting ileostomy vs. end&#xD;
           colostomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. lavage, vacuum assisted abdominal closure, third look 72 hours after emergency surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the study, data of DCS-procedures will be collected retrospectively in a multicentric&#xD;
      and transnational approach. Those will be compared to a cohort of patients treated with a&#xD;
      &quot;no-DCS&quot;-technique (resection with primary anastomosis or Hartmann´s procedure).&#xD;

      Research question/objective of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that the application of the Damage Control Strategy (DCS) in patients with&#xD;
      perforated diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon with generalized peritonitis leads to a&#xD;
      reduction of the stoma rate with the same degree of safety as other procedures (Hartmann´&#xD;
      procedure, sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis, laparoscopic lavage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The damage control strategy constitutes a two stage procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      limited resection of the diseased colonic segment with oral and aboral blind closure,&#xD;
      abdominal lavage, temporary vacuum assisted abdominal closure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second look surgery (48-72 hours later):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reexploration with&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. definite reconstruction (Colorectal anastomosis -/+ diverting ileostomy vs. end&#xD;
           colostomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. lavage, vacuum assisted abdominal closure, third look 72 hours after emergency surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basis and scientific knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of patients with acute diverticulitis of the left colon are currently treated&#xD;
      conservatively. However, diverticular perforation with diffuse peritonitis remains a&#xD;
      challenging and life-threatening situation requiring emergency surgical intervention.&#xD;
      Regardless of the frequency and severity of the disease, there is yet no generally accepted&#xD;
      treatment algorithm. Sigmoid resection with blind closure of the rectal stump and formation&#xD;
      of an end colostomy (Hartmann´s procedure) as well as sigmoid resection with primary&#xD;
      anastomosis with or without additional loop ileostomy are alternative procedures. As an&#xD;
      additional approach, laparoscopic lavage and drainage has not yet been widely established.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the technique is not recommended in the current German S2K guidelines for the&#xD;
      treatment of diverticular disease. Within Damage Control Strategy (DCS), a limited resection&#xD;
      of the affected sigmoid segment with oral and aboral blind closure is performed during the&#xD;
      initial intervention. After abdominal lavage, a temporary vacuum-assisted closure of the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity is then performed. 24 to 72 hours later, the decision on the definite&#xD;
      reconstruction procedure is made within the scope of the planned second-look laparotomy.&#xD;
      Generally, a colorectal anastomosis with or without loop ileostomy is intended. If this is&#xD;
      not possible, end colostomy is available as additional option. Principal criteria for the&#xD;
      decision on the type of definite reconstruction are the local and general findings of the&#xD;
      patient. According to the results of a first cohort from the Innsbruck University Hospital, a&#xD;
      colorectal anastomosis can be achieved in almost 80% of patients within second operation. In&#xD;
      about half of the patients, a loop ileostomy is additionally created. Using DCS, morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality are comparable to the above mentioned competing procedures. An own study from&#xD;
      2016 shows similar results. After the initial hospital stay, 47% of the patients were stoma&#xD;
      carriers after the application of DCS, compared to 83% of the patients from the control group&#xD;
      to which all &quot;other&quot; surgical procedures (Hartmann operation, Primary anastomosis with or&#xD;
      without loop ileostoma) were assigned. At the end of follow-up, 88% of patients were&#xD;
      stoma-free after use of DCS. The mortality rate was 11 percent. A systematic review of the&#xD;
      available specific literature on DCS is yet underway. The manuscript is currently undergoing&#xD;
      peer review at the World Journal of Gastroenterology. In the course of this process the above&#xD;
      mentioned results could be confirmed. A total of eight publications from five study groups&#xD;
      were identified (status 11/2019). In 73% of the cases a colorectal anastomosis could be&#xD;
      performed during the second-look laparotomy. 15% of the patients additionally received a loop&#xD;
      ileostomy. End colostomy (secondary Hartmann´s procedure) was necessary in only 27% of the&#xD;
      patients. The cumulative anastomotic leak rate was 13%, surgical morbidity 31% and 30-day&#xD;
      mortality was 9%. A stoma rate of 45% at discharge should be emphasized. Thus, the number of&#xD;
      patients in whom intestinal continuity could be restored during the initial hospital stay was&#xD;
      considerably higher when using the damage control strategy than in most studies on the&#xD;
      treatment of perforated diverticulitis with diffuse peritonitis. In addition, a stoma rate of&#xD;
      &lt;50% at discharge was achieved. These aspects should be highlighted as key benefits. Further&#xD;
      positive aspects of the method are the fast and technically simple focus repair during the&#xD;
      initial intervention.&#xD;
