      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the optimal interval to restart oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial&#xD;
      hemorrhage that will minimize thrombotic events and major bleeding by performing a response&#xD;
      adaptive randomized (RAR) PROBE clinical trial of restarting in anticoagulant-associated&#xD;
      traumatic intracranial hemorrhage patients, comparing restart at 1 week to restart at 2 weeks&#xD;
      or at 4 weeks, with a primary composite outcome of major thrombotic events and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: 60-day composite of thromboembolic events, defined as DVT, pulmonary emboli,&#xD;
      myocardial infarctions, ischemic strokes and systemic emboli, and bleeding events defined as&#xD;
      non-CNS major bleeding events (modified BARC3 or above) and worsening index tICrH or new&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this trial include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To use the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) of the American College of Surgeons&#xD;
           - Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT), a well-established and highly respected trauma center&#xD;
           oversight mechanism, to translate findings of the trial into practice in a closed loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish a relationship between time of restarting and overall secondary events,&#xD;
           i.e. a dose response, that favors early restarting (1 week is better than 2 weeks and 2&#xD;
           weeks is better than 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore patient centered utility weighting of thrombotic versus bleeding composite&#xD;
           endpoint components by: A) 60-day Disability Rating Scale (DRS) 24,25 and modified&#xD;
           Rankin Scale (mRS)26; B) Trial patient-reported standard gamble utilities including by&#xD;
           race, gender and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore the composite without DVT in the thrombotic component&#xD;

      Title: Restart tICrH Protocol Synopsis A Prospective Randomized Open Label Blinded Endpoint&#xD;
      Response Adaptive Clinical Trial of Timing to Restart Direct Oral Anticoagulants After&#xD;
      Traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To identify the optimal interval to restart oral anticoagulation after traumatic&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage that will minimize thrombotic events and major bleeding by performing&#xD;
      a response adaptive randomized (RAR) clinical trial of restarting in anticoagulant-associated&#xD;
      traumatic intracranial hemorrhage patients, comparing restart at 1 week to restart at 2 weeks&#xD;
      or at 4 weeks, with a primary composite outcome of major thrombotic events and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: We hypothesize that restarting an oral anticoagulant at one week after&#xD;
      anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, compared to delayed restarting,&#xD;
      reduces a composite outcome of major thrombotic events and major bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Prospective, response adaptive randomized, open-label, blinded end-point&#xD;
      (PROBE), 40 center national trial Study population -- Approximately 1100 participants with&#xD;
      traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and an indication for Direct Oral Anticoagulant Main&#xD;
      inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinician intent to restart a Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) after&#xD;
           anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and equipoise concerning&#xD;
           restart of anticoagulation at the specified time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute traumatic intracranial hemorrhage on anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation (AF)&#xD;
           or Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient is higher risk for stroke or other thrombotic events as witnessed by having a&#xD;
           CHA2DS2-VASc score of &gt; 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DOAC will be prescribed at label dose with label adjustments for creatinine clearance.&#xD;
           DOAC will be at continuation dose, i.e., not initial therapy high doses in the setting&#xD;
           of VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mechanical Valve/Ventricular Assist Device (excludes 1%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SDH &gt;8 mm maximum width or any midline shift at any time point or more than one SDH&#xD;
           (excludes 10%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physician plan to start/restart antiplatelet therapy during trial period (excludes 5%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Abbreviated Injury Scale other than head &gt;3 (excludes 10%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pregnancy (excludes 0%: median age 81, range 58-99)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Inability to understand need for adherence to study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Renal function below DOAC label exclusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Any active pathological bleeding (no acute blood most recent CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Hypersensitivity to drug or other label contraindication&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Any bleeding that the investigator deems unsafe to restart DOAC at 1 week post injury,&#xD;
           or conversely unsafe to hold DOAC to 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Completion of DOAC therapy expected prior to 60-day primary endpoint, e.g., 3-6-month&#xD;
           VTE treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Concomitant strong inducers/inhibitors of p-gp and CYP3A4&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Low body weight (&lt;45kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Inability to swallow&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: â€¢ The trial will randomize patients with anticoagulant-associated traumatic&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage to restart DOAC at 1 week or 2 weeks or 4 weeks, using an adaptive&#xD;
      randomization algorithm that increases the probability of patients being randomized to&#xD;
      treatment arms with lower event rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy outcome: A 60-day composite outcome that includes the following clinical&#xD;
      events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Bleeding Events Worsening tICrH/new ICrH&#xD;
&#xD;
      1)Hematoma expansion/new ICrH lesion on imaging 2)causing objective change in clinical status&#xD;
      and 3)leading to stop of anticoagulation (must include all three).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracranial Major bleeding BARC3a or above definition. B. Thrombotic events Venous&#xD;
      Thromboembolism (VTE) It is defined as a clinical diagnosis of acute proximal (popliteal and&#xD;
      above) deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus confirmed on imaging (compression ultrasound&#xD;
      or venogram for DVT, CT angiography, other angiography or ventilation/perfusion scan for PE)&#xD;
      by a radiologist qualified to interpret the scans in a timely manner. If the radiologist&#xD;
      cannot or does not attest to acute versus chronic thrombus, the Adjudication Committee will&#xD;
      make this determination according to its charter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial Infarction (MI) Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke New focal neurologic deficit consistent with ischemic stroke and confirmed by a stroke&#xD;
      specialist or brain imaging. Brain imaging must be performed but need not be positive if the&#xD;
      stroke specialist (neurology, neurosurgery or internal medicine) deems a clinically probable&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic Embolism A clinical diagnosis of extracranial infarction associated with likely&#xD;
      thromboembolism and documented by angiography or surgery in the absence of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular death non bleeding Death resulting from an acute myocardial infarction, sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death, death due to heart failure, death due to stroke, death due to cardiovascular&#xD;
      procedures, and death from other cardiovascular causes 45. A patient who has both this&#xD;
      outcome and another thrombotic outcome will only be counted once as this outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Modified Rankin Scale and Disability Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety outcomes: Incorporated in composite as thrombotic and bleeding events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: All interim and final analyses will be conducted on the primary&#xD;
      outcome, the composite 60-day outcome of thromboembolic events and recurrent hemorrhage. Both&#xD;
      thrombotic and bleeding outcomes will be modeled as a function of the three treatment arms in&#xD;
      a dose (time)/response (events composite) model. Two Bernoulli models will be used to&#xD;
      estimate thromboembolism and recurrent hemorrhage. Each of the rates for the Bernoulli values&#xD;
      by dose are Î¸d and Î´d for thromboembolism and recurrent hemorrhage respectively. These rates&#xD;
      are combined to provide a utility function Ud=-Î¸d-Î´d, so higher values of Ud correspond to&#xD;
      the better dose to establish specifically whether at a week is best and generally whether&#xD;
      earlier is better than later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 1100&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical sites: Approximately 40 trauma center clinical sites in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment period: Approximately 60 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period: Participants will be followed weekly for 60 days, the study end date.&#xD;
