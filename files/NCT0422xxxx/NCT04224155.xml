             and capsular IOL implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a Best-corrected Distance Visual Acuity (CDVA) projected to be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Contact lens wearers must demonstrate a stable refraction (within ±0.50 D for both&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any other serious ocular pathology or underlying systemic medical&#xD;
             condition (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes) or circumstance that, based on the&#xD;
