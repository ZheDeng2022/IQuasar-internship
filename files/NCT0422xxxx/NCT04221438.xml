  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well encorafenib and binimetinib work before surgery in&#xD;
      treating patients with BRAF V600-mutated stage IIIB-D melanoma that has spread to the lymph&#xD;
      nodes. Encorafenib and binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. This trial also studies how well 18F-FLT positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in predicting the response of melanoma to&#xD;
      encorafenib and binimetinib. 18F-FLT is an imaging agent, sometimes called a tracer. PET and&#xD;
      CT are types of imaging scans. Using 18F-FLT PET/CT together with encorafenib and binimetinib&#xD;
      may provide more information on melanoma over time.&#xD;

      PRIMARY CLINICAL OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant treatment with&#xD;
      encorafenib and binimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY CLINICAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine response rate (RR) (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]),&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe correlation of pCR with RR, DFS and OS. III. To assess safety and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate CD8 positive (+) T cell infiltration and Ki-67 status in tumor or tumor bed&#xD;
      pre, during, and post neoadjuvant treatment and the change in CD8+ tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocyte (TIL) with neoadjuvant treatment and correlate with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare local review for pathologic response with central pathology review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the correlation between change in fluorothymidine F-18 (18F-FLT) PET/CT uptake&#xD;
      and change in Ki-67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMAGING OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the change in 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake (from baseline to post-neoadjuvant therapy)&#xD;
      among patients with and without pathologic complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare post-neoadjuvant 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake among patients with and without&#xD;
      pathologic complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate an optimal threshold for prediction of pathologic complete response using i)&#xD;
      change in 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake, and ii) post-neoadjuvant 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the correlation between change in 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake and change in Ki-67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive 18F-FLT intravenously (IV) and undergo a PET/CT scan&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes later. Within 2 weeks, patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once&#xD;
      daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      then receive 18F-FLT IV and undergo a second PET/CT scan approximately 60 minutes later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL RESECTION: Within 2 weeks of completing therapy with encorafenib and binimetinib,&#xD;
      patients undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT TREATMENT: Within 2-7 days after surgery, patients resume treatment with encorafenib&#xD;
      PO QD and binimetinib PO BID on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 11&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, then&#xD;
      every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

             decreased intestinal absorption), or recent (=&lt; 3 months) history of a partial or&#xD;
