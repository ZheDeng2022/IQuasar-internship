  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the ARTERY Outcomes study is to compare optima-for-blood pressure (optima4BP),&#xD;
      a clinical decision support system for hypertension (HTN) treatment optimization to standard&#xD;
      of care in patients with essential HTN.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 34 million Americans have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Hypertension (HTN)&#xD;
      claims 1000 deaths every day. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN&#xD;
      associated hospitalizations had escalated to $113 billion in 2016, or 15% of all hospital&#xD;
      costs, with &gt;135 million Emergency Department (ED) visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncontrolled HTN for even a few weeks is associated with increased risk for acute&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CVD) events [stroke, heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI)] and&#xD;
      death. Medication treatment optimization to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by&#xD;
      35-40%, HF by up to 64%, and MI by 15-25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      optima-for-blood pressure [optima4BP] transforms the episodic and reactive nature of&#xD;
      uncontrolled HTN pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous,&#xD;
      proactive, and personalized. The innovation simulates the established clinical reasoning&#xD;
      treatment decision process undertaken during a patient's visit.&#xD;

    <description>Treating physicians receive periodic (every 5-8 weeks) medication treatment recommendations intended to optimize the current patient treatment.&#xD;
The recommendations are generated based on periodic remote data collected from the patient and from the Electronic Health Record. The analysis of the data allows assessment of the patient's response to current treatment and need for a treatment optimization. If a treatment optimization is needed, one is generated and sent to the treating physician for consideration.</description>

    <description>optima4BP establishes a &quot;no gaps&quot; computational framework in determining the most effective treatment change that can optimize a patient's HTN management towards BP Target. All possible drug combination options available through the 16 anti-HTN drug classes and subclasses are quantitatively evaluated in the context of 5 actions: add a drug, remove a drug, replace a drug, increase a drug dose, and decrease a drug dose. The pharmacological intervention efficacy ranking is computed and the highest ranked treatment recommendation is selected for consideration by the treating physician.</description>
