      SUMMARY Objective To assess the efficacy of Nd:YAG laser treatment on eccrine sweat&#xD;
      production in the axillae of persons experiencing excessive axillary hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Randomised, within-person controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting One Dermatology Department, at a University hospital in Denmark, from 2018-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants A total of 10 participants enrolled after signing informed consent from the&#xD;
      patients attending the hyperhidrosis clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Participants will receive one Nd:YAG laser-treatment of either left or right&#xD;
      axilla. The treated area will be cooled with ice during and after laser treatment. Prior to&#xD;
      treatment, patients can use lidocaine-prilocaine 5% cream at the treatment site on an&#xD;
      optional basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures Primary outcome measure will be reduced excessive sweat production&#xD;
      (%points) monitored by an iodine-starch test assessed at 1-month follow-up compared to&#xD;
      baseline. A 30% reduction in sweat production in the Nd:YAG laser-treatment relative to&#xD;
      control, will be considered clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary outcome measures include (1) weighing the sweat by gravimetric testing, (2)&#xD;
      patient assessment of sweat production on a Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) -&#xD;
      also assessed at 1 month from baseline. Safety around the use of Nd:YAG laser-treatment will&#xD;
      be monitored by registering pain during treatment on a visual analogue scale, as well as&#xD;
      monitoring of adverse events immediately as well as one week after treatment. As for the&#xD;
      purpose of further exploratory analyses (both benefits and harms), all outcome measures will&#xD;
      be re-collected 24 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timelines and dissemination For the collection of the primary data (i.e. primary endpoint&#xD;
      being assessed after 1 month), First Patient First Visit (FPFV) will take place in November&#xD;
      2018 and Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV) will be in March 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to present data internationally at e.g. the European Academy of&#xD;
      Dermatology and Venerology as well as nationally to the Danish Dermatology Society and to the&#xD;
      Hyperhidrosis Patient Association. Results will be published in an internationally recognised&#xD;
      peer reviewed (biomedical) journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial registration: Danish Research Ethics Committee (approved, protocol number: SJ-689);&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT pending (2018-11-22).&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is a condition with excessive secretion of sweat&#xD;
      from the eccrine sweat glands of the armpits that affects between 1 and 5 % of the world's&#xD;
      population. Numbers may be underestimated since this chronical disease debuts during&#xD;
      adolescence and is unmentionable in many cultures and social environments. Hyperhidrosis may&#xD;
      lead to malodour and cause large sweat patches on clothes, thus affecting dressing behaviour,&#xD;
      social activities and job opportunities. As a direct consequence, many patients experience&#xD;
      affected psychological and social behaviour, increased mental stress and low self-esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several treatment modalities exist that may treat axillary hyperhidrosis. Systemic treatment&#xD;
      with anticholinergic tablets is often reserved to hyperhidrosis that affects the entire body&#xD;
      due to a substantial risk of adverse effects. Possible adverse effects (i.e. related to the&#xD;
      intervention) include dry mouth and other mucous membranes, digestive problems, decreased&#xD;
      ability to empty the bladder, visual disturbances and affected nervous system. Localised&#xD;
      axillary hyperhidrosis is often treated by injections of botulinum toxin. Although this&#xD;
      method is effective in many patients the procedure is painful, expensive and has to be&#xD;
      repeated since the effect only last from four to nine months. Recently, heating of the sweat&#xD;
      glands with microwave technology has shown promising efficacy with minimal adverse effects.&#xD;
      However, this treatment is very expensive and is only available at a few sites in Denmark.&#xD;
      Surgery has also been performed, yet short-term and long-term efficiency is inferior to other&#xD;
      methods. Therefore, there is a need for efficient, safe, affordable and widely available&#xD;
      alternatives to treat axillary hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative method that have been proposed, could be heating and destroying sweat glands&#xD;
      by Neodynium Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser or intensed pulsed light (IPL). These&#xD;
      types of non-invasive light devices are widely available at dermatological clinics in Europe&#xD;
      and is well-known to treat vascular lesions and undesired hair growth. The IPL has a 640 -&#xD;
      800 nm wavelength and the Nd:YAG laser a 1064 nm wavelength that penetrates deeply into the&#xD;
      skin and target the melanin of the hair shaft. By adjusting the pulse length according to the&#xD;
      theory of extended photo-thermolysis, light energy can be delivered through the hair shaft&#xD;
      into surrounding sweat glands. A previous pilot study has demonstrated significant and&#xD;
      lasting reduction of axillary hyperhidrosis in six patients treated with Nd:YAG&#xD;
      laser.Treatments were reported safe and efficient without any side effects. Likewise, two&#xD;
      studies of a comparable but invasive Nd:YAG laser technique reported only temporary mild&#xD;
      adverse effects and significant sweat reduction for up to 43 months after treatment. A single&#xD;
      prospective study without a control group demonstrated increased sweat production following&#xD;
      Nd:YAG laser treatment of excessive hair growth. Targeting hair and sweat glands is however&#xD;
      not directly comparable due to different pulse lengths of the delivered energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic optic coherence tomography (d-OCT) is an imaging technique that utilizes infrared&#xD;
      light to create two-dimensional horizontal or transverse images. Penetration depth is&#xD;
      approximately 0.5 - 2 mm 11. The d-OCT technique allows in situ visualization of dynamic&#xD;
      changes in blood flow and superficial skin structures in vital skin. Thus, the eccrine sweat&#xD;
      glands and the surrounding blood supply can be followed over time without taking invasive&#xD;
      tissue biopsies. Previous studies of histological changes after laser treatment of eccrine&#xD;
      sweat glands have only been able to demonstrate limited structural changes and therefore,&#xD;
      there is a need for improved imaging techniques to visualize laser-tissue-interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim &amp; Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of experimental intervention (either&#xD;
      Nd:YAG laser OR IPL treatment) of an axilla with hyperhidrosis, relative to the contralateral&#xD;
      untreated side, and to visualise laser-tissue interactions by Dynamic Optical Coherence&#xD;
      Tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy objective: to assess the effect of one of the experimental interventions&#xD;
      (either Nd:YAG laser or IPL) treatment on eccrine sweat production by comparing treated and&#xD;
      contralateral untreated axillae in patients eligible for botulinum-toxin therapy due to&#xD;
      axillary hyperhidrosis. Sweat production is to be assessed at baseline and at one-month&#xD;
      follow-up primarily by the iodine-starch test and secondly by gravimetric testing and&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Patient research partners (PRPs) The study is designed without the assistance of&#xD;
      PRPs. Collaboration between patients and professionals in developing and disseminating&#xD;
      research projects is relatively new and the explorative nature and easily quantifiable&#xD;
      outcomes chosen in this study reduces the need for the use of PRP. Should the study support&#xD;
      the use of the new treatment, larger confirmatory studies will be needed and these will&#xD;
      naturally include softer patient-rerouted outcomes and PRP collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design and allocation ratio In a prospective within-person randomised trial, patients&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to receive laser treatment or IPL of one axilla while the other&#xD;
      serve as a control (i.e. Right-Left and Left-Right, respectively). Primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      assessed after 1 month. Treatments are performed with a combined platform of non-ablative 640&#xD;
      - 800 nm IPL and 1064 nm long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Lumenis M22 system, Lumenis Ltd.) and&#xD;
      laser energy is applied according to patient skin type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings and locations where the data will be collected This project will take place from&#xD;
      autumn 2019 to spring 2021 in an established research environment in the Dermatologic&#xD;
      Department at Zealand University Hospital Roskilde. All patients will be included from&#xD;
      January 2020 to June 2020 and will if possible be re-evaluated two years later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professor, doctor in medical science and Head of Department Gregor Jemec is principal&#xD;
      investigator. Daily leader will be medical doctor, PhD Elisabeth Hjardem Taudorf (EHT).&#xD;
      Medical doctor and PhD-students Mattias Hennig and Linnea Thorlacius will participate in&#xD;
      daily study activities. The department accounts for all study facilities and technical&#xD;
      equipment. The study has been approved by the Danish Research Ethics Committee (protocol&#xD;
      number: SJ-689). Before enrolling the first patient, the trial was registered with&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov (NCT Identifier: Pending).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions The intervention under investigation is one treatment with 640 - 800 nm IPL or&#xD;
      non-ablative long-pulsed 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser (Lumenis M22 systems, Lumenis Ltd). Laser or&#xD;
      IPL energy will be applied according to patient skin type. Skin will be cooled during and&#xD;
      after treatment to reduce inconvenience. On an optional basis, patients may also receive&#xD;
      topical anesthesia by lidocaine gel prior to treatment (EMLA 5%, Astra-Zenica, København S,&#xD;
      Danmark). All patients will receive one treatment and will be followed up after one month. If&#xD;
      possible, patients will be contacted in order to perform a long-time follow up after 24&#xD;
      months. After completion of the project, patients are offered laser or IPL treatment of the&#xD;
      axilla, which served as a control in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and Sample size considerations A sample size calculation was performed based on the&#xD;
      assumptions that the main outcome measurement (the iodine-starch test for sweat) is&#xD;
      continuous in nature, fairly normally distributed, and that an additional improvement in the&#xD;
      intervention side of 30%points (assumed standard deviation=25% with a correlation of 0.5)&#xD;
      will be considered clinically relevant. For a paired t-test of a normal mean difference with&#xD;
      a two-sided significance level of 0.05 (p&lt; 0.05), a sample size of 8 pairs is required to&#xD;
      obtain a power of at least 80% to detect a mean difference between pairs of 30% (the actual&#xD;
      power is 82.8%). It was decided to include and (within-person) randomise 10 patients for each&#xD;
      intervention in order to consider a potential risk of drop-outs; a sample size of 10 pairs&#xD;
      has a power of 92% to detect the mean difference between pairs of 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an extra exploratory objective, the investigators will explore whether the use of Nd:Yag&#xD;
      laser or IPL treatment have a different outcome after assessing the overall benefit or &quot;both&#xD;
      of the experimental treatments&quot;. Thus, it was decided for pragmatic reasons to include 20&#xD;
      patients in total; 10 of them treated with Nd:Yag laser on the experimental side, whereas the&#xD;
      other 10 will receive IPL treatment on the experimental side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Sequence generation, allocation concealment, and implementation This is an&#xD;
      intra-person study, comparing outcomes within participants. All participants will receive&#xD;
      active treatment on one axilla (Active-Right|Control-Left and Control-Right|Active-Left,&#xD;
      respectively). The implied subgroups of which axilla to receive active long-pulsed Nd:YAG&#xD;
      treatment or IPL will also (like right/left) be selected based on a computer generated table&#xD;
      of random numbers using SAS Proc Plan developed by an external biostatistician/author with no&#xD;
      clinical involvement in the trial (RC). The contralateral axilla will serve as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation will be concealed in a password-protected computer file only accessible by the&#xD;
      biostatistician. Individual allocations will be held in sealed, opaque, consecutively&#xD;
      numbered digital files, and forwarded individually to the principal investigator sequentially&#xD;
      as an active feedback mechanism after receiving a scanned copy of the informed consent form.&#xD;
      In addition, treatment of left or right axilla with either Nd:YAG or IPL will be directly&#xD;
      communicated from the data manager to the daily leader of the project (EHT) This procedure&#xD;
      will ensure that participants, study staff, and outcomes assessors will remain blinded to&#xD;
      subsequent treatment allocations throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed during data&#xD;
      collection. In brief, the analyses will be based on mixed linear models, with a random effect&#xD;
      for participant (1, 2, 3, …, to 20) with a fixed effect for group (active or placebo), axilla&#xD;
      (right or left), and the experimental intervention of secondary interest (Nd:YAG or IPL). For&#xD;
      the primary analyses the type of experimental intervention (Nd:YAG or IPL) will be included&#xD;
      as a main effect only; secondarily if the primary test hypothesis is rejected (p &lt;0.05; H0:&#xD;
      μActive = μPlacebo) the investigators will add a test for interaction to compare the net&#xD;
      benefit for Nd:YAG vs. Placebo and IPL vs. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERSPECTIVES Given a successful outcome of an investigation of long-pulsed Nd:Yag laser or&#xD;
      IPL treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis, the laser treatment could potentially be&#xD;
      implemented in the everyday practice, since Nd:YAG lasers and IPL devices are already&#xD;
      widespread in European dermatological hospital departments and clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be presented and published internationally. This new treatment holds the potential&#xD;
      to provide long-lasting sweat reduction in patients suffering from axillary hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may benefit from improved self-esteem, prevention of social anxiety, and better job&#xD;
      opportunities, providing a positive personal development for patients, who presently suffer&#xD;
      from a socially unacceptable and neglected chronic disease.&#xD;
