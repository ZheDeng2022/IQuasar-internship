  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of cabozantinib when given with&#xD;
      radiation therapy and how well it works in treating patients with sarcoma of the extremities.&#xD;
      Cabozantinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Giving cabozantinib with radiation therapy may make the tumors smaller and&#xD;
      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of cabozantinib followed by a phase II,&#xD;
      dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days until the completion of radiation therapy in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 2, patients also undergo standard of&#xD;
      care radiation therapy for 5-6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for&#xD;
      up to 1 year, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
