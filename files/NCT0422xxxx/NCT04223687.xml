    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether pictorial warnings on&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages are more effective than neutral labels at reducing parents'&#xD;
      purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages for their children. Participants will be parents or&#xD;
      guardians of at least one child age 2-12. The trial will take place in a mock convenience&#xD;
      store. Participants will be randomly assigned to a pictorial warnings arm in which all&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages in the store are labeled with pictorial warnings, or to a control&#xD;
      arm in which all sugar-sweetened beverages in the store are labeled with a neutral label. All&#xD;
      participants will visit the mock convenience store setup based on their randomized trial arm&#xD;
      and be instructed to engage in a shopping task. Participants will complete a computer survey&#xD;
      after the shopping task.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a major public health problem in the US among racial and ethnic&#xD;
      minorities, including among the US's growing Latino population. One promising but&#xD;
      understudied policy for addressing childhood obesity is requiring pictorial warnings on the&#xD;
      front of sugar-sweetened beverage containers. The impact of pictorial warnings in real-world&#xD;
      food retail environments on parents' sugar-sweetened beverage purchasing behavior for their&#xD;
      children is unknown. This study will assess the impact of pictorial warnings on parents'&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverage purchases for their children in a real-world randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. The investigators focus on parents as they are the primary decision-makers and&#xD;
      purchasers of food products for children and exert strong influence over their children's&#xD;
      dietary intake and food attitudes. Half of participants will be Latino as childhood obesity&#xD;
      is a major public health problem among the US's growing Latino population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The trial will take place in a mock convenience store setting created for&#xD;
      researchers to examine how store and product characteristics influence consumer purchases in&#xD;
      a controlled but realistic environment. The store reflects a convenience store's&#xD;
      characteristics, with foods, beverages, and household items set at real-world prices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited locally via methods including community subject&#xD;
      pools, printed flyers posted, and online listings. Interested potential participants will&#xD;
      complete a screening questionnaire online, in person, or over the phone to determine their&#xD;
      eligibility. If eligible, they will be invited to schedule a time to visit the mock store for&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: At the beginning of the in-person study visit, study staff will explain the&#xD;
      consent form. The study staff will ask the participant if he or she has any questions; once&#xD;
      the participant consents to the study, both parties will sign the consent form and the&#xD;
      participant will receive a copy of the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After the participant signs the consent form, study staff will randomly assign&#xD;
      participants to one of the two study arms. Randomization order will be determined a priori.&#xD;
      Participants will have an equal chance of being randomized to either arm of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Using an established protocol, participants will visit the mock study convenience&#xD;
      store and be given a shopping task to select 1 beverage and 1 snack to purchase for their&#xD;
      child ages 2-12. If the participant has more than one child age 2-12, the investigators will&#xD;
      randomly select the child they should shop for. At check-out, study staff will record the&#xD;
      products selected. Participants will then complete 1 computer-based survey immediately after&#xD;
      completing the shopping task. The visit will take approximately 45-60 minutes. At the end of&#xD;
      the study, participants will receive an informational handout about sugar-sweetened beverages&#xD;
      and healthier alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of the trial arms: Participants will be assigned to either a pictorial&#xD;
      warnings arm or a control arm. In the pictorial warnings arm, all sugar-sweetened beverage&#xD;
      products in the mock store will be labeled with a pictorial warning label (two different&#xD;
      warning labels will be displayed at the same time, but only 1 warning label per product).&#xD;
      Investigators developed the text and design of these warning labels using a pre-test. In the&#xD;
      control arm, all sugar-sweetened beverage products will be labeled with a neutral label, also&#xD;
      developed by the investigators. In both arms, labels will be adhered directly on the&#xD;
      front-of-package of sugar-sweetened beverage containers.&#xD;
