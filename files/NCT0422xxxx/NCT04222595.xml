  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2013 the UK government introduced the nasal flu spray vaccine (Fluenz TetraÂ®) for use in&#xD;
      children from 24 months to less than 18 years of age. This is a licensed vaccine that is&#xD;
      safe, effective and like the injectable vaccine, needs to be given yearly. There is evidence&#xD;
      that the nasal spray flu vaccine can offer better protection for children than the injectable&#xD;
      flu vaccine but it is not yet fully understood why this is so. When the immune system&#xD;
      responds to an infection or a vaccine, specific 'immune response' genes are activated or&#xD;
      'switched on'. This process is called gene expression and different types of immune responses&#xD;
      cause the activation of different genes.This study is looking at how specific parts of the&#xD;
      immune system like B and T cells respond to the nasal spray vaccine and how and what genes&#xD;
      are activated by the vaccine. B cells make antibodies, a part of our immune system that helps&#xD;
      to protect against invaders such as viruses or bacteria. The next time our bodies are exposed&#xD;
      to the same invader, our B cells make antibodies that can recognise and stop the invader&#xD;
      going on to cause an infection. Our T cells can help B cells to make antibodies and also help&#xD;
      to direct the body to attack the invader instead of causing harm to healthy cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Influenza infection is related to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Although&#xD;
      usually causing a self-limiting illness, the increased risk for children of hospitalisation&#xD;
      and further complications, ranging from secondary pneumonia to death, reflect the need to&#xD;
      focus on prevention. The commonly used trivalent inactive influenza vaccine (TIV) has been&#xD;
      documented to have poor immunogenicity in children. The live attenuated influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (LAIV) was introduced with the idea to induce superior protection than TIV. Early efficacy&#xD;
      studies suggested that LAIV provides superior protection to TIV in children, however the&#xD;
      mechanisms of action at a molecular and immunological level are not yet well described. This&#xD;
      study aims to understand how the LAIV works from a gene expression and immunological&#xD;
      perspective using a systems biology approach and relate these findings to adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses and immunogenicity. Success of this study will yield the first comprehensive&#xD;
      picture of cellular and molecular signature that underlie a successful response to LAIV&#xD;
      vaccination in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LAIV was introduced to provide broader protection by stimulation of both antibody and T&#xD;
      cell responses. At present the two major obstacles in the widespread use of LAIV are concerns&#xD;
      raised over its effectiveness and the lack of defined immunological correlates of protection.&#xD;
      In this study, by identifying key genes and immune cells that are participating in the&#xD;
      vaccine-induced responses, the investigators aim to understand molecular and immunological&#xD;
      mechanism of LAIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Unites States (US) recommended&#xD;
      against the use of LAIV due to its poor effectiveness in their analysis of the 2015/2016&#xD;
      season. However, the same vaccine, in the same season had high effectiveness as assessed by&#xD;
      two public health authorities in UK and Finland. Currently the reason for this discrepancy is&#xD;
      not known. The annual childhood influenza vaccine programme in UK started in the 2013/2014&#xD;
      influenza season by the introduction of the newly licensed LAIV. Eligible healthy children&#xD;
      were offered a single dose of LAIV, while children in a clinical risk group up to 9 years of&#xD;
      age were offered two doses of vaccine. By the 2016/2017 season, the LAIV became a licensed&#xD;
      vaccine in the UK for children and adolescents from 2 to 18 years of age. The UK has found&#xD;
      evidence of LAIV effectiveness in 2015/2016 season of 58% and therefore it continues to&#xD;
      recommend its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will administer LAIV to cohorts of children and investigate&#xD;
      the immunological basis for the observed variability and define the role of adaptive immunity&#xD;
      by applying the systems biology tools and machine learning algorithms for predictive&#xD;
      modelling. Tracing the influenza vaccine imprint on immune system, termed FluPRINT, by the&#xD;
      proposed project will help to identify cellular signatures of vaccine-induced protection in&#xD;
      young children, which is of critical importance for the development of a new generation of&#xD;
      influenza vaccines that will be more effective in this target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will cover an issue that has been poorly studied in humans and that is the role&#xD;
      of influenza-specific T cells after vaccination. Correlating the cellular signature and T&#xD;
      cell repertoire after vaccination with the vaccine efficacy is a novel approach to the&#xD;
      current problem about usage of LAIV. Results obtained are expected to increase the&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms of influenza vaccine effectiveness, by exploring for the&#xD;
      first time the impact of vaccines on the influenza-specific T cell repertoire in children&#xD;
      while their adaptive immune system is still being developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite many years on the market, no correlates of protection for LAIV have been defined.&#xD;
      Recent studies using systems biology and computational methods identified baseline frequency&#xD;
      of B and T cells to predict antibody responses on day 28 after TIV vaccination. A similar&#xD;
      approach to define cellular signatures driving immunity to LAIV has not yet been reported.&#xD;
      The current study aims to assess the detailed phenotypical and functional analysis of immune&#xD;
      cells (focusing on T and B cells) combined with the molecular signature which will provide&#xD;
      insights into LAIV's mechanisms of protection. To comprehensively probe the phenotypic and&#xD;
      functional profiles of different immune cells, in the proposed study the investigators will&#xD;
      analyse blood samples in children aged 4-6 years before and 28 days after LAIV vaccination&#xD;
      using mass cytometry (CyTOF), Luminex and transcriptome analysis which will be correlated&#xD;
      with HAI titers. This study will be an exploratory study with between 30 and 40 children&#xD;
      allocated to 4 groups; Group 1: up to 10 children aged 4-6 years that never received LAIV&#xD;
      before. Group 2: up to 10 children aged 4-6 years that received LAIV once before, Group 3: up&#xD;
      to 10 children aged 4-6 years that were vaccinated twice before and Group 4: up to 10&#xD;
      children aged 4-6 years vaccinated 3 or 4 times.&#xD;
