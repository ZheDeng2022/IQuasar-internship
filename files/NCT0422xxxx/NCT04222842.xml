      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase I Study to Evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary Efficacy of intermittent oral dosing of CM082&#xD;
      tablets in Chinese patients with mCNV. The study will be performed in two different parts,&#xD;
      dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and dose-expansion phase (Part 2). Subjects will receive CM082&#xD;
      orally for two weeks followed by two weeks off in four-week cycles. There are three dose&#xD;
      levels, 25mg BID,50mg QD and 50mg BID. The total treatment period is tentatively set at 3&#xD;
      cycles (12 weeks). Based on data from dose escalation studies, identify safe and effective&#xD;
      doses for expanded enrollment studies.The assessment of the safety and efficacy will be done&#xD;
      in 2、4、8、12weeks after the first dose.Also, single/multiple dose pharmacokinetics in these&#xD;
      patients will be studied.&#xD;
