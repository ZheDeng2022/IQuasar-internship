      End-to-side versus side-to-side anastomosis with distal vein ligation for arteriovenous&#xD;
      fistula creation: A prospective randomized controlled study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the lifeline for patients with chronic renal&#xD;
      failure on hemodialysis. The international guidelines recommend patient's referral for access&#xD;
      replacement 6 months prior to predicted hemodialysis. The sites being preferred for access&#xD;
      replacement are distal arm AVF, proximal arm AVF, basilic vein transposition or graft&#xD;
      insertion, respectively (1) Meticulous preoperative assessment and patient selection play&#xD;
      great role in achieving functioning AVF with long term patency. AVF maintenance always&#xD;
      requires multi-disciplinary approach, with surgeons, nephrologist, dialysis nurses and the&#xD;
      patients themselves working hand in hand. Any break in this circle will lead to failure of&#xD;
      the AVF, and consequently, failure of hemodialysis. Surgical technique is of paramount&#xD;
      importance for long term patency of AVF. There is an ongoing debate about the best technique&#xD;
      to do the anastomosis between the artery and the vein; end to side, or side to side. This&#xD;
      issue was addressed by very few randomized controlled studies (2,3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: To compare the results of both surgical techniques for creation of&#xD;
      arteriovenous anastomosis; End vein to side artery (ETS) versus Side vein to side artery&#xD;
      (STS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study location: Study protocol will be submitted for approval by Mansoura medical&#xD;
           research ethics committee, faculty of medicine, Mansoura University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: This is Prospective Randomized controlled trials that is going to be&#xD;
           conducted at in department of vascular surgery Mansoura University Hospitals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of study: The study will be conducted during the year 2017-2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population: Study population will be on Patients referred to Vascular surgery&#xD;
           department for creation of Hemodialysis access. Patients will be advised to undergo&#xD;
           elective surgery for AVF once their renal Glomerular Filtration Rate Estimated (eGFR) is&#xD;
           less than 15 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: All renal failure patients requiring creation of arm AVF, including&#xD;
           distal Radio-cephalic, Ulno-basilic, proximal brachio-cephalic or brachio-basilic&#xD;
           configurations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria: Revision AVF, Synthetic graft AVF or lower limb AVF, Patients with&#xD;
           absent distal pulses and chronic ischemia of the upper limb and Recent cannulation of&#xD;
           puncture of the vein within 2 weeks before its use in AVF creation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary End Point: Primary patency of Arterio-venous Fistula and Functional Maturation,&#xD;
           ready fistula for cannulation, vein length at least 10 cm, diameter more than 6 mm,&#xD;
           depth not more than 6 mm and ability of the access to deliver a flow rate 350 to&#xD;
           400ml/min and maintain dialysis for 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary End Points: Secondary patency, Complication rate failure of maturation,&#xD;
           bleeding, infection, steel syndrome and aneurysmal dilatation at anastomosis site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target number for recruitment: 50 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative assessment: All patients will undergo clinical assessment as well as&#xD;
           routine duplex scan for marking of artery and a patent vein suitable for creation of&#xD;
           AVF, with a minimum vein diameter of 2.5 mm for distal fistula and 3 mm for proximal&#xD;
           ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method of Randomization: Computer based randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical technique: Patients can have the procedure under general, local anesthetic or&#xD;
           regional block according to suitability and patients' preference. Mobilization of the&#xD;
           suitable artery and vein, creation of fistula using 6/0 prolene for anastomosis in&#xD;
           continuous sutures, either ETS or STS with ligation of the distal end of the vein.&#xD;
           Arteriotomy size will range from 7 to 10 mm for proximal AVF and from 12 to 15 mm for&#xD;
           distal AVF, according to the size of the artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sites sharing in the study: Mansoura University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative follow-up: Review in clinic on day 6, week 6, months 3 &amp; 6, Duplex scan&#xD;
           for assessment of flow in 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences. The Significant difference between the flow rate volume in both groups (continuous&#xD;
      variable) will be verified by a two-sample test between the two groups. The data analyzed&#xD;
      using Cochrane and ANOVA test. Categorical demographic variables were expressed as a&#xD;
      proportion of the population and compared with a two-tailed Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
