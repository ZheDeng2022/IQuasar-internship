  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Discomfort during respiratory decompensation of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) in intensive care and the establishment of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is&#xD;
      frequent and a source of failure. this therapy. Pharmacological treatments may be impossible&#xD;
      due to the pathology, the risk of it worsening and adverse effects. In this context, hypnosis&#xD;
      appears to be a tool that would promote comfort and thus increase tolerance of NIV.&#xD;

    <description>For the hypnosis group, hypnotic support is set up by an IDE previously trained and dedicated during the implementation of the NIV. The dedicated IDE will be presented before the start of the NIV setup procedure and will start the hypnosis session a few minutes before the mask is put on. The procedure for setting up the NAV may begin after agreement from the dedicated IDE.</description>

    <description>In the control group, in order to preserve the knowledge of the evaluator, the IDE dedicated to hypnosis is present in the service but does not intervene in the care so as not to be tempted to involuntarily put hypnosis in place. The assessor will be chosen from the two other teams present in the other two modules (each module is a seven-bed unit and has no physical communication with the other two) after the start of the procedure for setting up the NIV, with or without hypnosis, in order to be certain that he had no visual contact with the patient and the caregivers present before the evaluation. The implementation of the NAV will take place as usually carried out in the service.</description>
