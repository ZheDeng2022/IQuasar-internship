  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical trial evaluating activity, safety and patients reported outcomes&#xD;
      of first-line pembrolizumab plus cisplatin (or carboplatin) plus 5-FU for patients with&#xD;
      advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is overall responsa rate according to RECIST v1.1 at week 24.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma is associated with dismal survival rates and a major&#xD;
      impact on the quality of life. To date, unresectable or metastatic disease is managed by&#xD;
      systemic therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with good performance status.&#xD;
      The median PFS and OS on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy vary between 3-4 and 7-15&#xD;
      months, respectively. Chemotherapy induces objective responses in only 20-30% of penile&#xD;
      cancer patients with rare complete responses and systemic treatment has not changed for&#xD;
      decades. Therefore, this study's rationale is to explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab combined with standard-of-care cisplatin(or carboplatin) plus 5-fluorouracil as&#xD;
      part of the first-line therapy. Patients will receive pembrolizumab 200mg IV every three&#xD;
      weeks with a maximum duration of 2 years (34 cycles-counting the combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy) in case of no progressive disease or intolerance. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the combination of immunotherapy with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy may&#xD;
      improve the overall response rate by RECIST v1.1 in this patient population.&#xD;
