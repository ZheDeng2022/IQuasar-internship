    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to compare the accuracy of linear endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasonography and magnified narrowband endoscopy in the diagnosis of invasive depth of&#xD;
      early rectal cancer, and to provide more powerful evidence for the choice of surgical methods&#xD;
      for early rectal cancer. Patients with early rectal cancer who will be examined by endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasonography or magnifying narrowband endoscopy in the department of gastroenterology and&#xD;
      general surgery will be examined by linear endoscopic ultrasonography or magnifying&#xD;
      narrowband endoscopy to examine the depth of invasion of early rectal cancer, and the results&#xD;
      are compared with the postoperative pathological results of the patients as the gold&#xD;
      standard. It provides strong evidence that the accuracy of linear endoscopic ultrasonography&#xD;
      in judging the invasive depth of early colorectal cancer is not inferior to that of&#xD;
      magnifying narrowband endoscopy.&#xD;

      1. Research purpose. 1.1 main purpose: to provide a more accurate preoperative evaluation&#xD;
           method for the selection of surgical methods for early rectal cancer by comparing the&#xD;
           accuracy of linear endoscopic ultrasonography and magnifying narrowband endoscopy in the&#xD;
           diagnosis of invasive depth of early rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Secondary purpose: to compare the sensitivity, specificity and examination time of&#xD;
           linear endoscopic ultrasonography and magnified narrowband endoscopy in the diagnosis of&#xD;
           invasive depth of early rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experimental design. This study is a single-center randomized, self-controlled clinical&#xD;
           trial. The subjects were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and&#xD;
           all subjects who met the inclusion criteria were required to sign an informed consent&#xD;
           form before joining the group. The team of doctors is composed of four experienced&#xD;
           endoscopes from the Department of Gastroenterology of Nanfang Hospital. Patients were&#xD;
           randomly divided into group A (patients underwent linear endoscopic ultrasonography&#xD;
           followed by magnifying narrowband endoscopy) and group B (patients underwent magnifying&#xD;
           narrowband endoscopy first and then linear endoscopic ultrasonography). The examination&#xD;
           results, examination time and complications were recorded in both groups. After&#xD;
           examination, continue to follow up the patient's operation until the patient's surgical&#xD;
           and pathological results are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main observation indicators of this clinical study include the accuracy of linear&#xD;
           endoscopic ultrasonography and magnifying narrowband endoscopy in the diagnosis of the&#xD;
           invasive depth of early rectal cancer, in which the surgical and pathological results&#xD;
           are the gold standard, and the examination time of the two methods are also compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. data analysis. After examination, continue to follow up the patient's operation until&#xD;
           the patient's surgical and pathological results are obtained. Patients who did not&#xD;
           undergo surgery and patients whose surgical and pathological results were not consistent&#xD;
           with rectal cancer were excluded. The remaining patients took the pathological results&#xD;
           as the gold standard to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of linear&#xD;
           endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic narrowband imaging in the diagnosis of&#xD;
           invasive depth of early rectal cancer, and the results were statistically analyzed by&#xD;
           chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety monitoring, reporting and medical treatment. 4.1 adverse event (AE) definition.&#xD;
           An adverse event refers to any adverse medical event that occurs after the patient or&#xD;
           subject is examined in this study, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship&#xD;
           with the examination. Therefore, adverse events can be any adverse physical signs&#xD;
           (including abnormal laboratory results), symptoms, or diseases associated with the use&#xD;
           of this study test, regardless of whether or not there is a causal relationship with the&#xD;
           study test. Adverse events include serious adverse events ((Serious Adverse Event, SAE))&#xD;
           and non-serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 SAE definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAE refers to medical events during clinical trials, such as requiring hospitalization or&#xD;
      prolonging hospitalization, disability, affecting working ability, endangering life or death,&#xD;
      leading to congenital deformities and so on. Includes the following medical events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. events leading to death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a life-threatening event (defined as the risk of the subject's immediate death at the&#xD;
           time of the event);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. events requiring hospitalization or prolonging the duration of hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. events that can lead to permanent or severe disability / insufficiency / affect work&#xD;
           ability;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. congenital abnormality or birth defect; Other important medical events (defined as&#xD;
           events that endanger the subject or require intervention to prevent the occurrence of&#xD;
           any of the above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3. Adverse event recording, collection, reporting and handling. 4.3.1 Collection, reporting&#xD;
      and processing of AE. After signing the informed consent form and prior to the inspection of&#xD;
      this study, all AE related to the operating procedures specified in the test scheme should be&#xD;
      recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The records of the AE shall include the description of AE and all related symptoms, time of&#xD;
      onset, severity, duration, relevance to the trial drug, action taken, and final outcome and&#xD;
      outcome. AE records must use medical terms, and if the subjects' symptoms and signs can be&#xD;
      summed up by a common cause, the diagnosis should be recorded as far as possible. Except for&#xD;
      the indicators related to disease progression, all clinical events and laboratory adverse&#xD;
      reactions with clinical significance can be dealt with with reference to the evaluation&#xD;
      criteria for common adverse events ((CTCAE) version 5.0). Adverse reactions caused by the&#xD;
      treatment will be recorded by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.2 Collection and reporting of SAE. From the time the subjects signed the informed consent&#xD;
      form to the completion of the study, all SAE, regardless of the cause or relevance to the&#xD;
      inspection of this study, need to be reported by using the SAE report form. In the event of&#xD;
      SAE, researchers should immediately take appropriate treatment measures to ensure the safety&#xD;
      of the subjects, and report to the applicant for drug registration, the State Drug&#xD;
      Administration, the Provincial Food and Drug Administration, the ethics committee of the&#xD;
      corresponding clinical trial center and the Medical Department of the Medical Administration&#xD;
      and Hospital Administration within 24 hours, and promptly report to the ethics committee of&#xD;
      the team leader. As far as possible, the first report should include the following: the&#xD;
      source of the report, the items examined in this study, the name of serious adverse events,&#xD;
      the time of occurrence, severity, duration, relevance to experimental drugs, measures taken&#xD;
      and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.3 AE severity criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will evaluate the severity of the disease based on the five-level criteria&#xD;
      developed by the NCI CTCAE5.0 version:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 1, mild; asymptomatic or mild signs; only clinical or diagnostic observation without&#xD;
      medical intervention; Grade 2, moderate; age-related limited functions of daily life (such as&#xD;
      cooking, shopping, phone calls, etc.); Grade 3, serious or medically important but not&#xD;
      immediately life-threatening; leading to or prolonging the length of hospital stay;&#xD;
      disability; activities of daily self-care are limited (activities of daily self-care:&#xD;
      bathing, dressing, undressing, eating, going to the toilet, taking medicine, etc., but not&#xD;
      bedridden); Level 4, life-threatening and in need of emergency treatment; Level 5, AE-related&#xD;
      death. 4.3.4 other responsibilities of researchers during follow-up of serious adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers should examine and treat serious adverse events according to clinical judgment,&#xD;
      including necessary clinical laboratory examination, physical examination and so on. Any&#xD;
      examination results or other updated SAE-related information must be followed up. The time&#xD;
      limit and procedure of the follow-up report are the same as those of the initial report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Trial termination / suspension criteria. 5.1 the organizer has the right to terminate /&#xD;
      suspend this study. Before terminating / suspending a clinical study, the sponsor must notify&#xD;
      the researcher, the ethics committee and the relevant regulatory authorities and state the&#xD;
      reasons. After the early termination / suspension of the study, the resumption of the study&#xD;
      must be reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 termination / suspension requested by the Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. The rule to end clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment ends when all the subjects meet the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. include at least the number of valid cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. serious safety problems or serious adverse events occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. there are major mistakes in the test scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the organizer asks for termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Data management. 7.1 data Management. The main contents are as follows: 1) researchers&#xD;
      must ensure that the data are true, complete and accurate; 2) when making any corrections,&#xD;
      the test records can only be underlined, side notes on the revised data, explain the reasons,&#xD;
      signed and dated by the researchers, and shall not be scrubbed or overwritten the original&#xD;
      records; 3) the items of laboratory inspection are complete. 7.2. Data recording and file&#xD;
      saving. The data about the subjects on the case report form should be recorded in the way of&#xD;
      the subject code, and the subjects can only be identified by the subject code or their&#xD;
      initials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses EXCEL for data management: from the data entry to the verification&#xD;
      requirements of the source data, to the query and answer of the quality control data, and&#xD;
      finally to the operation of data locking and export. After confirming that there is no doubt&#xD;
      about the data, the parties sign the database locking application form, and the database is&#xD;
      locked by the data administrator. After the database is locked, the analysis database is&#xD;
      exported by the data administrator and handed over to the statisticians for statistical&#xD;
      analysis. The locked data can no longer be edited, and the problems found after the database&#xD;
      is locked can be corrected in the statistical analysis program after confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Statistic analysis. 8.1 sample size determination. After consulting the relevant&#xD;
      literature, investigators found that the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of magnifying&#xD;
      narrowband endoscopy in the diagnosis of the depth of early rectal cancer invasion were about&#xD;
      90%, 75% and 90%, respectively. According to the previous research results of our team, the&#xD;
      accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of linear endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      early rectal cancer invasion were about 93%, 75% and 96%, respectively. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigators speculate that the accuracy of linear endoscopic ultrasonography in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of invasive depth of early rectal cancer is not inferior to that of magnifying&#xD;
      narrowband endoscopy, and the non-inferiority threshold is set at 10%. By setting the&#xD;
      bilateral test level is 0.025, the test efficiency (power) is 80%, according to the 1:1&#xD;
      ratio, calculated by PASS16.0 software, each group needs Nylon 73, plus the shedding rate is&#xD;
      10%, each group has at least 81 cases, because this study is a self-control study, so a total&#xD;
      of 81 patients with early rectal cancer are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Statistical methods. The measurement data are described by mean and standard deviation,&#xD;
      and the counting data are described by examples and percentage. Chi-square test was used to&#xD;
      evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the two methods. A P value&#xD;
      less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered to have a statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between the test group and the control group. SPSS20.0 statistical software was used to&#xD;
      analyze the indexes of the two groups respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3 Statistical software and general requirements: The observational indexes of the two&#xD;
      groups were statistically analyzed by SPSS20.0 statistical software.&#xD;
