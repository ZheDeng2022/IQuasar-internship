    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of the combination of the GITR agonist monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      INCAGN01876, the anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody INCMGA00012, and stereotactic radiosurgery&#xD;
      (SRS) for recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM). The investigators hypothesize that the proposed&#xD;
      regimen will be safe and stimulate a robust anti-tumor immune response and result in improved&#xD;
      tumor responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has 2 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (Cohort A) is a nonsurgical arm (N=16) that will serve as the primary study cohort and&#xD;
      evaluated for the primary study endpoint. Subjects in this arm receive a single priming dose&#xD;
      of both INCMGA00012 and INCAGN01876 prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), then undergo&#xD;
      SRS (8 Gy x 3 fractions). Following SRS, INCMGA00012 (IV every 4 weeks) and INCAGN01876 (IV&#xD;
      every 2 weeks) are resumed and continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      for 2 years, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B (Cohort B) is a surgical arm (N=16) that will allow for evaluation of the effects on&#xD;
      the tumor immune microenvironment of INCMGA00012, INCAGN01876, and SRS. In order to be&#xD;
      enrolled on this arm, subjects must have a clinical indication for surgical resection of the&#xD;
      recurrent GBM tumor. Prior to planned surgical resection, subjects receive neoadjuvant&#xD;
      immunotherapy (one of two possible combinations, as outlined below). Subjects then undergo&#xD;
      surgery. Postoperatively, the immunotherapy combination of INCMGA00012 (IV every 4 weeks) and&#xD;
      INCAGN01876 (IV every 2 weeks) is resumed and continued until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or for 2 years, whichever occurs first. Subjects in the surgical arm&#xD;
      with a focus of contrast-enhancing tumor that is amenable to SRS will be assigned to surgical&#xD;
      sub-arm #1 of Cohort B (N=8). These subjects will receive neoadjuvant INCMGA00012 +&#xD;
      INCAGN01876 + SRS. All other subjects enrolled on Cohort B (N=8) are treated with neoadjvuant&#xD;
      INCMGA00012 + INCAGN01876 (without SRS).&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior histopathologically proven diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV&#xD;
             glioblastoma, OR histopathologically proven diagnosis of gliosarcoma, OR molecular&#xD;

             IDH-wildtype, with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV&quot;; this requires&#xD;
             presence of either amplification of EGFR, whole chromosome 7 gain AND whole chromosome&#xD;
             10 loss, or TERT promoter mutation). Participants are eligible if the prior diagnosis&#xD;
             was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma was made&#xD;
             (e.g. secondary GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants must have glial tumor that is recurrent following prior first-line&#xD;
             radiation therapy (prior dose must have been 40-75 Gy and may have been either photon&#xD;
             or proton radiation), and must have unequivocal evidence of tumor progression by MRI&#xD;
             scan&#xD;

          3. Cohort A and Sub-Arm 1 of Cohort B only: Patient must have at least one measurable&#xD;
             (&gt;=1cm x 1cm) contrast-enhancing tumor focus for which stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)&#xD;
             is clinically indicated, as determined by the Investigator, and must be able to&#xD;
             achieve radiation target coverage without exceeding dose constraints. The&#xD;
             contrast-enhancing target must not be larger than 4 cm in maximal diameter. Multifocal&#xD;
             disease is allowed as long as this criterion is met&#xD;

             amenable to SRS&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Cohort B (surgical) patients only: patients must be undergoing surgery that is&#xD;
             clinically indicated as determined by their care providers&#xD;

             have had prior bevacizumab or other vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF/VEGFR)&#xD;
             inhibitors (exception: prior bevacizumab is allowed if it was administered for the&#xD;
             treatment of radiation necrosis rather than progressive tumor and was stopped at least&#xD;
             4 weeks prior to MRI showing demonstrating tumor progression). Prior gliadel wafers&#xD;
             are only allowed if placed during the first surgery for GBM at initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have recovered from severe toxicity of prior therapy; the following&#xD;
             intervals from previous treatments are required to be eligible:&#xD;

             edema-related symptoms, the dose must be 2mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent) daily or&#xD;
             less for a minimum of 5 days prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;

               -  Total bilirubin (except patients with Gilbert's Syndrome, who are eligible for&#xD;
                  the study but exempt from the total bilirubin eligibility criterion) ≤ 2.0 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Adequate renal function within 7 days prior to start of study treatment, defined as&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Reproductive Status&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
                  pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 7&#xD;
                  days prior to the start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Women must agree to not breastfeed during the study or for 180 days after the&#xD;
                  last dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. WOCBP must agree to use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy (as defined below)&#xD;
                  from the time of study screening through 180 days from last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
                  method(s) of contraception (as defined below) starting with the first dose of&#xD;
                  study drug through 180 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are&#xD;
                  exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, these WOCBP must still undergo&#xD;
                  pregnancy testing as described in this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
             At a minimum, participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active and their&#xD;
             partners must agree to the use of a highly effective form of contraception (as defined&#xD;
             below) throughout their participation beginning with the time of consent, during the&#xD;
             study treatment, and for 180 days after last dose of study treatment(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
             HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills,&#xD;
                  vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) by WOCBP&#xD;
                  subject or male subject's WOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects&#xD;
                  participating in the study may use hormone-based contraceptives as one of the&#xD;
                  acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nonhormonal IUDs&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral Tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual Abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete&#xD;
                       abstinence is elected.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have&#xD;
                       pregnancy tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be&#xD;
                       discussed in the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego&#xD;
                       complete abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Participant must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be able to comply with study&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patients must be able to understand the study procedures and agree to participate in&#xD;
             the study by providing written informed consent (or have legally authorized&#xD;
             representative sign on patient's behalf if patient physically unable to sign consent&#xD;
             due to neurologic deficit)&#xD;
&#xD;

             prior to MRI showing demonstrating tumor progression).&#xD;
