  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited during a routine consultation with a physician in the&#xD;
      hepato-gastroenterology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the consultation, patients will have to complete the following questionnaire:&#xD;
      &quot;European Community Respiratory Health Survey&quot; which allows the screening of patients at risk&#xD;
      of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, emphysema).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of a declaration of functional respiratory signs, a consultation with a&#xD;
      pulmonologist will be systematically proposed. At the end of this consultation, if the doctor&#xD;
      deems it necessary, further investigations will be proposed and/or regular follow-up&#xD;
      organised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      leading to a diagnosis of chronic respiratory disease in patients with inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      diseases (IBD) (Crohn's disease and UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main criterion for judgement will be the frequency of functional respiratory signs&#xD;
      (wheezing, dyspnea, cough, sputum) reported by IBD patients through an adapted self-report&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one-third of IBD patients will develop systemic extra-digestive manifestations&#xD;
      (joint, dermatologic or ophthalmologic) during the course of their disease and up to 25% will&#xD;
      develop these systemic manifestations even before the diagnosis of IBD. Among these systemic&#xD;
      affections, respiratory manifestations remain poorly known because they are not searched for&#xD;
      in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      leading to a diagnosis of chronic respiratory disease (asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis) in&#xD;
      patients with IBD (Crohn's disease and UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited during a routine consultation with a physician in the&#xD;
      hepato-gastroenterology department as part of the management of their chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this consultation, the investigating physician will explain to the patient the&#xD;
      objective of the study and check with him/her the eligibility criteria. The patient will then&#xD;
      be given an information note. He or she may ask any questions he or she wishes and if he or&#xD;
      she refuses to participate in the study, he or she will have to sign an objection form in&#xD;
      duplicate (one copy will be given to the patient and the other will be kept in the medical&#xD;
      file). The doctor will also sign these two copies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the consultation, patients will have to complete the following questionnaire:&#xD;
      &quot;European Community Respiratory Health Survey&quot; which allows the screening of patients at risk&#xD;
      of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, emphysema).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of a declaration of functional respiratory signs, a consultation with a&#xD;
      pulmonologist from the Department of Pulmonology of the CHRU Nancy-Brabois will be&#xD;
      systematically proposed. At the end of this consultation, if the doctor deems it necessary,&#xD;
      further investigations will be proposed and/or regular follow-up organised. Patients will be&#xD;
      informed of this potential follow-up in pneumology before the questionnaire is given. There&#xD;
      is no change in the usual follow-up of the population in case of non-reporting of functional&#xD;
      respiratory signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main criterion for judgement will be the frequency of functional respiratory signs&#xD;
      (wheezing, dyspnea, cough, sputum) reported by IBD patients through an adapted self-report&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If our hypothesis is confirmed, this will have direct practical consequences on the global&#xD;
      and multidisciplinary management of IBD patients, in particular through a systematic search&#xD;
      for chronic respiratory disease, which is currently under-researched in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will improve the quality of life as well as the morbidity and mortality of our patients.&#xD;
