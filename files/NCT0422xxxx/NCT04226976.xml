  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular disorders are among the most common causes of disability in society and affect&#xD;
      over 50% of the population over the age of 65 and a significant percentage of the younger&#xD;
      population. Acute unilateral vestibulopathy (AUV) is easy to diagnose and is commonly treated&#xD;
      with physical therapy exercises called vestibular rehabilitation. But due to the discomfort&#xD;
      experienced during AUV, patients can't usually comply with the treatment plan prescribed by&#xD;
      their healthcare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators propose the use of an adjuvant device, the OtoBand, to&#xD;
      improve balance, gait, reduce vertigo, and nausea in participants with AUV. Participants&#xD;
      enrolled will undergo three vestibular tests batteries: one baseline, one with the OtoBand&#xD;
      set at an effective power, and one with the placebo device set at low power. Neither&#xD;
      participants nor investigator will know which device is effective and which is placebo. The&#xD;
      OtoBand will be set at two different effective power levels. Which power level the&#xD;
      participant will receive is randomized and unknown to the participant or investigator.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vestibular disorders are among the most common causes of disability in society and affect&#xD;
      over 50% of the population over the age of 65 and a significant percentage of the younger&#xD;
      population. Vestibular disorders have a dramatic impact on daily life impacting work,&#xD;
      relationships, and even activities of daily living. At the current time, the mainstay of&#xD;
      therapy for many vestibular disorders is a physical therapy called vestibular rehabilitation.&#xD;
      While usually highly effective, this therapy is time consuming and not universally effective,&#xD;
      in part because of inconsistent subject compliance. The use of adjuvant devices to speed&#xD;
      recovery has been studied but very few devices have proved beneficial; the few that have&#xD;
      shown benefit only work in special populations and are large units that cost several million&#xD;
      dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OtoBand has shown promise and might be beneficial for treating or improving the course of&#xD;
      recovery from vestibular disorders. To date, the device has only been systematically tested&#xD;
      on healthy volunteers and has been shown to improve vertigo associated to motion sickness and&#xD;
      virtual reality device use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will assay the efficacy of the OtoBand on participants with&#xD;
      acute unilateral vestibulopathy (AUV). The OtoBand will be given to participants with AUV for&#xD;
      use during vestibular test batteries. The OtoBand will be set at either a normal power&#xD;
      (effective) or low power (6 decibels lower than normal power, placebo device). There are two&#xD;
      effective power levels, which will be randomly assigned to each of the participants. Outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed by the investigator by a set of vestibular tests while the participant uses&#xD;
      the OtoBand or placebo device. Participants vestibular disorder outcomes will be compared&#xD;
      between OtoBand and placebo device to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if participants treated with OtoBand achieve instantaneous effectiveness in&#xD;
           reducing vestibular symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if participants treated with the OtoBand at higher power levels experience&#xD;
           higher benefits.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants with Acute Unilateral Vestibulopathy (AUV) will be asked to participate in the study. Subjects that give consent will be entered into the study and randomized to one of two groups (96dB or 98dB bone conduction level re:1dyne) by the study coordinator. Neither the subject nor the investigators in the study will know to which arm the subject was placed; rather the study coordinator will be given two sets of two OtoBands. When turned on, both the effective devices and placebo will be felt to vibrate, making it difficult for the typical subject or investigator to guess which device is effective and which is the placebo. After randomization, all subjects will undergo the vestibular battery. The subjects will complete a Participant Questionnaire following the testing.</intervention_model_description>
