  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most forms of Phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalanemia are caused by mutations in the PAH gene&#xD;
      (phenylalanine hydroxylase) which is responsible for the conversion of Phe into tyrosine, in&#xD;
      the presence of the molecular oxygen and cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). To prevent&#xD;
      mental retardation due to the buildup of neurotoxic metabolites of Phe, patients with severe&#xD;
      PKU must be treated with a low-Phe diet starting early in their life [1]. Although&#xD;
      Phe-restricted diet control is essential for avoiding neurological impairment, the life-long&#xD;
      compliance with this dietary control is not optimally maintained, particularly in adulthood&#xD;
      and adolescence [2]. Non-adherence to dietary control after successful treatment in early&#xD;
      childhood may contribute to lower intelligence quotient (IQ), emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      disorders, including attention deﬁcit disorders, depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, another therapeutic approach for managing PKU is to supplement a synthetic&#xD;
      form of BH4 along with diet control. Kure et al. and several other research teams had&#xD;
      indicated that treatment with BH4 might lower down the Phe level in a subset of PKU patients&#xD;
      [3-7]. BH4 acts as a pharmacological chaperone to stabilize mutant enzymes with disrupted&#xD;
      tetramer assembly and increased sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage and aggregation. The&#xD;
      BH4-supplementation therapy (Kuvan) can be used to loosen or even replace burdensome dietary&#xD;
      treatment of PKU patients. Correct and efficient identification of BH4-responsive patients is&#xD;
      important, both to improve the fast assessment, as well as to avoid false expectations and&#xD;
      unnecessary costs. Unfortunately, there is still no golden standard on how to assess BH4&#xD;
      responsiveness most efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Taiwan, high-dose BH4 [20mg/kg] loading is the standard test to identify patients who are&#xD;
      responsible to BH4 treatment, for PAH deficiency PKU patients with more than 30% decrease in&#xD;
      Phe level within 24 hours after BH4 challenge were BH4-responsive patients and eligible for&#xD;
      national health insurance coverage of continuous BH4 treatment. In clinical studies, blood&#xD;
      Phe levels in patients who are BH4-responsive typically decrease within 24 hours after a&#xD;
      single administration of Kuvan, although the maximal effect on blood Phe levels may take up&#xD;
      to a month. A Phase IV open-label trial showed that of 64% of patients responded to Kuvan&#xD;
      within 7 days whereas 10% responded between 8-28 days. To the best of our knowledge, there's&#xD;
      no previous study which evaluated longer than 7 days BH4 response test in Asian countries,&#xD;
      and for the purpose to help PAH deficiency PKU patients achieve optimal Phe control and&#xD;
      neurocognitive outcomes, it's definitely worthy to extend the period of BH4 response test to&#xD;
      identity more patients who can benefit from Kuvan treatment.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes of blood Phe level from baseline at the 7th, 14th, and 28th day&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Percentage of the study patients whose blood Phe level decreases for &gt;= 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Percentage of the study patients whose Phe tolerance increase from baseline for &gt;=50%&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlation between PAH gene mutation and blood Phe level reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methodology The PAH deficiency PKU patients who failed to achieve 30% blood&#xD;
      Phe reduction within 24-hour BH4 loading test will be enrolled to this study. Baseline&#xD;
      protein intake will be calculated and baseline blood phenylalanine levels will be established&#xD;
      prior to starting the trial. During the entire testing period, patients will have no dietary&#xD;
      restrictions. Blood Phe will be measured on day 1, 7, 14 and 28 days after oral&#xD;
      administration of 20 mg/kg KUVAN in 40 patients whose initial plasma Phe results were ≥360&#xD;
      umol/L. In this study, the efficacy of BH4 will be evaluated on 7, 14 and 28 days to&#xD;
      determine whether a patient is BH4-responsive. The total duration of patient participation in&#xD;
      the study will be up to 3 months (1 month of BH4 efficacy evaluation and up to 8 weeks of&#xD;
      screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health status assessments：A complete physical examination will be performed at all study&#xD;
           visits. The physical examination will include appearance, eyes, ears, nose, head,&#xD;
           throat, neck, chest, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities, skin and musculoskeletal&#xD;
           system. Weight will be measured at first visit, without shoes and having removed all&#xD;
           outwear such as jackets, sweaters or sweatshirts and heavy pocket items. Clinically&#xD;
           significant findings at screening will be reported as medical history and as adverse&#xD;
           event after the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital sign：Vital signs measurement will be recorded at all study visits and will include&#xD;
           body temperature, respiration, blood pressure and heart rate after the patients has sat&#xD;
           quietly for at least 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutrition assessment：Baseline protein intake will be calculated from 3-day photographic&#xD;
           food records, and baseline blood Phe level will be established after a 3-5 hour fasting&#xD;
           prior to starting BH4 loading. During the entire testing period, patients will have no&#xD;
           dietary restrictions, but will be asked to keep a stable diet throughout the study.&#xD;
           Patients will be required to keep a diary and photographic food records for three days&#xD;
           of each week containing a record of all foods and beverages ingested including synthetic&#xD;
           and low protein containing foods. Dietary records will be reviewed by a single qualified&#xD;
           metabolic dietician and monitored for calorie intake, natural protein intake, synthetic&#xD;
           protein intake, and total Phe intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory assessments：All routine clinical laboratory assessments will be performed by&#xD;
           central laboratory. The laboratory evaluations will include :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum nutritional biomarkers : total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, total&#xD;
                triglyceride, LDL (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), HDL (high-density&#xD;
                lipoprotein cholesterol), Iron, Ferritin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood phenylalanine and tyrosine : Blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels will be&#xD;
                measured prior to BH4 loading test, and on day 1, 7, 14 and 28 days following kuvan&#xD;
                20 mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PAH gene evaluation in all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine pTerin and DHPR enzyme activity analysis - Patients with defect in the&#xD;
                synthesis and recycling of BH4 will be excluded by analysis of urinary pterins and&#xD;
                dihydropteridine reductase activity in erythrocytes. pTerins (neopterin and&#xD;
                biopterin) metabolism will be analyzed in each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dispense study drug - Subjects will receive 20 mg/kg Kuvan administered orally once&#xD;
           daily for 28 days.&#xD;
