    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy affects about 50% of the diabetic population and there is no treatment&#xD;
      other than good blood glucose control, which is ineffective in subjects with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Part of the problem for the lack of an effective treatment is the inability to detect&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy in its early stage. The hypotheses to be addressed in the first phase&#xD;
      of this study is that changes in cornea sensitivity (blinking and squinting) following&#xD;
      addition of a hyperosmotic solution will provide a novel screening tool for early diagnosis&#xD;
      of peripheral neuropathy. For the second phase of the study the investigators will examine&#xD;
      the effect of fish oil treatment of diabetic subjects with neuropathy on corneal nerve&#xD;
      density and sensitivity. Corneal nerves are the most highly innervated part of the human body&#xD;
      with great sensitivity. The first phase will use this property and determine whether&#xD;
      sensitivity is lost in diabetic patients with neuropathy. Preclinical studies have supported&#xD;
      this hypothesis and now this will be tested in human subjects. Preclinical studies have also&#xD;
      shown that treating diabetic rodents with fish oil improves nerve regeneration and outcome&#xD;
      measures of peripheral in diabetic rodents. In the second phase the investigators will&#xD;
      perform preliminary studies in human subjects with diabetic neuropathy and determine whether&#xD;
      treating them with fish oil increases corneal nerve density and sensitivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recruitment has been suspended because of the COVID-19 crisis and the Iowa City VA is just&#xD;
      beginning to have face to face appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses to be studied in the following specific aims is that changes in cornea&#xD;
      sensitivity to a hyperosmotic solution will provide a novel screening tool for early&#xD;
      diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The investigators also propose that clinical&#xD;
      feasibility studies will demonstrate that treatment with fish oil will improve outcome&#xD;
      measures of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if the reflex squinting and blinking response to the application of a&#xD;
           hyperosmotic solution to the cornea is impaired in patients with type 2 diabetes with or&#xD;
           without peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Determine whether changes in corneal sensitivity correlate with loss of cornea nerves&#xD;
           in the sub-epithelial layer of the cornea and symptom scores for PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if treating human subjects with type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy with an&#xD;
           oral fish oil supplement increases circulating levels of resolvin D1, restores cornea&#xD;
           sensitivity to a hyperosmotic eye drop challenge and improves corneal nerve density and&#xD;
           symptom scores for peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this first phase the investigators will enroll 75 subjects to participate (Fifty subjects&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes; 25 with clinically detectable peripheral neuropathy and 25 without&#xD;
      neuropathy will be enrolled as well as 25 age-matched control subjects). In the second phase&#xD;
      of the study the investigators will investigate whether increased intake of fish oil improves&#xD;
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Subjects will receive 4g (2g twice a day) of fish oil per day&#xD;
      in capsule form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators first introduced fish oil as a successful treatment of peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy in pre-clinical studies with diabetic rodents and will now expand those studies ,&#xD;
      culminating in this feasibility study of treatment using human subjects with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and neuropathy. In this study non diabetic subjects (control) and subjects with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes with mild to moderate peripheral neuropathy will be recruited from phase 1 of this&#xD;
      study to participate in the phase 2 treatment phase of the study. A baseline determination of&#xD;
      their neuropathy (Subjective Peripheral Neuropathy Screen Questionnaire) including evaluation&#xD;
      of corneal nerve structure and sensitivity and blood sample will be performed. Tests besides&#xD;
      the questionnaire to be used to screen the subjects for peripheral neuropathy will include 10&#xD;
      g mono filament, vibration threshold, ankle reflex and sensitivity to warm and cold stimulus.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be instructed to take 2 fish oil capsules twice a day. Subjects will&#xD;
      return at 4, 8 and 12 months for re-evaluation. If successful, the feasibility study will&#xD;
      provide a proof of concept to advance fish oils to a larger clinical trial for diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual acuity (subject's vision) will be measured by having the subject read the smallest&#xD;
      letters on an eye chart with their glasses or best correction. This takes about 5 minutes or&#xD;
      less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slit lamp examination: A standard slit lamp examination will be performed to insure that no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are present and no corneal abrasion is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corneal sensitivity procedure will consist of applying a drop of 5% Muro 128 to the eye&#xD;
      and recording the blinking and squinting response over the next 5 minutes. Based on&#xD;
      preclinical studies it is anticipated that normal subjects will have an increased blinking&#xD;
      and squinting response seconds after the addition of the hyperosmotic solution (5% Muro 128),&#xD;
      whereas diabetic subjects with neuropathy will have a attenuated response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal sensation threshold: Corneal sensation will also be measured in each eye using a&#xD;
      handheld Luneau Cochet -Bonnet aesthesiometer. This device contains a thin, retractable,&#xD;
      nylon monofilament in which the length (stiffness) is varied between 6.0 mm and 1.0 mm until&#xD;
      the subject can detect the touch on their central cornea, resulting in a blink reflex. In&#xD;
      each eye, testing will begin with the 6.0 mm filament, after which the length will be&#xD;
      progressively shortened by 0.5 mm until the patient reports sensing the corneal contact. Each&#xD;
      eye will be tested three times and the best performance (in terms of longest filament that is&#xD;
      perceived to touch the cornea) will be recorded as the corneal sensation threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thickness of the optic nerve and macula will also be measured inside of the eye using a&#xD;
      special camera that forms an image of the layers of the retina. The imaging is harmless and&#xD;
      measures the thickness or structural health of retinal layers and optic nerve. A new feature&#xD;
      of OCT is eye-tracking. Eye tracking does not take any longer since it is done simultaneously&#xD;
      with the imaging. Eye tracking during OCT may give us new insight into some eye disorders.&#xD;
      This test takes approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hand-held pupillometer/electroretinogram device (RETeval, LKC) will be held in front of the&#xD;
      subject s eye, but will not touch the eye. The device will provide a brief, a series of brief&#xD;
      light stimuli and then record the pupil response and the elicited electrical response from&#xD;
      the retina from a surface skin patch (electrode) placed below each eye, from the light as a&#xD;
      measure of whether the inherent sensitivity of the eye in the retina is normal. The&#xD;
      investigators will repeat this in the left eye. The visible light stimulus is safe and is&#xD;
      given at an intensity experienced in normal daily light exposures. The test takes about 2&#xD;
      minutes per eye.&#xD;
