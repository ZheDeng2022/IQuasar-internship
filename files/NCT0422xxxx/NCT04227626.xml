  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to perform a first-in-humans trial of a fully integrated,&#xD;
      automated, closed-loop blood glucose control system designed for inpatient use. The GlucoSTAT&#xD;
      was designed for use by patients with diabetes while they are in the hospital, and others who&#xD;
      may develop high blood sugar as a result of their medical problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Our envisioned end product is an in-patient automated closed-loop control system for PG&#xD;
      regulation in the ICU as well as on the general hospital wards. In order to qualify the&#xD;
      system for the broad spectrum of challenges it will face in the inpatient setting, this study&#xD;
      will test the ability of the new integrated configuration of the system (the GlucoSTAT) to&#xD;
      control PG in subjects with extremes of insulin sensitivity. The first goal of this study is&#xD;
      to test the safety and efficacy of the control system in insulin sensitive subjects with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes. The second goal of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of the control&#xD;
      system in subjects with type 2 diabetes and substantial insulin resistance (TDD &gt; 0.75&#xD;
      u/kg/day, with up to 3 subjects with a TDD &gt; 2 u/kg/day).&#xD;
