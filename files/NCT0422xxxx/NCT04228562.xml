  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine (1) how the causal structure of a disease influences&#xD;
      people's disease prevention decisions; and (2) how the causal structure of a disease&#xD;
      interacts with people's regret anticipation in determining their disease prevention&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People sometimes have to deliberate on whether or not to remove a risk factor that may&#xD;
      potentially cause a disease in the future. When a modifiable risk factor (say, X) is the only&#xD;
      factor that causes a disease, the decision to remove it may simply depend on the&#xD;
      probabilistic relationship between X and an outcome, as well as the cost of removing X.&#xD;
      However, little is known when other factors that are out of the decision-maker's control are&#xD;
      also present. The main question being asked here is how does the presence of such&#xD;
      non-modifiable factors change people's decision to remove X.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators consider two cases: a disease caused by a single modifiable&#xD;
      risk factor (say X) and a disease caused by two risk factors -- a modifiable factor (X) and a&#xD;
      non-modifiable factor (Y). In both cases, the removal of X can result in a meaningful&#xD;
      reduction in overall disease risk. It is hypothesized that even when the magnitude of overall&#xD;
      risk reduction brought by the removal of X is the same in the two cases, people would have a&#xD;
      lower motivation to remove X in the latter case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also examine how the presence of a non-modifiable risk factor interacts&#xD;
      with the respondents' regret anticipation to influence their decision to remove X. In the&#xD;
      context of the current research, regret anticipation could take one of the following forms:&#xD;
      (a) feel regretful if one decides not to remove X and later develops the disease (b) feel&#xD;
      regretful if one decides to remove X but still develops the disease. The investigators expect&#xD;
      (a) to moderate the effect of non-modifiable risk factor on motivation to remove X.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Factorial Assignment The study has a 2 (Factor: one modifiable cause vs. one modifiable + one non-modifiable causes) ✕ 2 (Anticipated regret induction: yes vs. no) between-subject design. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 4 between-subject conditions.&#xD;
There is also a within-subject variable. Each subject will respond to 10 rounds of decision task with 5 different levels of overall disease risk reduction brought by the removal of X. The 5 levels of risk reduction are: (i) Removal of X reduces disease risk from 60% to 50% ; (ii) 60% to 40%; (iii) 60% to 30%; (iv) 60% to 20%; (v) 60% to 10%.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The experiment comprises 10 rounds of decision tasks. Participant begins with 130 points (each worth HK$0.5) in each round. After the 10 rounds, the computer randomly selects 1 round and the points from this round is paid in cash.&#xD;
There is a chance for the participant to develop a disease. Without prevention, the chance of getting the disease is 60%. A cause, X, is identified for the disease. X is a modifiable cause, which means that it can be changed by taking some actions. The participant has to decide whether or not to remove X. Removal of X reduces disease chance; the reduced chance varies between 10% and 50% across the 10 rounds and the exact level is communicated at the beginning of each round. The removal of X costs 30 points. Whether s/he ends up developing the disease or not is determined by a computerized lottery based on these chances. If s/he develops the disease, s/he will lose 100 points.</description>
