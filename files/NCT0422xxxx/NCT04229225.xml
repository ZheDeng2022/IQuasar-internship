    <textblock>
      A study to assess safety, tolerability and clinical effects of single and repeat dose&#xD;
      intra-articular administration of UBX0101 in patients with moderate to severe painful knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted as two parallel&#xD;
      cohorts to assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of single dose (SD) and&#xD;
      repeat dose (RD) intra-articular (IA) administration of UBX0101 in patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 36 patients will be randomly assigned to either Cohort 1 (SD) or Cohort 2 (RD)&#xD;
      (18 patients per treatment cohort) and further randomized in a 2:1 ratio to UBX0101 and&#xD;
      placebo in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SD and RD IA&#xD;
      administration of UBX0101 over 24 weeks.&#xD;
