      Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (VHR) is usually performed by reducing the contents in the&#xD;
      hernia sac from the abdominal cavity and then covering the defect from the inside with a&#xD;
      mesh, i.e. Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh (IPOM). This means that the hernia sac is left in situ&#xD;
      anterior to the mesh. This may, however, predispose for the development of fluid in the&#xD;
      hernia sac, i.e. seroma. The risk of seroma development may be reduced if a the defect is&#xD;
      closed before the mesh is applied. Closing the defect may, however, cause tension and pain&#xD;
      from the abdominal wall. Instead of closing the defect, the part of the peritoneum&#xD;
      constituting the hernia sac may be used for closing the defect. In this case, the peritoneum&#xD;
      is dissected from the edges of the hernia sac and then used as a flap that is fixated to the&#xD;
      edges of the hernia sac on the opposite side. In a previous study (BriClo), we compared&#xD;
      defect closure as control group with peritoneal bridging. That study showed an increased risk&#xD;
      for postoperative pain if the defect was closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate whether peritoneal bridging reduces the seroma development following&#xD;
      ventral hernia repair, we are undertaking a double-blind randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing no closure of the defect with peritoneal bridging. The goal is to randomize 100&#xD;
      patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up is performed three months, six months and one year after surgery. At all&#xD;
      occasions, the patient is requested to fill in the Ventral Hernia Pain Questionnaire (VHPQ)&#xD;
      and an investigation is done in order to assess the presence of seromas, recurrences or other&#xD;
      local complications. Duration until return to work is registered. One year after surgery,&#xD;
      computer tomography is performed in order to quantify the volume of seromas.&#xD;

      Background Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (VHR) has become a well-established technique&#xD;
      during the last decade. The repair is usually performed by reducing the contents in the&#xD;
      hernia sac from the abdominal cavity and then covering the defect from the inside with a&#xD;
      mesh, i.e. Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh (IPOM). This means that the hernia sac is left in situ&#xD;
      anterior to the mesh. This may, however, predispose for the development of fluid in the&#xD;
      hernia sac, i.e. seroma. Even if the mesh prevents the intestines from protruding into the&#xD;
      hernia sac, the patient may still be troubled by discomfort from the seroma that develops in&#xD;
      the cavity of the previous hernia sac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of seroma development may be reduced if a the defect is closed before the mesh is&#xD;
      applied (IPOM-Plus). Closing the defect may, however, cause tension and pain from the&#xD;
      abdominal wall. Instead of closing the defect, the part of the peritoneum constituting the&#xD;
      hernia sac may be used for closing the defect. In this case, the peritoneum is dissected from&#xD;
      the edges of the hernia sac and then used as a flap that is fixated to the edges of the&#xD;
      hernia sac on the opposite side. This reduces the size of the pseudosac and the peritoneal&#xD;
      surface, which prevents transudation to the pseudosac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, we have compared closure of the hernia defect with peritoneal bridging.&#xD;
      We found that closure of the defect increased the postoperative pain. In order to assess&#xD;
      whether the potential benefit from preitoneal bridging in terms of reduced risk for seromas&#xD;
      is present if the defect is not closed, we are undertaking a randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing bridging with IPOM without defect closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate whether peritoneal bridging reduces the seroma development following&#xD;
      ventral hernia repair, we are undertaking a randomized controlled trial. Our goal is to&#xD;
      include 50 patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method After obtaining written and oral consent from the patient, the randomisation is&#xD;
      performed through a sealed envelope system. The patient is blinded to the allocation. Prior&#xD;
      to the procedure, the patient is also requested to fill in the Ventral Hernia Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire (VHPQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is started according to the usual routines. Adhesions covering the defect are&#xD;
      dissected to visualize the defect. If the patients is randomized to defect closure, it is&#xD;
      sutured with continuous PDS 2-0. In case the patient is allocated to peritoneal bridging, the&#xD;
      peritoneum is dissected beginning 2-3 cm from the edge of the defect. The sac is dissected&#xD;
      all the way to the opposite edge of the defect. The peritoneal flap is pulled to the opposite&#xD;
      side and fixated with Optifix. If the patient is randomized to surgery without bridging, the&#xD;
      defect is left without closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mesh is attached in the same, irrespective of randomization. Optifix with double-crown&#xD;
      technique is used in both groups. Operation time and intraoperative complications are&#xD;
      registered when the procedure is completed. From the day of the procedure until two days&#xD;
      postoperatively, pain from the area of surgery is registered daily on a VAS-scale. Time to&#xD;
      return to normal daily activities is registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is invited to clinical follow-up three months, six months and one year after&#xD;
      surgery. At all occasions the patient is requested to fill in VHPQ. One year after surgery, a&#xD;
      computer tomography while straining to detect protrusion of the abdominal contents in the&#xD;
      defect. Any protrusion seen at the computer tomography is graded according to a previously&#xD;
      validated classification. The presence of seromas detected at the computer tomography is&#xD;
      described according to Morales-Conde, The computer tomography images are assessed by two&#xD;
      radiologists in order to reach consensus. The presence of seroma anterior to the defect is&#xD;
      evaluated in terms of size (maximal diameter), localization, shape (round, oval, triangular),&#xD;
      mean density (Hounsfield unit, HU) and the volume through three-dimensional reconstructions.&#xD;
