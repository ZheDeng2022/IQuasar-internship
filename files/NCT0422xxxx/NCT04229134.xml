      The proposed study will test the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week home-based&#xD;
      reciprocal peer support pain self-management intervention (CONNECT) for women Veterans with&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain. The use of this format will improve the accessibility of&#xD;
      treatment to women Veterans who experience logistical, healthcare delivery and psychosocial&#xD;
      barriers to care. To address these barriers women Veterans who enroll in CONNECT will be&#xD;
      paired and work together to learn/practice pain coping skills, set meaningful activity goals,&#xD;
      and participate in a graduated walking program; they will exchange nightly text messages and&#xD;
      engage in a weekly 20 minute phone call to reinforce each other and provide support for pain&#xD;
      self-management efforts. This is a single-arm pilot project; all eligible and interested&#xD;
      women with chronic musculoskeletal pain will receive CONNECT. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      post-treatment and long-term follow-up retention rates.&#xD;

      Objectives: The primary purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a reciprocal peer support pain self-management intervention (CONNECT) for&#xD;
      women Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The primary hypothesis states that the&#xD;
      post-treatment and long-term follow-up retention rates will not be less than 80% which is the&#xD;
      lowest rate obtained in a behavioral pain trial and comparable to peer support interventions.&#xD;
      Several secondary feasibility and acceptability hypotheses are proposed and include: a) rates&#xD;
      of successful dyad connection will be greater than or equal to 80%, b) nightly assessment&#xD;
      completion rates will meet or exceed the previously established 85% completion rate, c)&#xD;
      reported rates of skill practice will meet or exceed 65% consistent with other behavioral&#xD;
      pain trials, d) mean intervention satisfaction and credibility ratings will meet or exceed&#xD;
      80% d) 80% or more of participants will report favorable ratings of their peer. A responder&#xD;
      analysis will also be completed to determine the percentage of participants who report&#xD;
      clinically meaningful reductions in pain intensity and pain interference (as measured by the&#xD;
      Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form) and depressive symptoms (as defined by a reduction of 5 or&#xD;
      more points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8). Additional qualitative objectives will&#xD;
      solicit participant opinions of candidate control conditions for a future trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: A non-randomized pilot design will be employed. All eligible and interested&#xD;
      participants will participate in a week-long behavioral run-in period. Those who successfully&#xD;
      navigate it will receive CONNECT. Repeated assessments of key outcome domains will occur at&#xD;
      baseline, and at 10 and 22 weeks after intervention start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Participants will be 45 women Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
      receiving care at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System and VA Central Western Massachusetts.&#xD;
      Interested and eligible Veterans will be verbally consented before participating in a brief&#xD;
      telephone based qualitative interview and a 1-week behavioral run-in period designed to mimic&#xD;
      demands of the intervention/study. Women who successfully navigate the run-in (estimate n=30)&#xD;
      will participate in a telephone orientation with their peer and proceed through the 8-week&#xD;
      CONNECT intervention. Together, pairs will learn one new pain coping skill each week,&#xD;
      participate in a graduated walking program (using a study provided pedometer), and set&#xD;
      meaningful activity goals. They will provide reinforcement and support for these activities&#xD;
      via text messages and 1 weekly (15 minute call). Study staff will provide periodic feedback&#xD;
      on their progress.&#xD;
