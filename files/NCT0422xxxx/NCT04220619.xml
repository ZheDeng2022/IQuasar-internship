      ReTEECA Trial. Rescue TransEsophageal Echocardiography for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is aimed at studying the utility and interventional outcomes of rescue&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography (RescueTEE) to aid in diagnosis, change in management, and&#xD;
      outcomes during CPR by using a point of care RescueTEE protocol in the evaluation of&#xD;
      in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). This is an interventional prospective convenience sampled&#xD;
      partially blinded phase II clinical trial with primary outcomes of survival to hospital&#xD;
      discharge (SHD) with RescueTEE image guided ACLS versus conventional ACLS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single center, partially blinded, prospective, safety and efficacy&#xD;
      pragmatic clinical trial comparing rescue transesophageal image guided ACLS versus&#xD;
      conventional ACLS in adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). The ReTEECA Trial&#xD;
      will use a recently published and validated focused 5-view RescueTEE protocol to evaluate&#xD;
      patients with IHCA to obtain diagnostic and therapeutic information to aid in medical&#xD;
      decision-making in a rapid fashion for those patients who are experiencing in-hospital&#xD;
      arrest.1 Patients will be resuscitated with one of the following protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional ACLS with RescueTEE during IHCA. The TEE probe will be brought to the IHCA&#xD;
           code call and placed within 10 minutes of cardiac arrest after a secured airway has been&#xD;
           obtained. The RescueTEE team led by a physician (RescueTEE MD) and will use a predefined&#xD;
           protocol for diagnosis and if needed intervention at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
           physician (Code Team MD). If an intervention is performed this will be done at the&#xD;
           discretion of the treating physician as a pragmatic and clinically evidenced&#xD;
           intervention. The TEE probe will remain indwelling for 30 minutes or until return of&#xD;
           spontaneous circulation (ROSC) whichever is earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conventional ACLS without RescueTEE during IHCA. Conventional ACLS will be driven by&#xD;
           national American Heart Association (AHA) standardized protocols by the treating&#xD;
           physician (Code Team MD) and code team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of the patient and ACLS will be driven pragmatically and by the local code team&#xD;
      (Code Team MD) and not the RescueTEE team. Advice and diagnostic evidence, as able, from the&#xD;
      RescueTEE will be provided by the RescueTEE team (RescueTEE MD). Post ROSC care will be at&#xD;
      the discretion of the ICU team (ICU MD). The indications for using a validated published&#xD;
      RescueTEE protocol is to study the outcome effects of an intervention that is publicly&#xD;
      available and apply this in a real-world clinical scenario as a prospective trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our preliminary results we hypothesize that routine use of RescueTEE guided ACLS for&#xD;
      IHCA will expedite diagnosis, treatment, intervention, and facilitate and identify reversible&#xD;
      causes and significantly improve survival to hospital discharge and in turn functional&#xD;
      survival compared to standard ACLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the poor clinical outcomes of IHCA it is imperative to conduct research in this area.&#xD;
      RescueTEE provides an avenue to help diagnose and clinically intervene on pathology during&#xD;
      the intra-arrest period. This directly impacts the disease process, the patient, and will&#xD;
      likely change ACLS management. There are studies that have been conducted retrospectively and&#xD;
      prospectively that highlight the benefits of image guidance during ACLS; however, no&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial documenting the safety and efficacy of RescueTEE has been&#xD;
      conducted. Many institutions and hospital systems are now using RescueTEE during ACLS;&#xD;
      however, we do not know the impact that this has had directly on survival and complications.&#xD;
      Like many areas in medicine, a prospective clinical trial can help elucidate the direct&#xD;
      patient benefits in terms of survival. This will offer future researchers a platform to&#xD;
      conduct further studies on image guidance during ACLS. A prospective clinical trial is&#xD;
      necessary to transform national guidelines and help guide evidence-based practice throughout&#xD;
      the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ReTEECA Trial Hypothesis: Based on our preliminary results we hypothesize that routine use of&#xD;
      RescueTEE guided ACLS for IHCA will expedite diagnosis, treatment, intervention, and&#xD;
      facilitate and identify reversible causes and significantly improve survival to hospital&#xD;
      discharge and in turn functional survival compared to standard ACLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ReTEECA Trial: We propose a Phase II, single center, partially blinded, intention to treat,&#xD;
      safety and efficacy clinical trial to assess the results of routine RescueTEE guided ACLS for&#xD;
      IHCA compared with standard ACLS. The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the&#xD;
      Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care has the patient population, experience,&#xD;
      expertise, and infrastructure to execute the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The goal of the study will be to use intra-arrest RescueTEE diagnostic imaging&#xD;
      to guide the code leader in clinical management and decision-making and to therefore decrease&#xD;
      IHCA mortality rates. Additionally, we will assess if RescueTEE guidance of intra-arrest&#xD;
      therapies or interventions can significantly improve functionally favorable outcomes.&#xD;
