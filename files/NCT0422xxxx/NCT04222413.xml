      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastasis is the spread of cancer from one organ to a nonadjacent organ. It causes 90% of&#xD;
      cancer deaths. No treatment specifically prevents or reduces metastasis. Researchers hope a&#xD;
      new drug can help. It stops cancer cells from growing and spreading further and possibly&#xD;
      shrink cancer lesions in distant organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose of metarrestin and to see if this dose shrinks tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older with pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, or a solid tumor that has not&#xD;
      been cured by standard therapies. Also, children age 12-17 with a solid tumor (other than a&#xD;
      muscle tumor) with no standard therapy options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  documentation of disease confirmation or tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  electrocardiogram to evaluate the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  review of their medicines and their ability to do their normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take metarrestin by mouth until they cannot tolerate it or stop to benefit&#xD;
      from it. They will keep a medicine diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the Clinical Center. During the first month there are two brief&#xD;
      hospital stays required with visits weekly or every other week thereafter. They will repeat&#xD;
      some of the screening tests. They will fill out questionnaires. They will have tests of their&#xD;
      cognitive function. They will have an electroencephalogram to record brain activity. They&#xD;
      will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A CT is a&#xD;
      series of X-rays of the body. An MRI uses magnets and radio waves to take pictures of the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult participants may have tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends. Then they will have&#xD;
      follow-up phone calls or emails every 6 months for the rest of their life or until the study&#xD;
      ends.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metarrestin is a first-in-class investigational agent targeting the peri-nucleolar&#xD;
      compartment (PNC), a marker of genome organization associated with metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have shown that metarrestin effectively suppresses metastasis and extends&#xD;
      overall survival in different cancer models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-species allometric scaling and good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology and&#xD;
      toxicokinetic studies indicate that metarrestin administered at a calculated safe maximum&#xD;
      recommended starting dose (MRSD) to human subjects is predicted to afford intratumoral&#xD;
      exposure levels within the therapeutic range observed preclinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IA: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of metarrestin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IB: To determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.1) in patients treated with metarrestin at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult subjects with any advanced solid tumors (Cohort IA), or pancreatic, colorectal, or&#xD;
      breast tumors (Cohort IB1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric subjects age 12 and older with solid tumors other than rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)&#xD;
      including embryonal, alveolar, spindle cell/sclerosing, and pleomorphic subtypes of RMS&#xD;
      (Cohort IB2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have progressed on prior standard chemotherapeutic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is first-in-human Phase I trial to investigate the safety and clinical activity of&#xD;
      metarrestin in subjects with metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase IA MTD of metarrestin will be estimated in adult patients with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase IB adult patients with breast, colorectal, or pancreatic cancer and pediatric&#xD;
      patients with solid organ cancer will be treated at dose level of estimated MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment in cycles consisting of 28 (+/- 3) days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metarrestin will be administered PO until progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;

             refractory nausea and vomiting. Note: patients with gastric banding are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because metarrestin potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects is unknown. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with metarrestin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with study drug.&#xD;
