  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics,&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy GST-HG161.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 7 dose cohorts, including60mg, 150mg, 300mg, 450mg, 600mg, 750mg, 900mg QD in the&#xD;
      dose escalation stage and GST-HG161 will be administered orally to patients once daily for&#xD;
      each dose cohort. Recommended protocal in the dose expansion stage will be determined by the&#xD;
      results in the dose escalation stage .&#xD;
