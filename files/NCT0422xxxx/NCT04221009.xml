  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder that commonly occurs in&#xD;
      Veterans with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Untreated OSA increases risk&#xD;
      of poor health outcomes including cognitive impairment, declining mental health, poor&#xD;
      physical health, and premature mortality. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the frontline&#xD;
      treatment for OSA that effectively reduces the many negative health consequences of the&#xD;
      disease. However, adherence to PAP is required to reap the therapeutic benefit.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, PAP adherence is poor. A recent study showed that 68% of Veterans with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe TBI and OSA were nonadherent to PAP therapy. Psychoeducation is part of&#xD;
      the standard of care for OSA treatment with PAP, but on its own is insufficient for improving&#xD;
      PAP adherence. Alternatives to the standard of care include evidence-based behavioral&#xD;
      interventions such as Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      which have been shown to increase PAP use and improve PAP adherence in persons without TBI.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, these evidence-based interventions (designed for cognitively intact&#xD;
      individuals) have not been adapted to address PAP adherence in persons with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe TBI, who often require cognitive accommodations. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to test the feasibility of a novel 4-session manualized intervention, designed with cognitive&#xD;
      accommodations, and informed by MI and CBT, to address PAP adherence in Veterans with TBI and&#xD;
      OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims: Study Aim 1 will test the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the PAP&#xD;
      adherence intervention. Study Aim 2 will evaluate the feasibility of outcome and process&#xD;
      measures. To date, no treatment exists to ameliorate the adverse consequences of&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe TBI. OSA is a treatable health condition that commonly co-occurs with TBI,&#xD;
      which is a leading cause of long-term disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: In this study, 19 Veterans will be recruited from inpatient and outpatient TBI and&#xD;
      sleep clinics. Those meeting eligibility criteria (diagnosis of OSA and moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      TBI; nonadherent to PAP, able to provide informed consent) will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the 4-session intervention followed by a qualitative interview to inquire about intervention&#xD;
      acceptability. Study measures (e.g., symptom severity, sleep quality of life), will be&#xD;
      administered pre- and post-intervention. Adherence will be measured via objective data from&#xD;
      hospital software which monitors PAP use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is condition. The frontline treatment is Positive Airway&#xD;
      Pressure (PAP) therapy. Adherence to PAP is essential to reap the therapeutic benefit of the&#xD;
      treatment. Psychoeducation is part of the standard of care for the treatment of OSA, but on&#xD;
      its own has been shown to be ineffective in improving PAP adherence. In persons without brain&#xD;
      injury, alternatives to standard education, such as Motivational Interviewing (MI) and&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), have been shown to improve PAP adherence. To date, no&#xD;
      published studies have examined maximizing frontline PAP treatment for persons with brain&#xD;
      injury. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of a&#xD;
      manualized intervention, derived from evidence-based MI and CBT, and adapted with cognitive&#xD;
      accommodations, to maximize PAP success in Veterans with OSA and TBI-related burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 2-year mixed methods study using quantitative and qualitative inquiry to determine&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of a novel 4-session PAP adherence intervention (Aim 1).&#xD;
      Feasibility is the ease to which the intervention can be delivered (e.g., eligibility rates,&#xD;
      recruitment rates), and acceptability is the extent to which persons receiving the&#xD;
      intervention consider it appropriate (e.g., satisfaction ratings). Feasibility of process and&#xD;
      the ultimate outcome measures (e.g., completeness, perceived value and burden) will also be&#xD;
      examined (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from clinics within the James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital&#xD;
      (JAHVH), a tertiary care facility and teaching hospital. Participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      three clinical settings: (1) inpatient TBI neurorehabilitation; (2) outpatient TBI clinics;&#xD;
      and (3) sleep medicine clinic. Inclusion criteria for this study are as follows: (1)&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe TBI; (2) diagnosed with OSA and prescribed PAP therapy; (3) are&#xD;
      nonadherent to PAP treatment; and (4) able to consent. The plan is to enroll 19 participants,&#xD;
      because -- using a conservative 75% retention estimate - it is expected that 14 will complete&#xD;
      the intervention, exceeding the minimum for data saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon receipt of consent, the pre-intervention study measures will be administered. Veterans&#xD;
      will be scheduled for four treatment sessions. After the final session, participants will&#xD;
      complete post-intervention measures. The intervention will be delivered by a doctoral level&#xD;
      psychologist. Two independent evaluators will listen to 20% of audio-recorded sessions and&#xD;
      conduct intervention fidelity checks using a Fidelity Rating Checklist created for this study&#xD;
      by the PI, and adapted from other rating MI and CBT fidelity forms. Of the recordings, 10%&#xD;
      will be the same session to conduct interrater reliability checks of the ratings.&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted within 15 business days of their last intervention session for&#xD;
      the qualitative interview to gather information on acceptability of the intervention. The&#xD;
      project manager/research assistant will download objective PAP adherence data from the PAP&#xD;
      software program during study pre-screening and 30 days following the last intervention&#xD;
      session, to permit evaluation of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will include examination of persons enrolled and retained versus study eligible, and&#xD;
      reasons for non-enrollment. Attendance will be described. Acceptability will be examined via&#xD;
      the post-intervention interview. Identification of themes will be generated from the analysis&#xD;
      using a constant comparative approach. The qualitative team will independently read the data,&#xD;
      assign labels and codes to data segments, and develop initial themes, then meet to develop&#xD;
      consensus on initial themes and codes, revising them using an iterative process, confirming&#xD;
      evidence and consider rival explanations that contrast with findings and conclusions. Study&#xD;
      measures. Pre- and post-intervention measures which will be examined for completeness.&#xD;
      Descriptive data will be presented (e.g., central tendency, variability, change scores, and&#xD;
      effect sizes).&#xD;
