    <textblock>
      Some but not all children will refuse to take medicine because of its taste, which can lead&#xD;
      to substantial worsening of disease, antibiotic resistance, increased health care costs, and&#xD;
      even death. The investigators are systematically assessing individual variation in the taste&#xD;
      of liquid clindamycin among genotyped pediatric patients prescribed clindamycin for standard&#xD;
      of care treatment, to determine whether (1) genetic variation underlies differences in taste&#xD;
      ratings of the antibiotic; (2) initial taste responses, genetics, or both predict likelihood&#xD;
      of side effects and medication non-adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taste plays an integral role in whether a child accepts a medicine. Some children will like&#xD;
      the taste of a given medicine and complete the full course of treatment, whereas others will&#xD;
      strongly reject its taste, suffer taste-modulated side effects, or both. This study will&#xD;
      systematically measure initial palatability and reactions to the first dose of an antibiotic&#xD;
      (clindamycin, liquid formulation) by pediatric patients who are receiving clindamycin as part&#xD;
      of their standard of care treatment. Saliva will be collected from all patients for GWAS.&#xD;
      Taste response, tolerance of the medication, adherence and clinical outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed. Subjects will be followed to determine if they complete the prescribed medication&#xD;
      regimen (adherence) and/or experience side effects (tolerability). Because&#xD;
      medication-specific side effects have patient-specific variability, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine whether the child's initial taste responses, genes, or both predict subsequent side&#xD;
      effects and medication adherence.&#xD;
