  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate safety and efficacy of surgical application of&#xD;
      EB-101 (autologous, gene-corrected keratinocyte sheets) as a treatment of recessive&#xD;
      dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an ultra-rare, severe inherited&#xD;
      blistering skin disease caused by the absence of a protein known as type 7 collagen (C7).&#xD;
      There is no approved treatment for RDEB. Only supportive care is currently possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of EB-101 for the&#xD;
      treatment of large, chronic, RDEB wounds. The study intervention consists of one-time&#xD;
      surgical application of gene-corrected keratinocyte sheets (EB-101) for the treatment of RDEB&#xD;
      wound sites in up to approximately 10-15 participants. A single EB-101 sheet is able to&#xD;
      provide healing to a wound area up to approximately 40cm2. Up to 6 (six) EB-101 sheets may be&#xD;
      applied to each patient, depending on the area of existing wounds. The co-primary endpoints&#xD;
      of the study are: 1) the proportion of RDEB wound sites with greater than or equal to 50%&#xD;
      healing from baseline, comparing treated with untreated wound sites at Week 24 (Month 6) as&#xD;
      determined by direct investigator assessment; and 2) pain reduction associated with wound&#xD;
      dressing change assessed by the mean differences in scores of the Wong-Baker FACES scale&#xD;
      between treated and untreated wounds at Week 24 (Month 6). Patient-reported outcomes and&#xD;
      safety will also be collected throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach Week 24. Safety&#xD;
      and efficacy assessments will be conducted at regular intervals and completed when last&#xD;
      patient reaches Week 26 post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study period, patients will be monitored annually as per standard of&#xD;
      care for up to 15 years.&#xD;
