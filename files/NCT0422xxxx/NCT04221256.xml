      The brain is able to change throughout life in response to learning, or injury, or to adapt&#xD;
      to changes in the environment, which is known as neuroplasticity. Stroke survivors suffer&#xD;

      The brain is able to change throughout life in response to learning, or injury, or to adapt&#xD;
      to changes in the environment, which is known as neuroplasticity. Stroke survivors suffer&#xD;
      disabling chronic motor impairments that have proven challenging to improve. Increasing&#xD;
      neuroplasticity using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is a promising approach&#xD;
      to promote motor recovery in patients with stroke. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      (SSRIs) are currently widely used for treatment of depression, but they also have been shown&#xD;
      to be able to enhance neuroplasticity. A single dose of SSRI has been shown to improve hand&#xD;
      function in patients with chronic stroke. SSRIs also enhance neuroplasticity in healthy&#xD;
      individuals, as shown using paired associative stimulation (PAS), a non-invasive method which&#xD;
      causes the brain's excitability to change. However, the best dose of SSRI to increase&#xD;
      neuroplasticity is not yet established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to (1) find the effective dose of the SSRI escitalopram to&#xD;
      modulate PAS-induced plasticity in patients with stroke and healthy individuals and (2)&#xD;
      determine the variability of escitalopram's effect on PAS-induced plasticity between&#xD;
      individuals. We measure neuroplasticity with PAS, which causes the brain's excitability to&#xD;
      change. During PAS, you would receive electrical stimulation over your wrist and magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation to their scalp (called transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS) to increase the&#xD;
      excitability of the motor area of the brain. You will be asked to participate in a screening&#xD;
      visit and 8 study visits separated by at least 1 week. At each study visit, you will be given&#xD;
      a single dose of escitalopram (5, 10 or 20) or placebo, and we will measure your brain's&#xD;
      change in excitability after PAS.&#xD;
