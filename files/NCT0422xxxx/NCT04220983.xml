  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic prostate cancer can undergo MRI-guided prostate Stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) without significant adverse events, similar to what has been&#xD;
      reported for patients with localized prostate cancer. We hypothesize that prostate SBRT will&#xD;
      be well-tolerated in metastatic prostate cancer patients, with quality of life outcomes&#xD;
      similar to what has been reported in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MRidian ViewRay offers delivery of prostate SBRT with real-time MR guidance, which&#xD;
      provides superior soft-tissue differentiation with excellent visualization of the prostate.&#xD;
      This ViewRay platform offers the ideal setting for this study, that aims at precisely&#xD;
      delivering prostate SBRT with a simultaneous integrated boost (when indicated) to visible&#xD;
      nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we hope to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using 36.25 Gy in 5&#xD;
      fractions, plus a simultaneous integrated boost (when indicated), in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) short form questionnaire. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. Scores range from 0 to 100, lower scores indicate worse outcomes and higher EPIC scores represent better outcomes. QOL assessments will occur at baseline, 3-6 months, and at 9-12 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in The International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) will be assessed.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3-6months and at 9-12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicatingincreasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).&#xD;
Mild (symptom score less than of equal to 7) Moderate (symptom score range 8-19) Severe (symptom score range 20-35)</description>

    <description>Prostate SBRT has become a standard of care for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Radiation is delivered to the prostate and seminal vesicles in 5 treatment sessions (fractions). Doses ranging from 35-45 Gy in 5 fractions have demonstrated good outcomes with acceptable toxicity when planning is delivered appropriately.</description>
