  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate whether&#xD;
      the potent and selective RET inhibitor, pralsetinib, improves outcomes when compared to a&#xD;
      platinum chemotherapy-based regimen chosen by the Investigator from a list of standard of&#xD;
      care treatments, as measured primarily by progression free survival (PFS), for participants&#xD;
      with RET fusion-positive metastatic NSCLC who have not previously received systemic&#xD;
      anticancer therapy for metastatic disease. Participants who have centrally confirmed&#xD;
      progressive disease on the control arm have the option to crossover to pralsetinib.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant previously received treatment with a selective RET inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant received radiotherapy or radiosurgery to any site within 14 days before&#xD;
             randomization or more than 30 Gy of radiotherapy to the lung in the 6 months before&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with a history of pneumonitis within the last 12 months.&#xD;
