  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical procedures are routinely performed as an alternative to continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure treatment in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the response to&#xD;
      surgery is often variable. Instability of the respiratory control during sleep (or high loop&#xD;
      gain) has been associated with poor surgical results in previous research. Acetazolamide&#xD;
      (AZM), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has shown potential in reducing loop gain without&#xD;
      affecting other physiological OSA traits. In this protocol the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy of AZM add-on therapy to surgical procedures in patients with OSA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy-four patients with diagnosed moderate to severe OSA will be equally (1:1) randomized&#xD;
      to AZM (250 mg twice daily) or placebo add-on therapy after surgery. Two surgical procedures&#xD;
      will be performed throughout the study: barbed reposition pharyngoplasty (BRP) and upper&#xD;
      airway stimulation (UAS) using electrical neurostimulation of the hypoglossal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment allocation will occur after a satisfactory recovery in patients undergoing BRP and&#xD;
      after titration of the device settings in patients treated with UAS. Treatment outcome will&#xD;
      be assessed approximately 10 weeks thereafter by in-laboratory polysomnography. Two on-site&#xD;
      follow-up visits will be scheduled to assess adherence and adverse events. The maximum&#xD;
      treatment duration per participant will amount to 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the aforementioned core clinical part, the study protocol will also include an&#xD;
      optional exploratory part prior to surgery, assessing the physiological OSA traits and&#xD;
      airflow features by means of polysomnography and drug-induced sleep endoscopy research&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in daytime sleepiness measured with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks of add-on therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire asks subjects to rate their probability of falling asleep on a scale from 0 to 3 for eight different situations that most people encounter in their daily lives. The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number (0-24). An ESS score higher than 10 indicates the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Changes in sleep-related quality of life measured with the Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks of add-on therapy</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is an abbreviated version of the original 30-item version. The FOSQ-10 consists of 10 items that are distributed among 5 subscales: general productivity (2 items), activity level (3 items), vigilance (3 items), social outcomes (1 item), and intimacy and sexual relationships (1 item). The questionnaire has a 4-point scale. The total score is calculated as the sum of the subscale means and can range from 5 to 20. The minimal important difference ranges from 1.7 to 2.0 points.</description>

    <measure>Changes in snoring intensity measured with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks of add-on therapy</time_frame>
    <description>If patients have a bed partner, a standard 10-point VAS ranging from 0 (no snoring) to 10 (extreme snoring causing the bed partner to leave the bedroom or sleep separately) will be used to evaluate the subjective status of snoring during sleep. Heavy snoring corresponds to a snoring index of at least 7. A decrease of 3 points after treatment is considered significant. A satisfactory improvements is defined as a reduction to an index that is no longer experiences as bothersome (i.e. &lt;3).</description>
