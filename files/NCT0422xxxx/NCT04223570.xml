    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is increasingly used to treat superficial skin lesions, such as&#xD;
      actinic keratosis (AK) and non-melanoma skin cancers, and has been demonstrated to be an&#xD;
      effective and safe alternative to surgery. It is performed by applying a photosensitizing&#xD;
      pro-drug, amino -levulinic acid (ALA) and then allowing the conversion to the metabolite&#xD;
      Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). While attempts to measure the concentration of this drug in the&#xD;
      skin have been performed before, they have never been done in a clinical setting. With the&#xD;
      development of a new handheld, smart phone-associated device to measure PpIX, this&#xD;
      measurement is now feasible. This is a prospective single center quantitative descriptive&#xD;
      study in which the investigators will be applying the prodrug ALA on various parts of a&#xD;
      person's body and then taking measurements PpIX at various time points. This will then be&#xD;
      correlated with the individuals age, skin temperature, and skin type. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the concentration of PpIX will depend on all of these factors, including&#xD;
      anatomical location. All data will be collected into the data collection form and then&#xD;
      analyzed using Mat-lab. The investigators will assess for how anatomical location, skin&#xD;
      pigmentation, skin temperature, and other factors influence PpIX concentration. PpIX levels&#xD;
      will be measured quantitatively using our newly developed PpIX smart phone device at 0, 30,&#xD;
      45, and 60 min after ALA application. Skin temperature will also be measured at these time&#xD;
      points using and infrared (IR) camera. Fitzpatrick skin type will be assessed by the provider&#xD;
      to assess skin pigmentation. All of these factors will be correlated to the PpIX&#xD;
      concentration in 5 anatomical locations (forehead, cheeks, forearms, hands, and bald scalp&#xD;
      where applicable) to determine which factors most greatly influence the concentration of&#xD;
      PpIX.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) has gained popularity as an effective, non-scarring treatment for&#xD;
      thin, non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses (AKs). Similar to the topical agents&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil and imiquimod, PDT is particularly useful when utilized as a field-directed&#xD;
      therapy for the treatment of areas with multiple AKs and extensive sun damage. PDT consists&#xD;
      of two steps: 1) the topical application of a photosensitizer agent aminolevulinic acid&#xD;
      (ALA), which is preferentially converted to the photosensitive protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in&#xD;
      precancerous and neoplastic cells, and 2) controlled exposure to a visible wavelength light&#xD;
      source. Current methodologies utilize a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach with regard to duration&#xD;
      of incubation with photosensitizing agents and illumination. Moreover, patients frequently&#xD;
      experience pain after long PDT prodrug incubation. Better characterization of&#xD;
      photosensitization in PDT can help tailor incubation and overall treatment time to minimize&#xD;
      treatment duration and discomfort while maximizing clearance of the target lesions. The&#xD;
      direct measurement of PpIX is a promising, yet rarely performed test that may help determine&#xD;
      the appropriate PDT treatment time, the need for re-treatment or adjuvant therapy, and&#xD;
      potential efficacy of treatment. Point-probe measurements have shown extreme heterogeneity&#xD;
      between PPIx levels in different patients and among different lesions in the same patient9.&#xD;
      However, these point-probe measurements are unable to account for the variance in PpIX&#xD;
      production in different parts of the skin because of their relatively limited field of view.&#xD;
      The recent development of a low-cost, smart phone-based, wide-field fluorescence dosimetry&#xD;
      imaging system to map PpIX concentration onto a 2D image allows for handheld, real-time&#xD;
      analysis of PpIX levels in human skin. Initial unpublished clinical results have shown its&#xD;
      utility in human subjects. However, a more extensive characterization of the factors that&#xD;
      influence changes in PpIX during photosensitization has yet to be performed. This study&#xD;
      intends to elaborate these inter-and intra-individual variances in photosensitization,&#xD;
      including analysis of changes in PpIX concentrations based on anatomical location, skin&#xD;
      temperature, pigmentation, and previous skin damage.&#xD;
