    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in baseline to Week 8 on the HAMD-17 score; Minimum 0, Maximum 52; Higher scores mean a worse outcome</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a clinician rating of how much the subject's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state, a 7-point scale is used from 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SHAPS is a self-report 14-item, instrument, developed for the assessment of hedonic capacity. Participants score whether they experience pleasure in performing a list of activities or experiences. Participants can rate the answers as &quot;definitely/strongly agree&quot;, &quot;agree&quot;, &quot;disagree&quot; or &quot;strongly disagree&quot;. &quot;Definitely agree&quot; will be rated 1, &quot;Agree&quot; will be rated 2, &quot;Disagree&quot; will be rated 3, and &quot;Definitely disagree&quot; will be rated 4. The participant's item responses are summed to provide a total score ranging from 14 to 56. A higher total SHAPS score indicates higher levels of current anhedonia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) subscales (ie, anxiety subscale [HADS-A] and depression subscale [HADS-D]) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item self-report questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A is a 14-item scale to measure severity of different anxiety-related symptoms in participants. Each of the 14 items is rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (maximum degree) with a total score range of 0 to 52 where higher score indicates greater symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a 3-item self-report questionnaire used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption.</description>

                  Note: Abstinence will be allowed if, in the investigator's judgement, it is&#xD;
                  determined that the subject is reliable, that abstinence is the preferred and&#xD;
                  usual lifestyle of the subject, and that abstinence will be continued for the&#xD;
                  duration of the study including the 10 days (women) or 90-day period (men)&#xD;
