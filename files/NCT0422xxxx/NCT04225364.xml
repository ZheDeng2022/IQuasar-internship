      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Camrelizumab plus concurrent chemotherapy as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant approach for patients with opearble esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In&#xD;
      addition, potential clinical utility of ctDNA in monitoring tumor burden and dynamics of&#xD;
      tumor clonality during neoadjuvant immunotherapy will be assessed as well. At the same time,&#xD;
      CD8 and PD-L1 will also be used as monitoring indicators.&#xD;

      Immunotherapy improves clinical outcome of patients with advanced stage or metastatic&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In addition, superior effect of immunotherapy for&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was also reported recently. While, clinical application of&#xD;
      ctDNA, PD-L1 and CD8 T cell monitoring in neoadjuvant immunotherapy for patients with&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is largely unknown. This trial will evaluate firstly the&#xD;
      efficacy and the safety of Camrelizumab plus chemotherapy （albumin-bound paclitaxel plus&#xD;
      cisplatin）as neoadjuvant approach. The evaluation indicators include pathological complete&#xD;
      response rate (pCR) and objective imaging response rate after neoadjuvant therapy (ORR). ),&#xD;
      2-year progression-free survival (2y-PFS), postoperative progression-free survival (PFS), and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) after treatment. Objective response rate (ORR) based upon&#xD;
      immune-Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version (RECIST v1.1). Major pathological&#xD;
      response assessed by post-operational pathological review ctDNA efficacy will also be&#xD;
      evaluated along with clinical management. Monitoring tumor burden, clonality as well as tumor&#xD;
      heterogeneity evaluation will be correlated to radiological assessment and pathological&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;

Camrelizumab plus chemotherapy will be administrated intravenously per 3 weeks at the dosage of 200mg. Contrast-CT evaluation and peripheral blood collected will be performed at pre-neoadjuvant therapy and pre-operation. 6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy, participants who meet the indication will be assigned to operation. Another peripheral blood sample will be harvested 3-4 weeks after operation.</intervention_model_description>
