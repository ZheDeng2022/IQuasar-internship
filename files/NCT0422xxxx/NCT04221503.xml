      Evaluating the efficacy and safety of niraparib and Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) in&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) causes downregulation of BRCA1 signaling and reduced&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double-strand break repair capacity. Tumors that are deficient in&#xD;
      the homologous recombination DNA damage repair pathway are highly sensitive to blockade of&#xD;
      the repair of single strand DNA breaks via poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition. This&#xD;
      is a study of niraparib, a PARP inhibitor, in combination with tumor-treating fields for&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma. We hypothesize that tumor-treating fields will induce a state of&#xD;
      &quot;BRCAness&quot; in the glioma tumor cells, thus sensitizing them to PARP inhibition and resulting&#xD;
      in tumor cell death.&#xD;
