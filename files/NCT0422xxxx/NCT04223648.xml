      The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of mobilizing&#xD;
      programmed cell death (PD-1)+ T cells to the peripheral blood after a single treatment with&#xD;
      tremelimumab/durvalumab in patients with treatment naïve metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of administering a&#xD;
      regimen of PD-1+ selected tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)/(Interleukin) IL-2, using a&#xD;
      cell product manufactured in the Yale Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratories and assess for&#xD;
      clinical activities in subjects with metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have&#xD;
      progressed after receiving first-line therapy with 1 cycle of tremelimumab/durvalumab&#xD;
      followed by 3 cycles of ipilimumab/nivolumab followed by nivolumab monotherapy as maintenance&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objective are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess the number of PD-1+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment before and after a&#xD;
           single treatment with tremelimumab/durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. conduct a preliminary assessment of the TCR clonotypes present in PD1+ cluster of&#xD;
           differentiation 8 (CD8)+ cells (4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1) versus PD1-CD8+ T-cells early&#xD;
           in the expansion cultures and compare to clonotypes late in the final product and in&#xD;
           peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) 1 and 2 months post infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. assess neoantigens present in resected tumor and correlate T cell specificity for&#xD;
           neoantigens from TIL and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations stratified&#xD;
           by PD-1 expression in these cell populations.&#xD;
