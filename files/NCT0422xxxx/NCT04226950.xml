    <textblock>
      Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety in childhood and adolescent patients (&lt;20&#xD;
      years) diagnosed as essential thrombocythemia treated with the Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b&#xD;
      vs. Interferon Alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, single-center clinical trial&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, single-center clinical trial between&#xD;
      Interferon Alfa and Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b in childhood and adolescent essential&#xD;
      thrombocythemia (&lt;20 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into the following two treatment groups: 1. Recombinant Interferon&#xD;
      Alpha, with an initial dose of 300 wu twice a week. Other interferons that have been listed&#xD;
      can be used if Recombinant Interferon Alpha (300 wu) is not available, and the specific dose&#xD;
      will be determined by the researchers; 2. Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b, with an initial dose&#xD;
      of 135 ug once a week (body surface area &lt; 1.73 m2) or 180 ug once a week ( body surface&#xD;
      area≥1.73 m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current drug therapies and possible risks of Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b and Interferon&#xD;
      Alfa in the treatment of childhood and adolescent essential thrombocythemia will be fully&#xD;
      introduced to the guardians (childhood patients) or patients (adolescent patients) by the&#xD;
      researchers. Then the patients will be divided into one of the two groups according to the&#xD;
      guardians' (childhood patients) or patients' (adolescent patients) will.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage will be adjusted according to the results of laboratory examinations and patient&#xD;
      tolerance. The patient will be transferred to the other group if intolerance or resistance&#xD;
      occurs.&#xD;
