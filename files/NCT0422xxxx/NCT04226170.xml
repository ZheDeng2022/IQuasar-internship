      Methodology: This is a phase II, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      study in patients with a diagnosis of anti-AchR antibody positive myasthenia gravis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The clinical trial will be conducted over a 6-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Patients currently taking pyridostigmine and experiencing&#xD;
           pyridostigmine-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) within the past 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Patients not currently taking pyridostigmine due to GI AEs or that had their&#xD;
           dose reduced due to pyridostigmine related GI AEs Group A will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
           and randomized to either the control (pyridostigmine+ placebo) or the test group&#xD;
           (pyridostigmine + ondansetron) and treated for 6 weeks. Following enrolment, patients&#xD;
           may (if needed) titrate up their pyridostigmine dose at the investigator's discretion&#xD;
           each week to the highest dose deemed appropriate, tolerable and safe by the&#xD;
           Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B patients not currently taking pyridostigmine due to GI AEs will initiate&#xD;
      pyridostigmine at a dose determined by the investigator based on the patient's history and&#xD;
      may titrate as deemed tolerable and safe by Investigator during screening; patients on a&#xD;
      reduced dose due to pyridostigmine related GI AEs may titrate pyridostigmine as deemed&#xD;
      tolerable and safe by the investigator during screening. If patients in Group B experience GI&#xD;
      AEs that fulfil enrolment criteria, along with all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, they&#xD;
      will be enrolled into the study at that dose and randomized to either the control&#xD;
      (pyridostigmine+ placebo) or the test group (pyridostigmine + ondansetron) and treated for 6&#xD;
      weeks. Following enrolment, patients may (if needed) titrate up their pyridostigmine dose at&#xD;
      the investigator's discretion each week to the highest dose deemed appropriate, tolerable and&#xD;
      safe by the Investigator.&#xD;
