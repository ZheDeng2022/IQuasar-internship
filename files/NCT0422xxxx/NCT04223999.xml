    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to test a new potential treatment, skullremodeling surgery&#xD;
      (SR-surgery) combined with tumor treating fields (TTFields), for patients with first&#xD;
      recurrence of malignant brain tumor (first recurrence of glioblastoma). Glioblastoma is one&#xD;
      of the most malignant cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TTFields is a new treatment for brain cancer (glioblastoma), which is used in additional to&#xD;
      surgery (removal of the tumor), chemotherapy and radiation. TTFields work by sending&#xD;
      alternating current to the tumor. The current disrupts cell division and thus prevents cancer&#xD;
      growths. Electrodes are placed on the scalp and the current is delivered via a small portable&#xD;
      battery (1kg). Treatment duration is 18 hours during the day, where the patient can do normal&#xD;
      daily activities. The average life expectancy of a newly diagnosed brain cancer patient&#xD;
      (glioblastoma) is increased from 15 months to 21 months by adding TTFields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SR-surgery is a minor and safe procedure, that involves creating small burrholes in the skull&#xD;
      over the tumor location. The burrholes are approximately 15 mm in diameter. The burrholes&#xD;
      increase the electric current in the tumor by funneling the electricity trough the path of&#xD;
      least resistance, since bone hinders the electricity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theory is that combining TTFields with SR-surgery we can increase the effect of TTFields&#xD;
      and in return increase overall survival for brain cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently finished a phase 1 clinical trial, with 15 trial&#xD;
      participants, testing the safety and efficacy of our combined treatment. The investigators&#xD;
      concluded that TTFields and SR-surgery combined is safe and showed promising results by&#xD;
      increasing overall survival with the trial participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefor we wish to proceed with a phase 2 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The investigators aim to include 70 patients with first recurrence of glioblastoma&#xD;
      (brain cancer). Each patient will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. Both treatment&#xD;
      arms will receive the best current brain tumor treatment. In addition, one arm receives TTF&#xD;
      and the other arm TTFields and SR-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are expected to receive better treatment than current best practice, since&#xD;
      TTFields is not standard treatment in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the trial is to assess the 12-month overall survival in both groups. The&#xD;
      theory is that more trial participants will be alive after 12 months in the group that&#xD;
      receives both TTF and SR-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial duration is 36 months with an average expected follow-up of 18 months.&#xD;

      Introduction Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low-intensity (1-3 v/m) intermediate&#xD;
      frequency (200 khz for GBM) alternating fields that disrupt cell division. The treatment is&#xD;
      increasingly used as a supplementary modality for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Recent&#xD;
      randomized clinical studies have demonstrated tolerability of TTFields (Optune®, Novocure®)&#xD;
      for both newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM and a significant and sustained survival benefit&#xD;
      in the former population. Specifically, the addition of TTFields to maintenance temozolomide&#xD;
      (TMZ) therapy for newly diagnosed GBM patients, who had completed initial concurrent&#xD;
      radio-chemotherapy, resulted in significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (PFS&#xD;
      = 6.7 vs. 4.0 months, p&lt;0.001) and median overall survival (OS = 20.9 vs. 16.0 months,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.001) compared to maintenance TMZ therapy alone (ef-14 trial) (4). Consequently, TTFields&#xD;
      were recently approved by the US FDA and included as a category 1 recommendation in the most&#xD;
      recent guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the treatment of&#xD;
      newly diagnosed GBM. For recurrent GBM, TTFields monotherapy has been shown to have&#xD;
      equivalent efficacy and a superior toxicity profile compared to best practice medical&#xD;
      oncological therapy. This led to US FDA approval for this indication in 2011. In addition, a&#xD;
      post-hoc analysis of the EF-14 dataset has indicated that the addition of TTFields to 2nd&#xD;
      line medical oncological treatment at first disease recurrence leads to an overall survival&#xD;
      benefit. Finally, the pride dataset showed that the addition of TTFields to current practice&#xD;
      of medical oncological treatment was beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators proposed a novel approach to calculate the electrical field&#xD;
      distribution induced by TTFields therapy of GBM. The approach utilizes finite element&#xD;
      analysis and incorporates personalized MRI data to provide a realistic and individualized&#xD;
      estimate of the field intensity distribution, which is associated with the antimitotic&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment. Using this approach, the investigators showed that targeted&#xD;
      skull-remodeling surgery, e.g. craniectomy or multiple burr-holes, can provide a substantial&#xD;
      and highly focused enhancement (~100%) of the median field intensity in supratentorial&#xD;
      tumors, while leaving the field distribution in healthy tissues unaffected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results support the theoretical rationale that small and clinically feasible&#xD;
      craniectomies may improve the clinical efficacy of TTFields for cerebral hemispheric tumors&#xD;
      without compromising patient safety. Based on these findings, the investigators recently&#xD;
      concluded an open-label, single arm, prospective phase 1 trial (NCT02893137) to investigate&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of SR-surgery with TTFields and best practice neuro-oncological&#xD;
      therapy for recurrent GBM. The trial was active from December 2016 to May 2019. The planned&#xD;
      total number of patients was fifteen. Eligibility criteria included age &gt; 18 years, first&#xD;
      recurrence focal supratentorial GBM (RANO), and KPS ≥ 70. Patients were right-censored for OS&#xD;
      and PFS at the time of analysis and excluded upon progression, death, SUSARs, or unacceptable&#xD;
      AEs. The primary endpoint was toxicity (CTCAEv4.0). The secondary endpoints were OS, PFS, PFS&#xD;
      rate at six months (PFS6), objective response rate (ORR) based on the iRANO criteria (14),&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL), Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and steroid dose.20 patients were&#xD;
      screened, 2 declined, and 3 had KPS &lt; 70. Of the 15 enrolled patients, 4 were excluded prior&#xD;
      to TTFields due to radionecrosis/non-recurrence, post-op infection, neurodeficit and&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, respectively. All included patients (11 male and 2 female) had GBM&#xD;
      IDH-wt tumors (4 MGMT-methylated). Median KPS was 90 (range 70-100) and median age 57 years&#xD;
      (range 39 to 67). All patients received maximum safe resection at recurrence (4 had no&#xD;
      residual tumor (RANO), 5 non-measurable disease, and 2 measurable disease). 9 patients&#xD;
      received adjuvant bevacizumab monotherapy and 2 temozolomide rechallenge. The mean&#xD;
      skull-defect area was 10.6 cm2 (range 7 to 37 cm2) and the median field enhancement 43 %&#xD;
      (range 25 to 59%). The median follow-up duration was 10 months and the median TTFields&#xD;
      compliance 90% (range 48 to 98%). We observed no SUSARs, no grade 4/5 SAEs, 12 grade 3 SAEs&#xD;
      (6 generalized seizures in patients with known epilepsy, 1 post-op infection, 1 diarrhea,&#xD;
      1TIA, 1 fatigue, 1 headache and 1 DVT). The most common grade AE 1-2 was headache 60% CI95%=&#xD;
      [32; 84], fatigue 53%, CI95%= [27; 79], skin rash 47%, CI95%= [21; 73], and nausea 40%,&#xD;
      CI95%= [16; 68].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding survival results were PFS6 was 64%, CI95%= [35; 85], PFS= 8.8 months, CI95%= [6.2;&#xD;
      13.2], OS= 15.0 months, CI95%= [9.6;16.2], and OS12= 64%, CI95%= [35;85]. One patient had&#xD;
      complete response during TTFields. Based on these results, the investigators concluded that&#xD;
      skull-remodelling surgery incl. craniectomy is not associated with additional toxicity in&#xD;
      combination with TTFields and best practice medical oncological treatment and holds promising&#xD;
      potential for improving TTFields outcome by focally enhancing the field intensity in the&#xD;
      tumor. The proposed phase 2 trial aims to validate this hypothesis in a randomized&#xD;
      comparative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS Trial design The study is designed as an investigator-initiated,&#xD;
      prospective, multi-center, multi-national, randomized, minimax two-stage, comparative, phase&#xD;
      2 trial, investigating superior efficacy of the intervention. Patients randomized to the&#xD;
      control arm will receive TTFields plus best physician's choice medical oncological treatment&#xD;
      (BPC treatment) and patients in the interventional arm will receive SR-surgery in addition to&#xD;
      TTFields and BPC treatment. The trial will enroll an expected sample size of 70 patients from&#xD;
      4-6 scandinavian countries with Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, as the Sponsor and&#xD;
      coordinating site. The primary outcome will be overall survival at 12 months (OS12) and the&#xD;
      trial is designed to detect a 20% increase in OS12 in the interventional arm compared to&#xD;
      control (from 40% in the control arm to 60% in the interventional arm). Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QoL), clinical performance,&#xD;
      and objective response rate (ORR). Interim futility analysis will be conducted after 12&#xD;
      months follow-up of the first 52 patients. The trial will be stopped at interim analysis if&#xD;
      the OS12 months is lower in the control arm compared to the interventional arm. The trial&#xD;
      design and data reporting is in accordance with the consort 2010 statement, the gnosis&#xD;
      standards for neuro-oncology trials, recent RANO recommendations for phase 2 trial design in&#xD;
      neuro-oncology, and general recommendations for phase 2/3 trial design (16-19). The study&#xD;
      will be performed in the period march 2020 to march 2023. The inclusion period is expected to&#xD;
      be the first 24 months of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Seventy (70) patients with progressive GBM according to RANO criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Potential trial participants will be identified at an institutional&#xD;
      multidisciplinary neuro-oncological tumor boards and subsequently referred for eligibility&#xD;
      screening. All inclusion scans are assessed by a trained neuroradiologist. Patients who are&#xD;
      immediately ineligible, e.g. due to poor performance status, multifocal disease, significant&#xD;
      comorbidity, evidence of extracranial primary tumor, or other excluding circumstances, will&#xD;
      not be referred for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental intervention Patients will be randomised 1:1 to one of two study arms to receive&#xD;
      either, 1) SR-surgery, TTFields and best practice medical oncological therapy (interventional&#xD;
      arm), or 2) TTFields and best practice medical oncological therapy alone (control arm). Best&#xD;
      practice treatment will typically also include maximum safe resection. Since the intervention&#xD;
      (SR-surgery) is only effective during TTFields therapy, TTFields will continue until 1)&#xD;
      patient exclusion from the trial, 2) occurrence of a suspected unexpected serious adverse&#xD;
      reaction (SUSAR) related to the intervention, or 3) ethical or medical safety&#xD;
      contraindication for further TTFields therapy determined by the investigators. This means&#xD;
      that treatment may continue beyond progression, as long as active treatment is indicated, and&#xD;
      in some cases as compassionate use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical considerations The sample size calculations were based on a&#xD;
      randomized, comparative, minimax two-stage design and the binomial primary outcome of OS12&#xD;
      for the patient population treated per protocol, i.e. for whom TTFields therapy was&#xD;
      initiated. This means that patients excluded prior to TTFields therapy initiation are not&#xD;
      included in the primary outcome analysis. Therefore, additional patients may be enrolled to&#xD;
      ensure that the planned sample receives active TTFields treatment. The aim of the trial is to&#xD;
      determine whether the intervention is superior to control and thus worthy of further phase 3&#xD;
      investigation. The expected OS12 in the control arm is set to 40% based on the EORTC 26101&#xD;
      trial, in which patients with first recurrence of GBM were treated with lomustine monotherapy&#xD;
      or lomustine/bevacizumab combination therapy. The trial showed an OS12 of approximately 30%&#xD;
      and we therefore set the expected level of OS12 to be slightly above this threshold given the&#xD;
      fact that TTFields is added to the treatment which otherwise represents recommended practice.&#xD;
      There are no current studies providing accurate OS12 estimates for a population comparable to&#xD;
      the study control arm and we therefore based the estimate on an expected benefit of 10% from&#xD;
      TTFields alone compared to EORTC 26101. Setting the probabilities of false-positive and&#xD;
      false-negative trial results to α = 0.15 and 1-β = 0.80, respectively, and defining the&#xD;
      expected target level of OS12 to be OS12 = 0.6, i.e. a 20% absolute increase (and 50%&#xD;
      relative increase) compared to the control arm, we calculated a maximum sample size of n = 42&#xD;
      patients in each arm (total n = 84) and an expected total sample size (en = 69.8). The&#xD;
      expected sample size en is calculated as en = n1 × pet0 + n × (1 - pet0), where n1 = 52 is&#xD;
      the collective sample size of both groups at interim (stage 1) analysis, pet0 = 0.44 is the&#xD;
      probability of early futility termination. The numbers are based on the given statistical&#xD;
      parameters and a two-stage minimax design as given in sh jung 2018. Interim futility analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted after endpoint assessment of 52 patients and the trial will be terminated&#xD;
      if the experimental arm performs worse than the control arm. In this case the futility&#xD;
      criterion will be defined as OS12experimental &lt; OS12control and this conclusion will&#xD;
      determine futility at marginal power and significance levels of 1-β* = 0.80 and of α* = 0.20,&#xD;
      respectively. If the trial is not terminated at interim stage 1 analysis, the trial will&#xD;
      proceed to enroll a total of 84 patients and terminate when the final OS12 endpoint data have&#xD;
      been obtained for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures of hazard rate ratios of PFS and OS will be tested using the&#xD;
      log-rank test at the 0.05 alpha level. Time-to-event endpoints will be estimated from the&#xD;
      time of randomization. Toxicity and adverse events will be reported using absolute numbers&#xD;
      and appropriate risk estimates. Final analysis will be conducted when all patients have been&#xD;
      excluded or censored, e.g. due to end-of-trial, or loss-to-follow-up. Subgroup analysis based&#xD;
      on prognostic factors will be performed, incl. analysis of patient characteristics in each&#xD;
      arm and identification of characteristics of potential responders to the intervention. This&#xD;
      will also include a correlation analysis between the calculated field distribution and&#xD;
      outcome estimates. Analyses will be based on both the intent-to-treat population and the&#xD;
      population proceeding to active therapy (per protocol), i.e. At least four weeks of active&#xD;
      TTFields therapy with ≥75% average compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and blinding Patients will be randomised immediately upon enrollment in the&#xD;
      trial, i.e. prior to initial surgery. Randomisation will be performed using randomization.com&#xD;
      and patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive TTFields and best practice medical&#xD;
      oncological treatment w/o skull remodeling surgery. The study endpoint assessment committee&#xD;
      will be blinded to the intervention. Local principal investigators, co-investigators and&#xD;
      sub-investigators will not be blinded, as optimal array planning will require knowledge about&#xD;
      skull-remodeling surgery. The operating surgeon performing the skull-remodeling surgery will&#xD;
      not be blinded. Patients will not be blinded, as it will be possible for the patient to feel&#xD;
      the skull configuration and thereby determine whether SR-surgery was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and safety precautions General safety considerations concerning Optune® therapy are&#xD;
      outlined in the related technical and safety material provided by Novocure®. In general,&#xD;
      TTFields therapy is regarded a safe and recognized treatment for GBM. The most common adverse&#xD;
      effect is local skin rash in the area underlying the transducer arrays. The risk of skin rash&#xD;
      will be reduced by slightly moving the arrays during regular array changes. Skin rash may be&#xD;
      treated with topical corticosteroids, more frequent electrode replacement and short pauses in&#xD;
      TTFields therapy, if needed. The risk of brain injury due to the skull remodeling aspect of&#xD;
      surgery is minimal, as the entire operation is performed extra-durally. Minor craniectomies&#xD;
      do not pose a significant risk of mechanical brain injury. For larger craniectomies, external&#xD;
      protective headgear, such as a cap with mechanical reinforcement over the unprotected brain&#xD;
      area, may be used to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury after craniectomy. In the case&#xD;
      of post-operative infection or impaired wound healing, antibiotic therapy will be&#xD;
      administered. If needed, surgical revision/debridement of the wound and potentially removal&#xD;
      of the bone flap may be performed. In such cases, the patient may proceed to receive or&#xD;
      continue TTFields therapy at an appropriate time, if it is in the patient's best interest.&#xD;
      TTFields therapy following removal of the infected bone flap may be accepted even if the&#xD;
      craniectomy size exceeds 30 cm2. In all cases, the decision whether to continue with TTFields&#xD;
      therapy after surgery will be based on careful consideration of the expected safety and&#xD;
      benefit for the patient. All participants will be advised of situations and adverse events,&#xD;
      in which medical attention is required. Investigators or properly trained medical personnel&#xD;
      will be available for immediate attention or medical advice specific to the treatment or&#xD;
      protocol. Patients will receive contact information to the device support specialist, whom&#xD;
      they may contact in case of technical problems or considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and quality control The project will comply with international guidelines good&#xD;
      clinical practice (ICH-GCP and ds/en iso 14155:2012. Clinical investigation of medical&#xD;
      devices for human subjects - good clinical practice) and be monitored by the local contract&#xD;
      research organization (CRO). Source data, verification of consent, and handling of adverse&#xD;
      events and near-miss incidents will be subject to 20% sampled monitoring. Full access to all&#xD;
      source data, incl. patient records, will be granted in relation to trial inspection by the&#xD;
      relevant national competent authorities. Experimental &quot;waivers&quot; from the protocol will be&#xD;
      registered in the project trial master file and reported to the relevant authorities. Changes&#xD;
      to the protocol will be submitted for approval by the relevant authorities in accordance with&#xD;
      GCP guidelines and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination All results will be published in peer-reviewed international scientific&#xD;
      journals and presented at international scientific conferences, regardless of academic&#xD;
      conclusions. Positive, negative, and inconclusive results will be publicly available.&#xD;
