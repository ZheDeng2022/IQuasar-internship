  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, one treatment, four group, parallel group study to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of impaired hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib in&#xD;
      participants with different levels of hepatic function. Participants with mild, moderate or&#xD;
      severe hepatic impairment ('Mild', 'Moderate' and 'Severe' groups), and control participants&#xD;
      with normal hepatic function ('Normal' group) will each receive a single 100 mg dose of&#xD;
      entrectinib after consumption of a standardized meal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with reduced hepatic function will be assigned to a functional category based on&#xD;
      assessments at the Screening visit. Each individual will be categorized according to the&#xD;
      Child Pugh system for classifying hepatic impairment and also according to the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute organ dysfunction working group (NCI-ODWG) system. Recruitment will be&#xD;
      staggered to allow review of pharmacokinetic and safety data from at least three participants&#xD;
      in each of the Mild and Moderate groups before participants are enrolled into the Severe&#xD;
      group. Recruitment of the Severe group will only proceed if there is agreement between the&#xD;
      Sponsor and the Investigator that data from this group are necessary to fulfill the&#xD;
      objectives of the study and that dosing is not anticipated to present an unacceptable risk to&#xD;
      those individuals. The control group of participants with normal hepatic function will be&#xD;
      enrolled after the full complement of participants with hepatic dysfunction has been dosed.&#xD;
