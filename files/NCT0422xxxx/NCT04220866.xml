    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of intratumoral (IT)&#xD;
      ulevostinag in PLUS pembrolizumab (MK-3475) compared to pembrolizumab alone as a first line&#xD;
      treatment of adults with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (HNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypotheses are that IT ulevostinag in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      results in a superior Objective Response Rate (ORR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), compared to pembrolizumab alone:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. in participants with a tumor that has a programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Combined&#xD;
           Positive Scoring (CPS) ≥ 1, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. in participants with a tumor that has a PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. ORR will be assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).</description>

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS will be assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).</description>

    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 until Progressive Disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, in participants demonstrating a CR or PR. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD.</description>
