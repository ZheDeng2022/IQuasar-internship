  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether a novel manualized intervention, called&#xD;
      Emotion and Symptom-focused Engagement (EASE), that combines psychological support with&#xD;
      symptom screening plus triggered referral to early palliative care for symptom control,&#xD;
      reduces psychological distress and physical symptom burden in individuals newly diagnosed&#xD;
      with acute leukemia. To do this, half of the participants in this study will receive the&#xD;
      usual care offered to patients with acute leukemia and half of the participants will receive&#xD;
      usual care plus the EASE intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual care treatment for patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia&#xD;
      involves admission to hospital for treatment (e.g. induction chemotherapy). Additional&#xD;
      support services may be delivered if requested or if a doctor thinks it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little research has been done looking at the psychological and physical consequences of being&#xD;
      diagnosed with and treated for acute leukemia, but our research team has found that a&#xD;
      significant number of these individuals experience symptoms of traumatic stress and severe&#xD;
      physical symptoms. Even less research has been done looking at ways to help alleviate this&#xD;
      psychological and physical distress. Emotion and Symptom-focused Engagement (EASE) is an&#xD;
      integrated psychosocial and early palliative care (symptom control) intervention designed to&#xD;
      reduce psychological distress and physical symptom burden in patients newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      acute leukemia. The EASE intervention provides i) tailored supportive psychotherapy (called&#xD;
      EASE-psy) during the initial weeks of treatment to reduce symptoms of traumatic stress, and&#xD;
      ii) symptom screening during the initial inpatient treatment period with triggered referral&#xD;
      to early palliative care (symptom control) to help manage moderate to severe physical&#xD;
      symptoms (called EASE-phys).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase II trial of EASE in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia demonstrated&#xD;
      feasibility and preliminary evidence that it reduces psychological distress and physical&#xD;
      symptom severity compared to usual care. This new trial is a definitive phase III, multi-site&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of EASE at reducing psychological&#xD;
      distress and physical burden.&#xD;
