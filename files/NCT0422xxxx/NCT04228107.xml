      This study will look at how adolescents use both their controller and rescue medications&#xD;
      using an electronic medication monitoring platform, for the period of one year. Participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in a medication monitoring platform, and their asthma care provider will&#xD;
      have access to medication usage information. The study team will collect data on medication&#xD;
      use patterns in a real world setting for 12 months per participant. Additionally, healthcare&#xD;
      providers will be enrolled in focus groups to determine barriers and facilitators to optimal&#xD;
      medication use for their patients.&#xD;

    <description>The Investigators will calculate the number of participants that fall into the following treatment phenotypes: &quot;Well controlled-good adherence&quot;, &quot;Well controlled-poor adherence&quot;, &quot;Poorly controlled-good adherence&quot;, &quot;Poorly controlled-poor adherence&quot;. The investigators will use group based trajectory modeling to evaluate adherence and control phenotypes; In essence, they will evaluate the adherence trajectory of each subject, as well as the control phenotype of each patient, and then use this information to determine into which of the four groups the participant falls. The outcome reported will be the number of subjects in each group.</description>

    <description>Participants will be enrolled in medication use monitoring. Their medication use patterns will be available to themselves and their guardians via a smartphone application, and to their asthma care providers via a portal. There will be no interventions to change medication use patterns. A portion of them will be asked to participate in a semistructured interview during which they will be asked questions about their perception of their asthma, health beliefs regarding medication use, and what they feel would be the most helpful to get them to take their asthma medicines.&#xD;
Additionally a small group of healthcare providers will be asked to participate in a focus group to collect qualitative data on medication use barriers and facilitators</description>
