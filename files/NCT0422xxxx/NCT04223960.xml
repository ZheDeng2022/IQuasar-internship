  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EA1080&#xD;
      following single and multiple ascending oral doses in healthy Caucasian and Japanese male&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

      The drug being tested in this study is called EA1080. EA1080 is being tested to find a safe&#xD;
      and well-tolerated dose in healthy Caucasian and Japanese male participants. The study&#xD;
      consists of 2 parts as mentioned below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: This part of the study is fully adaptive and will be performed in three sub-parts as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single ascending dose (SAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food Effect (FE) and optional bioavailability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple ascending dose (MAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: This part of study is comprised of four sub-parts to assess Formulation E and&#xD;
      Formulation F as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An additional FE period in SAD cohorts (SAD-FE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food Effect and bioavailability (FE/BA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MAD&#xD;
