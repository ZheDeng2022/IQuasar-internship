  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an online program to help people with peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease (PAD) in their extremities to better self-manage their condition. Some earlier&#xD;
      testing has been done and the investigators now wish to try this system with participants who&#xD;
      have this blood vessel disease as well as high blood pressure. Investigators are hoping to&#xD;
      help these participants to achieve healthier lifestyles and improve their quality of life&#xD;
      through education, monitoring and continuing support. A similar online desk-top version with&#xD;
      over 30 participants has been tested at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to test this newer mobile system with 210 outpatient participants from Hamilton&#xD;
      General Hospital. Data collected will be analyzed following the (12 months for each&#xD;
      participant) study, along with data recorded during clinical visits at baseline and twelve&#xD;
      months for each participant. The objective is to evaluate changes to participant health and&#xD;
      determine whether the health self-management process has been successful in improving&#xD;
      participant lifestyles and quality of life, when compared to usual care.&#xD;
