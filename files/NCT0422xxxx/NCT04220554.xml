  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis affects 2-4% of the Western adult population and is a socio-economic burden for&#xD;
      patients and society. Topical drugs are recommended as first-line treatment for&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate psoriasis, but low adherence is a barrier for treatment success. There is a&#xD;
      need for improved patient support for psoriasis patients, which is suggested to improve&#xD;
      long-term use of topical drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to test whether a patient-supporting intervention delivered by healthcare&#xD;
      professionals can improve the use of topical drugs. The intervention design is based on&#xD;
      experiences with previous adherence-improving studies consisting of digital support by&#xD;
      conducting a systematic literature search and holding focus groups with patients as well as&#xD;
      healthcare professionals. The intervention consists of shared decision-making with patients,&#xD;
      nurses and doctors, frequent consultations, easy access to healthcare professionals through&#xD;
      video or in-office consultations and holding patients accountable for taking the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be tested in a randomized controlled trial: during a 48 week period, a&#xD;
      group of patients (18-85 years of age) diagnosed with mild-to-moderate psoriasis and treated&#xD;
      with topical drugs will be randomized to an intervention (n=40) or non-intervention group&#xD;
      (n=40). The primary outcome will be severity of psoriasis and secondary outcomes primary&#xD;
      adherence (i.e., rate of filled prescriptions), quality of life and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the intervention can reduce the severity of psoriasis in a significant manner and is&#xD;
      cost-effective, there is a potential for a national implementation of the intervention.&#xD;

      Background Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting 2-4% of the Western&#xD;
      adult population. It is associated with many comorbidities, negatively affects quality of&#xD;
      life and is a socioeconomic burden for patients and society. Topical drugs are the&#xD;
      recommended first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate psoriasis, but adherence rates are low,&#xD;
      which is a barrier for treatment success, resulting in a need for systemic or biological&#xD;
      treatments, which are associated with more severe adverse events and are more expensive than&#xD;
      topical drugs. However, improved adherence to topical drugs is associated with improved&#xD;
      efficacy. That is why there is a need for improving psoriasis patients' adherence to topical&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a supplement to the introduction of new and advanced technology, there is a need for more&#xD;
      studies on how to optimize the available healthcare professionals in dermatology clinics.&#xD;
      Since dermatologists are a limited resource, there is a need to study how other healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, e.g., hospital nurses and pharmaconomists at the pharmacies, can support&#xD;
      psoriasis patients in their use of topical drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient-supporting intervention delivered by dermatologists, dermatology nurses and&#xD;
      pharmaconomists significantly reduces psoriasis patients' severity of psoriasis compared to&#xD;
      standard patient support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to test whether an individualized patient-supporting intervention&#xD;
      delivered to psoriasis patients by dermatologists, nurses and pharmaconomists at a&#xD;
      dermatology hospital clinic can: 1) reduce the severity of psoriasis, 2) improve quality of&#xD;
      life, 3) improve adherence to prescribed topical drugs, and 4) be cost-effective compared to&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be fully informed of the purpose of the study, and the study will be&#xD;
      performed in accordance with the ethical principles in the Belmont report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, assessor-blinded, parallel group&#xD;
      superiority randomized clinical study. Before inclusion of study participants, the study will&#xD;
      be approved by the local regional ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will include patients (18-85 years of age) with milder-to-moderate psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements will be either patient-reported or assessor-blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary adherence: Proportion of filled topical prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amount of medication used according to weight of the remains in the used medication packages.&#xD;
      Data will be assessed week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease severity measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease severity will be measured by Lattice-System Physician's Global Assessment (LS-PGA)&#xD;
      (15), and the quality of life will be measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).&#xD;
      This data will be assessed at baseline, weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial savings from use of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost-analysis of optimized patient support will be measured by total use of psoriasis&#xD;
      medication including topical treatments, systemic treatments, phototherapy and biological&#xD;
      treatments compared to the cost of the intervention. A cost-utility analysis will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis patients who use topical treatments and are referred to the Department of&#xD;
      Dermatology at Odense University Hospital will be recruited to the project until there is a&#xD;
      sufficient number of participants included (n=80). If needed, recruitment advertisement will&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and expected number of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in reduction of psoriasis between the&#xD;
      intervention and non-intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated based on data from a previous project with consumption data&#xD;
      for the use of prescribed calcipotriol betamethasone dipropionate cutaneous foam over 4&#xD;
      weeks. We expect an 20% difference in the LS-PGA, power 80%, two-sided significance of 95%,&#xD;
      allocation of 1: 1 and an expected dropout rate of 25%. When using an unpaired t-test, the&#xD;
      calculation resulted in the inclusion of a sample size consisting of 80 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of the data assessors: When the data assessor obtains baseline data from the study&#xD;
      participants, it will be entered by an electronic data collection tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated 1: 1 to an intervention or non-intervention arm via a&#xD;
      computer-generated block randomization. The data assessor will be blinded to the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary outcome: changes in LS-PGA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in LS-PGA measurements from baseline to weeks 12 and from baseline to weeks 24, 36&#xD;
      and 48 will be compared between the two groups by linear mixed model for longitudinal data.&#xD;
      LS-PGA will be presented in box plots. As a sensitivity analysis on LS-PGA, the analysis will&#xD;
      be carried out excluding missing data and after 100 times multiple imputations by&#xD;
      multivariate normal regression on LS-PGA data, without included covariates in addition to&#xD;
      with an imputation including treatment, age, sex and smoking as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of secondary outcomes: Changes in DLQI and adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in DLQI measurements from baseline to weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 will be compared&#xD;
      between the two groups by linear mixed model for longitudinal data. DLQI will be presented in&#xD;
      box plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of adherence (by filled prescriptions, weight and patient reported), we will&#xD;
      dichotomize adherence rate with a selected cut-off of 80%, with adherence rates above 80%&#xD;
      considered adherent (a cut-off typically used when studying adherence in chronic diseases)&#xD;
      [7, 42]. We will compare the dichotomized adherences by using logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be conducted by an experienced statistician blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention. An interim analysis is not planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs will be presented as a total average cost totaling costs for psoriasis treatment&#xD;
      distributed on hospital costs, primary health care costs, and pharmaceutical costs. The costs&#xD;
      will be distributed on average total healthcare cost per patient in the non-intervention and&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cost-effectiveness analysis, average healthcare costs will be summarized per group as&#xD;
      total costs across all trajectories and divided by the total number of participants in each&#xD;
      group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for reduction in LS-PGA and DLQI will&#xD;
      be calculated by dividing the mean cost difference between the groups measured by the&#xD;
      difference in reduction of LS-PGA and DLQI from baseline to week 48. Dominance in the results&#xD;
      exists if one strategy is found to be both cheaper and more effective. It will improve&#xD;
      quality of the analysis, if the ICER reflects a minimal clinically importance difference&#xD;
      (MCID) in the DLQI and LS-PGA (that is, at least a two-point difference in the DLQI as well&#xD;
      as the LS-PGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trial-based economic evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and standard&#xD;
      care compared to standard care is planned. Main outcomes will be cost effectiveness based on&#xD;
      incremental cost per reduction in LS-PGA and cost-utility based on incremental cost per&#xD;
      reduction in DLQI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in total cost of treatment from a two-year period up until study inclusion to the&#xD;
      48-week treatment period will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will demonstrate whether an individualized, optimized patient support delivered by&#xD;
      doctors, nurses and pharmaconomists to dermatological patients can optimize the use of&#xD;
      topical treatment, reduce the severity of psoriasis and have socioeconomic benefits compared&#xD;
      to standard treatment. If the study shows that individualized and optimized patient support&#xD;
      is effective and has economic benefits, it is intended for the intervention to be implemented&#xD;
      in the clinic. In addition, we will work on implementing the intervention nationally by a&#xD;
      translational process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the study may also be referred to other chronic dermatological disorders. The&#xD;
      study may be used methodically as a model for additional research projects investigating&#xD;
      medical adherence in other chronic skin diseases.&#xD;
