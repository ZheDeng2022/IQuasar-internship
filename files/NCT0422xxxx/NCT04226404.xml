    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, controlled, open-label, parallel study to evaluate the&#xD;
      puffing patterns of healthy adult consumers of tobacco products switching from a usual brand&#xD;
      (UB) Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) product to an ENDS Investigational Product&#xD;
      (IP) product with 4.8% nicotine over a three-week ambulatory period. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in support of a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) ENDS submission to the&#xD;
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products (CTP).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will complete a pre-screening interview and a Screening Visit to assess&#xD;
      their eligibility and, based on meeting eligibility requirements, will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study on the same day of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, the subjects will be assigned to one of the seven flavor variants of ENDS&#xD;
      product. Subjects will be allowed to sample flavors and determine which flavor that they&#xD;
      would like to use for the length of the study. Subjects will then participate in a three-week&#xD;
      ambulatory study in which they will use their assigned IP in place of their UB ENDS. Subjects&#xD;
      will be directed to not use their UB ENDS products during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial visit, subjects will be provided an orientation to the product, including the&#xD;
      IP power unit, cartridges, the Product Use and Behavior (PUB) instrument, PUB application,&#xD;
      and a provided electronic device. Based upon their UB ENDS usage, they will be given a&#xD;
      sufficient amount (for three weeks of ad libitum use equaling 375% of their self-reported UB&#xD;
      weekly use) of ENDS cartridges. The study will involve a one-week acclimation period followed&#xD;
      by a two-week product use evaluation period. At the end of the first week of the study,&#xD;
      subjects will receive a phone call from the clinic to assess IP compliance and to ensure that&#xD;
      they are not using their UB ENDS. The PUB instrument will collect topography data, and&#xD;
      product use data will be uploaded frequently using a web-based PUB application installed on&#xD;
      the electronic device provided by the Sponsor. Throughout the study, subjects will receive&#xD;
      weekly phone calls to remind them of guidelines for using their assigned IP. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to use the IP in place of their UB ENDS, but they will be allowed to use non-ENDS&#xD;
      tobacco/nicotine-containing products according to their normal use pattern. All used&#xD;
      cartridges may be disposed of by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the three-week ambulatory period, subjects will return to the clinic;&#xD;
      return the IP power unit, charger, all unused cartridges, the PUB instrument (and all&#xD;
      cables/charger), and the provided electronic device. Each subject will complete all End of&#xD;
      Study procedures, including completing the Product Evaluation Scale (PES) questionnaire, and&#xD;
      they will then be discharged from the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Must have used 2 or more ENDS cartridges per week over the last 30 days. Brief periods&#xD;
             of abstinence due to illness, quit attempt (prior to 30 days of Screening), or&#xD;

             willing to keep both active for the length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must be willing to use an application on the provided electronic device, and keep the&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Scheduled treatment for asthma currently or within the past consecutive 12 months&#xD;
