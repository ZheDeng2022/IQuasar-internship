  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate physical activity intensity levels,&#xD;
      enjoyment, and pain perception during virtual reality (VR) active games in healthy young&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

      Enrolled participants will complete four sessions: the first session including the informed&#xD;
      consent process and one experimental game, and sessions 2-4 being devoted to one experimental&#xD;
      game per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and enrollment (Session 1 only): All participants will be asked to read and sign an&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form (ICF) and a copy of the ICF will be given to the participant to keep&#xD;
      for their records. Following the ICF process, participants will be given the Physical&#xD;
      Activity Readiness-Questionnaire Plus (2019 version), a demographic questionnaire, and the&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to fill out. Inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be assessed and eligibility will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarization of pain test and VR system (Session 1 only):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a familiarization with the pressure pain threshold (PPT) test to&#xD;
      measure pain sensitivity. The PPT test will be performed as practice on the participants'&#xD;
      non-dominant forearm and thigh three times. Following PPT familiarization, participants will&#xD;
      be shown the HTC Vive system, which includes a head-mounted display system and two handheld&#xD;
      controllers. The HTC Vive system comes with a tutorial program which exposes the user to the&#xD;
      basic functions of the VR system. Each participant will be fitted with the headset and follow&#xD;
      the tutorial for movement/system familiarization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol (All sessions): In each session participants will play one of the&#xD;
      following four virtual reality games: Beat Saber, Holopoint, Hot Squat, and Relax Walk. The&#xD;
      order of the games played in Sessions 1 - 4 will be randomized and counterbalanced. Following&#xD;
      the familiarization via the tutorial program (only Session 1), participants will be&#xD;
      introduced to one of the games (which will be randomized). A verbal description of the game&#xD;
      followed by a visual demonstration will be conducted by the researcher for the participant to&#xD;
      observe. The participant will then play the game for approximately 10 minutes for&#xD;
      familiarization. After 10 minutes, the participants will be asked to stop playing and sit in&#xD;
      a resting position to allow for a proper return to resting heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear accelerometers on the hip and arm to measure physical activity&#xD;
      behavior during game play. Participants will also wear heart rate monitors during game play.&#xD;
      The participants will then play the game for 15 minutes. Every 5 minutes the participant will&#xD;
      be asked to rate their exertion using the Borg 6-20 Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE)&#xD;
      scale. After 15 minutes of game play, the pressure pain thresholds will be administered on&#xD;
      the leg and forearm. The participant will then be allowed/assisted in removing the VR headset&#xD;
      and will be asked to rate their level of enjoyment using an 11-point Visual Analog Scale. The&#xD;
      next session will be scheduled with the participant. Session 1 is expected to last 1.5 hours&#xD;
      and sessions 2 through 4 will last approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
