  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the pilot study is to determine preliminary estimates of the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and comfort of a dexamethasone-eluting therapeutic contact lens drug delivery&#xD;
      system (TCL-DDS) for the treatment of recurrent cystoid macular edema. Secondarily,&#xD;
      feasibility of the TCL-DDS system will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety: To establish that a topical dexamethasone delivery system has an acceptable&#xD;
           safety profile by determining the incidence and severity of ocular adverse events, as&#xD;
           identified by eye examination through day 28 following treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comfort and tolerability: to establish the subject tolerability and comfort of the&#xD;
           TCL-DDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Feasibility: To establish- that a topical dexamethasone delivery system is a feasible&#xD;
           treatment for recurrent cystoid macular edema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study to assess safety and feasibility of delivering dexamethasone&#xD;
      through the TCL-DDS delivery system as a treatment for recurrent cystoid macular edema. The&#xD;
      study has two phases. The study begins with phase A, which is an open label study in that&#xD;
      will enroll up to 6 subject. The goal of this phase is to have 3 subjects complete the study.&#xD;
      The enrollment number is 6 in order to accommodate for withdraws and/or terminations (for&#xD;
      reasons other than adverse event to the study intervention and include loss of the lens&#xD;
      before 7 days). Subjects will wear the TCL-DDS in one eye for one week during which time they&#xD;
      will be closely followed with examinations at 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days.&#xD;
      After the TCL-DDS is removed after 7 days of wear, the subjects will be followed with weekly&#xD;
      examinations for 3 additional weeks for evaluation of safety. If the TCL-DDS is found to be&#xD;
      safe after review of the clinical data by monitoring board, phase B will be initiated that&#xD;
      will study the safety and effectiveness of delivering dexamethasone through the TCL-DDS. This&#xD;
      clinical trials submission only relates to phase A of the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase A, a commercial contact lens (Kontur Kontact Lens, Hercules, CA) that has the&#xD;
      same dimensions and thickness (16.0 mm diameter and 8.6 mm base curve) as the TCL-DDS will be&#xD;
      placed on the study eye and worn for a 1 hour run-in period. This run in period will be used&#xD;
      to help identify subjects who can tolerate a contact lens with the same dimensions and&#xD;
      parameters as the TCL-DDS. Those subjects that cannot wear the commercial contact lens due to&#xD;
      problems with fitting of the lens, comfort, or other reasons will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      We will evaluate comfort and examine the eye for signs of ocular irritation and inflammation,&#xD;
      which may include slit lamp findings of conjunctiva redness, the pattern of any conjunctiva&#xD;
      redness, anterior chamber reaction, discharge, and pupillary dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the contact lens is worn comfortably without signs of ocular irritation, then the&#xD;
      commercial lens will be removed and replaced with a TCL-DDS. The eye will be examined at 1&#xD;
      hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days. We will evaluate comfort and examine the eyes&#xD;
      for signs of ocular irritation by slit lamp examination. In addition, we will check&#xD;
      intraocular pressure on day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye will be assessed again at Day 14, 21, and 28. During the examinations, the study eyes&#xD;
      will have the intraocular pressure measured and will be evaluated by slit lamp examination&#xD;
      for associated adverse events to determine the safety of the TCL-DDS. Phone call assessments&#xD;
      in place of scheduled clinic visits will be completed on Day 2 and Day 4 for safety checks.&#xD;
      Information on adverse events will be collected at each study visit, including phone visits,&#xD;
      from screening to Day 28. The subject will then attend a final follow up evaluation visit at&#xD;
      Day 28 that will conclude the subject's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 3 subject s (up to 6 subjects enrolled) in Phase A complete their day 28&#xD;
      visit, and it is determined that the TCL-DDS is safe and well tolerated, 15 additional&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled into Phase B of the study.&#xD;
