      Aim of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect data for a new image-guided diagnostic algoritm, enabling the investigators to&#xD;
      differentiate more precisely between benign and malignant pigmented tumours at the bedside.&#xD;
      This study will include 60 patients with four different pigmented tumours: seborrheic&#xD;
      keratosis (n=15), dermal nevi (n=15), pigmented basal cell carcinomas (n=15), and malignant&#xD;
      melanomas (n=15), these four types of tumours are depicted in Fig.1, and all lesions will be&#xD;
      scanned by four imaging technologies, recruiting patients from Sept 2019 to May 2020. In vivo&#xD;
      reflectance confocal microscopy (CM) will be used to diagnose pigmented tumours at a cellular&#xD;
      level and provide micromorphological information5;6. Flourescent CM will be applied to&#xD;
      enhance contrast in surrounding tissue/tumours. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), doppler&#xD;
      high-frequency ultrasound (HIFU) and photoacustic imaging (also termed MSOT, multispectral&#xD;
      optoacustic tomography) will be used to measure tumour thickness, to delineate tumours and&#xD;
      analyze blood flow in blood vessels. Potential diagnostic features from each lesion type will&#xD;
      be tested. Diagnostic accuracy will be statistically evaluated by comparison to gold standard&#xD;
      histopathology&#xD;

      Study design The prospective non-blinded clinical study will include with seborrheic&#xD;
      keratosis (n=15), dermal nevi (n=15), pigmented or dark basal cell carcinomas (n=15), and&#xD;
      malignant melanomas (n=15) referred to or diagnosed at Dept. of Dermatology, Bispebjerg&#xD;
      Hospital. All tumours are histologically verified by skin biopsy. To explore clinical&#xD;
      feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of four different skin imaging technologies all patients&#xD;
      will be scanned by an experienced examiner in one 2-hour session. If patients demonstrate&#xD;
      more than one skin tumour within the same anatomical location, all lesions will be included&#xD;
      and scanned. Lesions in other anatomical areas of the same patient will not be included. The&#xD;
      total extra time spend in the department to participate in this study will be approximately&#xD;
      2-3 hours for each patient. Only one visit is required to participate. The skin tumors in&#xD;
      patients enrolled will subsequently be treated according to hospital and national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: A bedside examination of a skin tumours using advanced imaging technology is&#xD;
      considered a valuable future tool for Dermatologists. The investigators vision is to provide&#xD;
      image guided skin cancer therapy to all patients with skin tumours. This study compares&#xD;
      clinical feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of four different imaging technologies applied&#xD;
      in a fast-track bedside analysis of various skin tumours; four different types, 2 benign and&#xD;
      2 malignant types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Due to higher resolution UHR-OCT may have higher diagnostic accuracy than C-OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doppler HIFU and optoacustic imaging diagnosis may be more accurate in skin tumours&#xD;
           thicker than 1-2 mm compared to diagnosis based on OCT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cellular resolution of RCM and the detailed blood flow information acquired from&#xD;
           photoacustic imaging may supplement clinical decision making and increase diagnostic&#xD;
           accuracy compared to only OCT or only HIFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study explores the clinical utility of four skin imaging technologies: scanning time,&#xD;
      clinical feasibility (does the skin tumour fit into the scanning probe) and diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy. The investigators examine patients with four different common skin tumour types&#xD;
      referred to Dept of Dermatology, BFH using four different advanced imaging technologies; five&#xD;
      different tools as investigators apply two different OCT-systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure diagnostic accuracy of index tests (OCT, RCM, HIFU and photoacoustic imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure tumor size by OCT, photoacoustic imaging and HIFU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore if UHR-OCT detects features in tumors that C-OCT cannot detect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore if information from dynamic C-OCT images of dermal blood vessels inside the&#xD;
           skin tumour increases diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore if information from doppler ultrasound images of dermal vessels inside the&#xD;
           tumour increases diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore if information from photoacoustic imaging of dermal vessels inside the tumour&#xD;
           increases diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report potential decreased time delay from first visit to efficient skin cancer&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To record survival rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To record treatment types and number of therapeutic sessions (e.g. operations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report potential adverse device events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report patient satisfaction of scanning procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of skin tumours All skin tumours will be evaluated clinically, by two different&#xD;
      OCT systems (C-OCT and UHR-OCT), by RCM, by photoacoustic imaging and doppler HIFU. Skin&#xD;
      biopsies will be performed according to standard hospital procedures. Skin punch biopsies&#xD;
      from skin tumours are required for treatment planning and is not part of this research&#xD;
      project. Accordingly, a skin biopsy will be performed as part of the treatment plan&#xD;
      independent of whether the patient is recruited or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Technologies In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (CM) will be used to diagnose&#xD;
      pigmented tumours at a cellular level and provide micromorphological information5;6.&#xD;
      Flourescent CM will be applied to enhance contrast in surrounding tissue/tumours. Optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT), doppler high-frequency ultrasound (HIFU) and photoacustic imaging&#xD;
      (also termed MSOT, multispectral optoacustic tomography) will be used to measure tumour&#xD;
      thickness, to delineate tumours and analyze blood flow in blood vessels. Potential diagnostic&#xD;
      features from lesion types will be tested. Diagnostic accuracy will be statistically&#xD;
      evaluated by comparison to gold standard histopathology The imaging methods OCT, RCM and&#xD;
      doppler ultrasound, are technologies that are routinely used in the clinic at Dept of&#xD;
      Dermatology, BFH and all investigators are highly trained in using the scanners. The UHR-OCT&#xD;
      is a prototype and the photoacoustic system is a brand-new clinical device. OCT, RCM and&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations are performed in a darkened room. The images of all patients will be&#xD;
      saved in a digital archiving computer system for subsequent scoring and further evaluation.&#xD;
