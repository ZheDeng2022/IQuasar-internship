  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Bladder cancer is the ninth most common type of cancer worldwide. In the past,&#xD;
      Radical Cystectomy via open surgery has been considered the gold-standard treatment for&#xD;
      muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, in recent years there has been a progressive&#xD;
      increase in the use of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy surgery. The aim of the&#xD;
      current project is to investigate the surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes of&#xD;
      patients with bladder cancer who undergo radical cystectomy surgery comparing three different&#xD;
      surgical techniques (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgery). Pre-, peri- and&#xD;
      post-operative factors will be examined, and participants will be followed for a period of up&#xD;
      to 24 months to identify risks of mortality, oncological outcomes, hospital readmission,&#xD;
      sexual performance, and continence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study is an observational, prospective, multicenter, cohort study to assess&#xD;
      patients affected by bladder neoplasms undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion.&#xD;
      The Italian Radical Cystectomy Registry is an electronic registry to prospectively collect&#xD;
      the data of patients undergoing Radical Cystectomy conducted with any technique (open,&#xD;
      laparoscopic, robotic-assisted). Twenty-eight urology departments across Italy will provide&#xD;
      data for the study, with recruitment phase between 1st January 2017-31st June 2020).&#xD;
      Information is collected from the patients at the moment of surgical intervention and during&#xD;
      follow-up (3, 6, 12, and 24 months after radical cystectomy surgery). Peri-operative&#xD;
      variables include surgery time, type of urinary diversion, conversion to open surgery,&#xD;
      bleeding, nerves sparing and lymphadenectomy. Follow-up data collection includes histological&#xD;
      information (e.g., post-op staging, grading and tumor histology), short- and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., mortality, post-op complications, hospital readmission, sexual potency,&#xD;
      continence etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The current protocol aims to contribute additional data to the field concerning&#xD;
      the short- and long-term outcomes of three different radical cystectomy surgical techniques&#xD;
      for patients with bladder cancer, including open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted. This is a&#xD;
      comparative-effectiveness trial that takes into account a complex range of factors and&#xD;
      decision making by both physicians and patients that affect their choice of surgical&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;

      The aim of the project is to investigate the surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes&#xD;
      of patients with bladder cancer who undergo radical cystectomy surgery comparing three&#xD;
      different surgical techniques (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgery). Pre-, peri-&#xD;
      and post-operative factors will be examined, and participants will be followed for a period&#xD;
      of up to 24 months to identify risks of mortality, oncological outcomes, hospital&#xD;
      readmission, sexual performance, and continence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-eight participating centers across Italy will provide data for the study: Urology&#xD;
      Clinic, University of Bologna; Department of Urology, AOU Careggi, Florence; European&#xD;
      Institute of Oncology Milan; San Raffaele Hospital, Milan; University Hospital of Verona;&#xD;
      Department of Urology, Policlinico Abano; Department of Urology, Spedali Civili, Brescia;&#xD;
      Department of Urology and Kidney Transplantation, University of Foggia, Foggia; Galliera&#xD;
      Hospital, Genova; ASST Niguarda Metropolitan Hospital, Niguarda; Policlinico Umberto I,&#xD;
      Saproma; Department of Clinical Urology, University of Perugia; Department of Clinical&#xD;
      Urology, AOUP Cisanello Hospital, Pisa; Department of Clinical Urology, Palermo University,&#xD;
      Palermo; Department of Clinical Urology, Alessandria Hospital, Alessandria; Department of&#xD;
      Clinical Urology, ASST Mantova, Mantova; Department of Clinical Urology, ASL Abruzzo;&#xD;
      Department of Clinical Urology Ca Foncello Hospital, Treviso; Department of Clinical Urology&#xD;
      II, Bari University, Bari; Department of Clinical Urology, Vittorio Emanuele Hospital,&#xD;
      Catania; Department of Clinical Urology, Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, Sgrotondo; Hospital&#xD;
      Bassiano, Bassano; Department of Clinical Urology, Hospital San Francesco ASL 3, Nuoro;&#xD;
      Department of Clinical Urology, Portogruaro; Department of Clinical Urology, Biella Hospital,&#xD;
      Biella; Department of Clinical Urology Chioggia Hospital; Ausl Modena; Department of Urology&#xD;
      and Kidney Transplantation, Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli Grand Metropolitan Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are: 1) male and female consecutively recruited patients; 2) age ≥18&#xD;
      years; 3) histologically confirmed diagnosis of bladder cancer eligible for radical&#xD;
      cystectomy surgery at date of enrollment; 4) providing written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-surgery, data will be taken directly from&#xD;
      the patients at their follow-up medical visits and entered into the online database. The&#xD;
      physician identifying and recruiting patients is in charge of completing the data collection&#xD;
      forms during follow-up, even if the patient is subsequently treated in another center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables of interest include demographic variables (age, sex, etc), surgical factors&#xD;
      (technique use, length of surgery, blood loss, type of urinary diversion, node burden,&#xD;
      histological exams, surgical margins etc), mortality, morbidity (pre-, during- and&#xD;
      post-surgery), oncological results, and functioning (continence and sexual performance) over&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
