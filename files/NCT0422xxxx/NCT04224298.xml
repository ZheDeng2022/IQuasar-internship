    <textblock>
      Based on the theory of traditional Chinese Medicine, this study collects eye features of&#xD;
      white eyes through the White Eye Imaging Health Care System under visible light and&#xD;
      establishes a database of eye-eye features corresponding to the disease. The computer image&#xD;
      analysis and artificial intelligence technology are used to visualize the eye. The features&#xD;
      were extracted and classified, and the corresponding changes in the characteristics of the&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine and the disease were analyzed statistically to establish an&#xD;
      analytical model corresponding to the disease.&#xD;

      1. Collecting the white-eyed eye features of 500 patients with malignant tumors and 500&#xD;
           non-tumor patients by the white-eye shadowless imaging acquisition system under visible&#xD;
           light, and establishing eye-catching images of malignant tumor patients and healthy&#xD;
           people of different diseases. Feature database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Based on the collected four-dimensional eye-eye diagram, using computer image analysis&#xD;
           and artificial intelligence technology to extract and classify the eye-eye features of&#xD;
           the white eye, and statistically analyze the correlation between the eye-eye features&#xD;
           and the malignant tumor. The relationship between the characteristics of the white eye&#xD;
           and the corresponding change of malignant tumor.&#xD;
