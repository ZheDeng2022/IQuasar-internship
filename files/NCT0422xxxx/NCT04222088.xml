      1. BACKGROUND In 2002, the Philippines changed its antimalarial drug policy to the&#xD;
           combination treatment, CQ+ Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as 1st-line treatment and&#xD;
           artemether-lumefantrine as 2nd-line treatment. The Department of Health (DOH) prescribed&#xD;
           the use of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) combination as the second line drug, limiting&#xD;
           its use only in the treatment of confirmed Plasmodium falciparum, until further study on&#xD;
           its efficacy were done before making it as the first line treatment. Consequently, AL&#xD;
           became the first-line drug for falciparum malaria in the 2009 revised drug policy. The&#xD;
           DOH in the past 6 years (2002-2007) adopted the use of AL in the highly endemic areas of&#xD;
           the country and conducted therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) in 3 sentinel sites:&#xD;
           Kalinga-Isabela, Palawan and several Mindanao provinces, showing 97-100% efficacy.&#xD;
           Whereas, CQ+SP showed variability and declining efficacy, results ranged from 70%-95%&#xD;
           (CARAGA region). In Sultan Kudarat province, results in 2006-2007 showed 90% efficacy of&#xD;
           CQ+SP and 96% for AL for falciparum malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the 2018 drug policy, chloroquine was replaced by artemether-lumefantrine as the&#xD;
           primary treatment for P. vivax (Pv) malaria, with primaquine as anti-relapse drug. The&#xD;
           last TES of AL as firstline drug of choice for falciparum malaria was made in 2017 and&#xD;
           this will be the first time that AL will be assessed as treatment for uncomplicated&#xD;
           vivax malaria. Monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy through molecular analysis of&#xD;
           known drug resistance associated genes can also provide complementary information.&#xD;
           Previous analysis of drug resistance markers for CQ, SP and artemisinin (pfcrt, pfdhps,&#xD;
           pfdhfr, pfmdr1, Kelch13 for Pf, and pvcrt, pvmdr, pvdhps, pvdhfr for Pv) of Philippine&#xD;
           TES samples revealed variations in genotypes that can be assessed in relation to TES&#xD;
           clinical outcomes. These information are relevant baseline information that have future&#xD;
           use in determining parasite lineage during post malaria-elimination status, in addition&#xD;
           to the crucial monitoring for drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The results of this study will be used to assist the Department of Health of Philippines&#xD;
           in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum&#xD;
           and P. vivax malaria, and to update the policy if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES The general objective of this study is to assess the therapeutic efficacy and&#xD;
           safety artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum&#xD;
           infections and of P. vivax infections in the Philippines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To measure the clinical and parasitological efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL)&#xD;
           among patients aged between &gt; 6 months and 59 years old suffering from uncomplicated&#xD;
           falciparum malaria, by determining the proportion of patients with Early Treatment&#xD;
           Failure (ETF), Late Clinical Failure (LTF), Late Parasitological Failure (LPF), or with&#xD;
           an Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR) as indicators of efficacy; To&#xD;
           measure the clinical and parasitological efficacy of Chloroquine among patients aged&#xD;
           between &gt; 6 months and 59 years old suffering from uncomplicated vivax malaria, by&#xD;
           determining the proportion of patients with Early Treatment Failure (ETF), Late Clinical&#xD;
           Failure (LTF), Late Parasitological Failure (LPF), or with an Adequate Clinical and&#xD;
           Parasitological Response (ACPR) as indicators of efficacy; To differentiate&#xD;
           recrudescences from new infections by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the incidence of adverse events; To formulate recommendations to enable the&#xD;
           Department of Health to make informed decisions about the possible need for updating of&#xD;
           the current national antimalarial treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The exploratory objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine the polymorphism of molecular markers for artemether-lumefantrine and&#xD;
           chloroquine resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLANNING 3.1. Study Design The design of this surveillance study is a&#xD;
           one-arm, prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological response to directly&#xD;
           observed treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria and vivax malaria. Individuals&#xD;
           with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled,&#xD;
           treated on site with AL and monitored for a period of 28 days if they have falciparum&#xD;
           malaria, and with chloroquine if with vivax malaria for a period of 34 days. The&#xD;
           follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical&#xD;
           and laboratory examinations. Study patients will be classified as therapeutic failures&#xD;
           (early or late) or adequate responders based on the results of these assessments. The&#xD;
           proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the follow-up period will&#xD;
           be used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug(s). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)&#xD;
           analysis will help distinguish between a true recrudescence due to treatment failure and&#xD;
           episodes of reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Study site The study site will be conducted in the Rural Health Unit in selected&#xD;
           municipalities of Palawan. Several factors influenced the selection of sites were:&#xD;
           adequate numbers of patients with symptomatic, uncomplicated P. falciparum or P. vivax&#xD;
           malaria; willingness and availability of the selected health care facility staff to&#xD;
           participate in the surveillance study and to support the work with laboratory space;&#xD;
           access of patients to the health facility for weekly follow-ups; availability of the&#xD;
           Municipality Health Officer (MHO), the nurse and a trained Medical Technologist to take&#xD;
           responsibility for conducting the study, and security.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3. Timing and duration of study The study will be conducted from September 2019 to&#xD;
           September 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.4. Study population The study population will consists of patients aged between &gt; 6&#xD;
           months to 59 years old diagnosed with uncomplicated falciparum and vivax malaria&#xD;

           have given an informed consent for study inclusion and assent in children as&#xD;
           appropriate. All adult patients who are 18 years, age of majority in this country, will&#xD;
           sign an informed consent form for participation. Parents or guardians will give informed&#xD;
           consent on behalf of children who have not reached 18 years of age. Children aged 12 to&#xD;
           17 years old will be required to consent for participation by signing an informed assent&#xD;
           form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.5. Inclusion criteria Above 6 months old to 59 years old;&#xD;

&#xD;
           3.6. Exclusion criteria Presence of general danger signs among children &lt;5 years old or&#xD;
           other signs of severe and complicated falciparum malaria according to World Health&#xD;
           Organization (WHO) definitions; Severe malnutrition Mixed Plasmodium species detected by&#xD;
           microscopy; Presence of severe malnutrition (defined as a child whose weight-for-height&#xD;
           is below -3 standard deviation or less than 70% of the median of the National Center for&#xD;
           Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO normalized reference values, or who has symmetrical oedema&#xD;
           involving at least the feet or who has a Mid Upper Arm Circumference Mid-Upper arm&#xD;
           circumference [MUAC] &lt;110 mm); Presence of febrile conditions due to diseases other than&#xD;
           malaria (measles, acute lower tract respiratory infection, severe diarrhea with&#xD;
           dehydration, etc.), or other known underlying chronic or severe diseases (e.g. cardiac,&#xD;
           renal, hepatic diseases, HIV/AIDS); Regular medication, which may interfere with&#xD;
           antimalarial pharmacokinetics; History of hypersensitivity reactions or&#xD;

           Positive pregnancy test or breastfeeding; and Unable to or unwilling to take pregnancy&#xD;
           test or to use contraception for women or child-bearing age and who are sexually active.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.7. Loss to follow-up Loss to follow-up occurs when, despite all reasonable efforts&#xD;
           within 48 hrs period of the visit, an enrolled patient that does not attend the&#xD;
           scheduled visits cannot be found. No treatment outcome will be assigned to these&#xD;
           patients. These patients will be classified as lost to follow-up and excluded from the&#xD;
           per protocol analysis. Patients who are lost to follow-up, but who subsequently come&#xD;
           back to the study site before day 28 for participants with Plasmodium falciparum and&#xD;
           before day 34 for Plasmodium vivax participants, will not be turned away and will also&#xD;
           be encouraged to return for check-up visits. Nevertheless, these patients will also be&#xD;
           classified as lost to follow-up. Every effort must be made to schedule a follow-up visit&#xD;
           for patients who fail to return to the study site especially during or but also after&#xD;
           administration of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.8. Patient discontinuation or protocol violation Study patients meeting any of the&#xD;
           following criteria classified as withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Withdrawal of consent A patient may withdraw consent at any time, without prejudice for&#xD;
           further follow up or treatment by the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Failure to complete the treatment due to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Persistent vomiting of the treatment. A patient who vomits twice study medication will&#xD;
           be withdrawn from the study and given rescue treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Failure to attend the scheduled visits during the first 3 days; Serious adverse events&#xD;
           necessitating termination of the treatment before the full course of the treatment is&#xD;
           completed. A patient can be discontinued from the study if the principal investigator&#xD;
           decides that a patient should be withdrawn for safety reasons due to an adverse event of&#xD;
           such a nature or intensity to recommend withdrawal from the study. In this case,&#xD;
           information concerning the adverse event and symptomatic treatment given must be&#xD;
           recorded on the case record form (CRF). If the adverse event is serious, the principal&#xD;
           investigator must notify the sponsor or its designee immediately and the reporting&#xD;
           procedures described in the safety section must be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Enrolment Violation Severe malaria on Day 0; Erroneous inclusion of patient who does not&#xD;
           meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Voluntary protocol violation Self or third party administration of antimalarial (or&#xD;
           antibiotics with antimalarial activity) (see Annex 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Involuntary protocol violation Severe malaria occurring on Day 0 Occurrence during the&#xD;
           follow-up of concomitant disease that would interfere with a clear classification of the&#xD;
           treatment outcome Detection of another malaria species during the follow-up Erroneous&#xD;
           inclusion of a patient who do not meet the inclusion criteria Misclassification of a&#xD;
           patient due to a laboratory error (parasitaemia) leading to the administration of the&#xD;
           rescue treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who are withdrawn will nevertheless be follow-up until day 28 for Plasmodium&#xD;
           falciparum and until day 34 for Plasmodium vivax or until recovery, if possible.&#xD;
           However, no treatment outcome will be assigned to these patients and excluded from the&#xD;
           per protocol analysis. The reason for discontinuation or protocol violation will always&#xD;
           be recorded on the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. TREATMENT 4.1. Antimalarial treatment P. falciparum: artemether-lumefantrine will be&#xD;
           administered for 3 days according to body weight (Days 0, 1 and 2). Correct drug dosage&#xD;
           will be determined using the dosing chart (in accordance with national treatment&#xD;
           guidelines, details provided in Annex 3). Primaquine 0.75 mg/kg body weight single dose&#xD;
           will be given on Day 3 (in accordance with national treatment guidelines, details&#xD;
           provided in Annex 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           P. vivax: Chloroquine will be administered according to body weight at a total dose of&#xD;
           25mg base/kg over 3 days (10mg base/kg on Day 0; 10mg base/kg on Day 1 and 5mg base/kg&#xD;
           on Day 2) Primaquine will be withheld for 28 days. It will be given after Day 28&#xD;
           follow-up, at 0.25 mg base/kg per day for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quinine, doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin and primaquine (15 mg base per tablet)&#xD;
           as well as other anti-malarial drugs for rescue treatment will be sourced from the&#xD;
           Department of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All doses of drugs including rescue treatment will be administered under the supervision&#xD;
           of Municipal Health Officer and Public Health Nurse, and/ or Project Staff Nurse&#xD;
           designated by the principal investigator. Study patients will be observed for 30 minutes&#xD;
           after drug administration for adverse reactions or vomiting. Any patient who vomits&#xD;
           during this observation period will be retreated with the same dose of drug and observed&#xD;
           for an additional 30 minutes. If the patient vomits again he/she will be withdrawn and&#xD;
           offered rescue therapy. The study patients will be required to return to Rural health&#xD;
           unit (RHU) for each dosing dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2. Concomitant treatments and forbidden medication Treatment of fever over 38 °C is&#xD;
           permitted with paracetamol or acetaminophen. Parents/guardians will be instructed in the&#xD;
           use of tepid sponging for children &lt;5 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior treatment with antimalarial drugs will not be considered as an exclusion&#xD;
           criterion. But, during the follow-up, if infections other than malaria require the&#xD;
           administration of drugs with antimalarial activity, the patient will be withdrawn from&#xD;
           the study. Patients given tetracycline as eye ointment will not be excluded (see Annex&#xD;
           2). Similarly, patients will be withdrawn from the study in case of self-medication or&#xD;
           if an antimalarial drug or antibiotics with antimalarial activity is administered by a&#xD;
           third party.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse events requiring treatment will be checked and treated by the municipal heath&#xD;
           officer and inform Principal Investigator within 24 hours of occurrence of the event.&#xD;
           Should there be a clinical indication for any additional medication during the course of&#xD;
           the study including medication given to treat an adverse event related to the study&#xD;
           drug, the name of the drug, the dosage, and the date and time of administration must be&#xD;
           recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3. Rescue treatment If the patient vomits twice he/she will receive parenteral therapy&#xD;
           with quinine at 10mg/kg bw every 8 hours for 2-3 days, followed by AL for 3 days when&#xD;
           he/she can tolerate oral meds, and he/she will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For any sign of severe Pf or Pv malaria, the study patient will be hospitalized and&#xD;
           receive parenteral therapy with Quinine at 10mg/kg bw every 8 hours for 2-3 days,&#xD;
           followed by AL for 3 days, as well as relevant supportive treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a patient meets one of the criteria for therapeutic failure, he/she will receive oral&#xD;
           Quinine at 10mg/kg bw every 8 hours for 7 days, in combination with tetracycline (250 mg&#xD;
           4x/ day for 7 days), clindamycin (10 mg/kg twice a day for 7 days) or doxycycline (3&#xD;
           mg/kg once a day for 7 days) for Pf patients and Pv patients + Primaquine for 14 days&#xD;
           for Pv patients, according to the current national recommendations. If the patient is&#xD;
           re-infected with another malaria species he/she will receive treatment according to the&#xD;
           current national recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluation criteria Valid end-points of the study include completion of the follow-up&#xD;
           period without treatment failure, treatment failure, and loss to follow-up, and&#xD;
           withdrawal from study (voluntary or involuntary, and voluntary or involuntary protocol&#xD;
           violation). At all times, the well-being of the study patient will take priority over&#xD;
           the continuation of the involvement of that patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1. Efficacy and safety evaluation 5.1.1. Classification of treatment outcomes The&#xD;
           classification of treatment outcomes will be based on an assessment of the&#xD;
           parasitological and clinical outcome of antimalarial treatment according to the latest&#xD;
           guidelines of WHO. Accordingly, all patients will be classified as having an Early&#xD;
           Treatment Failure, a Late Clinical Failure, a Late Parasitological Failure, or an&#xD;
           Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response, as defined in Annex 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As parasitological cure is the goal of antimalarial therapy, all study subjects who&#xD;
           present with a treatment failure will be treated with the rescue treatment and dropped&#xD;
           from further follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2. Clinical evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical evaluations will be undertaken in all patients using the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.1. Physical Examination A standard physical examination will be performed at&#xD;
           baseline (Day 0 pre-dose) as well as on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28. A complete medical&#xD;
           history, demography and location of contact address and details will be taken at&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.2. Weighing and presence of edema Body weight will be recorded at day 0. Weight will&#xD;
           be measured at to the nearest kg on a Salter scale or some other hanging scale for&#xD;
           weighing young children properly calibrated with only undergarments kept on the patient.&#xD;
           The screening weight will be used to satisfy the inclusion/exclusion for nutrition&#xD;
           status as well as to calculate the dose (number of tablets) to be administered. The&#xD;
           reliability of scales will be verified using known standard weights prior to&#xD;
           commencement of study and will be checked at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MUAC will be measured on the left arm, at the mid-point between the elbow and the&#xD;
           shoulder and will be recorded to the nearest 0.2 cm. Edema will be assessed by thumb&#xD;
           pressure for 3 seconds on the dorsal part of both feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.3. Measurement of body temperature Axillary temperature will be performed at&#xD;
           baseline (Day 0 pre-dose) as well as on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21,and 28. Temperature will&#xD;
           be measured using a thermometer with a precision of 0.1°C. Temperature will additionally&#xD;
           be measured as clinically indicated. If the result is &lt;36.0°C, the measurement will be&#xD;
           repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quality of temperature-taking technique and thermometers should be regularly tested in a&#xD;
           water-bath of known temperature prior to study commencement and at regular intervals&#xD;
           during study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.4. Microscopic blood examination A pair of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films&#xD;
           will be obtained from each patient and examined at a magnification of 1000x to identify&#xD;
           parasite species and to determine the level of parasitemia at screening on Day 0 to&#xD;
           confirm inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thick and thin blood films will be also examined&#xD;
           on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 or on any other day if the patient spontaneously&#xD;
           returns and parasitological reassessment is required. Specimens will be labelled&#xD;
           anonymously (study number, day of follow-up, date taken). The other pair of blood film&#xD;
           will be kept in a separate box as back-up blood films. The study number of the patient,&#xD;
           the date and day of follow-up will be recorded on the frosted edge of the slide.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The second blood smear (Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28,) will be used to calculate&#xD;
           the parasite density, by counting the number of asexual parasites in a set number of&#xD;
           white blood cells (typically 200) with a hand tally counter. Once a field has been&#xD;
           started, it must be counted to completion; the final number of white blood cells will&#xD;
           therefore rarely be exactly 200. If more than 500 parasites have been counted before 200&#xD;
           white blood cells have been reached, the count will be stopped after the reading of the&#xD;
           last field has been completed. Parasite density, expressed as the number of asexual&#xD;
           parasites per µl of blood, will be calculated by dividing the number of asexual&#xD;
           parasites by the number of white blood cells counted and then multiplying by an assumed&#xD;
           white blood cell density (typically 6000 per µl).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The same technique will be used to establish the parasite count on each subsequent blood&#xD;
           film. When the number of asexual parasites is less than 100 per 200 white blood cells in&#xD;
           follow-up smears, counting will be done against at least 500 white blood cells (i.e. to&#xD;
           completion of the field in which the 500th white blood cell is counted).&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.5. Genotyping of malaria parasites In order to differentiate a recrudescence (same&#xD;
           parasite strain) from a newly acquired infection (different parasite strain), a&#xD;
           genotypic analysis based on the extensive genetic diversity displayed by the malaria&#xD;
           parasite genes, msp1, msp2 and glurp will be performed. Genotypic profiles of the pre-&#xD;
           and post parasite strains will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.6. Pregnancy test Female patients of child-bearing age (≥ 12 years), defined as&#xD;
           those who menstruate and who are sexually active, will be asked to take a urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test before enrolment in the study, because name of the antimalarial drug(s)&#xD;
           or drug combination(s) is contraindicated during the first trimester. They will also be&#xD;
           asked to take a urine pregnancy test on day 28 or on early withdrawal from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.7. Haematological assessment Hemoglobin will be determined at Day 0, Day 3, Day 7,&#xD;
           Day 14 (optional) follow-up among patients enrolled in the Pf study and on Day 0, Day 3,&#xD;
           Day 7, Day 14 (optional), Day 28, Day 31, and Day 34 among enrolled Pv patients using&#xD;
           the Hemocue method, requiring 60 ul from a finger-prick blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3. Safety assessment Safety will be assessed by recording the nature and incidence of&#xD;
           adverse events and serious adverse events. Adverse events will be assessed by direct&#xD;
           questioning. An adverse event is defined as any unfavourable, unintended sign, symptom,&#xD;
           syndrome or disease that develops or worsens with the use of a medicinal product,&#xD;
           regardless of whether it is related to the medicinal product. All adverse events must be&#xD;
           recorded on the case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS 6.1. Screening and enrolment procedures All patients meeting the basic&#xD;
           enrolment criteria (age, fever or history of fever, presence of symptoms of malaria,&#xD;
           absence of signs of severe malaria, absence of severe malnutrition, pregnancy, etc)&#xD;
           during the screening procedure will be assigned a consecutive screening number and&#xD;
           evaluated in greater depth by clinical staff. Special care will be taken to detect the&#xD;
           presence or early signs of febrile diseases other than malaria, as these will probably&#xD;
           necessitate exclusion of the patient from the evaluation. Among paediatric populations,&#xD;
           the most frequent confounding condition is lower respiratory tract infections: cough or&#xD;
           difficult breathing, together with fast breathing, is an indicator for identifying and&#xD;
           excluding patients suffering from such conditions. Fast breathing is defined as a&#xD;
           respiratory frequency &gt;50/minute in infants under 12 months of age and &gt;40/minute in&#xD;
           children aged 12-59 months. Other relatively common febrile conditions are otitis media,&#xD;
           tonsillitis, measles and abscesses. Patients with these conditions will not be enrolled,&#xD;
           but obviously need to be treated both for malaria (if they have parasitaemia) and the&#xD;
           other infection as appropriate. Patients will be screened and enrolled at the Rural&#xD;
           Health Unit and required to return for follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2. Follow-up procedure Patients meeting all enrolment criteria will be given a&#xD;
           personal identification number and receive treatment only after they have had the study&#xD;
           fully explained to them and have willingly provided their informed consent. Any subject&#xD;
           who decides not to participate in the study will be examined and treated by the health&#xD;
           facility staff as usual. They will be treated and followed-up according to the standard&#xD;
           of care established by the Department of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The day that the patient is enrolled and receives the first dose of drugs is designated&#xD;
           as &quot;day 0&quot;. All antimalarial treatment will be given by a study team member under&#xD;
           supervision. Enrolled patients will be observed for at least 30 minutes after treatment&#xD;
           to ensure that they do not vomit the medicine. If vomiting occurs within 30 minutes of&#xD;
           treatment, the full treatment dose will be repeated. Ancillary treatments, such as&#xD;
           antipyretics, may be required and will be provided to patients by the study team and&#xD;
           documented on the CRF. Patients with persistent vomiting (i.e. necessitating more than a&#xD;
           single repeat dose) will be excluded from the study and immediately referred to the&#xD;
           health facility staff for appropriate management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. DATA MANAGEMENT The principal investigator will ensure that the study protocol is&#xD;
           strictly adhered to throughout, and that all data are collected and recorded correctly&#xD;
           on the CRF. Laboratory and clinical data will be recorded on a daily basis in the CRF&#xD;
           designed for the study. Data that are derived from source documents should be consistent&#xD;
           with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained. Any change or&#xD;
           correction to a CRF should be dated, and explained and should not obscure the original&#xD;
           entry. All CRF will be checked for completeness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the study has been completed, data will be entered onto a database using double&#xD;
           independent data entry. The data will be stored in a computer database maintaining&#xD;
           confidentiality in accordance with the national data legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The principal investigator is responsible for keeping all the screening forms, the CRF&#xD;
           and the completed subject identification code list in a secure location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. STATISTICAL METHODS 8.1. Minimum sample size Treatment failure to AL in the area being&#xD;
           0-5 %, 5% has been chosen as the estimated therapeutic failure rate of the drug. At a&#xD;
           confidence level of 95% and with a precision around the estimate of 10%, 18 patients&#xD;
           will be needed. With a 20% increase to allow losses to follow-up and withdrawals during&#xD;
           the 28-day follow-up period, 22 patients need to be included. But in order for the&#xD;
           sample to be representative, a minimum of 50 P. falciparum and 50 P.vivax patients need&#xD;
           to be included and maximum of 75 patients for both P. falciparum and P. vivax will be&#xD;
           enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2. Analysis of data The Epidemiology-information (EPI-INFO) 6.0 software from USA and&#xD;
           Excel sheet program (designed from WHO Headquarter [HQ] for monitoring P. falciparum and&#xD;
           P.vivax resistance to antimalarial drugs) will be used for data entry, management and&#xD;
           analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol&#xD;
           analysis (including those who were withdrawn from the study or who were lost to&#xD;
           follow-up). In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients&#xD;
           will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or&#xD;
           if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P.&#xD;
           falciparum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The final analysis will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The description of all the patients screened as well as the distribution of the reasons&#xD;
           for non-inclusion in the study The description of all the patients included in the study&#xD;
           The proportion and/or percentage of adverse events and serious adverse events for all&#xD;
           the patients included in the study The proportion and/or percentage of patients who are&#xD;
           lost to follow-up or withdrawn with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for&#xD;
           exclusion The proportion and/or percentage of Early treatment failure (ETF), late&#xD;
           clinical failure (LCF) and late parasitological failure (LPF) and adequate clinical&#xD;
           parasitological failure (ACPR) on day 28 with 95% confidence intervals using both&#xD;
           methods of analysis Guidelines on calculating the cumulative success or failure rate,&#xD;
           the proportion of adequate clinical and parasitological response and treatment failure&#xD;
           are given in Annex 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.3. Dissemination of results At the end of the study, the principal investigator will&#xD;
           submit a report on the study and the main outcome. This report will be shared with the&#xD;
           National Malaria Program of Department of Health, Philippines and will allow to&#xD;
           formulate recommendations and enable to make informed decisions about whether the&#xD;
           current national anti-malarial treatment guidelines should be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient data will be included in the global database. The results will also be&#xD;
           presented during the scientific meeting and also be disseminated to the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.4. Amendments to the protocol Before the study, official approval to conduct the study&#xD;
           will be obtained from RITM institutional review board. After the protocol has been&#xD;
           accepted, no change may be made without the agreement of the principal investigator, the&#xD;
           sponsor(s), and the Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1. Approval by the national ethical committee Prior to the&#xD;
           study, official approval to conduct the study will be obtained from Research Institute&#xD;
           for Tropical Medicine Institutional and Ethical Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2. Patient Information Sheet and Informed consent Inclusion in the study will occur only if&#xD;
      the patient or the parent/guardian of the child gives an informed consent and informed assent&#xD;
      from any minor participant aged 12 - 17 years. The consent request, available in English and&#xD;
      Tagalog, will be read entirely to the patient or the parents/guardians. The Patient&#xD;
      Information Sheet, available in English and in Tagalog, showing the details about the trial&#xD;
      and its benefits and potential risks will be explained, and after answering to any potential&#xD;
      questions, signature on the document will be requested (Annex10). If the patient is&#xD;
      illiterate, a literate witness must sign (if possible, this person will be selected by the&#xD;
      participant and will have no connection to the research team). The principal investigator&#xD;
      must also obtain the assent of children over the age of 12 years, but their assent should&#xD;
      normally be completed by the permission of a parent or guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3. Confidentiality All information regarding the patients will remain confidential within&#xD;
      the study team. Unique numerical identifiers will be used for the computer-based data entry&#xD;
      and blood samples. In all cases, principal investigator will seek to ensure that screening&#xD;
      forms, CRF and completed subject identification code list are kept in locked files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4. Health care services Free health care during the duration of the follow-up for illness&#xD;
      related to malaria will be provided to the study patients regardless of treatment outcome;&#xD;
      this includes any necessary expenses related with hospital admission and to adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions, if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When prospective or actual subjects are found to have diseases unrelated to malaria, the&#xD;
      principal investigator should advise them to obtain, or refer them for medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any subject who decides not to participate or cannot be enrolled in the study because they do&#xD;
      not meet the criteria, will be referred to the health facility staff. They will be treated&#xD;
      with and followed-up according to the standard of care established by the Department of&#xD;
      Health. The principal investigator must ensure that this antimalarial drug is available at&#xD;
      the health center. If a patient is withdrawn from the study before the full course of the&#xD;
      treatment is completed, the physician must make all necessary arrangements to provide the&#xD;
      patient with the full dose of the drug currently tested or with a full course of Quinine&#xD;
      10mg/kg bw every 8 hours for 7 days, as recommended by the national policy.&#xD;
