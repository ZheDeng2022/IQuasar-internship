      The primary safety objectives were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: To determine the safety and tolerability of single doses of ZP-059 in healthy&#xD;
           subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: To determine the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ZP-059 in subjects&#xD;
           with mild stable asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 3: To determine the safety and tolerability of single doses of ZP-059 in subjects&#xD;
           with mild to moderate stable asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary PK objectives were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: To characterize systemic PK of voriconazole and N-oxide voriconazole after&#xD;
           single doses of ZP-059 in healthy subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: To characterize systemic PK of voriconazole and N-oxide voriconazole after&#xD;
           multiple doses of ZP-059 in subjects with mild stable asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 3: To characterize systemic PK of voriconazole and N-oxide voriconazole after&#xD;
           single doses of ZP-059 and single doses of oral voriconazole in subjects with mild to&#xD;
           moderate stable asthma.&#xD;

      This was an integrated Phase 1, single centre, multi-part, open-label study in both healthy&#xD;
      subjects (Part 1), subjects with mild stable asthma (Part 2) and subjects with mild to&#xD;
      moderate stable asthma (Part 3). In all three parts of the study every effort was made to&#xD;
      include as close as possible an equal balance between male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assessed safety, tolerability and PK of single and multiple ascending doses of&#xD;
      ZP-059 capsules administered as dry powder for inhalation in Part 1 to healthy volunteers&#xD;
      (single ascending dose; SAD) and in Part 2 to subjects with mild asthma (multiple ascending&#xD;
      dose; MAD), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 3, the bioavailability of ZP-059 in subjects with mild to moderate stable asthma were&#xD;
      compared to that of oral voriconazole. Part 3 started only after review of safety data from&#xD;
      cohorts 1 to 4 of Part 1 (SAD) have been completed. Parts 2 and 3 of the study also explored&#xD;
      voriconazole concentrations in induced sputum samples in asthmatic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the safety and tolerability assessment, this study investigated the effects of&#xD;
      ZP-059 on airway function in both mild and mild to moderate stable asthma subjects.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The investigator or his/her representative explained the nature of the study to the subject and answered all questions regarding the study. Subjects had to be informed that their participation was voluntary. Subjects were required to sign a statement of informed consent that met the requirements of UK regulations, ICH E6 GCP guidelines, General Data Protection Regulation, and the IEC or study site requirements.&#xD;
The authorized person who obtained the informed consent had to also sign the ICF.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in the study within 28 days before dosing (Day 1). Part 2 and Part 3 subjects who had completed the initial screening visit attended the study site on Day -4 or Day -3, for Covid-19 reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, together with additional daily tympanic temperature measurements, and other tests as applicable.&#xD;
Subjects were then be admitted to the study site on the evening of Day -1.</pre_assignment_details>

Part 2 (MAD): eligible subjects received 2 (10mg twice daily [BID]) or 4 [20mg BID]) inhaled doses of ZP-059 5mg capsules administered via DPI BID for 9 days and once in the morning of Day 10, or 8 inhaled doses of ZP-059 5 mg capsules (40mg once daily [QD]) for 10 days. For QD dosing, subjects received QD doses of ZP-059 (at hour 0) on Days 1 to 10.&#xD;
Part 3 (2-period crossover): eligible subjects received a single inhaled dose (20mg) of ZP-059 5mg capsules administered via DPI on the morning of Day 1 according to the crossover scheme of the study.&#xD;
ZP-059 (inhaled voriconazole) was provided in clear, colorless size 3 hydroxypropylmethylcellulose hard capsules, which were individually and manually triggered by a breath actuated inhalation device (RS01 monodose inhaler).</description>

Cohort 1: 10mg (2 x 5 mg capsule) ZP-059 twice daily (bid) administered via DPI (RS01 monodose device) for 9 days and once in the morning of Day 10.&#xD;
Voriconazole inhaled: Part 1 (SAD): eligible subjects received a single ascending inhaled dose (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) of ZP-059 5mg capsules administered via dry powder inhaler (DPI) on the morning of Day 1.&#xD;
Part 2 (MAD): eligible subjects received 2 (10mg twice daily [BID]) or 4 [20mg BID]) inhaled doses of ZP-059 5mg capsules administered via DPI BID for 9 days and once in the morning of Day 10, or 8 inhaled doses of ZP-059 5 mg capsules (40mg once daily [QD]) for 10 days. For QD dosing, subjects received QD doses of ZP-059 (at hour 0) on Days 1 to 10.&#xD;
