  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pulmonary hypertension is a disease, which tends to a progredient right heart failure.&#xD;
      Although there was a large progress in development of medical therapy, the quality of life,&#xD;
      the physical efficiency and the prognosis of the patients are still limited. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to examine the influence of physical training to clinical and molecular parameter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study in patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, who are under stable optimized treatment for at least 2 months, is to examine&#xD;
      the effect of an additional exercise and respiratory therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim criteria measures the clinical parameters to record the effect of the training plus&#xD;
      molecular parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. The molecular parameters&#xD;
      are composed of laboratory parameter and inflammatory parameter as well as genetic analyses,&#xD;
      measurements of epigenetic changes measured by microRNA Expressions and DNA-methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study parameters will be assessed in the patient's routine examinations. Clinical&#xD;
      parameters comprise of hemodynamic assessment of pulmonary arterial pressure during exercise,&#xD;
      pump function of left and right ventricle, and further echocardiographic parameters.&#xD;
      Improvement of exercise capacity will be measured by the change of six-minute walking&#xD;
      distance, the breathing economics, the world health organization functional class (WHO&#xD;
      functional class), peak oxygen consumption and blood gas analysis. The quality of life will&#xD;
      be assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire. Data for survival analysis will be gained by&#xD;
      structured phone interviews . The safety of the training is warranted by long-term, rest- and&#xD;
      stress-ECG, safety laboratory, systemic blood pressure, heart frequency, oxygen saturation&#xD;
      and occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be examined in the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg. Patients of the training group will&#xD;
      take part in a specific, 3-week inpatient training program at the rehabilitation center&#xD;
      Königstuhl Heidelberg. The training program consists of exercise and respiratory therapy as&#xD;
      well as a mental gait training. Respiratory therapy will be performed 5 times/week for 30&#xD;
      minutes. Furthermore, 15-25 minutes low dosed interval training on a bicycle ergometer,&#xD;
      dumbbell training of particular muscle groups with low weights and supervised walks on&#xD;
      ground-level will be scheduled 5-7 times/week. Three- to five times a week a &quot;mental gait&#xD;
      training&quot; is conducted to estimate the patient's individual physical abilities and&#xD;
      limitations. The heart rate during exerciseand the intensity of the training will be closely&#xD;
      monitored and individually adjusted. After three weeks of in-hospital rehabilitation the&#xD;
      patients are asked to continue the training for twelve further weeks at home. All patients&#xD;
      will be examined before the training program, at the end of the in-hospital phase after three&#xD;
      weeks and after 15 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control examinations cover the medical history, WHO functional class, physical&#xD;
      examination, ECG, echocardiography at rest and during exercise, spiroergometry, quality of&#xD;
      life, blood-gas analysis, lung function, 6-minute walking distance, oxygen saturation, blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate, laboratory tests. An optional magnet resonance imaging at the&#xD;
      beginning and after three months may also be conducted. At baseline, an optional genetic&#xD;
      assessment will be performed; and at the beginning, after three and 15 weeks the expression&#xD;
      levels of micro RNA and methylation of the DNA will be assessed. Medication will remain&#xD;
      stable throughout the study.&#xD;
