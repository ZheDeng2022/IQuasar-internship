      Background: Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine) is an indoleamine synthesized and&#xD;
      secreted by the pineal gland and other organs, such as the retina, bone marrow, and&#xD;
      intestines in a circadian pattern. Some authors claimed that Melatonin induces bone&#xD;
      formation, increase bone density, and bone implant contact. According to animal and human&#xD;
      studies the melatonin can be used topically during implant placement to increase bone implant&#xD;
      contact and reduce marginal bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the topical administration of&#xD;
      melatonin on osseointegration of dental implants and in minimize marginal bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Twenty single-piece endosseous implants (Dentium Co, Korea) will use&#xD;
      to restore missing lower teeth from canine to first molar area. The study will be split-mouth&#xD;
      technique, each patient serve as his own control (served into 2 groups), the study side&#xD;
      (topical application of melatonin in the implant side), and the control side (no melatonin in&#xD;
      the other implant side of the same patients).The primary and secondary stability of dental&#xD;
      implant will be evaluated by periotest M device and measure bone level as baseline&#xD;
      immediately after implant placement and after 6 months follow up by CBCT.&#xD;

      Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine) is an indoleamine synthesized and secreted by the&#xD;
      pineal gland and other organs, such as the retina, bone marrow, and intestines in a circadian&#xD;
      pattern. Extrapineal sites contribute poorly, or only upon specific stimuli to circulating&#xD;
      melatonin. Melatonin influences numerous physiological actions that may be mediated by the&#xD;
      binding of the indoleamine to membrane receptors in all tissues. Because of its lipophilic&#xD;
      properties, melatonin passes through cell membranes to gain access to subcellular organelles,&#xD;
      being capable to bind to some cytosolic proteins like kinase-C . Currently, melatonin is not&#xD;
      considered a hormone in the classical sense of the term, because it is synthesized in several&#xD;
      organs and does not exert effects on a specific target , but it is rather a powerful cell&#xD;
      protector against molecular damage. For the synthesis of melatonin, the pineal cells take up&#xD;
      tryptophan from the blood and, through hydroxylation and a decarboxylation process, turn it&#xD;
      into serotonin. Serotonin is then converted into N-acetylserotonin through&#xD;
      N-acetyltransferase and subsequently methylated to the final form of melatonin by the enzyme&#xD;
      hydroxy indole-O-methyltransferase . In healthy individuals, the maximum secretion of&#xD;
      melatonin occurs between midnight and 2 a.m., then it decreases to a minimum during the day.&#xD;
      Melatonin has numerous physiological functions in different parts of the body, such as the&#xD;
      control of circadian rhythms \, regulation of body temperature, and activation of the immune&#xD;
      system.In the oral cavity, melatonin has been recognized as an important substance with&#xD;
      paracrine effects on nearby cells, it also acts as an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      and plays an important role in bone formation and in the reduction of bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osseointegration defined as a direct connection between living bone tissues and a titanium&#xD;
      implant without any connective tissues. Osteoblasts are bone formative cells, and osteoclasts&#xD;
      are bone resorptive cells. When these cells work together physiologically, the formation and&#xD;
      resorption processes of bone tissue is known as bone remodelling. The remodeling of bone&#xD;
      tissues is regulated by the action of systemic hormones (estradiol, parathyroid, growth, and&#xD;
      melatonin) and by the bone marrow and osteoid matrix-derived growth factors.Insufficient bone&#xD;
      quality and quantity can be seen frequently in elderly populations with atrophic and&#xD;
      osteoporotic bones, and this situation stems from increased osteoclastic activity due to a&#xD;
      reduction in osteoblastogenesis. In addition, local free radical concentrations in all body&#xD;
      cells, including osteoblasts, can reduce osteoblastic activity in aged patients. This process&#xD;
      could lead to a reduction in bone regeneration capacity. Melatonin can also suppress&#xD;
      osteoclastogenesis, and therefore inhibit bone tissue resorption. In addition to this, in&#xD;
      vitro research has reported that melatonin can increase osteoblast proliferation and&#xD;
      differentiation. So was proposed that the local application of melatonin during surgical&#xD;
      implant placement procedures would be an effective treatment technique for dental implant&#xD;
      osseointegration. Worthy osseointegration is a prerequisite for dental implants. Optimal&#xD;
      osseointegration depends on the formation of new bone around implants, which may be&#xD;
      stimulated by the application of biomimetic agents. Considering the bone metabolism,&#xD;
      melatonin acts directly on the osteoclast, a multinucleated cell, which resorbs the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix through various mechanisms, including the production of free radicals.&#xD;
      Moreover, in pre-osteoblast cultures from rats, melatonin, in a dose-dependent manner,&#xD;
      promoted the development of bone sialoprotein and other protein bone markers, including&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, and osteocalcin, and speeds up their period of&#xD;
      differentiation into osteoblasts from the normal rate, which is 21 days, to 12 days, this&#xD;
      reaction is mediated by the membrane receptors for the indole. Also, melatonin, may interfere&#xD;
      with the function of the osteoclast and thereby inhibit bone resorption. conducted an&#xD;
      experimental study using melatonin with dental implants in dogs. Two weeks after implant&#xD;
      insertion, melatonin significantly increased all parameters of osteointegration. It has been&#xD;
      observed that melatonin, increases bone mass by suppressing resorption through&#xD;
      down-regulation of the RANKL-mediated osteoclast formation and activation. These data point&#xD;
      towards an osteogenic effect of melatonin that may be of clinical importance, as it could be&#xD;
      used as a therapeutic agent in situations in which bone formation would be advantageous, such&#xD;
      as in the treatment of fractures or of osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicology of Melatonin:- The physiological functions of the pineal hormone melatonin are&#xD;
      extremely diverse. The functions include direct and indirect modulations of anti-oxidative&#xD;
      defense, blood pressure, body temperature, cortisol rhythm, reproduction and immune function&#xD;
      . Correspondingly, exogenous melatonin has been investigated as a treatment for a number of&#xD;
      medical and surgical diseases, demonstrating encouraging results . In the USA, melatonin is&#xD;
      available as an over-the-counter non-prescription drug. In most European countries, however,&#xD;
      melatonin remains a prescription drug (Circadin) and has only been approved as a treatment&#xD;
      for primary insomnia in people over 55 years of age. However, a recent Norwegian register&#xD;
      study documented a 3- to 5-times increase in off-label use among children and adolescents in&#xD;
      the time period 2004 to 2012 . Melatonin is generally considered safe, but the increasing&#xD;
      clinical use with potentially increasing doses necessitates further investigations of the&#xD;
      risks of both mild and serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periotest M device:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periotest device was developed to measure the damping characteristics of natural teeth and&#xD;
      has been used to evaluate implant. It was developed by Schulte in 1983 to quantify TM , and&#xD;
      then utilized by Teerlinck et al , to measure implant stability and to overcome destructive&#xD;
      methods in measuring the implant stability like histologic analysis, tensional test,&#xD;
      push-out/pull-out test and removal torque analysis. The (Classic/Wired) Periotest device has&#xD;
      been the subject of several studies with generally favorable results. These results showed&#xD;
      that the Periotest device generally demonstrated a high degree of repeatability and&#xD;
      reliability. A wireless version of the Periotest (Periotest &quot;M&quot;) has been introduced to the&#xD;
      profession. According to information provided by the electronic page of the Periotest M&#xD;
      /wireless device manufacturer (Medizintechnik Gulden, Modautal, Germany), Periotest M is&#xD;
      simpler to perform an objective evaluation of an implant's stability compared to classic&#xD;
      Periotest. In Periotest M wireless design, the user can benefit from maximum freedom of&#xD;
      movement. The device can be used for taking measurements on a wide variety of implants,&#xD;
      without the need for any special accessories, such as a smart peg . The Periotest has an&#xD;
      important advantage against the others like the Osstell device: it can be applied directly to&#xD;
      the implant superstructure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limitations of Periotest are the inability of the instrument to measure the mesiodistal&#xD;
      mobility, the possible effect of position and angle of the rods on the measured value . The&#xD;
      readings of PTV are from (-8 to +50) according to information provided by the device&#xD;
      manufacturer (Medizintechnik Gulden, Modautal, Germany) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT):-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an imaging modality that offers significant&#xD;
      advantages for the evaluation of implant patients . The field of view (FOV) is an important&#xD;
      feature that describes the extent of the imaged volume from large FOV (greater than 15 cm) to&#xD;
      medium FOV (8 to 15 cm) and limited FOV (less than 8 cm). Limited FOV units image a small&#xD;
      area, delivering less radiation and producing a higher-resolution image . CBCT allows for&#xD;
      defining with elevated accuracy the quality (cortical/medullar ratio) and the quantity&#xD;
      (height and thickness) of bone available for the implant, providing the essential information&#xD;
      of performing or not a preimplant bony graft . when compared to medical CT, CBCT can be&#xD;
      recommended as a dose reducing technique for dental implant applications. The effective dose&#xD;
      from CBCT examinations ranges from 13 µ Sv with the 3D Accuitomo CBCT machine using the 4 x4&#xD;
      cm FOV to 479 µ Sv with the CB Mercury CBCT machine . For comparison, the effective dose from&#xD;
      one panoramic radiograph is approximately 10 to 14µSv. Furthermore, the exposure from a&#xD;
      maxillomandibular medical CT ranges from 474 to 1160 µSv. The average background radiation in&#xD;
      the United States is 3000 µSv (3 mSv) per year or 8 µSv per day . It is important to&#xD;
      understand that every effort must be made to reduce the effective radiation dose to the&#xD;
      patient. By using the smallest possible FOV, the lowest mA setting, the shortest exposure&#xD;
      time, and a pulsed exposure mode of acquisition, it is possible to accomplish effective dose&#xD;
      reduction to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty single-piece endosseous implants (Dentium Co, Korea) will use to restore missing teeth&#xD;
      in the upper or lower jaw (canine to 1st molars area) from both sides. The study will be&#xD;
      split-mouth technique, each patient serves as his own control (served into 2 groups), the&#xD;
      study side (topical application of melatonin in the implant side), and the control side (no&#xD;
      melatonin in the other implant side of the same patients). According to the study reported by&#xD;
      (Cutando et al., 2008) the estimated dose of melatonin required to enhance osseointegration&#xD;
      of dental implant and minimize the marginal bone resorption is 1.2 mg of melatonin powder for&#xD;
      each implant. CBCT for all patients before implant placement to determine bone density,&#xD;
      dimension, and anatomical landmarks. Prior to surgery, all patients will instruct to use&#xD;
      chlorhexidine 0.12% mouthwash as antiseptic. After local anesthesia, a mucoperiosteal flap&#xD;
      will reflect. The manufacturer's instructions should be followed for the preparation of the&#xD;
      implant osteotomy site. For the study side, 1.2 mg of melatonin powder will place in the&#xD;
      osteotomy site before the insertion of the implant. For the control side, no melatonin powder&#xD;
      will be used and implants will be inserted directly in the prepared implant site. After&#xD;
      dental implant installation, the gingival former will insert into the body of the fixture,&#xD;
      then the Periotest M device will use to measure the primary stability of the DI fixture.&#xD;
      After that, the gingival former will be removed and cover screw place and tightened into the&#xD;
      fixture. Sutures will place after flap replacement. Patients should be instructed to use&#xD;
      antibiotics amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 500mg 3 times/day for 5 days after surgical&#xD;
      procedure, soft diet and proper oral hygiene measures. Also, CBCT immediately after implant&#xD;
      placement to record baseline bone level, CBCT after 6 months follow up to measure marginal&#xD;
      bone level around implant comparing with baseline measurement, and measure the secondary&#xD;
      stability using periotest M device.&#xD;
