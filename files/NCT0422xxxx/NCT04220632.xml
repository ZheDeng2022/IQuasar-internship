      The purpose of this study is to evaluate itacitinib in combination with corticosteroids as&#xD;
      first-line treatment of participants with Grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (aGVHD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, multicenter Phase I/II study of IBI377 in combination with&#xD;
      corticosteroids as first-line treatment of subjects with Grade II to IV aGVHD. In Phase I,&#xD;
      the PK, safety, tolerability and efficacy of IBI377 will be assessed in 12 subjects. In Phase&#xD;
      II, the efficacy and safety will be assessed in 48 subjects.&#xD;
