  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of pexidartinib was investigated in participants with&#xD;
      impaired hepatic function and compared with healthy control participants with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pexidartinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor, currently approved in the&#xD;
      US for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT)&#xD;
      associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement&#xD;
      with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      pexidartinib after a single oral dose of 200 mg in participants with moderate hepatic&#xD;
      impairment (HI) as defined by National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group&#xD;
      (NCI-ODWG) criteria compared to the healthy controls participants with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

        <description>AUCinf is defined as area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the time of dosing extrapolated to infinity and AUClast is defined as AUC from time 0 to the last measurable concentration, as calculated by the linear up-log down trapezoidal method. MPR is defined as a metabolite to parent ratio with metabolite as the numerator and the parent as the denominator. MPR corrected for molecular weight of ZAAD-1006a of AUCinf and AUClast are reported and were calculated using non-compartmental analysis.</description>
