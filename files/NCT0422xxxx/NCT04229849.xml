      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of anrotenib plus toripalimab&#xD;
      in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will explore the possible mechanisms of anrotinib combined with toripalimab in&#xD;
      advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and screen out biomarkers that can predict the&#xD;
      efficacy of combination therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard recommendation for the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      cancer after chemotherapy failure. Anrotinib combined with triplizumab have showed&#xD;
      synergistic effect in the tumor treatment, and they have demonstrated robust antitumor&#xD;
      activity in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with negative driving gene. However,&#xD;
      there is no related report on the efficacy in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of anrotenib&#xD;
      plus toripalimab in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will explore the possible mechanisms of anrotinib combined with&#xD;
      toripalimab in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and screen out biomarkers that&#xD;
      can predict the efficacy of combination therapy.&#xD;
