  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study with EC5026, a new drug candidate intended to treat&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. The purpose of the study is to provide initial safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics data of single ascending oral doses of EC5026 in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1a single ascending dose&#xD;
      study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of sequential doses of oral&#xD;
      EC5026 in healthy male and female subjects. EC5026 is an inhibitor of the soluble Epoxide&#xD;
      Hydrolase (sEH) enzyme developed as a first-in-class analgesic for the treatment of pain.&#xD;
      This study will help refine the dosing strategy for subsequent multiple-dose studies in&#xD;
      healthy subjects and for future clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sEH is an enzyme that is downstream in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway of the arachidonic&#xD;
      acid (AA) cascade. The sEH enzyme is responsible of metabolizing a class of epoxy-fatty acids&#xD;
      known as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are potent, naturally occurring analgesics.&#xD;
      EETs are produced at high concentrations in areas of tissue damage and inflammation, but are&#xD;
      rapidly metabolized by the sEH enzyme into inactive compounds. Effective inhibition of sEH&#xD;
      activity prolongs the ability of EETs to exert their analgesic activity.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) [Safety and Tolerability]</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the electronic case report forms (eCRF). Information to be collected includes drug treatment, type of event, time of onset, dosage, investigator-specified assessment of severity and relationship to study drug, time of resolution of the event, seriousness, any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. Any AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved, stable, or judged by the investigator to be not clinically significant. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities will be used to code all AEs. A TEAE is defined as any event not present before exposure to study drug or any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) [Safety and Tolerability]</title>
        <description>All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the electronic case report forms (eCRF). Information to be collected includes drug treatment, type of event, time of onset, dosage, investigator-specified assessment of severity and relationship to study drug, time of resolution of the event, seriousness, any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. Any AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved, stable, or judged by the investigator to be not clinically significant. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities will be used to code all AEs. A TEAE is defined as any event not present before exposure to study drug or any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure.</description>
