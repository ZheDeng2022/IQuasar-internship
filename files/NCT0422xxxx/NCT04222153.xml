  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this PhD project focuses on the relationship between intestinal microbiota and&#xD;
      health in the background of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Many pathologies, including the&#xD;
      CKD, display a dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, which is at the same time a&#xD;
      consequence of CKD and contributes to its progression and complication. In a variety of&#xD;
      chronic-degenerative and infectious diseases, the &quot;fecal microbiota transplantation&quot; (FMT) is&#xD;
      being tested in recent years in addition with the application of both probiotics and&#xD;
      prebiotics. FMT is indeed currently successfully used in the eradication of recurrent&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile infections, with success rates of 90%, thus recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      that FMT could be applied in other diseases characterized by microbiota dysbiosis, such as&#xD;
      CKD and diabetes, in which the FMT has never been previously tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will allow to study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) the prototypal production of the encapsulated suspension of healthy microbiota tested in a&#xD;
      minimally invasive FMT procedure (by oral administration);&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) the efficacy of the innovative prototype for colonization and modulation of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota following FMT;&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) the experimental and clinical feedback of this suspension, by in vivo studies.&#xD;

      This project will allow to experiment the Fecal microbiota transplantation in the CKD model&#xD;
      and to set up a pharmaceutical formulation of fecal suspensions of microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, a collection of fecal samples from healthy volunteers will be set up, with the aim&#xD;
      to collect biological samples. Screening and enrollment of healthy volunteers, gathering&#xD;
      personal and clinical information together with eating habits, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best product design in efficacy, stability over time as well as suitable excipients and&#xD;
      any other active components able to perform a synergistic action will be evaluated. After&#xD;
      defining the pharmaceutical formulation, the production of the prototype will be finalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second time in vivo studies on a model of CKD (uremic mouse with CKD induced by 5/6&#xD;
      nephrectomy) will be designed and carried on. The CKD model will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects and the outcomes of FMT on clinical parameters such as renal function, circulating&#xD;
      levels of uremic toxins, state and function of the intestinal microbiota, intestinal&#xD;
      permeability and microbiota composition. This step will be necessary to establish the&#xD;
      efficacy of the innovative prototype for the colonization and the modulation of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota following FMT.&#xD;

    <description>A final number of 10 healthy volunteers will be selected to collect their fecal samples, according to the protocol FMT01 (ref. Cammarota G et al. Gut 2017 doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2016-313017):&#xD;
Preliminary interview - anamnestic interview to exclude people with history of disease and risk factors&#xD;
Secondary interview - anamnestic interview (on the day of donation) to exclude donors with recently appeared harmful issues&#xD;
Sample collection - blood and stool testing to verify the presence of potentially transmittable disease: Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Hepatitis A, HBV, HCV, Syphilis, HIV-1 and HIV-2, Faecal Helicobacter pylori, Faecal occult blood testing, Fecal ova and parasites Steps 1 and 2 will be analyzed by the physician in order to exclude people, after enrollment, at risk of potential harmful issues. People passing steps 1 and 2 will undergo blood and fecal laboratory screening. Positivity to one or more of the tested factor will result in volunteer exclusion.</description>
