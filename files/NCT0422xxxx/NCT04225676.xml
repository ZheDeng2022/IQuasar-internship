    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center Phase II study investigating the efficacy and safety of reinfusion of&#xD;
      tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult patients with ALL who were treated with&#xD;
      tisagenlecleucel and experience B cell recovery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial was a phase II, open label, multi-center trial to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of tisagenlecleucel re-infusion in pediatric and adolescent young adult (AYA) patients&#xD;
      with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing loss of B cell aplasia. Loss of B-cell&#xD;
      aplasia is defined as: peripheral blood (PB) absolute B lymphocyte count ≥ 50/µL, OR PB B&#xD;
      lymphocyte ≥ 10% of the total lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had the following phases for all patients: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study was about 12 months. After tisagenlecleucel re-infusion, efficacy&#xD;
      was assessed at months 1, 3, 6, and End of Study at which time blood samples were obtained to&#xD;
      measure circulating B lymphocytes (&lt; 50/µL) and presence of CTL019 cells by qPCR in the&#xD;
      peripheral blood. Safety was assessed throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study stopped early due to slow enrollment into the trial. The rate of enrollment made&#xD;
      the trial no longer feasible to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were able to voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason, at any time.&#xD;
      Patients who receive commercial tisagenlecleucel must be followed for up to 15 years&#xD;
      post-infusion. Patients can be followed under the Center for International Blood and Marrow&#xD;
      Transplant Research (CIBMTR) cellular therapy registry if consented for participation. For&#xD;
      patients who do not provide consent for participation in the Center for International Blood&#xD;
      and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry, AEs will need to be reported for 15 years&#xD;
      or until the patient enrolls in the registry.&#xD;
