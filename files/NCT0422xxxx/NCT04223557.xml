  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research objective is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of perirenal fat modification in&#xD;
      the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in a double-blinded and randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants were low-and medium-risk ASCVD as defined by the guidelines,&#xD;
      accompanied by serum cholesterol abnormality. 84 patients are planned to be enrolled.The&#xD;
      admission rate was 2:1 in the treatment group versus control group, including 56 of the&#xD;
      treatment group and 28 of the sham-control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment group, participants will receive the peri-renal fat modification therapy (PRFM)&#xD;
      and in the sham-control group, participants will undergo peri-renal fat ultrasonic&#xD;
      measurement and localization, focused ultrasound treatment parameters setting, except that no&#xD;
      energy will be delivered to the peri-renal fat. The follow-up evaluations will be performed&#xD;
      at 24h, 1 month and 3 months post-procedure, including demographic data, serum lipid level,&#xD;
      renal ultrasound, renal CT scan and renal MRI if it is necessary.&#xD;
