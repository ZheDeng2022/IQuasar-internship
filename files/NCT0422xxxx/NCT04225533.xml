  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential benefit of blocking inflammation during a heart attack&#xD;
      using an investigational anti-inflammatory medicine called SP16. The study will enroll 10&#xD;
      patients and all 10 patients will receive a standard dose of SP16.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of this study is that a single subcutaneous administration of SP16 0.2&#xD;
      mg/kg is safe and well tolerated in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (STEMI) and associated with a reduction in the acute inflammatory response to STEMI, as&#xD;
      measured as area-under-the-curve (AUC) for C reactive protein (CRP), the preferred&#xD;
      inflammatory marker for cardiovascular risk prognostication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SP16 will be administered subcutaneously as this route has greater ease of administration&#xD;
      than intravenous injection. A single dose administration has been selected based upon&#xD;
      pre-clinical data and expected clinical use of SP16.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 72 hours, 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>This study will evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of SP16 by calculating the AUC for CRP. This is done by measuring CRP at baseline, 72 hours, and 14 days. The AUC will then be compared to historical controls to evaluate whether or not SP16 reduces the AUC for CRP.</description>

    <measure>Infarct size</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This study will estimate the infarct size based upon area under the curve (AUC) for creatine-kinase myocardial band (CK-MB). The AUC calculation will come from CK-MB levels drawn during usual care. The infarct size will then be compared to historical controls to evaluate whether or not SP16 reduces the infarct size.</description>

        In order to be eligible for this study, patients must meet all the 3 criteria:&#xD;

          1. Presentation to the hospital with acute STEMI defined as chest pain (or equivalent)&#xD;
             with an onset within 12 hours and electrocardiogram (ECG) evidence of ST segment&#xD;
             elevation (&gt;1 mm) in 2 or more anatomically contiguous leads that is new or presumably&#xD;
             new (for intermittent pain lasting more than 12 hours, the time from the when the pain&#xD;
             became severe and constant);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Coronary intervention planned and/or completed within 12 hours of symptom onset, and&#xD;
             enrollment in the study within 6 hours of angiogram (max 18 hours from symptom onset)&#xD;
