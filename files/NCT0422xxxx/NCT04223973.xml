      Demonstration study of the interest of the MEDTRUM A7+ TouchCare insulin patch pump versus&#xD;
      INSULET Omnipod® patch pump&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compare the daily use of two single usage patch pumps and demonstrate the interest of use of&#xD;
      the A7+TouchCare® (Medtrum) patch pump for type 1 &amp; 2 diabetes management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective is an estimation of Patients A1C based on the average blood glucose (obtained&#xD;
      from a Flash glucose monitoring) and to compare it in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comparison of mean A1C (laboratory values) between the two groups at Baseline and study&#xD;
           end. Comparison to be established in a non-inferiority&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe Skin &amp; overall Tolerance, Technical incidents with the device (failure,&#xD;
           disconnection, catheter obstruction…)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colllection of Glucose metrics (minimum, maximum, average/median, standard deviation,&#xD;
           out of range value, percentage of time in range, glucose variability)&#xD;

    <description>A1C will be estimated by a Continuous Glucose Measurement (FreeStyle Libre®) for all patients, at baseline and end of the study. The main objective is to demonstrate Non-inferiority efficacy (PP then ITT) of Medtrum A7+ insulin patch pump vs Insulet Omnipod® insulin patch pump (2 randomized groups).&#xD;
For the primary outcome, A1C will be estimated and appear in percentage based on assessment done by a Continuous Glucose Monitoring system.&#xD;
The A1C obtained in real life for the group using the comparator pump (Omnipod®) is estimated at 7,8%. Assuming that blood glucose level will be the same with Medtrum pump and based on a defined non-inferiority margin ∆ = + 0,4 (following FDA Guidance for Industry Diabetes Mellitus: Developing Drugs and Therapeutic Biologics for Treatment and Prevention).</description>
