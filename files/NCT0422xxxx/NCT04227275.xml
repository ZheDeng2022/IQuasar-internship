    <textblock>
      Multi-center, open-label, Phase 1 study of the safety, tolerability and feasibility of dosing&#xD;
      patients harboring metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with genetically&#xD;
      modified autologous T cells (CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells) engineered to express a chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (CAR) capable of recognizing the tumor antigen prostate-specific membrane&#xD;
      antigen (PSMA) and activating the T cell.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 single-arm study designed to identify the dose and regimen of CART-PSMA-&#xD;
      TGFβRDN cells that can be safely administered intravenously following the lymphodepletion&#xD;
      (LD) regimen to patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
      Following Dose Escalation, a Cohort Expansion will enroll patients to further explore the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the selected dose and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that up to 50 patients will enroll in this study in both dose escalation&#xD;
      and cohort expansion.&#xD;
