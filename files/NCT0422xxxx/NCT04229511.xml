  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DETERMINE trial is a prospective multicenter multinational cohort study. This study will be&#xD;
      carried out to predict the risk of bloodstream infections (BSIs) or other types of invasive&#xD;
      infection with carbapenem resistant K.pneumoniae in patients being colonized by CRKp. The&#xD;
      results of DETERMINE trial would be quite important to prevent unnecessary coverage of&#xD;
      carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in empirical treatment of colonized patients. In&#xD;
      this study, both risk score model and decision tree algorithm will be constructed and&#xD;
      compared with each other in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and&#xD;
      negative predictive value.&#xD;

      1. Main Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Building a risk score model and decision tree algorithm with an acceptable certainty for&#xD;
           early prediction of BSI or other invasive infections caused by CRKp in CRKp carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of risk score model and decision tree algorithm in terms of sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity rates, positive predictive and negative predictive values&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of risk score model and decision tree algorithm in terms of convenience for&#xD;
           routine clinical use&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Main hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of immunosuppression, invasive devices, gastrointestinal surgery within prior 3&#xD;
      months, multi-site colonization beside stool, older age, diabetes as a comorbidity, admission&#xD;
      to ICUs, presence of carbapenemase gene in CRKp that causes colonization, type of&#xD;
      carbapenemase (eg. blaOXA-48 and blaKPC ), high SOFA score, high APACHEII score, high ECOG&#xD;
      score (&gt;2), short time interval between identification of colonization and development of BSI&#xD;
      or other type of invasive infection are independent risk factors for development of&#xD;
      subsequent BSI or other invasive infections in CRKp colonized participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sensitivity and specificity rates are similar in risk score model and decision tree&#xD;
           algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Positive and negative predictive values are similar in risk score model and decision&#xD;
           tree algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Both risk score model and decision tree algorithm are feasible for usage in our daily&#xD;
           practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective multi-centre multinational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Setting and study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary care hospitals form different parts of the world will be included in DETERMINE&#xD;
      trial. Study period is scheduled to be 01.04.2020-01.04.2021 or longer until pre-defined&#xD;
      sample size is attained. Each participant will be included only once at the time of first&#xD;
      infectious episode (BSI or other type of invasive infections) caused by CRKp or any other&#xD;
      bacteria even if more than one infectious episode is reported. Local (primary) investigators&#xD;
      will collect microbiological and clinical data of participants and record these data in a&#xD;
      standardized electronic case report form. Site investigators will screen all patients who are&#xD;
      admitted to ICUs, burn ward, solid and bone marrow transplant units, all patients who are&#xD;
      admitted to wards in which an outbreak with CRKp is detected, all patients who share the same&#xD;
      room with a patient colonized or infected with CRKp by rectal swab with once a week interval&#xD;
      regularly. The participants who have CRKp rectal colonization will be screened by axillary,&#xD;
      inguinal and surgical wound screening as well. These patients will be followed for emergence&#xD;
      of BSI or other types of invasive infection for 90 days starting from identification of&#xD;
      rectal colonization (day 0). Periodic rectal screening with once a week interval will be&#xD;
      applied for non-colonized patients during their hospitalization. Carbapenem resistance in&#xD;
      Klebsiella pneumonia isolates will be determined according to 2015 CDC criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size can be determined by the number of parameter included in logistic regression&#xD;
      model. Ideally, the number of participants that should be involved is calculated by&#xD;
      multiplying the number of parameters involved in multivariate logistic regression model with&#xD;
      40. Therefore, the sample size needs to be at least 520 if all hypothesized parameters take&#xD;
      place in logistic regression model (Peduzzi P., Concato J., Kemper E., Holford T.R.,&#xD;
      Feinstein A.R. (1996), A Simulation Study of Number Per Variable In Logistic Regression&#xD;
      Analysis, J.Clin.Epidemiology, Vol 12, 1373-1379).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regular assessment of participants will be carried out during hospitalization and after&#xD;
      discharge. it will be performed in once a month interval through 90-days follow-up. The&#xD;
      participants will be primarily evaluated for occurrence of any type of invasive infection&#xD;
      (blood stream or other type of invasive infections). The participants will be warned to apply&#xD;
      to our centres until the completion of 90-day follow-up period when symptoms of infection&#xD;
      develop (eg fever, chills). Also, participants will be informed to call physicians who are&#xD;
      primary investigators of particular centre when they arrive to hospital clinic or emergency&#xD;
      department. Primary investigators will evaluate participants and send their culture samples&#xD;
      according to clinical necessity. After review of the results of cultures and clinical&#xD;
      presentation, the patients will be allocated into one of three different groups constituted&#xD;
      by (i) infections with carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumonia, (ii) invasive infections&#xD;
      with other type of microorganisms and (iii) non-infectious groups. In statistical analysis,&#xD;
      cases with bloodstream infection and other types of invasive infection will be grouped and&#xD;
      analysed separately. If the participant is discharged before completion of the 90-days,&#xD;
      he/she will be contacted in 30-days interval by telephone call to appraise the investigated&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Microbiological Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimicrobial susceptibility tests (AST) will be performed in each centre and not be&#xD;
      repeated. Therefore, AST results will be obtained from hospital database. Multiplex PCR will&#xD;
      be used for identification of type of carbapenemases among CRKp isolates (both isolates&#xD;
      recovered in rectal swab sample and blood or other site cultures). EUCAST breakpoints will be&#xD;
      applied for identification of carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumonia. Rectal swab&#xD;
      processing and identification of CRKp colonization will be performed according to CDC&#xD;
      recommendations as follows: Perirectal swabs will be placed into universals containing 5 ml&#xD;
      tyriptic soy broth (Oxoid, UK) with an ertapenem 10 ug disk and send to the reference centre&#xD;
      in each country for overnight incubation at 37 °C. The broth cultures are then inoculated&#xD;
      onto MacConkey agar (Oxoid, UK), and lactose-fermenting colonies are identified with an&#xD;
      automatized system such as API20E or Vitek-2 etc. and confirmed by MALDI-TOF Biotyper CA&#xD;
      system (Bruker, Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Carbapenem resistance will be determined&#xD;
      phenotypically with ertapenem E-test (bioMerieux, France) and the isolates with a MIC value&#xD;
      of &gt; 0.5 mg/L are reported as CRKp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In BSIs or other invasive infections, only the first CRKp isolate of each patient will be&#xD;
      included. Multiplex PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) will be applied for identification of&#xD;
      type of carbapenemase genes in clinical CRKp isolates. Clonal relatedness and sequence typing&#xD;
      of CRKp isolates will be determined by using MLST (Multi-locus sequence typing) method. Both&#xD;
      multiplex PCR and MLST will be performed in reference centres of each country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the patients who develop BSI with CRKp vs. any bacteria vs. do not develop any&#xD;
      infection will be matched in a 1:1:2 ratios by using relevant parameters. The same procedure&#xD;
      will be applied for the patients who develop invasive infections without bacteremia. The&#xD;
      variables are expressed as absolute numbers and their relative frequencies. Continuous&#xD;
      variables are expressed as mean and SD if normally distributed, or as median and&#xD;
      interquartile range (IQR) if non-normally distributed. Discrete variables for the matched&#xD;
      pairs were compared by McNemar's test; for continuous variables we used the Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
      All the variables being associated with CRKp BSI or other invasive infections in the crude&#xD;
      analysis (p &lt;0.1) were included in a backward, stepwise multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
      model, separately. Overall goodness of fit for model will be analyzed by Akiake's Information&#xD;
      Criteria (AIC) and Nagelkerke's R-square. Discrimination of the model will be assessed by&#xD;
      receiver-operator curve (ROC) characteristics. Internal validation of final risk score model&#xD;
      and decision tree algorithm will be made with last 1/3 enrolled patients of all cohort&#xD;
      (validation cohort). The data of first 2/3 recruited patients will be used to develop risk&#xD;
      score model and decision tree algorithm (derivation cohort). The risk of development of&#xD;
      subsequent BSI wtih CRKp vs. any other bacteria vs. patients not having any type of&#xD;
      infections through 90-days follow-up in CRKp colonized patients will be assessed by cox&#xD;
      proportional hazards models in separate analyzes as well as the risk of development of other&#xD;
      invasive infections in the same groups through 90-days follow-up will be analyzed by the same&#xD;
      statistical method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop the risk score, variables that maintain statistical significance in the&#xD;
      multivariate regression model will be assigned a point value corresponding to the&#xD;
      beta-coefficient divided by the lowest beta-coefficient identified in the regression model,&#xD;
      and the resulting quotient will be multiplied by two and rounded to the nearest whole number.&#xD;
      Summation of the points generated by the calculated risk factors will result in a&#xD;
      quantitative score that will be assigned to each patient in the database. Optimal breakpoint&#xD;
      will be assigned by the Youden's J statistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, a decision tree will be built using the following steps: (1) identification of&#xD;
      the most appropriate single variable that can divide the dataset into 2 groups (&quot;nodes&quot;),&#xD;
      best minimized impurity of CRKp BSI or other invasive infections with CRKp status in each&#xD;
      daughter node, according to the Gini impurity criterion, (2) repetition of the branching&#xD;
      process within each daughter node and subsequent generations of nodes and (3) cessation at&#xD;
      &quot;terminal&quot; nodes when no additional variables achieve further reductions in node impurity by&#xD;
      applying pre-defined cut-off values for branching.&#xD;
