  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is a rare chronic genetic disease that mainly affects the respiratory tract&#xD;
      and the digestive system. Their management includes multi-year intravenous antibiotic&#xD;
      treatments and repeated venous sampling. The venous access is a source of difficulties that&#xD;
      nurses who take care of these patients face on a daily basis. In addition, multiple attempts&#xD;
      at punctures can induce anxiety and pain in patients. It is therefore important to limit&#xD;
      failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vein visualization technologies exist: guidance echo, portable trans lumination or infrared&#xD;
      visualization can guide venipuncture and limit failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with the guided echo or the portable trans lumination, the infrared visualization is&#xD;
      easy to use and does not pose a risk for the patient. Nevertheless, studies evaluating this&#xD;
      technique are few in chronic diseases and mainly conducted in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to show that the use of a vein illumination system (VIS) should improve the&#xD;
      peripheral venous access at the first attempt (thus limiting venous lesions) in adolescent&#xD;
      and adult patients with cystic fibrosis, and improve comfort of the patient (pain,&#xD;
      apprehension of the gesture).&#xD;

      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystic fibrosis is a rare chronic genetic disease that mainly affects the respiratory tract&#xD;
      and the digestive system. Their management includes multi-year intravenous antibiotic&#xD;
      treatments and repeated venous sampling. The venous access is a source of difficulties that&#xD;
      nurses who take care of these patients face on a daily basis. In addition, multiple attempts&#xD;
      at punctures can induce anxiety and pain in patients. It is therefore important to limit&#xD;
      failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vein visualization technologies exist: guidance echo, portable trans lumination or infrared&#xD;
      visualization can guide venipuncture and limit failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with the guided echo or the portable trans lumination, the infrared visualization is&#xD;
      easy to use and does not pose a risk for the patient. Nevertheless, studies evaluating this&#xD;
      technique are few in chronic diseases and mainly conducted in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to show that the use of a vein illumination system (VIS) should improve the&#xD;
      peripheral venous access at the first attempt (thus limiting venous lesions) in adolescent&#xD;
      and adult patients with cystic fibrosis, and improve comfort of the patient (pain,&#xD;
      apprehension of the gesture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate that the use of a vein illumination system&#xD;
      (VIS) for the placement of a peripheral venous line or venous sampling on the hand, forearm&#xD;
      or fold of the elbow improves peripheral venous access (PVA) successful on the first attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the efficacy of VIS for peripheral venous access (placement of a peripheral&#xD;
           venous line or peripheral venous sampling in the hand, forearm or elbow) on the number&#xD;
           of attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the impact of the use of SIV on the patient's pain felt during the peripheral&#xD;
           venous access procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the impact of VIS on patient anxiety prior to peripheral venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the nurses and nursing students satisfaction with the use of the VIS device&#xD;
           for peripheral venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the determinants of the success of peripheral venous access at the first&#xD;
           attempt among the characteristics of nurses and nursing students (age, year of obtaining&#xD;
           their diploma, experience within the cystic fibrosis ressource and competence center).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the nurses and nursing students satisfaction with the use of A-DIVA scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study will last 36 months. It is an open and randomized multicenter cluster&#xD;
      study, with sequential allocation of the device (stepped wedge allocation), comparing a group&#xD;
      of patients benefiting from a technique of locating the puncture site by a venous&#xD;
      illumination system for a peripheral venoux access (hand, forearm, fold of the elbow) to a&#xD;
      group of patients whose veins are identified according to the usual modality of a peripheral&#xD;
      venoux access. The cluster is defined by the Cystic Fibrosis Resource and Competence Center&#xD;
      (CRCM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patients, the use of a venous illumination system device during the peripheral venous&#xD;
      access should facilitate the success of the gesture on the first attempt, allowing to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce their pain due to multiple attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce their anxiety associated with peripheral venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preserve their venous capital This could have an impact on their care, such as making it&#xD;
           easier to consult for them and being less anxious about peripheral venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the nurses, using a venous illimunation system device could&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce their apprehension of peripheral venous access gesture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Save their time with fewer peripheral venous access are repeated. It is considered that&#xD;
           this technique will be distributed to all Cytic Fibrosis Ressource and Competence&#xD;
           Centers (CRCM) in order to improving the comfort of the chronically ill patient with&#xD;
           repeated blood tests and intravenous treatments.&#xD;
