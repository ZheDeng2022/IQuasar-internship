    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess health and quality of life outcomes in patients treated with&#xD;
      benralizumab, within a Belgian Real-World setting. To prove the clinical value of&#xD;
      benralizumab in a Real-World setting, the study will document the effect of benralizumab&#xD;
      within a time frame of 112 weeks after initiation of treatment.&#xD;

      The aim and objective of this single arm, prospective observational study is to provide&#xD;
      supporting RWE on the symptom relief of asthma patients qualified for benralizumab therapy in&#xD;
      Belgium. The PRO measures consist of the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ 6) as well as&#xD;
      Patient Global Impression of Change and Severity (PGI-C and PGI-S), healthcare resource&#xD;
      utilization (HCRU) and treatment satisfaction (TSQM-9). In addition change in daily OCS use&#xD;
      and rate of exacerbations after initiation of benralizumab in real-world setting will be&#xD;
      assessed&#xD;
