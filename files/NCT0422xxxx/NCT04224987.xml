  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MORDOR trial found that biannual distribution of azithromycin to children 1-59 months old&#xD;
      reduced child mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) released conditional guidelines&#xD;
      for this intervention, which include targeting azithromycin distributions to children 1-11&#xD;
      months of age in high mortality settings.Targeting treatment to children 1-11 months old&#xD;
      could reduce antimicrobial resistance by limiting antibiotic distributions while treating&#xD;
      children at the highest mortality risk. However, this targeted intervention has not yet been&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AVENIR mortality/resistance trial aims to assess the efficacy of age-based targeting of&#xD;
      biannual azithromycin distribution on mortality as well as determine the impact of age-based&#xD;
      targeting on antimicrobial resistance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the mortality/resistance trial, 3,350 communities in the Dosso and Tahoua regions of Niger&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) azithro 1-11: biannual oral azithromycin to&#xD;
      children 1-11 months old with biannual oral placebo to children 12-59 months old, 2) azithro&#xD;
      1-59: biannual oral azithromycin to children 1-59 months old, or 3) placebo: biannual oral&#xD;
      placebo to children 1-59 months old. Interventions will be delivered biannually through a&#xD;
      door-to-door census. Mortality will also be monitored through biannual census data&#xD;
      collection, which will be used to adaptively allocation treatment assignments after the first&#xD;
      year. Communities will retain an allocation for 4 distributions before being re-randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimicrobial resistance will be monitored using cluster sampling of treated and untreated&#xD;
      children and adults in the Dosso region.&#xD;

    <masking_description>In the mortality/resistance trial, we will use a matching placebo to mask study arm allocation. Placebo will be identical to azithromycin in appearance, smell, and packaging. Treatment assignment will be masked by assigning a series of upper- and lower-case letters to each trial, age group, and treatment arm. Those masked to study arm allocation include participants, investigators, most study personnel including study personnel administering treatment and collecting data on mortality outcomes, and laboratory personnel processing samples for resistance outcomes. Unmasked personnel include the trial biostatistician and data analyst responsible for implementing the randomization sequence and key members of Pfizer staff.</masking_description>
