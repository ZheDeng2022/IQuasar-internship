  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is required for the treatment of many pancreatic conditions, either malignant or&#xD;
      benign. Mortality of pancreatic surgery can be up to 3% even in expert centers. Morbidity is&#xD;
      high, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) being the main postoperative complication. In&#xD;
      its current definition (drain output of any measurable fluid &gt;= postoperative day 3 with&#xD;
      amylase content &gt;3 times the serum amylase activity and with clinical consequence), the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative PF is between 15 and 30 %. Most POPF resolve spontaneously but&#xD;
      when refractory POPF occurs, it may lead to severe complications. POPF severity is graded as&#xD;
      follows: grade B in case of change in medical management: infection without organ failure,&#xD;
      specific medication (total parenteral nutrition, somatostatin analogs, antibiotics),&#xD;
      persistent drainage &gt; 3 weeks, angiographic procedure for bleeding, prolonged hospital stay;&#xD;
      grade C in case of reoperation or PF-related organ failure or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific prophylactic treatment of POPF is currently recommended by clinical guidelines.&#xD;
      In clinical research, many prophylactic strategies have been attempted with partial efficacy.&#xD;
      Endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy with plastic stent placement is effective in pre-and&#xD;
      postoperative management of pancreatic fistula but with the need of a highly competent&#xD;
      interventional endoscopist. Intrapapillary botulinum toxin injection is believed to induce&#xD;
      relaxation of the pancreatic sphincter, leading to a &quot; pharmacological &quot; pancreatic&#xD;
      sphincterotomy without any morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent phase I/II prospective study has shown promising results in this indication, with no&#xD;
      clinically relevant pancreatic fistula when botulinum toxin was injected. Based on this&#xD;
      observation we hypothesize that intrapapillary botulinum toxin injection during an endoscopic&#xD;
      procedure before surgery could be effective for the prevention of post-surgical pancreatic&#xD;
      fistula&#xD;

      This study will be a prospective, multicentric, phase III, superiority, controlled,&#xD;
      randomized (1:1), open-label, clinical trial with two parallel arms (intrapapillary botulinum&#xD;
      toxin versus standard care), using a PROBE (Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point)&#xD;
      methodology.&#xD;

    <description>The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state : LEVEL 1: indicating no problem LEVEL 2: indicating slight problems LEVEL 3: indicating moderate problems LEVEL 4: indicating severe problems LEVEL 5: indicating unable to/extreme problems</description>
