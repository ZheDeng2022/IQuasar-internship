  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      xrAI (pronounced &quot;X-ray&quot;) serves as a clinical assistance tool for trained clinical&#xD;
      professionals who are interpreting chest radiographs. The tool is designed as a quality&#xD;
      control and adjunct, limited, clinical decision support tool, and does not replace the role&#xD;
      of clinical professionals. It highlights areas on chest radiographs for review by an&#xD;
      interpreting clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence&#xD;
      algorithms (xrAI) to improve the quality and efficiency in the interpretation of chest&#xD;
      radiographs by radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the addition of xrAI's analysis will reduce inter-observer variability&#xD;
      in the interpretation of chest radiographs and increase participants' sensitivity, recall,&#xD;
      and accuracy in pulmonary abnormality screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of xrAI for radiologists that interpret chest radiographs as part&#xD;
      of their daily responsibilities, the investigators have designed a randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulmonary abnormalities detected by xrAI and included in the definition of abnormal are&#xD;
      as follows: any linear scar or fibrosis, atelectasis, consolidation, abscess or cavity,&#xD;
      nodule, pleural effusion, severe cases of emphysema and COPD (mild cases with hyperinflation&#xD;
      but not significant emphysema are not flagged), and pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the causal effect of xrAI the investigators randomly assign 10 to 14 radiologists&#xD;
      to either treatment (x-ray images processed by xrAI) or control (no xrAI processing) groups.&#xD;
      Participants will only review images once. Each participant will perform 500 radiograph&#xD;
      interpretations in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will be asked to interpret the same 500 images without&#xD;
      xrAI's analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the precision of the estimate and better investigate potential differences&#xD;
      between clinical professionals, investigators block randomize the assignment of treatment or&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyse the effect of xrAI, the investigators will estimate the average treatment effect&#xD;
      (ATE) for each group by comparing the performance of the treatment and control groups using&#xD;
      randomization-based inference (Green and Gerber, 2012).&#xD;

Accuracy= (TP+FP) / (TP+FP+TN+FN)&#xD;
TP (true positives) = cases interpreted as abnormal that are abnormal; FP (false positives) = cases wrongly interpreted to be abnormal; TN (true negatives) = cases correctly interpreted to be normal; FN (false negatives) = abnormal cases wrongly interpreted as normal.</description>

    <description>Precision is defined as the probability of a radiograph being abnormal if a physician makes the determination that it is abnormal.&#xD;
Precision= TP / (TP+FP)&#xD;
