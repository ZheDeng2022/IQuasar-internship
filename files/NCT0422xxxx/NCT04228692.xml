  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic endometriosis can be responsible for urinary problems as well as symptoms of&#xD;
      clinical bladder hyperactivity and/or symptoms of bladder pain before or during miction that&#xD;
      can persist after bladder voiding. Whereas urinary problems can predate surgery due to the&#xD;
      endometrial lesions themselves, the surgery can also have functional consequences for urinary&#xD;
      function, specifically when there is trauma (incisions, per-operative coagulation) to the&#xD;
      inferior hypogastric nerve fibers and/or to the hypogastric plexus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of post-surgery urinary symptoms could be as high as 30%. The incidence of&#xD;
      voiding problems and specifically of non-obstructive voiding dysfunction can be observed in&#xD;
      17,5% of cases of patients 1-month post-surgery for deep colorectal endometriosis, and&#xD;
      persists in 4,8% of women after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for treatment of voiding problems consists of self-catheterization, as is&#xD;
      the case for all non-obstructive voiding dysfunction symptoms. This procedure considerably&#xD;
      impacts quality of life. The proper and complete voiding of the bladder remains essential in&#xD;
      order to avoid recurring urinary tract infections and pelvic static disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of persistent dysuria, the use of self-catheterization is necessary in 21% of&#xD;
      patients after surgery for deep endometriosis, for an average duration of 85 days. To date,&#xD;
      few studies have explored the management of post-operative urinary complications after&#xD;
      surgery for deep endometriosis. Pharmaceutical alternatives (alpha-blockers,&#xD;
      anticholinergics, benzodiazepines) have not proven effective and sometimes cause side&#xD;
      effects. However promising alternative treatments are being developed, specifically the&#xD;
      neuromodulation of the sacral root. This procedure has been shown effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of non-obstructive voiding dysfunction; however, it remains an invasive treatment that has&#xD;
      its load of complications and undesirable side-effects. A recent study reports favorable&#xD;
      results for the use of sacral neuromodulation in the case of persistent incomplete voiding&#xD;
      following surgery for deep colorectal endometriosis. Some studies have also suggested that&#xD;
      percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTN) could also be a treatment alternative.&#xD;
      The advantage of this procedure is that it is non-invasive and less constraining. No study&#xD;
      has yet evaluated whether PTN could also be used to treat patients with persistent voiding&#xD;
      dysfunction following surgery for deep endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study, conducted in the gynecologic department of Croix ROUSSE Hospital, Lyon (France),&#xD;
      evaluates PTN as a new treatment option for post-operative voiding dysfunction in women who&#xD;
      suffer from deep endometriosis. Our aim is to prove that the use of PTN can reduce the&#xD;
      duration of self-catheterization by 50% when compared to self-catheterization only.&#xD;
