    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects of infigratinib before surgery in treating&#xD;
      patients with upper tract urothelial cancer. Infigratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking the activities of a gene called FGFR needed for cell growth. Giving infigratinib&#xD;
      before surgery may cause the tumor to shrink, which may make the surgical procedure easier&#xD;
      and/or reduce the need for more extensive surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the tolerability of infigratinib in patients with low-grade and high-grade&#xD;
      platinum ineligible upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess tolerability in those with GFR 30-49. II. Evaluate the objective response rate&#xD;
      (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of infigratinib after 2 cycles in UTUC with&#xD;
      and without FGFR3 alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate tumor tissue FGFR3 alteration (presence/absence, alteration type, and clonal&#xD;
      status) with response and occurrence/severity of adverse events (AEs) such as&#xD;
      hyperphosphatemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate upper tract, bladder and local/distant recurrence within 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate renal function pre-treatment and after two treatments. VI. Evaluate&#xD;
      patient-reported quality of life (QOL) outcomes during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore intra-tumor heterogeneity, gene expression profiles, and changes in tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment using single cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass&#xD;
      cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) pre and post treatment to identify potential mechanisms&#xD;
      of response and/or resistance, and correlation with the occurrence/severity of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore urinary/upper tract washing FGFR3 alterations as potential biomarker for&#xD;
      detection and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) for detection of FGFR3 alterations and&#xD;
      as a predictor of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive infigratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. During weeks 8-9 (at least 48 hours after last dose of infigratinib), patients&#xD;
      undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 1 year after surgery.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have low grade UTUC undergoing nephroureterectomy or ureterectomy, or high grade UTUC&#xD;
             and not eligible for cis-platin neoadjuvant chemotherapy either due to medical&#xD;
             comorbidities (e.g., cardiac dysfunction, hearing loss, glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
             [GFR] &lt; 50), or based on &lt; 49% risk prediction of non-organ confined disease by&#xD;
             clinical nomogram&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate biopsy tissue available for mutational analysis, as determined by the&#xD;
             study pathologist, prior to enrollment. Any biopsy of index UTUC tissue available&#xD;
             within 6 weeks of enrollment may be used&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Calculated or measured creatinine clearance &gt;= 30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are able to read and/or understand the details of the study and provide written&#xD;
             evidence of informed consent as approved by Institutional Review Board&#xD;
             (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have recovered from AEs of previous systemic anti-cancer therapies to baseline or&#xD;
             grade 1, except for alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are able to swallow and retain oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan and laboratory&#xD;
             tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), must have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 7 days of the first dose of study drug. A woman is not of childbearing&#xD;
             potential if she has undergone surgical sterilization (total hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 weeks before taking&#xD;
             study drug) or if she is post-menopausal and has had no menstrual bleeding of any kind&#xD;
             including menstrual period, irregular bleeding, spotting, etc., for at least 12&#xD;
             months, with an appropriate clinical profile, and there is no other cause of&#xD;
             amenorrhea (e.g., hormonal therapy, prior chemotherapy). WOCBP and males whose sexual&#xD;
             partners are WOCBP must agree to use barrier contraception and a second form of highly&#xD;
             effective contraception (Clinical Trials Facilitation Group, 2014) while receiving&#xD;
             study drug and for 3 months following their last dose of study drug. Alternatively,&#xD;
             total abstinence is also considered a highly effective contraception method when this&#xD;
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence&#xD;
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
             not acceptable methods of contraception. Sexually active males must use a condom&#xD;
             during intercourse while taking drug and for 3 months after the last dose of the study&#xD;
             drug and should not father a child during this period. A condom is required to be used&#xD;
             also by vasectomized men as well as during intercourse with a male partner to prevent&#xD;
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have any other medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, prevent&#xD;
