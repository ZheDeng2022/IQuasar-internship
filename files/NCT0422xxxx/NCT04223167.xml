  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consumption of energy drinks has significantly increased in recent years but their&#xD;
      adverse effects are not yet efficiently known. The objective of the study is to determine the&#xD;
      acute effects of energy drink on habitual and non-habitual caffeine consumers and if caffeine&#xD;
      consumption habit causes a difference on the hemodynamic and electrophysiologic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted on 48 students selected from Aydın Adnan Menderes University. Four&#xD;
      main groups were determined according to the results of the application acceptance survey.&#xD;
      Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, breath rate, haemoglobin oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis were measured before consuming the drinks. After consuming&#xD;
      the drinks, measurements were repeated at 30 minutes and 60 minutes. In addition to this,&#xD;
      Participant's Situation Anxiety Scale was applied.&#xD;

      In this study, it is aimed to determine the acute effects of energy drink on habitual and&#xD;
      non-habitual caffeine consumers and if caffeine consumption habit causes a difference on the&#xD;
      hemodynamic and electrophysiologic parameters. In this respect, the complicated human body's&#xD;
      reactions to these beverages will be examined in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Participants Forty eight participants (16 female, 32 male) aged 18-24&#xD;
      were selected from the students which are in the first year of various faculties of Aydın&#xD;
      Adnan Menderes University. The individuals were identified by collecting the age, weight,&#xD;
      height, BMI, caffeine and energy drink consumption habit information by applicant acceptance&#xD;
      questionnaire. According to the results of applicant acceptance questionnaire, those with a&#xD;
      body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2, a systemic disease, current alcoholism and smokers&#xD;
      were not included in the study. Also, the participants who has previous adverse reactions to&#xD;
      energy drinks were excluded to prevent undesired reactions associated with this condition.&#xD;
      Based on the applicant acceptance questionnaire 12 subjects were low-habitual caffeine&#xD;
      consumers with an estimated daily intake of approximately 130 mg caffeine and named as energy&#xD;
      drink 2 (ED2) group, 12 subjects were high-habitual caffeine consumers with an estimated&#xD;
      daily intake of approximately more than 200 mg caffeine and named as energy drink 3 (ED3)&#xD;
      group, while 24 subjects were caffeine naive (energy drink 1 (ED1) (n=12) and Control (n=12))&#xD;
      . This study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional&#xD;
      Medical Ethics Committee of Adnan Menderes University (Protocol number: 2017/1211).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol All experiments were performed in a quiet and isolated room from&#xD;
      external factors with room temperature of about 20°C and relative humidity between %40 and&#xD;
      60. All participants were advised to avoid alcohol and caffeine containing foods for at least&#xD;
      72 h prior to the test and to come with an overnight (12 h) fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, breath rate, haemoglobin oxygen saturation (HOS) and BIA&#xD;
      measurements were performed from the participants before the consumption of drinks. After the&#xD;
      measurements ED1, ED2 and ED3 groups consumed 473 ml of Red Bull energy drink containing&#xD;
      151.36 mg caffeine and control group consumed the same amount of water within 5 minutes. The&#xD;
      measurements were performed again in 30 minutes and 60 minutes. Also, state-trait anxiety&#xD;
      inventory test (STAI) was used to assess the physiological stress of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured&#xD;
      indirectly by using a stethoscope (Littman Classic II, Saint Paul, USA) and aneroid&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer (Welch Allyn Tycos, New York, USA) on each participant left arm in sitting&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiography (ECG) After a 5 min resting in the sitting position ECG recordings were&#xD;
      obtained from all the individuals for 5 min in rest. Disposable Ag-AgCl electrodes were&#xD;
      placed following the Einthoven triangle configuration. ECG measurement was performed with&#xD;
      sampling frequency 200 Hz using ECG100C unit and BIOPAC Acqknowledge acquisition software&#xD;
      (Biopac System Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) connected to a personal computer. PR interval, QRS&#xD;
      complex and QTc interval values were determined from ECG recordings of the participants. QTc&#xD;
      was calculated by Bazett's formula (QTc=QT/RR). Their normal range values are 120-200 ms,&#xD;
      normal&lt;140 ms and normal &lt; 400 ms, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For acquiring the heart rate variability (HRV) time series, Pan and Thompkins algorithm was&#xD;
      used. R peaks were detected and R-R intervals are defined. The time duration between two&#xD;
      consecutive R peaks is termed as RR interval (tRR). The sample size of the HRV time series is&#xD;
      400. The heart rate (HR) is determined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HR=60/t_RR State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) It is a test developed to determine the&#xD;
      psychological stress during the study. STAI is defined as state and trait anxiety scale. This&#xD;
      test is composed of two parts (40 questions). State Anxiety scale consisting of the first 20&#xD;
      questions was used to obtain information about the acute anxiety state of participants at the&#xD;
      time of the study. Each question is evaluated using an ordinal scale (not at all=1,&#xD;
      somewhat=2, moderately=3, very much=4). The total score is obtained as the sum of each answer&#xD;
      value and gives information about the anxiety state of the participant. A total score of 50&#xD;
      or more is considered as positive pathological anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemoglobin Oxygen Saturation (HOS) HOS was measured by using a fingertip pulse oximeter on&#xD;
      the second left finger for 1 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath Rate Breath rate measurements were taken from the participants by counting the breaths&#xD;
      for one minute with the use of a stethoscope (Littman Classic II, Saint Paul, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) BIA measurements were taken by using In Body 720&#xD;
      before the consumption of the drinks and at 60th minute after the consumption. Each&#xD;
      participant was asked to stand on the body composition analyzer after undressing their&#xD;
      clothes. In Body 720 has an eight-point tactile electrode system that separately measures the&#xD;
      impedance of the arms, trunk and legs. It measures directly the amount of the intracellular&#xD;
      water (ICW), extracellular water (ECW), body fat percentage (PBF), body mass index (BMI) and&#xD;
      body metabolism rate (BMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the data was performed by using SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      for Windows, Version 14.0. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). For comparing the groups&#xD;
      first of all Shapiro-Wilk (SW) normality test was applied to determine the normality of the&#xD;
      distribution. If the result of (SW) normality test was bigger than 0.05 the data were&#xD;
      normally distributed and were analysed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with&#xD;
      Bonferroni post-test but if the result was less than 0.05 the data were not normally&#xD;
      distributed and were analysed by using Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. Repeated ANOVA&#xD;
      test was used for the comparison of different measurement time data of the same group.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). A p-value&#xD;
      of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.&#xD;
