    <textblock>
      This study will develop a new jump assessment tool for the Triple Hop Test, and will test its&#xD;
      reliability on adolescent and adult, healthy and post- anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creating a new assessment test for a jump test that incorporates the known movement&#xD;
      components that are important after an ACL injury can improve patient evaluation, decision&#xD;
      for return to sport activity and injury prevention.&#xD;

      Study population- Adults, women and men aged 20-45, boys and girls aged 12-15. uninjured&#xD;
      population: non symptomatic subjects, without major injury in their history. Injured&#xD;
      population: ACL injured subjects, 9-12 month after beginning of treatment/surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      stage 1- The investigators will create a new high-quality literature-based assessment test&#xD;
      for the triple hop test (NTHT). The test will have 10 sections, its score ranges from 0 to 14&#xD;
      points and a high score means poor performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2- Performing reliability tests between and within the testers for NTHT. The tests will&#xD;
      be done with the help of video photography of NTHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3- Performing NTHT and THT tests on healthy adult and adolescent subjects and on ACL&#xD;
      adult and adolescent subjects, assessing the NTHT by watching video performance.&#xD;
