  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, with increasing prevalence&#xD;
      associated with an ageing population. Management is challenging, and invasive catheter&#xD;
      ablation procedures are increasingly used in those with symptoms refractory to drug therapy.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, success rates from this procedure can be limited. This is partly due to&#xD;
      limitations in understanding of the mechanisms involved in arrhythmia propagation. There is&#xD;
      much interest in the role of structural changes within the muscle of the left atrium&#xD;
      resulting in scaring (known as fibrosis). This has been identified on MRI studies and&#xD;
      invasive electroanatomical mapping using voltage amplitude of recorded signals as a surrogate&#xD;
      measure of tissue properties. This however is affected by the technology used, as it does not&#xD;
      routinely incorporate the effect of heart rate on conduction properties. Furthermore,&#xD;
      although this aims to identify regions of structural changes, it does not identify more&#xD;
      dynamic patterns of conduction seen during AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to use a high density mapping catheter (Abbott Advisa HD grid (SE)), which&#xD;
      employs a novel algorithm to minimise the effect of wavefront direction on the size of&#xD;
      electrical signals. Electroanatomical mapping of the left atrium in patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation will be conducted whilst pacing at long and short cycle lengths to assess the&#xD;
      effect of pacing rate on conduction properties, assessed using signal morphology and&#xD;
      conduction velocity. The same procedure will also be carried out in 5 control patients to&#xD;
      allow comparison with normal atria. Two subgroups will also analysed. In the first the aim is&#xD;
      to compare the use of the HD grid catheter to a bipolar ablation catheter in carrying out&#xD;
      electroanatomical mapping. In the second, to correlate electrical signals obtained with&#xD;
      propagation patterns identified using the AcQMap non-contact mapping system and atrial&#xD;
      properties identified on cardiac MRI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomised mechanistic study of 35 patients, including 5 control&#xD;
      patients with normal atria and 30 patients with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5 control patients will be undergoing an elective catheter ablation for another&#xD;
      arrhythmia (likely supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)) involving a trans-septal puncture for&#xD;
      left atrial access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 30 main study participants will only be patients who are already planning to undergo a&#xD;
      catheter ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation. This will include 10 patients who are&#xD;
      undergoing elective AcQMap guided procedures, in order to correlate non-contact propagation&#xD;
      patterns with contact substrate mapping. These 10 patients will also undergo cardiac MRI&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be identified by medical staff in the outpatient clinic at the time&#xD;
      of listing for catheter ablation, or by review of patients electronically listed for this&#xD;
      procedure. If patients are in the clinic and give consent then a member of the research team&#xD;
      may approach them at this stage. If identified by medical staff through listing for the&#xD;
      procedure, they will be approached by telephone. An information leaflet will then be provided&#xD;
      by post or email (if this has not been provided in clinic) with contact details for the&#xD;
      research team. If willing to participate then formal screening and recruitment will take&#xD;
      place at the time of attendance for standard pre-procedure assessment appointments or when&#xD;
      attending for the elective procedure. Information must have been provided with sufficient&#xD;
      time for the potential participant to fully consider involvement prior to formal recruitment&#xD;
      and consent (generally expected to be at least 24 hours). It will be clear that participation&#xD;
      or choosing not to participate has no impact on proceeding with their planned procedure. As&#xD;
      the baseline assessments required involve purely a review of a participants medical history&#xD;
      and measurement of height and weight, this will be combined with the screening/recruitment&#xD;
      visit, and providing information has been provided sufficiently in advance then may be&#xD;
      undertaken at the time of attending for the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with standard practice in this institution, all AF ablation procedures will be&#xD;
      undertaken under general anaesthesia. SVT ablation will be conducted under sedation. Venous&#xD;
      access, trans-septal puncture and placement of standard electrophysiology catheters will be&#xD;
      undertaken in accordance with standard clinical care. Anticoagulation will be administered&#xD;
      following trans-septal puncture in line with standard protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will undergo electroanatomical voltage mapping (EAVM) using the Abbott&#xD;
      Advisa HD Grid (SE) mapping catheter using the orthogonal wave setting (HD wave solution). If&#xD;
      in AF at the start of the procedure then direct current cardioversion (DCCV) will be used to&#xD;
      restore sinus rhythm. This can be repeated at the discretion of the operator if initially&#xD;
      unsuccessful (including internal cardioversion if necessary). If unsuccessful then the&#xD;
      patient will no longer be included in the study. Mapping will then be undertaken during&#xD;
      bipolar pacing from the mid point of the coronary sinus catheter whilst pacing at 800ms for 4&#xD;
      beats followed by a single beat at 300ms (or the shortest captured if longer). Ablation and&#xD;
      the rest of the procedure can then be performed according to standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 30 patients undergoing AF ablation, once the initial study procedures above are&#xD;
      complete, further mapping will be conducted using either an ablation catheter (20 patients)&#xD;
      or the AcQMap system (10 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation catheter mapping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This involves using a contact force guided bipolar irrigated ablation catheter (Abbott&#xD;
      Tacticath) during the same pacing protocol. For patients presenting in sinus rhythm or AF,&#xD;
      all required mapping should be completed in the presenting rhythm followed by either AF&#xD;
      induction (using incremental burst atrial pacing) or DCCV respectively before completion of&#xD;
      mapping procedures. Ablation in line with standard clinical care will be undertaken following&#xD;
      completion of all mapping procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AcQMap guided mapping and ablation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients with persistent AF who are undergoing AcQMap guided elective catheter ablation&#xD;
      procedures will be included. All patients will undergo the same main study mapping procedure&#xD;
      outlined above. In addition, AcQMap recordings will also be obtained. Recordings will be made&#xD;
      during pacing with the same main study protocol and two 30second recordings will be&#xD;
      undertaken during AF. HD grid contact recordings will then also be obtained in regions of&#xD;
      prominent rotational and irregular conduction identified by AcQMap and ablation performed at&#xD;
      the operator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post procedure care including subsequent discharge will continue in line with standard&#xD;
      clinical practice and no study follow up is required (excluding the repeat MRI referred to&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10 participants undergoing elective AcQMap guided procedures will also undergo a cardiac&#xD;
      MRI both prior to and after the procedure. The initial scan will be within the 6 weeks prior&#xD;
      to the ablation procedure and the follow up scan will be within 3-6 months after the&#xD;
      procedure. These will be planned whenever possible to take place alongside routine hospital&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete an MRI safety questionnaire (5 minutes) prior to the scan. An&#xD;
      intravenous cannula will be inserted. Cardiac MRI will evaluate cardiac structure and&#xD;
      function, with particular focus on the left atrium. For late gadolinium enhancement imaging,&#xD;
      the total dose of gadolinium-based contrast will not exceed 0.2mmol/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the MR protocol will be approximately 60 minutes, considering&#xD;
      approximately 50 minutes of scanning time, plus approximately 10 minutes for pre/post-scan&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that a total of 35 patients will be recruited to this study. As this study is&#xD;
      not evaluating clinical outcomes of a procedure, greater numbers are not needed. This number&#xD;
      is thought to be enough to reveal any patterns in electrophysiological properties. Data&#xD;
      analysis will occur offline using anonymised datasets. Results will be collated and a report&#xD;
      compiled at the end of the study.&#xD;
