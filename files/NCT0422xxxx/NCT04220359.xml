  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide myriad of physiological parameters in patients admitted in an&#xD;
      internal medicine department, and which are defined as being in an increased risk of clinical&#xD;
      deterioration within the first 72-hours after admission. The investigators will also conduct&#xD;
      a retrospective comparison between physiological changes in patients who did deteriorate to&#xD;
      those who did not. This will form the basis for the development of an algorithm for early&#xD;
      prediction and warning of physiological and clinical deterioration during the first 72-hours&#xD;
      of admission.&#xD;

        Male and female patients 18 years and older admitted to the internal medicine department&#xD;
        and are at high-risk for clinical deterioration during the first 72-hours after admission.&#xD;
        The investigators anticipate it will include patients with acute and chronic&#xD;
        cardio-respiratory disease, systemic infections, etc.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females 18 years old and above admitted to the internal medicine department&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On admission, the primary investigator assess their risk to deteriorate during the&#xD;
             first 72 hours after admission as reasonably high&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is assigned to a &quot;monitoring bed&quot; within the department&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has signed an informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is known in advance that the patient cannot take part in the study for a 72-hours&#xD;
             period (e.g. a patient that will be taken to surgery within the next 24 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Technical inability to attach the Biobeat patch (BB-613PW) to the patients chest&#xD;
