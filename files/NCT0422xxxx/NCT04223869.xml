      A novel cytokine interleukin 34 (IL-34) is a second possible functional ligand of macrophage&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). IL-34 is secreted in different tissues&#xD;
      including: heart, brain, lung, liver, kidney, thymus, testes, ovary, small intestine,&#xD;
      prostate, colon and spleen . IL-34 shares vital functions of macrophage colony-stimulating&#xD;
      factor -1(CSF-1), and manage myeloid cell survival, differentiation and proliferation. It is&#xD;
      produced by synovial fluid, gingival fibroblast and human adipose tissue, and is controlled&#xD;
      by the transcription factor RANK and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (CJNK).&#xD;
      Additionally, the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumornecrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α) and&#xD;
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) arrange IL-34 release from gingival fibroblasts, by a mechanism&#xD;
      including nuclear factor -kB (NF-kB) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK).The&#xD;
      targeting CSF-1 merely is not adequate to inhibit the effect via CSF-1R. Moreover, neither&#xD;
      RANKL nor IL-34 solely can cause osteoclast formation which suggests that IL-34 is required&#xD;
      but not enough. IL-34 plays a crucial role in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis; the&#xD;
      osteoclasts differentiation is mediated by the same way with CSF-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies evaluated the role of IL-34 in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis&#xD;
      (CP). To the best of our knowledge, any of these studies reported the relationship between&#xD;
      GCF IL-34 level and GCF RANKL/OPG ratio in other types of periodontitis before and after&#xD;
      non-surgical periodontal therapy. This study highlights the influence of IL-34 in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of Chronic Periodontitis (CP) and Aggressive Periodontitis (AgP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to 1) identification of the impact of IL-34 on the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of periodontal disease and determine whether any relationship among the existing&#xD;
      levels of GCF IL-34 and GCF RANKL, OPG and RANKL/OPG ratio, as a mediator of bone resorption&#xD;
      2) analysis of the impact of non-surgical periodontal treatment on GCF IL-34 levels in&#xD;
      patients with CP and AgP and 3) to correlate between biochemical markers and clinical&#xD;
      recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 60 subjects: 20 who were periodontally healthy (CTRL), 20 with chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis (CP)and 20 with aggressive periodontitis (AgP). Patients with periodontitis&#xD;
      were treated with non-surgical periodontal therapy. GCF sampling procedures and clinical&#xD;
      periodontal measures were investigated at the baseline and 6 weeks after treatment. Levels of&#xD;
      IL-34, RANKL and OPG were analyzed with Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were periodontally assessed at baseline and after non-surgical periodontal&#xD;
      therapy in accordance with the following criteria; plaque index (PI)(Silness and Loe, 1964),&#xD;
      GI(Loe and Silness, 1963), PPD, clinical attachment level (CAL) and BOP (judged positive if&#xD;
      it developed within 15 s following contact). Full-mouth periapical radiographs were used to&#xD;
      determine the periodontal bone loss.The clinical measurement were taken in millimeters by a&#xD;
      single calibrated examiner (ŞBD), who was blinded to the whole study composition, from six&#xD;
      locations of each tooth (mesio-buccal, disto-buccal, mid-buccal, mesiolingual, disto-lingual,&#xD;
      and mid-lingual), by the use of a periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sites per participant were selected to collect GCF for each group. GCF samples were&#xD;
      collected from the mesiobuccal or distobuccal sites of single-rooted teeth. The sample areas&#xD;
      were isolated with cotton rolls, saliva contamination was ensured, all supragingival plaque&#xD;
      was eliminated by sterile curette and it was slightly air dried. The paper strips were&#xD;
      inserted within the crevice until resistance was encountered and then allowed to remain in&#xD;
      place for 30 seconds. The amount of GCF on the strips was measured by weighing the collected&#xD;
      liquid. The strips were placed into closed and numbered plastic eppendorf tubes. The liquid&#xD;
      was weighed again, immediately after collection, to take into account evaporation. The&#xD;
      samples consisting of saliva and blood were discarded from the study. Two available for use&#xD;
      samples from per individual were merged to make a singular sample and instantly insert in a&#xD;
      singular Eppendorf tube and freezed at _80°C until aftertime evaluation.&#xD;
