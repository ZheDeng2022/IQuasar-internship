      Clinical Consequences of Adults Presenting with Hypophosphatasia with Special Focus on Gait,&#xD;
      Bone Microstructure and Cognition: The PORTRAIT study Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inherited&#xD;
      condition that leads to weak bones. Early childhood forms are severe and easily recognized.&#xD;
      Adult forms can vary in severity. HPP is often missed by doctors or confused with&#xD;
      osteoporosis. This is important because the usual osteoporosis treatments may be harmful to&#xD;
      patients with HPP and increase the risk of broken bones. One of the reasons it is missed is a&#xD;
      lack of research describing the typical features of HPP, so doctors don't recognize the&#xD;
      signs, and don't know when or how to test for it. The PORTRAIT Study will help increase&#xD;
      understanding of the burden of disease of HPP on patients. The aim is to examine the effects&#xD;
      of HPP on bone structure and strength, physical functioning, cognition, and quality of life.&#xD;
      Researchers will study adults with HPP and healthy age- and gender-matched individuals. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected after an overnight fast. Researchers will use these samples to&#xD;
      measure markers of HPP and bone health. Medical history and lifestyle, quality of life and&#xD;
      cognitive function will be assessed using questionnaires. Bone mineral density, body&#xD;
      composition and bone structure and strength will be measured using dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry and high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Physical&#xD;
      functioning will be assessed as participants perform a series of physical performance and&#xD;
      gait tests. Magnetic resonance images of the lower limbs will be matched-up with the physical&#xD;
      functioning data to create patient-specific musculoskeletal models. Cognitive function tests&#xD;
      will be performed to assess cognition and mental health. To reveal the burden of disease of&#xD;
      HPP, the data collected from patients with HPP will be compared to that collected from&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is caused by mutations in the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
      (TNSALP) gene with deficiency in TNSALP activity. This leads to accumulation of inorganic&#xD;
      pyrophosphate, a potent inhibitor of bone mineralization, which causes rickets and&#xD;
      osteomalacia, and of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) which causes seizures in neonates but no&#xD;
      harm in adults. HPP is also associated with muscle weakness (which is very severe in&#xD;
      perinatal and infantile forms) and early tooth loss. The most severe forms of HPP present in&#xD;
      infancy, and were fatal until the recent development of TNSALP enzyme replacement therapy,&#xD;
      Asfotase Alpha. Adult-onset HPP is less severe. It often presents with fractures of the femur&#xD;
      or metatarsals, and so is likely to be misdiagnosed as osteoporosis. Correct diagnosis of HPP&#xD;
      is important as the usual osteoporosis treatments, for example bisphosphonates, may be&#xD;
      harmful and increase the risk of fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is an imaging technique&#xD;
      that allows the detailed assessment of BMD, microstructure and strength. HR-pQCT could reveal&#xD;
      important information about the effects of HPP on bone microstructural properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPP can also have a significant effect on physical functioning. In infantile HPP, motor&#xD;
      function delay is usual but in adult-onset HPP effects on physical functioning are less&#xD;
      apparent. These effects can be explored through the use of physical function testing and&#xD;
      clinical gait analysis. Cognitive function may be affected by low levels of or inactivity of&#xD;
      ALP in the neural tissue (TNALP). Patients with HPP have reported forgetfulness and&#xD;
      'fogginess'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to examine the effects of HPP on (i) bone structure and strength,&#xD;
      (ii) physical functioning, (iii) cognition and (iv) quality of life (QoL). Researchers will&#xD;
      study adults with HPP and healthy individuals. The results will help to determine if there&#xD;
      should be a trial of a new drug treatment for adults with HPP. This study forms part of our&#xD;
      wider programme of research into HPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will recruit 7 patients with childhood- or adult-presenting HPP (cases), who are&#xD;
      known to the Metabolic Bone Clinic at the Metabolic Bone Centre (MBC), Northern General&#xD;
      Hospital (NGH), Sheffield. Researchers will also recruit 7 healthy controls matched to the&#xD;
      cases by gender and age. Researchers will approach first degree relatives (with their&#xD;
      permission) of patients with HPP to offer them genetic testing for HPP. If HPP is confirmed,&#xD;
      approach these first degree relatives to invite them to participate in the study, Fasting&#xD;
      blood samples will be obtained for measurement of serum or plasma bone alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
      (bone ALP), PLP, procollagen type I N-propeptide (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) and&#xD;
      genetic testing (if not already performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history and lifestyle, quality of life and cognitive function will be assessed using&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, proximal femur and whole body will be&#xD;
      measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Whole body composition will also be&#xD;
      determined by DXA. Trabecular and cortical BMD and bone microstructure and strength will be&#xD;
      examining using HR-pQCT of the distal radius and tibia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical functioning will also be assessed. Participants will undergo a series of physical&#xD;
      performance tests/gait analysis tests. Chair rises (sit to stand), a timed up and go test. A&#xD;
      10 m walking test and a 4 stair climb will be used to assess muscle strength. A modified&#xD;
      performance oriented mobility assessment-gait (MPOMA-G) will also be performed. Recordings of&#xD;
      the kinematics, ground reaction forces, electromyography (EMG) data and muscle function will&#xD;
      be made using a motion capture system. This will allow the quantification of joint kinematics&#xD;
      and kinetics and of muscular pattern activation during the execution of a number of different&#xD;
      motor skills. Lower limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with the participants dressed in a&#xD;
      set of MRI visible markers, will allow the registration of the MRI and physical&#xD;
      functioning/gait data enhancing the participant's specific musculoskeletal modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive function tests (a Montreal Cognitive Assessment) will be performed to assess the&#xD;
      burden of disease of HPP on cognitive and mental health as forgetfulness and 'fogginess' have&#xD;
      been reported by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the various assessments performed will be compared between the age-gender&#xD;
      matched cases and controls using paired samples t-tests. For each test, the mean difference,&#xD;
      95% confidence interval and associated p-value will be reported. In the event of the&#xD;
      normality assumption of the paired samples t-test being violated comparisons will be made&#xD;
      using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. The burden of disease of HPP on bone&#xD;
      quality (i.e. BMD, bone structure and strength), mental health, cognition, QoL, pain,&#xD;
      physical functioning and gait will be examined using Spearman Rank Correlation.&#xD;
