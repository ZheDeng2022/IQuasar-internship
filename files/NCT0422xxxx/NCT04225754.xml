  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging of the population is a reality in our society, with a strong increase in the number&#xD;
      of elderly patients hospitalized for heart failure in our institutions. Heart failure in&#xD;
      these patients is more present than to younger patients, with preserved ejection fraction&#xD;
      form (HFpEF). Aging is responsible for the onset of senile amyloid cardiomyopathy. This&#xD;
      pathology is still imperfectly understood and its link with the increase in the frequency of&#xD;
      HFpEF is important. In addition, specific treatments have just shown their effectiveness. It&#xD;
      is therefore urgent to better identify the prognostic predictive parameters of this&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological involvement of the coronary microcirculation responsible for a true&#xD;
      microvascular coronary disease (CMVD) has been described as predictive factor in all&#xD;
      cardiomyopathies. However the implementation of preventive strategies and / or therapeutic of&#xD;
      the coronary microcirculation dysfunction are limited because we lack of diagnostic tests&#xD;
      available and applicable to large cohorts of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team INSERM U1039 Radiopharmaceutiques Biocliniques in collaboration with the laboratory&#xD;
      GIPSA-lab (Grenoble Images Speech Signal Automatique), laboratory specialized in the signal&#xD;
      analysis, has developed a new method of analysis allowing to measure the coronary&#xD;
      microcirculation dysfunction usable in SPECT thanks to the measurement of a myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion heterogeneity index (IHPM) (patented technique). The 3C registry (NCT03479580) is a&#xD;
      registry studying the prevalence and cardiovascular prognosis of macro and microcirculatory&#xD;
      coronary artery disease using the latest coronary evaluation techniques in patient with&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. This registry deployed on interventional cardiology centers on the Alpine Arc&#xD;
      is therefore also addressed to patients with senile cardiomyopathy. The data collected will&#xD;
      provide a better understanding of the factors influencing the prognosis of senile&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and the prognostic contribution of the measurement of the IHPM will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
