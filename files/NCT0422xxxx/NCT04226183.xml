    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a condition that increased requirements of energy and oxygen, and if this&#xD;
      condition is not maximally that can lead oxidative stress and produce free radicals which is&#xD;
      affect in the pregnancy process. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level in pregnant women is higher than&#xD;
      non-pregnant women. Exercise is one way to neutralize the free radical. The aim of this study&#xD;
      was analyzed effect of treatment natural antioxidants after exercise which was pregnancy&#xD;
      workout to MDA level in the third trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a true experimental study. There were 24 prenatal pregnant women and separated&#xD;
      to 3 groups, which were 8 prenatal pregnant women without pregnancy workout as a control&#xD;
      group, 8 prenatal pregnant women with pregnancy workout but without natural antioxidant&#xD;
      consume as a positive control group, and 8 prenatal pregnant women with natural antioxidant&#xD;
      consume after pregnancy workout as a treatment group. The antioxidant compounds given in this&#xD;
      study were guava juice that contains vitamin C. MDA levels was analyzed by&#xD;
      spectrophotometric. Comparison between groups was done by one way ANOVA test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a condition that is vulnerable to all kinds - stress resulting in changes in&#xD;
      physiology and metabolic function. In pregnancy there is also an increase in energy and&#xD;
      oxygen requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic process can increase require of the oxygen and if it is not available as well&#xD;
      as unmaximal used can causes the formation of oxidative stress and produces excessive free&#xD;
      radicals which ultimately, that affected in the saferity of a pregnancy process. The&#xD;
      imbalance between antioxidants and free radicals in pregnancy prosses are causes pathological&#xD;
      and complications changes in pregnancy. This kind of biochemical marker of antioxidants and&#xD;
      oxidants is very useful in observing complications that may arise in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment given is expected to eliminate complaints that arise while exercise during&#xD;
      pregnancy can prevent the formation of free radicals, but exercise must be given in&#xD;
      accordance with the ability of pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exercise or exercise in pregnancy can maintain excess weight gain, prevent diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, and shorten labor time. Sports is one way to neutralize the formation of free&#xD;
      radicals because by doing physical activity, excessive oxygen can be used to produce energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased free radicals are characterised by an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) as a&#xD;
      biochemical markers. Malondialdehyde (MDA) which is the output of lipid peroxidation prosses&#xD;
      that measured to determine the presence of oxidative stress due to damage by free radicals.&#xD;
      The resent study was found that MDA levels in pregnant women were higher compared to&#xD;
      non-pregnant women. Increased MDA levels are in line with the increase in gestational age,&#xD;
      from the first, second, and third trimesters. Study was also found that there was a&#xD;
      significant increase in MDA levels accompanied by a decrease in non-enzymatic antioxidants,&#xD;
      such as Vitamin-E, Vitamin-C, and Vitamin-A in pregnant women with hypertension. Moreover&#xD;
      this study assums that was &quot;Giving Antioxidant to decrease Malondialdehyde (MDA) in the third&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy&quot;. futher more the aims of this study was analyzed effect of natural&#xD;
      antioxidants treatment after exercise to MDA level in the third trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a experimental study. This study was located in the several clinics midwife&#xD;
      practice, Community Health Centers (Puskesmas) in Palembang and Bio Sains Riset Laboratory&#xD;
      Palembang from August to October 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study was approved informed consent from all participans as well as ethical clearance&#xD;
      approval number is 007/UP-ETIK/I/2016. This study was obtained 24 prenatal pregnant women&#xD;
      that separated to 3 groups, which were 8 prenatal pregnant women without pregnancy workout&#xD;
      exercise as a control group, 8 prenatal pregnant women with pregnancy workout exercise as a&#xD;
      positive control group and 8 prenatal pregnant women with consume natural antioxidants after&#xD;
      pregnancy workout exercise as a treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antioxidant compounds given in this study were natural vitamin C from 100 ml guava juice&#xD;
      without additionaly sugar, 5 cc syringe, cotton, alcohol, syringe, hanscoon, EDTA tube,&#xD;
      serum, TCA 5%, Na thiobarbiturat 0,65%, MDA standart, and aquades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectrophotometric assay used to measure the MDA levels in the Bio Sains Riset Laboratory,&#xD;
      Palembang and followed the essay of protocol kit from manufacture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between groups used by one way ANOVA test, that was considered significant if p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05. All statistical analyses were done by SPPS for Windows version 16.0.&#xD;
