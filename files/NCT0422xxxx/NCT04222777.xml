      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological motion of the cervical spine is a subject of interest for medical specialists.&#xD;
      Segmental range of motion (sROM) has been most commonly used to define motion but inter- and&#xD;
      intra-variability is large. Therefore, a sequence of segmental contributions in the lower&#xD;
      cervical spine during the second half of extension has been defined in healthy participants&#xD;
      (uniform in 80-90%). The mean age of these participants was 23 years. Since cervical&#xD;
      degenerative disc disease (CDDD) occurs more often in elderly patients, it is of paramount&#xD;
      importance to study whether this sequence remains present during aging, regardless of losing&#xD;
      0.11 degrees of sROM each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate if the normal sequence of segmental contributions in the lower cervical spine&#xD;
      during the second half of extension (C4-C5 followed by C5-C6, and then C6- C7) is also&#xD;
      present in asymptomatic participants between 55 and 70 years of age by using cinematographic&#xD;
      recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundamental research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eleven asymptomatic participants between 55 and 70 years of age, without a medical history of&#xD;
      neck problems, with a score of 4 or less on the Neck Disability Index (NDI), and without&#xD;
      severe degenerative changes based on a score of 3 or less on the radiological Kellgrens'&#xD;
      classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two flexion and extension cinematographic recordings of the cervical spine with a two-week&#xD;
      interval between recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Defining the cervical spines' physiological motion pattern by analysing the&#xD;
      normal sequence of segmental contributions in the lower cervical spine (C4-C5 followed by&#xD;
      C5-C6, and then C6-C7) during the second halfof extension in asymptomatic participants&#xD;
      between 55 and 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: Determine sROM of C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 by analysing the flexion and&#xD;
      extension cinematographic recordings in asymptomatic participants between 55 and 70 years of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Participants receive cinematographic recordings twice. There will be no&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Physiological motion of the cervical spine is a subject of&#xD;
      interest for medical specialists. Although the term 'physiological motion' is commonly used,&#xD;
      a proper definition has been lacking for a long time. Segmental range of motion (sROM, e.g.&#xD;
      the amount of sagittal rotation in a segment between maximal flexion and maximal extension&#xD;
      position of the entire cervical spine) is most commonly used to study motion. SROMs, however,&#xD;
      suffer from large intra- and interindividual variability. Therefore, in the lower cervical&#xD;
      spine, Boselie et al have recently described a consistent sequence of segmental contribution&#xD;
      in sagittal rotation during flexion and extension in 20 healthy participants. This was based&#xD;
      on historic reports. The mean age of the healthy participants was 23 years (SD 2.65, range&#xD;
      18-55 years). They showed that the sequence of segmental contributions in the lower cervical&#xD;
      spine during the second half of extension of the entire cervical spine and head was uniform&#xD;
      in 80-90% of the healthy participants. The sequence of segmental contributions was C4-C5&#xD;
      followed by C5-C6, and then C6-C7. Also, they described a group of single level cervical&#xD;
      degenerative disc disease (CDDD) patients in which this sequence was present in only one&#xD;
      patient (10%). This is the first method described which can reliably differentiate between&#xD;
      normal or abnormal movement of the cervical spine in an individual subject. CDDD is&#xD;
      degeneration of a cervical intervertebral disc and/or the adjoining vertebral bodies leading&#xD;
      to cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy. CDDD occurs more often in elderly patients (&gt; 50&#xD;
      years of age) and due to aging of the population this will become a larger problem in the&#xD;
      future. Age has been shown to be associated with a 0.11 degree decrease of sROM per year,&#xD;
      independent of degeneration. Given that there are five levels in the subaxial cervical spine,&#xD;
      there is an associated five degrees decrease in motion of the total subaxial cervical spine&#xD;
      for every 10 years of ageing. It remains unclear whether the normal sequence of segmental&#xD;
      contributions in the lower cervical spine is also present in asymptomatic elderly. By&#xD;
      confirming the normal sequence in this group, this can be used to determine abnormal motion&#xD;
      in elderly patients suffering from CDDD. The intention is to use this in future research in&#xD;
      patients with cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy undergoing surgery to compare the outcomes&#xD;
      of different types of surgery (e.g. cervical arthroplasty or anterior cervical discectomy&#xD;
      with fusion) and to compare the influence of the type of surgery on normal motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. OBJECTIVES Primary Objective: To investigate whether the normal sequence of segmental&#xD;
      contributions in the lower cervical spine during the second half of extension (C4-C5 followed&#xD;
      by C5-C6, and then C6-C7), which is present in young asymptomatic controls, is similar in&#xD;
      asymptomatic participants between 55 and 70 years of age by using cinematographic recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To determine sROM of C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 by analysing the flexion&#xD;
      and extension cinematographic recordings in asymptomatic participants between 55 and 70 years&#xD;
      of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY DESIGN This is a fundamental research project in which asymptomatic elderly&#xD;
      participants without neck pain or severe degenerative changes will be included. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited at Zuyd Hogeschool Sittard/Heerlen and Zuyderland Medical Center Sittard-&#xD;
      Geleen/Heerlen by using posters notifying about the study. They can contact the researcher by&#xD;
      email, who will inform them verbally and in writing. Informed consent will be signed if they&#xD;
      meet the in- and exclusion criteria and if they are willing to participate. Flexion and&#xD;
      extension of the cervical spine has been analysed through sagittal cinematographic recordings&#xD;
      before. This was done in two groups with ten healthy participants in each group, from which&#xD;
      an adequate analysis could be performed. Taking a possible loss to follow up of 10% into&#xD;
      account, our study population will consist of 11 participants. No interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed. Each participant receives flexion and extension cinematographic recording twice to&#xD;
      determine reproducibility and consistency of sequence between the two time points (T1 and&#xD;
      T2). Recordings will be performed with an interval of two weeks, resulting in 22&#xD;
      cinematographic recordings. Inclusion is expected to take approximately three months.&#xD;
      Possible participants have to complete the Neck Disability Index (NDI), participants scoring&#xD;
      above 4/50 points will be excluded (which means they would be no longer be classified as 'no&#xD;
      disability due to neck problems'). A lateral X-ray of the cervical spine will be made, which&#xD;
      will be scored using Kellgrens' classification by two neurosurgeons to avoid inclusion of&#xD;
      participants with severe degenerative changes. Participants with a Kellgren score (KS) of&#xD;
      four will be excluded. A KS score of four indicates severe degenerative changes such as&#xD;
      severe narrowing of the disc space, severe sclerosis of the vertebral plates, or multiple&#xD;
      large osteophytes. Participants with KS between zero and three will be included, indicating&#xD;
      no, minimal, or moderate degenerative changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDY POPULATION Population (base) Male and female participants between 55 and 70 years of&#xD;
      age, without a history of neck complaints, an NDI score of 4 or less and a KS of 3 or less&#xD;
      will be included. Participants will be recruited using posters in Zuyd Hogeschool&#xD;
      Sittard/Heerlen and Zuyderland Medical Center Sittard- Geleen/Heerlen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Sample size calculation is based on previous articles using the same&#xD;
      method of cinematographic recordings to analyse motion of the cervical spine. Our study&#xD;
      population will consist of 11 participants, assuming a possible loss to follow-up of 10%.&#xD;
      Flexion and extension cinematographic recordings are acquired twice for each participant with&#xD;
      an interval of two weeks in order to determine reproducibility and consistency of sequence of&#xD;
      motion between two time points (T1 and T2). If there is no loss to follow-up and all&#xD;
      cinematographic recordings are of good quality in the first 10 participants, the study will&#xD;
      be ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 5.1 Investigational product/treatment Cinematographic recordings&#xD;
      during flexion and extension of the cervical spine in asymptomatic elderly participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Use of co-intervention Not applicable.&#xD;

      5.3 Name and description of investigational product Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Summary of findings from non-clinical studies Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Summary of findings from clinical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a method was developed to determine the ROM in the sagittal plane of the cervical&#xD;
      spine using a fluoroscopy video of flexion-extension movement. The total ROM (tROM) and the&#xD;
      sROM in 10 healthy participants (19-22 years) was investigated. The tROM for anteflexion is&#xD;
      118.1 degrees and 114.3 degrees for retroflexion. Several new and very important insights&#xD;
      have been published in this study. The maximum sROM is not necessarily reflected comparing&#xD;
      the position of the vertebra in full flexion to its position in full extension. Moreover,&#xD;
      sROM differs depending on execution of the motion from flexion to extension or the other way&#xD;
      around and sROM can differ with time. A difference in excess of five degrees for the same&#xD;
      segment in the same individual can be recorded. The cadence of movement in the cervical spine&#xD;
      was also described. During flexion and extension, motion of the cervical vertebrae follows a&#xD;
      general pattern which is complex and counter- intuitive. They conclude that tROM and sROM are&#xD;
      unsuitable to be used as a parameter of cervical spine mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review that systematically addressed contemporary knowledge about the mechanical behaviour&#xD;
      of cervical vertebrae and soft-tissue of the cervical spine, under conditions that result in&#xD;
      minor of major injuries. The results are collected from multiple studies that have measured&#xD;
      sROM of individual joints of the cervical spine. It is emphasised that, even under normal&#xD;
      conditions, sROM is not consistent either in time or according to the direction of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sROM and KS with flexion/ extension radiographs were assessed and the relation to clinical&#xD;
      variables in 195 patients was determined (age 15-93 years, 62 males and 133 females).&#xD;
      Interobserver reliabilities for assessing KS (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.81) and&#xD;
      sROM (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.72) were good to excellent. Age had a significant&#xD;
      negative association with sROM at C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, amounting to a total of&#xD;
      five degrees decrease in subaxial cervical ROM every 10 years. KS at the level of interest&#xD;
      had a significant negative association with sROM at C2-C3, C3-C4, C4- C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7.&#xD;
      KS at the inferior segment had a significant positive association with sROM at C2-C3, C3-C4,&#xD;
      and C4-C5. For every point increase in KS at a given level, there was an associated 1.2&#xD;
      degrees decrease in sROM at that level, and 0.8 degrees increase in sROM at the level above.&#xD;
      Gender had a significant association with sROM only at C2-C3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-invasive infrared system Polaris was used to quantify the 3D tROM of the cervical spine&#xD;
      in 140 asymptomatic volunteers (age 20-93 years, 70 males and 70 females). The standard error&#xD;
      of measurement for the maximum tROM in 3D space planes was 5%. Gender had no significant&#xD;
      influence on the 3D cervical tROM. Age had a significant influence on all main movements&#xD;
      showing 0.55 - 0.79 degrees magnitude decrease per decade per segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Later, an automatic fast and precise method for tracking cervical vertebrae in fluoroscopy&#xD;
      videos of flexion- extension movement of the cervical spine was developed. The method relies&#xD;
      only on a rough selection of template areas of each vertebra in a single frame of the video&#xD;
      sequence, no contours need to be extracted and no vertebra segmentation is required. Tracking&#xD;
      is done with a normalized gradient field, using only the gradient orientations as features.&#xD;
      Results show that the algorithm is robust and able to track the vertebrae accurately, even if&#xD;
      they are partially occluded or if a disc prosthesis is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clear definition of the normal sequence of segmental contributions in the cervical spine&#xD;
      using extension cinematographic recordings (ECRs) was defined. They analysed healthy&#xD;
      participants (n=20) and patients with CDDD (n=10). ECRs were more consistent than flexion&#xD;
      cinematographic recordings (FCRs) and were therefore used to define &quot;normal&quot; motion. A&#xD;
      consistent sequence of contribution of sagittal rotation of the three lower cervical motion&#xD;
      segments C4-C7 was especially identified in the last phase of extension in healthy&#xD;
      participants. The first peak was found for C4- C5, followed by C5-C6 and finally in C6- C7.&#xD;
      Sensitivity, specificity, and reliability were calculated. Reliability of scoring as normal&#xD;
      or abnormal is high (Fleiss kappa of 0.80-0.84, range of 95% CI: 0.66- 0.98). Sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity are also high, with an average sensitivity of 90% (range of 95% CI: 78.4 -&#xD;
      99.8%), nd an average specificity of 85% (range of 95% CI: 72.9 - 96.4%). This is the first&#xD;
      described method which can reliably differentiate between normal or abnormal movement of the&#xD;
      cervical spine in an individual subject.5.6 Summary of known and potential risks and benefits&#xD;
      Flexion- and extension cinematographic recordings are made using the Philips Allura Xper FD20&#xD;
      X-ray system. Radiation dose per cinematographic recording, determined by radiation experts,&#xD;
      will be around 0.084 mSv. Participants will perform cinematographic recordings twice,&#xD;
      resulting in a total radiation dose of 0.168 mSv. Moreover, before definitive inclusion in&#xD;
      the study a lateral X-ray of the cervical spine will be performed to determine eligibility&#xD;
      resulting in a radiation dose of 0.0096 mSv. Average radiation dose per participant will&#xD;
      therefore be 0.1776 mSv. This amount of radiation can be categorized in category IIa using&#xD;
      the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) guidelines about risks of radiation dosage (0.1 to 1&#xD;
      mSv) 11. This category includes moderate risk which can be justified if there is a potential&#xD;
      health benefit for future patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. METHODS 6.1 Study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.1 Main study parameter/endpoint To investigate whether the normal sequence of segmental&#xD;
      contributions in the lower cervical spine during the second half of extension (C4-C5 followed&#xD;
      by C5-C6, and then C6-C7), which is present in young asymptomatic controls, is similar in&#xD;
      asymptomatic participants between 55 and 70 years of age by using cinematographic recordings.&#xD;
      Recordings will be made at two occasions, with an interval of two weeks. These will then be&#xD;
      analysed within one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.2 Secondary study parameters/endpoints (if applicable) Analysing sROM of C4-C5, C5-C6 and&#xD;
      C6-C7 by analysing the flexion and extension cinematographic recordings in asymptomatic&#xD;
      participants between 55 and 70 years of age. Recordings will be made at two occasions, with&#xD;
      an interval of two weeks. These will then be analysed within one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Randomisation, blinding and treatment allocation Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Study procedures This study does not use invasive procedures, but is not regular care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations before inclusion in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral X-ray of the cervical spine to determine Kellgrens' classification. The KS will be&#xD;
      determined by two neurosurgeons and is a scoring method to determine severity of degenerative&#xD;
      disc disease, using five gradations :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 0: absence of degeneration in the disc. Grade 1: minimal anterior osteophytosis. Grade&#xD;
      2: definite anterior osteophytosis, possible narrowing of the disc space, some sclerosis of&#xD;
      the vertebral plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 3: moderate narrowing of the disc space, sclerosis of the vertebral plates,&#xD;
      osteophytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 4: severe narrowing of the disc space, severe sclerosis of the vertebral plates,&#xD;
      multiple large osteophytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire the NDI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NDI is a modification of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index. It is a patient-&#xD;
      completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain,&#xD;
      personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and&#xD;
      recreation. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain'&#xD;
      and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. Al the points can be summed to a total score. The test&#xD;
      can be interpreted as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage. 0 points&#xD;
      or 0% means: no activity limitations, 50 points or 100% means complete activity limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cinematographic recordings: participants are seated on a crutch, adjustable in height, with&#xD;
      their neck, shoulders and head free. Before recordings are made, participants will be taught&#xD;
      to perform the prescribed flexion and extension movement on about 16 seconds using a&#xD;
      metronome. Participants are placed on the crutch with their shoulder's perpendicular to the&#xD;
      image intensifier to obtain sagittal images from the occiput till C7. As soon as the&#xD;
      recording is started, the participant is instructed to move his head in the sagittal plane&#xD;
      from maximal ex- tension to maximal flexion, without moving the upper part of the body. It is&#xD;
      important that the participants shoulders are kept as low as possible while making the&#xD;
      recordings to ensure that all the cervical vertebrae are visible. The movement of the&#xD;
      cervical spine should be as fluent as possible to prevent for sudden large rotations and&#xD;
      translations between consecutive frames. The cinematographic recordings will be made twice&#xD;
      with an interval of two weeks using the Philips Alura Xper FD20 X- ray system. To stay below&#xD;
      the limit of 1 mSv per participant, the 0.9 mm Cu + 1 mm Al filter will be used for the&#xD;
      entire study. The Alura Xper automatically selects correct tube voltage, with an expected&#xD;
      maximum around 70-80 kV for cervical cinematographic recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Withdrawal of individual subjects Participants can cease study participation at any time&#xD;
      for any reason if they wish to do so, without any consequences. If participants leave the&#xD;
      study before the second recording, only the first recording will be included and analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers cannot decide to withdraw participants from the study, unless participants do not&#xD;
      respond to calls before the first cinematographic recording is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal If a participant withdraws before the&#xD;
      first cinematographic recording is made, researchers are allowed to replace this&#xD;
      participant.cal cinematographic recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6 Follow-up of subjects withdrawn from treatment Participants who withdraw from the study&#xD;
      will not be actively recalled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.7 Premature termination of the study Interim analysis will not be performed, so there will&#xD;
      be no reason to terminate the study prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. SAFETY REPORTING 7.1 Temporary halt for reasons of subject safety In accordance to section&#xD;
      10, subsection 4, of the WMO, the investigator will suspend the study if there is sufficient&#xD;
      ground that continuation of the study will jeopardise subject health or safety. The sponsor&#xD;
      will notify the accredited METC without undue delay of a temporary halt including the reason&#xD;
      for such an action. The study will be suspended pending a further positive decision by the&#xD;
      accredited METC. The investigator will take care that all subjects are kept informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 AEs, SAEs and SUSARs 7.2.1 Adverse events (AEs) Adverse events are defined as any&#xD;
      undesirable experience occurring to a participant during the study, whether or not considered&#xD;
      related to experimental intervention. All adverse events reported spontaneously by the&#xD;
      participant or observed by the investigator or his staff will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2.2 Serious adverse events (SAEs) A serious adverse event is any untoward medical&#xD;
      occurrence or effect that results in: Death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is life threatening (at the time of event). Requires hospitalization or prolongation of&#xD;
      existing inpatients' hospitalization. Results in persistent or significant disability or&#xD;
      incapacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Any other important medical event that did not&#xD;
      result in any of the outcomes listed above due to medical or surgical intervention but could&#xD;
      have been based upon appropriate judgement by the investigator. An elective hospital&#xD;
      admission will not be considered as a serious adverse event. The investigator will report all&#xD;
      SAEs to the sponsor without undue delay of obtaining knowledge of the events. Sponsor will&#xD;
      report these SAEs through the web portal ToetsingOnline to the accredited METC that approved&#xD;
      the protocol, within 7 days for SAEs that result in death or life- threatening event,&#xD;
      followed by a period of maximum of 8 days to complete the initial preliminary report. All&#xD;
      other SAEs will be reported within a period of maximum 15 days after sponsor has first&#xD;
      knowledge of the serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Follow-up of adverse events All AEs will be followed until they have abated, or until a&#xD;
      stable situation has been reached. Depending on event, follow up may require additional tests&#xD;
      or medical procedures as indicated, and/or referral to general physician or medical&#xD;
      specialist. SAEs need to be reported till end of study (last follow up moment for last&#xD;
      subject), as defined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 8.1 Primary study parameter(s) The primary study parameter is to&#xD;
      define if the normal sequence of segmental contributions in the lower cervical spine during&#xD;
      the second half of extension (C4-C5 followed by C5-C6, and then C6-C7) is present in&#xD;
      asymptomatic participants between 55 and 70 years of age by using cinematographic recordings.&#xD;
      Participants are seated on a crutch, adjustable in height, with their neck, shoulders and&#xD;
      head free. As soon as the recording is started, the participant is instructed to move his&#xD;
      head in the sagittal plane from maximal extension to maximal flexion, without moving the&#xD;
      upper part of the body, in about 16 seconds. Participants perform this procedure twice with&#xD;
      an interval of two weeks. Images will be analysed using computer software that uses an&#xD;
      algorithm to follow motion of the vertebrae during complete flexion and extension. This will&#xD;
      be done by two researchers for 4 cinematographic recordings to determine reproducibility&#xD;
      using two way mixed, absolute agreement, intra-class correlation coefficient. Graphs will be&#xD;
      made for flexion and extension in which segmental rotation between each pair of successive&#xD;
      frames of each individual segment within C4 to C7 will be plotted against the cumulative&#xD;
      rotation in segments C4 to C7 together (block C4-C7) to describe the sequence of segmental&#xD;
      contributions during flexion and extension. These graphs will be made and analysed for each&#xD;
      individual participant to determine if the normal sequence of segmental contributions is&#xD;
      present or absent. T1 will be tested against T2 using coefficient of variation and&#xD;
      intra-individual standard deviation to determine if the defined sequence is consistent&#xD;
      between two recordings in the intra-individual variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Secondary study parameter(s) The secondary study parameter is defining the sROM of C4-C5,&#xD;
      C5-C6 and C6- C7 by analysing the flexion and extension cinematographic recordings in&#xD;
      asymptomatic participants between 55 and 70 years of age. Rotation within a segment is&#xD;
      calculated between each pair of successive frames to be able to determine the sequence of&#xD;
      segmental contributions. All these small rotations from extension to flexion (or vice versa)&#xD;
      can be summated to calculate sROM for that motion segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1 Regulation statement This research is conducted according to&#xD;
      principles enshrined in the Declaration of Helsinki (3th edition 2013) and in accordance with&#xD;
      the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO, version 1 July 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 Recruitment and consent Participants will be recruited from Zuyd Hogeschool&#xD;
      Sittard/Heerlen and Zuyderland Medical Center Sittard-Geleen/Heerlen using posters. Possible&#xD;
      participants have to contact the researcher by email if they are interested in participation.&#xD;
      Further information will be given verbally and in writing, followed by a thinking time of&#xD;
      seven days. When people are willing to participate and meet the inclusion criteria, informed&#xD;
      consent will be signed during the first meeting between researcher and participant.&#xD;
      Participants can terminate their participation at all times, without giving a reason. For any&#xD;
      questions regarding the study, an independent physician is available throughout the duration&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Objection by minors or incapacitated subjects (if applicable) Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Benefits and risks assessment, group relatedness Participants do not directly benefit&#xD;
      from participating in this study. They make a contribution to knowledge in the field of&#xD;
      motion of the cervical spine in the elderly population. Increased knowledge of physiological&#xD;
      motion enables us to recognize abnormal motion in future. Phantom measurements of the Alura&#xD;
      Xper in Zuyderland Sittard were used to determine radiation dosage. According to radiation&#xD;
      experts, radiation dosage per cinematographic recording will be 0.084 mSv. Participants will&#xD;
      perform cinematographic recordings twice, resulting in a total radiation dose of 0.168 mSv.&#xD;
      Moreover, before definitive inclusion in the study a lateral X-ray of the cervical spine will&#xD;
      be performed to determine eligibility resulting in a radiation dose of 0.0096 mSv. Total&#xD;
      radiation dose per participant will therefore be 0.1776 mSv. This amount of radiation can be&#xD;
      categorized in category IIa using the NCS guidelines about risks of radiation dosage (0.1 to&#xD;
      1 mSv). This category includes moderate risk which can be justified if there is a potential&#xD;
      health benefit for future patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.5 Compensation for injury The sponsor/investigator has a liability insurance which is in&#xD;
      accordance with article 7 of the WMO. The sponsor (also) has an insurance which is in&#xD;
      accordance with the legal requirements in the Netherlands (Article 7 WMO). This insurance&#xD;
      provides cover for damage to re- search subjects through injury or death caused by the study.&#xD;
      The insurance applies to the damage that becomes apparent during the study or within 4 years&#xD;
      after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.6 Incentives (if applicable) Participants will be reimbursed for extra time that is needed&#xD;
      to fill out the questionnaires and undergo cinematographic recordings. They will receive €50&#xD;
      for participating in T1 and T2. Participants that live outside of Sittard will receive&#xD;
      mission expenses of €0.20 per kilometre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS, MONITORING AND PUBLICATION 10.1 Handling and storage of data and&#xD;
      documents Data will be stored in two ways; cinematographic recordings on CDs and&#xD;
      questionnaires on paper. Both of them will be coded with participant-number (e.g. participant&#xD;
      5). Cinematographic recordings will also be coded with recording-number (e.g. recording 5).&#xD;
      CDs and questionnaires will be locked up in a secured room in the Maastricht University&#xD;
      Medical Centre (MUMC+). Data analysis will also take place in the MUMC+. Data will be kept&#xD;
      for 15 years after ending the study. Handling of personal data will comply with the Dutch&#xD;
      Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Monitoring and Quality Assurance Monitoring will be performed by trained and qualified&#xD;
      monitors. According to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines main task of the monitor is&#xD;
      ensuring that: Rights and well-being of human participants are protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported trial data are accurate, complete and verifiable from source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of trial is in compliance with currently approved protocol, GCP and applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the study start a monitoring plan will be assembled, specifying Source Document&#xD;
      Verification Plan, frequency of monitoring visits and frequency of checking Trial Master&#xD;
      Files/Investigator Site Files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring will be performed remotely and on site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several kinds of monitoring visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site initiation visit (SIV): SIV will be performed after all approvals have been obtained and&#xD;
      prior to enrolling the first subject in that centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim monitoring visit (IMV): Several IMV's will be performed during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of visits is determined in monitoring plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Close out visit (COV): COV will be performed at the end of the trial, after collection of&#xD;
      all data. Monitoring visits will be planned in agreement with study site personnel. According&#xD;
      to GCP guidelines, the investigators must provide the monitor with all necessary information&#xD;
      and documents. Furthermore, the investigators are obliged to answer all queries raised by&#xD;
      monitor in eCRF in timely manner. After each monitoring visit, a follow-up email with all&#xD;
      action points will be sent to the study site. These action points will be addressed at&#xD;
      beginning of the next monitoring visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.3 Amendments Amendments are changes made to the research after a favourable opinion by the&#xD;
      accredited METC has been given. All amendments will be notified to the METC that gave a&#xD;
      favourable opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4 Annual progress report The researcher will submit a summary of progress of the trial to&#xD;
      the accredited METC once a year. Information will be provided on date of inclusion of the&#xD;
      first subject, numbers of subjects included and numbers of subjects that have completed the&#xD;
      trial, serious adverse events, other problems, and amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.5 Temporary halt and (prematurely) end of study report The researcher will notify the&#xD;
      accredited METC of the end of the study within a period of 8 weeks. The end of the study is&#xD;
      defined as the last participants' last visit. The researcher will notify METC immediately of&#xD;
      a temporary halt of the study, including reason of such an action. In case of ending the&#xD;
      study prematurely, the researcher will notify the accredited METC within 10 days, including&#xD;
      reasons for premature termination. Within one year after the end of the study, the researcher&#xD;
      will submit a final study report with results, including any publications/abstracts, to the&#xD;
      accredited METC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.6 Public disclosure and publication policy This trial will be registered in a public trial&#xD;
      register before recruitment of the first participant. Results will preferable be published in&#xD;
      open access, peer-reviewed journals. Data of participants will be anonymous for publication&#xD;
      and cannot be traced to an individual. In case of negative results, data will also be&#xD;
      published. Possible funding has through contractual agreement no effect on publication. There&#xD;
      is no veto over whether or not to publish data by one of the parties.&#xD;
