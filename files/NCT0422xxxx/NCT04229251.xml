  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacies of an online mindfulness-based intervention for&#xD;
      emerging adults with ADHD in Malaysia. The investigators hypothesized that online&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention may improve ADHD symptoms and executive functions of emerging&#xD;
      adults with ADHD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that&#xD;
      often persist to adulthood. In Malaysia, the Chinese ethnic is having the highest prevalence&#xD;
      rate of hyperactivity symptoms. Nevertheless, there are only limited evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      options targeting the core symptoms of ADHD, as well as executive functions in adulthood. In&#xD;
      addition, conventional psychotherapeutic approaches for adults with ADHD have found to be&#xD;
      highly labor-intensive. Emerging adulthood is a distinct developmental stage of 18 - 29 years&#xD;
      old, with unique challenges that rarely addressed in mental health system. Recently,&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention appears to be a promising treatment for adults living with&#xD;
      ADHD but it has not been evaluated among Malaysian emerging adults with ADHD. The&#xD;
      investigators proposed a two-arm randomized controlled trial, comparing an eight-week online&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention program with an online introductory psychology program. The&#xD;
      outcomes include changes of inattention symptom, changes of hyperactivity-impulsivity&#xD;
      symptom, and changes of executive functions from pretest to posttest, 1-month follow-up and&#xD;
      3-month follow-up. To investigators' best knowledge, this randomized controlled trial will be&#xD;
      the first to test the efficacious of online mindfulness-based intervention for ADHD among&#xD;
      emerging adults. It will provide evidence on the efficacious of online treatment for this&#xD;
      often-overlooked population in the mental healthcare system.&#xD;

    <description>The iMBI starts with psychoeducation about ADHD and defining mindfulness. Participants were then encouraged to discuss their experience of living with ADHD via a series of guided questions. Upon orientated to the program, the participants will be introduced to various topics of mindfulness and ADHD, as well as a wide range of in-session online mindfulness exercises. Offline assignments that correspond to each week's theme will be assigned to participants at the end of each session. Downloadable audio tracks for offline practices will be provided to the participants. Participants are expected to spend around 15 to 30 minutes each day to complete the weekly iMBI assignment.</description>
