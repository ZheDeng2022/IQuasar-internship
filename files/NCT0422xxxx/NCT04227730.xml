      Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a facultative gram positive diplococcus originally known for&#xD;
      causing bovine mastitis and was not demonstrated to be a human pathogen until 1938 (1). In&#xD;
      the 1970s, GBS emerged as the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, with a&#xD;
      frequency of 2-3 cases per 1,000 live births and case-fatality ratios as high as 50% (2). It&#xD;
      causes severe invasive infection in newborns 80% of which occur within the first week of life&#xD;
      (early-onset neonatal sepsis) that results from ascending spread of GBS into the amniotic&#xD;
      fluid through both ruptured and intact membranes (3,4). Infants who have such infections may&#xD;
      require prolonged hospitalization, and those who survive may have mental retardation or&#xD;
      visual loss (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmission from mother to child has been reported to be 29 times higher in GBS-colonized&#xD;
      mothers than in noncolonized mothers. The prevalence of GBS colonization in the vagina and/or&#xD;
      rectum among pregnant women can vary among ethnic groups and geographical locations, ranging&#xD;
      from approximately 10% to 40% (6). Although GBS colonization is not associated with disease&#xD;
      in healthy women, colonization in pregnant women may be associated with urinary tract&#xD;
      infection, bacteremia, amnionitis, endometritis, postpartum wound infections, and rarely,&#xD;
      meningitis (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of obstetric factors have been associated with an increased likelihood of&#xD;
      early-onset GBS disease in the newborn. These include maternal colonization of the vagina and&#xD;
      rectum with GBS, preterm birth, prolonged rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever, women&#xD;
      younger than 20 years (8), women with prior GBS-infected infant, women with heavy&#xD;
      colonization- GBS bacteriuria equal to or greater than 104 colony forming units or low levels&#xD;
      of anti-GBS capsular antibody(9,10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) has been shown not only to interrupt the&#xD;
      transmission of GBS from mother to infant but also to reduce the incidence of early-onset GBS&#xD;
      disease (11). Guidelines from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#xD;
      (12), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (6) and the American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued in 1996 and 2002(13, 14) recommended two different&#xD;
      strategies for the selection of candidates for IAP: either screening for GBS vaginorectal&#xD;
      carriers or identification of maternal clinical risk factors for early-onset neonatal GBS&#xD;
      disease. They recommended obtaining rectovaginal cultures at 35-37 weeks of gestation with&#xD;
      the culture-based approach (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value and practicality of both strategies has been debated in the literature. At issue is&#xD;
      potential overtreatment (in the case of the culture strategy) and under treatment (in the&#xD;
      case of the risk-factor strategy) of patients, as well as the associated cost. For example,&#xD;
      the standard screening test, a rectovaginal culture taken at 35 to 37 weeks, has been&#xD;
      controversial because it may not accurately predict genital tract colonization at time of&#xD;
      labor (with an estimated sensitivity of 87%-91% and specificity of 89%-96%). The risk-factor&#xD;
      method, on the other hand, would target treatment toward the mothers believed to be at&#xD;
      greatest risk but would miss many colonized mothers and at-risk infants (15, 16). Despite&#xD;
      their limitations, both approaches are effective in reducing early-onset group B&#xD;
      streptococcal infection rate in infants, although more widespread implementation of the&#xD;
      guidelines is needed (11, 17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Committee on Obstetric Practice 2003 recognized that compliance with the culture-based&#xD;
      approach will require the implementation of several steps (18)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining accurate culture media&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appropriate processing of the culture by laboratories&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timely reporting of results to obstetric providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administering intrapartum prophylaxis to culture-positive women&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity of cultures in detecting GBS colonization varies from 54% to 87%, and results&#xD;
      has a slow turnaround time requiring up to 36 to 72 hours before results can be issued(3,16).&#xD;
      Besides being time-consuming, this method requires an experienced technician to identify the&#xD;
      suspected colonies, which are not always beta-hemolytic. Moreover, the suppression of GBS&#xD;
      growth by enterococci present in the vaginal and rectal flora could lead to false-negative&#xD;
      results (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid methods of detection of GBS colonization in pregnant women namely molecular biology&#xD;
      based assays have become the focus of investigation in recent years. The most promising of&#xD;
      these techniques is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is reported to be highly&#xD;
      sensitive and specific among women in labor and to yield results in 30 to 45 minutes (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of GBS colonization and disease among pregnant women and their infants has not been&#xD;
      studied in Egypt, and no preventive strategy has been formulated with regard to intrapartum&#xD;
      antimicrobial prophylaxis.&#xD;
