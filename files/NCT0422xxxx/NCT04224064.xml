      The main objective of this project is to identify a new non-invasive biological test for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of LPS by measuring circulating serine levels. The current gold standard is the&#xD;
      detection of Mdm2 amplification by the FISH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcomas are rare diseases, accounting for less than 1% of all malignant diseases in adults¹.&#xD;
      Their incidence is about 6 new cases per 100,000 in inhabitants per year, ie 4,000 to 5,000&#xD;
      new cases estimated per year in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma subtype, accounting for&#xD;
      approximately 15% of all sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OMS classification distinguishes 5 categories of LPS: myxoid, pleomorphe, round-cell&#xD;
      liposarcomas, dedifferentiated (DD-LPS) and well-differentiated (WD-LPS). Research team is&#xD;
      interested by the last two in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is suspected on the imaging examinations (MRI for limb tumors and CT for&#xD;
      retro-peritoneal LPS) which should lead to a discussion at a multidisciplinary tumor board in&#xD;
      an expert center to validate the biopsy for definitive diagnosis and define the best biopsy&#xD;
      route to avoid the risk of spread. In France, the management of patients with sarcoma is&#xD;
      organized around the network of 24 &quot;NETSARC&quot; centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WD-LPS and DD-LPS, may be difficult to distinguish from benign adipose tumors and&#xD;
      undifferentiated sarcomas, respectively. Molecular analyze, based on the detection of Mdm2&#xD;
      gene amplification by Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) is currently the &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot;. It is performed on a tumor biopsy. The biopsy is a radiologic biopsy as it is&#xD;
      recommended in the guidelines to reduce the risk of disease spread. The material allowing the&#xD;
      diagnosis is thus limited complicating the realization of morphology, immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      and molecular biology on the same sample. The other limitation is that this tumor fragment&#xD;
      does not always reflect intra-tumor heterogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is surgical with monobloc resection by a surgeon specialized in sarcomas.&#xD;
      Despite surgical excision, the risk of local and distant recurrence is approximately 26% for&#xD;
      well-differentiated liposarcomas⁵ and up to 59% for dedifferentiated retroperitoneal&#xD;
      liposarcomas. Prognostic factors for recurrence are the quality of excision, tumor size,&#xD;
      grade, and retroperitoneal / limb localization. The problematic concerning these 2 types of&#xD;
      liposarcomas is not the same. In WD-LPS, the question is to know the risk of recurrence in&#xD;
      case of unplanned R1 resection (representing approximately 50% of initial surgeries). Indeed&#xD;
      a systematic surgical revision of all these cases is expensive and morbid whereas in 50% of&#xD;
      cases no tumor residue will be found on the surgical recovery. For the DD-LPS the problem is&#xD;
      different because the surgical revision must be systematic in case of non-R0 surgery, but it&#xD;
      is the risk of local recurrence despite adequate surgery and the metastatic risk that must be&#xD;
      evaluated in order to propose an adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy) to&#xD;
      patients with a high risk of recurrence also making it essential to identify a biological&#xD;
      factor of prognosis to select patients with a high risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians propose to identify a new blood test that would indicate the presence of the&#xD;
      disease. It would then serve for the diagnosis but also prognosis allowing us to evaluate the&#xD;
      residual disease after surgery of excision. Due to the complexity of sarcomas, identifying an&#xD;
      effective and reliable biomarker for WD-LPS and DD-LPS with non-invasive methods is a&#xD;
      challenge, but clinicians hope that their project will provide a more efficient and&#xD;
      patient-friendly method for the detection of the disease. Our project relies on the&#xD;
      complementary expertise provided by clinicians, researchers and biostatisticians in close&#xD;
      collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians have recently characterized a novel function of the p53 independent Mdm2 protein&#xD;
      in serine metabolism, which could play a fundamental role in the development of LPS. Through&#xD;
      pan-genome approaches clinicians have characterized a novel transcriptional activity of Mdm2&#xD;
      and demonstrated its role in the metabolism of cancer cells. These data indicate that the&#xD;
      presence of Mdm2 at chromatin makes it possible to control the transcription of genes&#xD;
      involved in the metabolism and transport of certain amino acids such as serine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endogenous serine pool is maintained by a balance between auxotrophy and de novo&#xD;
      synthesis, that are strongly deregulated during cell transformation to support the anabolic&#xD;
      needs of cancer cells. Mdm2 is recruited via transcription factors of the ATF family on&#xD;
      target genes involved in de novo synthesis and serine transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians propose to identify a biological test for the prognosis and diagnosis of LPS that&#xD;
      does not require invasive biopsy. Patients included in the study will be patients with WD-LPS&#xD;
      or DD-LPS, with the goal of including 100 patients over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on recent data showing that LPS growth is mediated by Mdm2-mediated regulation of&#xD;
      serine metabolism, clinicians propose to measure serine blood levels as a surrogate marker&#xD;
      for LPS development. To maintain the intracellular level of serine, Mdm2 controls both de&#xD;
      novo serine synthesis (a metabolic pathway that uses the glycolytic intermediate&#xD;
      3-Phospho-Glycerate to generate serine in cells) and the entry of the serine in the cell by&#xD;
      auxotrophy. Given the size of LPS, which can often reach several tens of centimeters,&#xD;
      clinicians hypothesized that LPS may result in significant demand for serine that could be&#xD;
      produced by the microenvironment and transmitted to the tumor by circulating pools of serine&#xD;
      and glycine (which can be inter-converted to serine by cells). The profiling of plasma amino&#xD;
      acids is of great clinical interest since they are easy to measure by liquid chromatography&#xD;
      (HPLC). Clinicians have already validated an HPLC method to measure different amino acids,&#xD;
      including serine and glycine, in the serum. Our preliminary data are in line with our&#xD;
      hypothesis since the serum serine level is higher in the xenografted mice with patient tumor&#xD;
      compared to serum levels measured in the control mice. In addition, in response to treatment&#xD;
      with an Mdm2 inhibitor, which induces a drastic reduction in tumor growth, a decrease in&#xD;
      circulating serine can be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians will use an HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry already developed to measure amino&#xD;
      acids from Agilent technology. The quantitative analysis of amino acids combines speed and&#xD;
      sensitivity with the reliability of the derivation reaction and the analytical technique.&#xD;
      These goals are achieved by automated and online derivatization using o-phthalaldehyde (OPA)&#xD;
      for primary amino acids and 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC) for secondary amino acids.&#xD;
      Automated derivation is then integrated into robust HPLC analysis. The complete procedure is&#xD;
      fast, accurate, sensitive and reproducible using Agilent 1190 HPLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to identify a new non-invasive biological test for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of LPS by measuring circulating serine levels. The current gold standard is the&#xD;
      detection of Mdm2 amplification by the FISH.&#xD;
