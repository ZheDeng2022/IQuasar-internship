      Women with Hormone Receptor (HR)+ Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER)2- metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer are eligible to a randomized trial. Patients receiving standard first line&#xD;
      therapy for metastatic HR+ Breast cancer(BC) (letrozole+palbociclib) are randomly assigned to&#xD;
      also receive Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy(SBRT) to each metastatic lesion.&#xD;

They will undergo tumor Immunogenic-SBRT(I-SBRT) days 1-12 (+/-2 days, to enable inclusion of holidays). During the week preceding day 1, they will undergo simulation and planning for radiotherapy. Each oligometastatic lesion will be treated with I-SBRT every 48 hours. Treatment may be given daily (to keep the total I-SBRT treatment time to ≤ 12 days) and lesions targeted with I-SBRT will thus be alternated each day to accommodate for the 48 hour interval between fractions</description>
