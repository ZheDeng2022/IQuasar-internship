                  antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg&#xD;
                  negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc]&#xD;
                  and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened&#xD;
