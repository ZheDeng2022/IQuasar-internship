  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a new treatment (repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS)) for Veterans with stimulant use disorder (SUD). Despite the large public&#xD;
      health burden imposed by SUD, there is currently no FDA-approved or widely recognized&#xD;
      effective somatic treatment. rTMS may be a promising treatment option for SUD. In this study,&#xD;
      we will demonstrate the feasibility of applying rTMS to Veterans with SUD, examine the&#xD;
      efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of SUD, and explore biomarkers that may guide patient&#xD;
      selection for rTMS treatment and predict treatment response.&#xD;

    <description>Before and after treatment, participants will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging while completing the Monetary Incentive Delay Task, a validated probe of reward processing circuit function and dysfunction. Signaling in the substantia nigra will be measured in an individual-subject, &quot;native space&quot; ROI approach as a marker of dopaminergic reward processing function, as well as in voxel-wise, whole-brain exploratory analyses. Changes in reward function and signaling will be compared between active vs. sham rTMS groups</description>

    <description>rTMS is a non-invasive procedure in which administering a transient magnetic field induces electrical currents in specific, targeted brain regions. The intervention (active and sham) will be administered in 8 sessions across 2 weeks. The brain region targeted is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</description>
