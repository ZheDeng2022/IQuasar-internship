  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROVE Trial is a randomized clinical trial that will determine whether a weight loss&#xD;
      intervention combined with walking exercise achieves greater improvement or less decline in&#xD;
      six-minute walk distance at 12 month follow-up than walking exercise alone in people with PAD&#xD;
      and BMI&gt;28 kg/m2. The intervention uses a Group Mediated Cognitive Behavioral framework,&#xD;
      connective mobile technology, remote monitoring by a coach, and a calorie restricted Dietary&#xD;
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-derived Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart&#xD;
      Health (OMNIHeart) diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      212 participants with PAD and BMI &gt; 28 kg/m2 will be randomized to one of two groups: weight&#xD;
      loss + exercise (WL+EX) vs. exercise alone (EX). Participants will be randomized at&#xD;
      Northwestern, Tulane University, and University of Minnesota. Our primary outcome is change&#xD;
      in six-minute walk distance at 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are change in 6-minute&#xD;
      walk distance at 6-month follow-up and change in exercise adherence, physical activity,&#xD;
      patient-reported walking ability (measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ)&#xD;
      distance score), and mobility (measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
      Information System [PROMIS] mobility questionnaire) at 12-month follow-up. Tertiary outcomes&#xD;
      are perceived exertional effort (measured by the Borg scale at the end of the 6-minute walk&#xD;
      at 12-month follow-up), and diet quality. Exploratory outcomes consist of change in the short&#xD;
      physical performance battery (SPPB), the WIQ stair climbing and walking speed scores, and&#xD;
      calf muscle biopsy measures at 12-month follow-up. Study investigators will perform calf&#xD;
      muscle biopsies in 50 participants to compare changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and&#xD;
      activity, capillary density, and inflammation between WL+EX vs. EX.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria are a) presence of PAD; b) BMI&gt; 28 kg/m2; c) Age &gt; 18 and &lt; 90. The&#xD;
        diagnosis of PAD will be based on the following. First, an ankle brachial index (ABI) value&#xD;
        &lt; 0.90, which is a well-accepted standard for diagnosing PAD (98-103). People with a toe&#xD;
        brachial index of &lt;0.70, performed at the study visit, will be eligible. Second, people&#xD;
        with an ABI of &gt;0.90 and &lt;1.00 who experience a 20% or greater drop in ABI after the&#xD;
        heel-rise test will also be included. Third, potential participants with an ABI &gt; 0.90 who&#xD;
        provide vascular laboratory evidence or angiographic evidence of PAD will be included.&#xD;
        Prior vascular laboratory evidence consists of objective evidence of PAD including toe&#xD;
        brachial index (TBI) &lt; 0.70, Duplex measure showing 70% stenosis or greater, a post&#xD;
        heel-rise or post-exercise ABI drop of 20% or greater, or ABI values &lt; 0.90. Angiographic&#xD;
        evidence of PAD consists of a stenosis of 70% or greater in a lower extremity artery.&#xD;
        Fourth, people with a history of lower extremity revascularization who do not meet the&#xD;
        criterion above and have an ABI &gt; 0.90 with a 20% or higher drop in ABI after the heel-rise&#xD;
        test will be eligible if they have symptomatic PAD. Symptomatic PAD will be defined as leg&#xD;
        symptoms associated with exertion that resolved within 10 minutes of rest. The presence of&#xD;
        symptomatic PAD will be determined based on the claudication questionnaire, the six-minute&#xD;
        walk, or principal investigator interview/discussion with the potential participant. A&#xD;
        positive heel-rise test is defined as a 20% or greater drop in ABI after the heel-rise&#xD;
        test. The heel-rise test consists of 50 heel rises at a rate of one per second. We will use&#xD;
        the BMI inclusion criterion of &gt; 28 kg/m2 because overweight and obesity are defined as a&#xD;
        BMI of 25 to 29 kg/m2 and &gt; 30 kg/m2, respectively, and because in our PAD cohorts, those&#xD;
        with BMI &gt; 28 kg/m2 have significantly greater functional impairment and faster functional&#xD;
        decline than those with BMI of 20-28 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Above or below knee amputation, critical limb ischemia, or wheelchair confinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Walking is limited by a condition other than PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Failure to complete the study run-in, defined as not entering at least 800 Kcal of&#xD;
             consumed calories per day for at least five days during the 14 day run-in*.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Major surgery, coronary or leg revascularization in the past 3 months or anticipated&#xD;
             in the next year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Experienced a heart attack or stroke in the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Major medical illness including lung disease requiring oxygen or life-threatening&#xD;
             illness, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life expectancy less&#xD;
             than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE:&#xD;
             potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage&#xD;
             cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Mini-Mental Status Examination score &lt; 23 (108), dementia and substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of being treated for new onset or an acute episode of schizophrenia or&#xD;
             psychosis in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Hospitalization for a psychiatric disorder in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. BMI &gt; 45 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of an eating disorder or any weight loss treatment in the past 6 months.&#xD;
             Weight loss treatment includes weight watchers, any history of weight loss surgery,&#xD;
             and using weight loss medications now or in the past six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Weight gain or loss of more than 25 pounds in the past six months&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Potential participants unwilling/unable to use a smart phone and unwilling to attend&#xD;
             weekly study sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Excessive alcohol use, defined as &gt;14 drinks/week in men and &gt; 10 alcoholic&#xD;
             drinks/week in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Age &gt; 90 years&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Current ulcer on bottom of foot&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Current participation in supervised treadmill exercise, participation in supervised&#xD;
             treadmill exercise in the past six months, or planning to participate in supervised&#xD;
             treadmill exercise in the next year&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Increase in angina or angina at rest. Potential participants may become eligible&#xD;
             following an abnormal baseline treadmill stress test if they have evidence of an&#xD;
             absence of coronary ischemia based on testing with their own physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Non-English speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Visual impairment that limits walking ability&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Currently walking regularly for exercise at a level comparable to the amount of&#xD;
             exercise prescribed in the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months.&#xD;
             [NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will&#xD;
             become eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene therapy&#xD;
             study so long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention&#xD;
             administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell or&#xD;
             gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up visit as&#xD;
             long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the trial.]&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine&#xD;
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The run-in will also be used to assist participants with learning the app.&#xD;
                  However, they must demonstrate ability to enter at least 800 Kcal per day for at&#xD;
                  least five days of the run-in.&#xD;
