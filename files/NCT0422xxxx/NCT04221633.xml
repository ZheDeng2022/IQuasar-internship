  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the current study, the investigators will develop, implement, and evaluate web-based and&#xD;
      consultative training for Family Advocates employed at Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs)&#xD;
      across the United States to enhance children's early engagement in evidence-based mental&#xD;
      health treatment. The interactive web-based training will embed key targets of knowledge and&#xD;
      skills related to family engagement, trauma, evidence-based practices (EBP), and EBP services&#xD;
      in the community. Seventy-five CACs who apply to participate in training will be randomized&#xD;
      to a webinar-only training group, a webinar plus consultation training group, and a delayed&#xD;
      (waitlist) control group. It is hypothesized that the Family Advocates and CAC Directors will&#xD;
      report high levels of satisfaction with the training. More importantly, it is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that webinar training will improve Family Advocates' knowledge, resulting in&#xD;
      minor improvement in EBP engagement, while the addition of consultation in the second&#xD;
      training group will lead to increased use of engagement skills, thereby resulting in greater&#xD;
      improvement in family engagement in EBP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Partnering with the accrediting board for CACs, the National Children's Alliance (NCA), the&#xD;
      investigators will implement and evaluate training for Family Advocates to enhance early&#xD;
      engagement in EBP (E3 training). Two levels of E3 training will be tested. The first level,&#xD;
      webinar-only (E3w), will be web-based training on MH screening, EBP identification, trauma&#xD;
      and effects of trauma, and engagement strategies that directly target known hindrances to&#xD;
      accessing EBP in high risk, traumatized populations. The second level, webinar plus&#xD;
      consultation (E3w+c), will add short-term consultation with experts in engagement and mental&#xD;
      health. Consultation will target Family Advocates' skills in engagement, mental health&#xD;
      screening, and coordination of care through strategies found to enhance skill acquisition.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test two key mechanisms of change for improving EBP engagement:&#xD;
      knowledge (e.g., EBP identification) and skills (e.g., addressing caregiver perceptions of&#xD;
      MH). To examine these change mechanisms, the investigators will implement the feasibility&#xD;
      study designed to accomplish three tasks: (1) test if E3w training provides incremental&#xD;
      benefits in engagement rates over the no training comparison group, (2) examine if E3w+c&#xD;
      further improves outcomes beyond the E3w engagement rates and (3) examine mediating and&#xD;
      moderating factors impacting outcome and implementation, including cost. The hypotheses that&#xD;
      E3w will improve Family Advocates' knowledge, resulting in minor improvement in EBP&#xD;
      engagement, and that addition of consultation in E3w+c will lead to increased use of&#xD;
      engagement skills, resulting in greater improvement in family engagement in EBP, will be&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using NCA's innovative data capture systems, including the Outcome Management System (OMS;&#xD;
      designed to obtain follow-up surveys from families and multidisciplinary team members), as&#xD;
      well as a specific data tracking procedure using REDCap, the investigators will track case&#xD;
      management details (including mental health needs and referrals) from each site randomized.&#xD;
      In addition, knowledge learned via the training (pre- and post-knowledge assessments) will be&#xD;
      tracked. In addition, NCA quantitative data on family engagement in EBP will be drawn, and&#xD;
      the data submitted and integrated with pre- and post-training surveys of Family Advocates and&#xD;
      CAC leaders measuring knowledge and perceptions of the training, including its utility,&#xD;
      strengths, weaknesses, and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applications were released to CACs nationwide in October of 2019, and sites were officially&#xD;
      selected and randomized to groups using an adaptive randomization procedure such that a broad&#xD;
      range of the selected covariates that are hypothesized to influence key outcomes occurs in&#xD;
      all conditions. Participants from sites, including Advocates and Senior Leaders, will&#xD;
      officially consent and enroll in the study in mid-December 2019. Participants will provide&#xD;
      study data via an online data platform (i.e., REDCap). The outcomes of interest are the&#xD;
      time-varying and CAC-varying provider fidelity and knowledge, as well as the family screening&#xD;
      and engagement in treatment. Linear mixed effects models will be used to evaluate these&#xD;
      outcomes, with generalized versions of these applied whenever the distribution of the outcome&#xD;
      variable and the residuals suggest these to be appropriate&#xD;
