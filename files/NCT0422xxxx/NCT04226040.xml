  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores whether and how DOW, as a PRO marker, can contribute to triage in the&#xD;
      Emergency Departments. The study is designed as a mixed-method study consisting of a survey&#xD;
      among acutely ill patients and qualitative semi-structured interviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Emergency Departments (ED) in Denmark and internationally, triage manuals are used to&#xD;
      divide incoming patients according to their acute clinical severity, and thus assess who&#xD;
      should be examined and treated first. However, the triage manuals are criticized for being&#xD;
      imprecise in the intermediate categories. Furthermore, the triage manuals, nationally and&#xD;
      internationally, are criticized for not adequately involving the patient's perspective and&#xD;
      context. In addition, triage is not independent of personal factors and workload, which may&#xD;
      contribute to interprofessional variation. Further, patients themselves express a desire to&#xD;
      be even more involved. Also, the relationship between patient and healthcare professional has&#xD;
      a direct impact on the quality of health services, however, there are divergent perceptions&#xD;
      of what patient involvement entails. Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) data is one way in which&#xD;
      patient involvement can occur. PRO is data reported directly from the patient without&#xD;
      interference from the healthcare professional and is thus self-reported data, typically&#xD;
      generated through survey studies among patients. A strength of PRO data is that these are&#xD;
      often more sensitive which may, for example, demonstrate a higher degree of severity of the&#xD;
      patient's symptoms. Furthermore, it is considered a strength that PRO data can be used at&#xD;
      both group level, for example in quality assurance, as well as at an individual level to&#xD;
      support the decision making of healthcare professionals and thereby ensure efficient use of&#xD;
      resources. Due to lack of evidence-based knowledge in the field and despite the potential of&#xD;
      using PRO data, the information of patients and / or relatives is not used systematically in&#xD;
      the Emergency Department. This also applies in the acute contact, where an imprecise initial&#xD;
      evaluation of the patient's overall medical needs can cause both over- and under-triaging to&#xD;
      the detriment of the overall patient course. The result is an inappropriate allocation of&#xD;
      resources at the organizational level and a poorer quality in the treatment process. This&#xD;
      points to the need to use relevant patient-reported measures (PROM), the tool for measuring&#xD;
      PROs. One such instrument is Degree-of-Worry (DOW), which measures the patient's&#xD;
      self-reported level of worry. DOW is a ten-point score of self-reported worry (from 1 =&#xD;
      minimal concern to 10 = maximally concerned), reflecting the patient's own assessment of&#xD;
      acute illness and own perception of concern. DOW has been scientifically tested in connection&#xD;
      with telephone triage at the medical helpline 1813 (MH1813) as a five-point score. The&#xD;
      patient's DOW, measured at the time the patient makes his first call to the MH1813, is&#xD;
      strongly associated with the probability of acute hospitalization within 48 hours. However, a&#xD;
      pilot test with DOW as a five-point score in the Emergency Department indicates a ceiling&#xD;
      effect, by which DOW will be presented as a 10-point score in this setting. DOW has the&#xD;
      potential to increase patient safety, create greater patient involvement and increase&#xD;
      efficiency so that the lengths of stay reflects the triage level. A previous study suggests&#xD;
      that DOW could also be used advantageously in other similar settings, such as Emergency&#xD;
      Department, which, however, requires that potential implementation barriers is examined.&#xD;
