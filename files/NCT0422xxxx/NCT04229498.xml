  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COMBAT trial was contemplated to elucidate unknown clinical relevance of carbapenem&#xD;
      heteroresistance among Klebsiella pneumoniae species. Bloodstream infections, type of&#xD;
      frequently seen invasive infections that pathogen isolation, identification of antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance mechanisms can be performed efficiently, with carbapenem resistant Klebsiella&#xD;
      pneumoniae (CRKp) and carbapenem hetero-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae will be compared in&#xD;
      terms of relevant clinical outcomes such as 30-day mortality rate, 14-day clinical cure rate,&#xD;
      7-day microbiological eradication rate and 90-day relapse/re-infection rate. In addition,&#xD;
      underlying molecular resistance mechanisms causing carbapenem hetero-resistance among&#xD;
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates will be investigated by using whole genome sequences.&#xD;

      Main Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conceiving the clinical relevance of carbapenem hetero-resistance phenomenon among&#xD;
           Klebsiella pneumoniae strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of molecular resistance mechanisms causing carbapenem hetero-resistance&#xD;
           among Klebsiella pneumoniae strains&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identification of accuracy of gradient test (e.g. E-test) and disc diffusion test for&#xD;
           detection of carbapenem heteroresistance as compared with gold standard PAP analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- 30-day mortality rate is higher in bloodstream infections caused by CRKp than carbapenem&#xD;
      hetero-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 90-day relapse/re-infection rates are similar in CRKp and carbapenem heteroresistant Kp&#xD;
           groups. However, carbapenem monotherapy is associated with higher rate of&#xD;
           relapse/reinfection rate in treatment of bloodstream infection caused by carbapenem&#xD;
           heteoresistant K. pneumonia even if used as high dose and prolonged infusion regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 14-day clinical cure rate is significantly higher in carbapenem heteroresistant Kp group&#xD;
           than CRKp group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 14-day clinical cure rate is significantly lower in patients having BSI caused by&#xD;
           carbapenem hetero-resistant K. pneumoniae and treated with carbapenem monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 7-day microbiological cure rate is significantly higher in carbapenem heteroresistant Kp&#xD;
           group than CRKp group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 7-day microbiological cure rate is significantly lower in patients having BSI caused by&#xD;
           carbapenem heteroresistant K. pneumoniae and treated with carbapenem monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective multi-centre multinational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary care hospitals form different parts of the world will be included in COMBAT trial.&#xD;
      Study period is scheduled to be 01.04.2020-01.04.2021 or longer until pre-defined sample size&#xD;
      is attained. Local (primary) investigators will collect microbiological and clinical data of&#xD;
      participants. Site investigators will screen the microbiology laboratory data in daily&#xD;
      interval to identify patients with CRKp or carbapenem hetero-resistant Kp bacteremia. All&#xD;
      consecutive patients with monobacterial CRKp or carbapenem hetero-resistant Kp BSI will be&#xD;
      eligible to be evaluated for inclusion in the study. Carbapenem resistance will be determined&#xD;
      according to 2015 CDC criteria. The presence of carbapenem hetero-resistance among Kp blood&#xD;
      culture isolates will be initially determined based on observation of some sub-colonies in&#xD;
      inhibition zone of carbapenems. The presence of hetero-resistance against only one type of&#xD;
      carbapenems including ertapenem, imipenem, meroepenem will be sufficient to be included.&#xD;
      Identification of carbapenem hetero-resistant subpopulations is not infrequent while&#xD;
      performing disc diffusion tests or gradient tests (eg. E-test) in our daily practices.&#xD;
      However, the exact sensitivity and specificity of these tests for identification of&#xD;
      carbapenem hetero-resistance among gram-negative microorganisms are not known yet. The&#xD;
      participants with BSI caused by carbapenem hetero-resistant Kp that is defined by disc&#xD;
      diffusion or gradient test results will be recruited into carbapenem hetero-resistant Kp&#xD;
      group. However, clinical carbapenem hetero-resistant Kp isolates will be transfered to&#xD;
      pre-defined reference centres of each country via appropriate transfer culture media.&#xD;
      Population analysis profiling (PAP) will be performed for these pathogens in reference&#xD;
      centres. Although PAP is recommended method for identification of carbapenem&#xD;
      hetero-resistance, it is cumbersome for microbiology laboratories for routine usage.&#xD;
      Participants suspected of having BSI with carbapenem hetero-resistant Kp based on routine&#xD;
      microbiological methods will be initially included and data of these patients will be&#xD;
      recorded but, these patients will be excluded from our final analysis if PAP analysis does&#xD;
      not confirm the presence of carbapenem hetero-resistance in these pathogens. PAP analysis&#xD;
      will be used as a confirmatory test for identification of carbapenem heteroresistance among&#xD;
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. PAP will be performed at the end of patient recruitment and&#xD;
      after collection of all isolates in reference centers. Therefore, treatment decisions and any&#xD;
      other interventions will not be affected by the results of PAP analysis. PAP will only be&#xD;
      used for identification of presence of carbapenem hetero-resistance among suspicious isolates&#xD;
      as a gold standard method. This study will be purely observational and no intervention will&#xD;
      be in any part of patient follow-up (eg. diagnosis, treatment etc.) and all decisions will be&#xD;
      taken by attending physicians. Briefly, PAP analysis will be performed as following: one&#xD;
      colony from a culture grown overnight on Columbia agar is inoculated into 5 ml of&#xD;
      Luria-Bertani broth. After 24 h of incubation, 0.1 ml of bacterial suspension with a density&#xD;
      corresponding 0.5 McFarland is serially diluted and spread onto Mueller-Hinton agar&#xD;
      containing two-fold serial dilutions of meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem with concentrations&#xD;
      ranging from 0.25 to 256 mg/L. One hundred microliters of ten-fold serial dilution(s) of a&#xD;
      0.5 McFarland suspension is spread on drug-free Mueller-Hinton agar and incubated for 48h at&#xD;
      37 °C to determine the CFUs/ml. Colony counts from three replicate plates are performed for&#xD;
      all of the isolates, and mean values are estimated. The number of resistant cells in 0.1 ml&#xD;
      of starting bacterial suspension is calculated and the log CFUs/ml is plotted against the&#xD;
      antibiotic concentration. The frequency of hetero-resistant subpopulations at the highest&#xD;
      drug concentration will be calculated and divided the number of colonies grown on&#xD;
      antibiotic-containing plates by the colony counts from the same bacterial inoculum plated&#xD;
      onto antibiotic-free plates. A protocol for PAP analysis will be prepared and send to&#xD;
      reference centers to perform PAP more smoothly and with same techniques in each reference&#xD;
      centers. Site investigators will also collect CRKp isolates and keep these isolates in&#xD;
      appropriate conditions until time of transfer for analysis. All CRKp isolates will be sent to&#xD;
      the central microbiology laboratories in each country for identification of carbapenemase&#xD;
      genes by performing multiplex PCR (polymerized chain reaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To best of our knowledge, there is no study investigating clinical outcomes of bloodstream or&#xD;
      other type of invasive infections caused by carbapenem hetero-resistant gram negative&#xD;
      bacteria in literature. Therefore, this study will be conducted as a pilot study.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, 200 participants for CRKp arm and 100 participants for carbapenem&#xD;
      hetero-resistant Klebsiella pneumonaie arm are planned to be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated for microbiological eradication on day 7 by control blood&#xD;
      cultures and cultures of primary infection source. If causative pathogen is not eradicated&#xD;
      within 7 days follow-up, consecutive cultures will be taken between 7-28 days as being&#xD;
      necessary. Patients will also be evaluated for clinical response on day-7 and day-14 by using&#xD;
      relevant parameters. All participants will be followed for 90 days after index blood culture&#xD;
      date. During this follow-up period, regular assessment starting from blood culture sampling&#xD;
      will be carried out and participants will be primarily evaluated for occurrence of any&#xD;
      infection (blood stream or other type of invasive infection) in once a month interval if the&#xD;
      participants are discharged. Participants will be warned to apply to our centres until the&#xD;
      completion of 90-day follow-up period when symptoms of infection develop (eg fever, chills).&#xD;
      Also, participants will be informed to call physicians who are primary investigators of&#xD;
      particular centre in this study when the participants arrive to hospital clinic or emergency&#xD;
      department. Primary investigators will evaluate participants and send their culture samples&#xD;
      according to clinical necessity. After review of the results of cultures and clinical&#xD;
      presentation, the patients will be allocated into infections with carbapenem resistant or&#xD;
      carbapenem hetero-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae groups. If the participant is discharged&#xD;
      before completion of the 90-days, he/she will be contacted in 30 days interval by telephone&#xD;
      call to appraise the investigated outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antimicrobial susceptibility tests (AST) will be performed in each center and not be&#xD;
           repeated. Therefore, AST results will be obtained from hospital database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PAP (Population analysis profiling) will be performed in reference centers in each&#xD;
           country to identify actual hetero-resistant isolates among suspected isolates in which&#xD;
           some subpopulations within inhibition zone in gradient test (eg.E-test) or disk&#xD;
           diffusion test are identified&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiplex PCR will be used for identification of types of carbapenemase (will be&#xD;
           performed in reference centers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole genome sequencing will be used to identifiy molecular mechanisms of carbapenem&#xD;
           hetero-resistance in clinical isolates (will be performed in reference centers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colistin resistance will be investigated by broth microdilution method (will be&#xD;
           performed in reference centers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EUCAST breakpoints will be used for identification of resistance against all antibiotics&#xD;
           except tigecycline in which FDA breakpoints will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results of antimicrobial susceptiblity and MIC values of carbapenems, colistin,&#xD;
           tigecycline, amikacin and gentamycin will be indicated for most resistant subpopulations&#xD;
           identified in PAP analysis. MIC values of aforementioned antibiotics will be analyzed in&#xD;
           reference centers by using broth microdilution method. For other antibiotics, AST&#xD;
           results of parental isolates will be recorded and obtained from hospital database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables were described using median (interquartile range) or frequency count according to&#xD;
      the type of variable. The categorical variables will be compared by Pearson's chi-square or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test if cells have a frequency of 5 or less and continuous variables by&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U tests for nonnormally distributed variables or Student's t test for&#xD;
      normally distributed variables. The groups (CRKp vs Carbapenem hetero-resisant) were compared&#xD;
      by using univariate analysis to define the variables that have significant difference between&#xD;
      comparison groups. All univariables with a P value of 0.20 or less will be included in the&#xD;
      multivariate Cox regression models by manually selecting them in a backward stepwise manner&#xD;
      according to clinical value and their association. VIF (variance inflation factor) will be&#xD;
      calculated for each variables incorporated into multivariate model. The best fit model will&#xD;
      be picked up according to likelihood ratio test. In another analysis comparing CRKp group and&#xD;
      carbapenem hetero-resistant group, a propensity score will be calculated and this score will&#xD;
      be incorporated into cox regression analysis model as a confounding parameter. Cox&#xD;
      reggression analysis will be applied to compare relevant outcomes such as 30-day mortality&#xD;
      and 14-day clinical cure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival for 30 days from the first positive blood culture was plotted as Kaplan-Meier curves&#xD;
      and the rates of survival were compared by the log rank test to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      carbapenem hetero-resistance. All tests were two-tailed, and significance was set at 0.05 in&#xD;
      SPSS software (version 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
