  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of Metformin in subjects with&#xD;
      C9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis administered for 24 weeks. The overall objective is to&#xD;
      determine if Metformin is safe in C9orf72 ALS patients and is a potentially viable&#xD;
      therapeutic treatment for C9-ALS that reduces repeat-associated non-canonical start codon -&#xD;
      in DNA (non-ATG) (RAN) proteins that are produced by the C9orf72 repeat expansion mutation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The C9orf72 repeat expansion is the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and&#xD;
      frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Metformin, a well-tolerated diabetes drug, blocks a key&#xD;
      pathway for expression of toxic proteins produced from the C9orf72 repeat expansion via&#xD;
      repeat associated non-canonical start codon - in RNA (non-AUG) (RAN) translation. In mouse&#xD;
      model of C9-ALS/FTD, metformin treatment decreases RAN protein levels and improves disease&#xD;
      features. This current study is a small-scale clinical trial to assess the safety and&#xD;
      potential efficacy of metformin for the treatment of C9-ALS/FTD.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects with C9orf72 positive ALS will be instructed in the use of Metformin and receive the first dose of Metformin under supervision of the investigator during Visit 1, Day 2.&#xD;

    <description>Metformin is a widely used, well-tolerated drug that has been used for decades as a first-line defense for treating type 2 diabetes. Its safety has been well established. Subjects will begin treatment with Metformin at a dosage of 500mg with an escalation of dosage by 500mg every week to a maximal dosage of 2000mg. Dosing will be twice daily.</description>
