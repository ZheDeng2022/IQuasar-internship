      Purpose: It is unknown whether instillation of a drop of anesthetic ophthalmic solution into&#xD;
      the eye such as proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% prior to probing and irrigation of the tear&#xD;
      duct (lacrimal drainage) system improves participant comfort during the procedure. To date,&#xD;
      there have been no formal studies evaluating the possible benefit of this pretreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants 18 years and older who present to the William Beaumont Hospital - Royal&#xD;
      Oak, Michigan outpatient ophthalmology clinic with a chief complaint of epiphora (excessive&#xD;
      tearing) who necessitate bilateral lower lid probing and irrigation of the lacrimal drainage&#xD;
      system will be enrolled in the study. One eye will be randomized to receive a drop of the&#xD;
      anesthetic Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% and the other eye will receive a control drop of&#xD;
      Balanced Salt Solution (BSS). Probing and irrigation will then be performed in the usual&#xD;
      fashion. The participant will then be questioned via survey on a pain scale of 1-5 as to the&#xD;
      amount of subjective pain experienced on each side during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: Investigators expect participants will experience statistically&#xD;
      significantly less pain in eyes that have received a drop of Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%&#xD;
      prior to performance of probing and irrigation compared to the eyes which have received the&#xD;
      control drop.&#xD;

      Rationale: It is common for male and female adults of all races with a chief complaint of&#xD;
      epiphora (excessive tearing) to express discomfort either verbally or through body language&#xD;
      while undergoing tear duct (canalicular) probing and irrigation even when no pathology is&#xD;
      detected. Use of a topical anesthetic during canalicular probing and irrigation is seen in&#xD;
      children but has yet to be formally investigated in adults to date. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to identify whether or not instillation of a drop of Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%&#xD;
      ophthalmic solution into a participant's eye prior to performance of probing and irrigation&#xD;
      will improve participant comfort during the procedure and is therefore recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Administration of a drop of Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% ophthalmic solution&#xD;
      into the eye prior to probing and irrigation of the lower lid canalicular system will&#xD;
      decrease discomfort as compared to a control drop of BSS ophthalmic solution into the&#xD;
      opposite eye prior to the same procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Administration of a drop of Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% ophthalmic&#xD;
      solution does not have an effect on discomfort during canalicular probing and irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication: Proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, United States Pharmacopeia (USP)&#xD;
      0.5% is a local anesthetic drug intended for topical ophthalmic use. Proparacaine&#xD;
      Hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is a fast-acting anesthetic lasting 10-20 minutes.&#xD;
      Proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, USP 0.5% is FDA approved for this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probing and irrigation: A common in-office ophthalmic procedure performed with a small gauge,&#xD;
      blunt tube on a syringe filled with BSS. The cannula is placed into the canaliculus (tear&#xD;
      duct) of one eyelid, and the BSS is used to irrigate the lacrimal system. This procedure&#xD;
      identifies whether or not obstruction of the lacrimal system is present. A participant with&#xD;
      an open (patent) system will taste the salty BSS solution in the nose. A participant with a&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) or a more proximal canalicular obstruction will have&#xD;
      reflux of the irrigant out of the opposite lid (on the same side) canaliculus, the probed&#xD;
      canaliculus, or both and will usually not detect any irrigant within the nasopharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasolacrimal drainage system: The physiologic apparatus which drains tears from the surface&#xD;
      of the eye into the nose (i.e. the tear drain). It consists of (from eye to nose) the punctum&#xD;
      (opening of the tube), the canaliculus (a thin tube within the eyelid), the lacrimal sac (a&#xD;
      sac that hold the tears that lies within the bone of the nose) and finally the nasolacrimal&#xD;
      duct (a duct that connects the lacrimal sac (-lacrimal) into the nose (naso-). A blockage&#xD;
      anywhere along this pathway can cause epiphora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epiphora: The pathological process of tears overflowing from the ocular surface and rolling&#xD;
      down the face. Commonly caused by obstructions of the lacrimal drainage system. Can cause&#xD;
      significant irritation and loss of vision.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization will be performed by the primary investigator who will have no participant interaction during the performance of the procedure and obtainment of the survey responses. A random number generator will be used to obtain either an even or odd number. Odd numbers mean the left eye receives Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% ophthalmic solution, even numbers mean the right eye does. The chief investigator will instruct clinic personnel as to which syringe should be labeled &quot;L&quot; or &quot;R&quot; depending on randomization results.Two identical 1 ml syringes will be prepared. One syringe containing control BSS, and the other containing Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% ophthalmic solution. Each syringe will be labeled by clinical assistants with either left (L) or right (R) as randomized.</masking_description>
