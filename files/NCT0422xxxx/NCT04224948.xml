  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retroperitoneal sarcoma(RPS) is a rare cancer that is difficult to cure as it typically&#xD;
      presents as a very large abdominal mass, and complete removal with clear margins is&#xD;
      challenging . This study will focus on improving the outcomes of surgery by treating RPS&#xD;
      before surgery, to make resection more effective. The role of chemotherapy as a preoperative&#xD;
      treatment for RPS is highly controversial. Response to chemotherapy is unpredictable and if&#xD;
      the patient's tumour progresses instead of responding, the window of opportunity for&#xD;
      resection will be lost. Conventional cross sectional imaging (CT scan) is inadequate to&#xD;
      measure response to chemotherapy until 5-6 cycles have been given, possibly with no&#xD;
      improvement. Thus it is critical to develop an earlier and reliable way to assess response.&#xD;
      Functional imaging by PET scan is used in other tumour types to identify early response to&#xD;
      treatment. PET imaging may provide a more meaningful assessment of RPS response to systemic&#xD;
      therapy much earlier in the course of treatment than conventional imaging, allowing timely&#xD;
      modification of the treatment plan. This study will define the role of PET imaging in&#xD;
      evaluating early response to systemic therapy in high grade RPS, improving patient treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are derived from mesenchymal cells, and can arise at any site.&#xD;
      Retroperitoneal sarcomas (RPS) account for ~15% of STS, and patients have much worse survival&#xD;
      outcomes than for extremity STS. Local (abdominal) recurrence of RPS is very common, due to&#xD;
      the challenges of obtaining complete resection of these large masses that abut critical&#xD;
      central compartment structures, such as the inferior vena cava and aorta. There is currently&#xD;
      intense interest in using preoperative therapy to downsize/cytoreduce RPS and hopefully&#xD;
      improve oncologic outcomes. Studies have shown that preoperative radiation does not&#xD;
      cytoreduce these tumours. In this study, the potential of systemic therapy for cytoreduction&#xD;
      will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard systemic therapy regimen for treatment of patients with STS remains&#xD;
      Adriamycin/Ifosphamide, although side effects can be tolerated only by relatively young and&#xD;
      fit patients. The use of this regimen preoperatively for extremity STS results in average&#xD;
      response rates of about 30-40%, as judged by histologic assessment of the resected specimen.&#xD;
      The international experience with preoperative chemotherapy for RPS is very limited, and&#xD;
      there are no published reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional imaging may provide a more meaningful assessment of tumour response to systemic&#xD;
      therapy. PET-MR is a newer modality that may hold promise in assessing solid tumour response&#xD;
      and its potential utility is currently of rapidly growing interest. Conventional MRI can&#xD;
      offer a more detailed assessment of tumour relationships to adjacent structures than can CT,&#xD;
      particularly in STS. Integration of PET with MR has the potential to provide information&#xD;
      about metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and to help guide surgical planning.There are no data&#xD;
      available on the utility of PET-MR in evaluating tumour response to chemotherapy in STS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the role of chemotherapy as a preoperative treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma&#xD;
      (RPS) is undefined and controversial. The sarcoma group at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre&#xD;
      (PMCC) has had some experience with this treatment paradigm, but like most sarcoma groups in&#xD;
      Ontario, and Canada, has reserved preoperative chemotherapy for frankly unresectable and&#xD;
      borderline resectable tumours for which downsizing would potentially render resection more&#xD;
      feasible. At present, CT-scan imaging is performed after 2 cycles of chemotherapy, and if&#xD;
      there is no frank progression of the cancer, chemotherapy is continued for another 3-4&#xD;
      cycles. By that point the tumour is smaller on CT scan in about 30% of patients. There are 2&#xD;
      main problems with this approach: 1)70% of the patients may have undergone 5-6 cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy with no apparent benefit; and 2) there may be a metabolic response and&#xD;
      associated benefit without a change in tumour size. The ability to reliably assess tumour&#xD;
      response earlier on (i.e. after 1 cycle) would significantly influence the care of these&#xD;
      patients as ineffective chemotherapy could be terminated after 1 cycle and the regimen could&#xD;
      be modified, or surgery could happen right away before the window of resectability is lost.&#xD;
