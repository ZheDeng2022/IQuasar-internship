  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the preoperative period, 60-80% of the patients had anxiety symptoms. This rate increases&#xD;
      even more during pregnancy. There are a number of studies examining the role of anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms on fetal outcome, but the mechanisms that explain the effects of maternal stress are&#xD;
      not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most extensively studied cytokines in neuropsychiatric disorders are TNF-α and IL-6 due&#xD;
      to their effects on the central nervous system. TNF-α levels have been reported to be&#xD;
      elevated in anxiety disorders. In our study, the investigators aimed to determine the&#xD;
      relationship between preoperative anxiety levels and fetal cord blood TNF-α and IL-6 cytokine&#xD;
      levels in pregnant women.&#xD;

      This prospective observational study is planned to involve 30 volunteer patients between&#xD;
      18-40 years of age who will undergo elective caesarean section surgery. People with known&#xD;
      psychiatric illness and medication use, illiterate, who do not have mental competence to&#xD;
      understand survey questions and very urgent patients will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative anxiety levels will be determined by the STAI-Continuity scale at the time of&#xD;
      admission to the anesthesia outpatient clinic and by the STAI-State scale 1 hour before&#xD;
      surgery.The scales will be scored as normal, mild, moderate and severe anxiety. Psychiatric&#xD;
      consultation will be requested for patients with severe anxiety. At the end of the cesarean&#xD;
      section, the concentration of TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines in the blood remaining from routine&#xD;
      blood gas taken from the umbilical cord will be determined to obtain information about the&#xD;
      state of fetal well-being.&#xD;
