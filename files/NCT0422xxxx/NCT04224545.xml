      Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a major complication of cardiac surgery, which&#xD;
      could lead to high morbidity and mortality, increase duration of hospital stay and increase&#xD;
      the cost of treatment. Colchicine possesses both anti-inflammatory and sympatholytic&#xD;
      properties, so it has been studied to prevent POAF. The ACC/AHA guidelines for colchicine&#xD;
      contain a class IIB recommendation, but the ESC guidelines do not recommend this drug. More&#xD;
      researches are needed to focus on reducing of side effects by optimizing the colchicine&#xD;
      regimen to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. It is believed that further&#xD;
      research is needed to investigate the efficacy and safety of colchicine in these conditions.&#xD;

      Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a major complication of cardiac surgery, which&#xD;
      could lead to high morbidity and mortality, increase duration of hospital stay and increase&#xD;
      the cost of treatment. Postoperative AF is considered as a multifactorial phenomenon. Its&#xD;
      pathogenesis is characterized by inflammation, oxidative stress and autonomic dysfunction.&#xD;
      Several predisposing factors lead to the development of POAF, including pre -, intra-and&#xD;
      postoperative factors. The main of them are age, previous history of major cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors and ischemic reperfusion injury during surgery. Treatment of POAF involves drugs&#xD;
      to control the frequency of rhythm in hemodynamically stable patients and other treatment&#xD;
      regimens usually used for the treatment of AF. Intraoperative administration of beta-blockers&#xD;
      and some antiarrhythmic drugs is recommended by international clinical guidelines. In&#xD;
      addition, previous treatment consisting of the use of colchicine, magnesium sulfate, statins&#xD;
      and antioxidants have reduced the incidence of postoperative AF. However, the results of&#xD;
      large-scale randomized trials have observed the development of undesirable adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these recommendations, the question of the correct regimen for prevention of POAF&#xD;
      remains controversial. Colchicine possesses both anti-inflammatory and sympatholytic&#xD;
      properties, so it has been studied to prevent POAF. The ACC/AHA guidelines for colchicine&#xD;
      contain a class IIB recommendation, but the ESC guidelines do not recommend this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two studies sequentially COPPS-1 and COPPS-2 evaluated the effect of colchicine on the&#xD;
      incidence of POAF after open heart surgery (COPPS-1) and the development of postcardiotomy&#xD;
      syndrome (COPPS-2). In COPPS-1, patients (n=336) were treated with colchicine from the third&#xD;
      day after surgery for a month and showed a significant decrease of POAF after heart surgery&#xD;
      over the entire follow-up period. 360 patients were evaluated in the COPPS-2 study. The&#xD;
      incidence of POAF between the colchicine and placebo groups was comparable, although&#xD;
      colchicine significantly reduced postpericardiotomy syndrome. The main limitation of the&#xD;
      COPSS-2 study was the high rate of cessation of intervention (20% of participants), which had&#xD;
      a significant impact on the outcome of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the latest meta-analysis of the colchicine effect on POAF after heart surgery, it&#xD;
      was found that it still reduces POAF compared with control (HR = 0.69, 95% IM 0.57-0.84, p =&#xD;
      0.0002) and the duration of hospital stay was reduced by 1.2 days (95% IM -1.89 to -0.44, p =&#xD;
      0.002); however, the frequency of adverse gastrointestinal events increased significantly (HR&#xD;
      = 2.52, 95% IM 1.62-3.93, p &lt; 0.0001). Despite the high level of side effects, a significant&#xD;
      reduction of POAF outweighs the balance in the favor of its use. However, more researches are&#xD;
      needed to focus on reducing of side effects by optimizing the colchicine regimen to reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. It is believed that further research is&#xD;
      needed to investigate the efficacy and safety of colchicine in these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is aimed to study the effectiveness of short-term administration of the drug.&#xD;
