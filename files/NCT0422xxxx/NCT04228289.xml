      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, debilitating condition that&#xD;
      disproportionately affects Veterans. Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is a &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
      treatment for PTSD. However, approximately one-third of Veterans fail to receive an adequate&#xD;
      dose of treatment because they prematurely drop out of PE therapy. There is also room to&#xD;
      improve PE treatment outcomes. Consistent with the VA Office of Research and Development&#xD;
      initiative to develop effective treatments for PTSD, the proposed randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      will examine the ability of oxytocin (as compared with placebo) combined with PE to reduce&#xD;
      PTSD symptom severity, improve the rate of PTSD symptom reduction, and to enhance PE&#xD;
      treatment retention and adherence. This two-site study will leverage the investments made in&#xD;
      the nationwide rollout off PE therapy and has the potential to significantly improve mental&#xD;
      health care among Veterans, advance the science in this area, and identify mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying positive PTSD treatment response. Participants may choose to complete this&#xD;
      research study via home-based telemedicine (HBT) care (i.e. service delivery to patients in&#xD;
      their homes using consumer friendly, video-conferencing technology). HBT sessions will be&#xD;
      delivered via standard desk, laptop computer, tablet, or smartphone using VA approved&#xD;
      applications. All procedures that take place via telemedicine will be performed and completed&#xD;
      as though they were in-person/in-office&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most highly prevalent mental health disorder&#xD;
      among U.S. military Veterans. PTSD is a chronic disorder that is associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality, disability, and costly health care expenditures. The clinical&#xD;
      impairment associated with PTSD among Veterans is severe and associated with comorbid&#xD;
      depression, suicidality, substance abuse, physical health problems, interpersonal violence,&#xD;
      and neuropsychiatric impairment. Despite these pervasive health consequences, the current&#xD;
      treatment services offered to Veterans do not adequately address PTSD. Several promising&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions, including Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, have been developed&#xD;
      for the treatment of PTSD. Although PE is one of the most widely used evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments for PTSD, there is substantial room for improvement in outcomes and retention&#xD;
      rates. For example, approximately one-third of patients dropout of PE treatment prematurely,&#xD;
      and the highest dropout rates occur among Veterans. Consistent with the VA Office of Research&#xD;
      and Development initiative to develop effective treatments for PTSD, identifying&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies to enhance PTSD treatment retention and outcomes is critical. Accumulating&#xD;
      data from the investigators' group and others suggests that oxytocin is a promising candidate&#xD;
      to achieve this goal. Oxytocin is known to promote prosocial behaviors associated with&#xD;
      successful psychosocial treatment outcomes (e.g., trust, safety, social cognition) and has&#xD;
      demonstrated positive effects on extinction learning in animal and human stress models.&#xD;
      Furthermore, recent neuroimaging studies show that oxytocin has the ability to ameliorate&#xD;
      dysregulation of the corticolimbic brain circuitry, which is a central component of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology and maintenance of PTSD. In the only study to date examining the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of augmenting PE with oxytocin, the investigators'&#xD;
      group found that participants randomized to the oxytocin condition demonstrated lower PTSD&#xD;
      and depression symptoms during PE, and had higher working alliance scores compared to&#xD;
      participants randomized to the placebo condition. Therefore, the primary objective of the&#xD;
      proposed two-site Phase II study is to examine the ability of oxytocin (vs. placebo) combined&#xD;
      with PE therapy to (1) reduce PTSD symptom severity, (2) improve rate of PTSD symptom&#xD;
      improvement, and (3) improve PE adherence and retention rates. To accomplish these&#xD;
      objectives, the investigators will employ a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial and use standardized, repeated dependent measures of change at five time points&#xD;
      (baseline, mid-treatment, end of treatment, and 3 and 6 month follow-up). The proposed study&#xD;
      directly addresses the mission of the Veterans Health Administration Blueprint for Excellence&#xD;
      in that it seeks to advance personalized and proactive mental health care opportunities for&#xD;
      Veterans. Findings from this study will provide critical new information regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy of oxytocin to augment psychosocial treatment for PTSD, as well as information&#xD;
      regarding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PTSD and positive treatment response.&#xD;
      Participants may choose to complete this research study via home-based telemedicine (HBT)&#xD;
      care (i.e. service delivery to patients in their homes using consumer friendly,&#xD;
      video-conferencing technology). HBT sessions will be delivered via standard desk, laptop&#xD;
      computer, tablet, or smartphone using VA approved applications. All procedures that take&#xD;
      place via telemedicine will be performed and completed as though they were&#xD;
      in-person/in-office&#xD;
