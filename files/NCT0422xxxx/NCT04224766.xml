  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative analgesia for shoulder surgery is typically achieved by providing an&#xD;
      interscalene brachial plexus block. However, a very common side effect of this block is&#xD;
      hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis, a state which may not be tolerated in patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      conditions such as COPD. Recently, clinicians have explored new ways to provide satisfactory&#xD;
      analgesia while minimizing the pulmonary side effects of the interscalene nerve block. One of&#xD;
      these solutions might be to offer the patient a suprascapular nerve block combined to a&#xD;
      costoclavicular block. Since these blocks are performed lower in the neck or under the&#xD;
      clavicle, the phrenic nerve is less likely to be blocked. Thus, fewer respiratory side&#xD;
      effects have been reported when using such blocks. This prospective observational study will&#xD;
      evaluate the patient response to surgical stimuli and the opioid requirements&#xD;
      intraoperatively in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopies with either a supraclavicular&#xD;
      and costoclavicular blocks or an interscalene block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, randomized open label non-inferiority trial. Subject Population:&#xD;
      Adults scheduled to undergo elective shoulder arthroscopy Sample Size: 60 patients Study&#xD;
      Duration: Starts February 2020 - Ends February 2021 - Interim analysis at 30 patients Study&#xD;
      Center: Assuit university hospital&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of this study is that the suprascapular block combined with a&#xD;
      costoclavicular block is not inferior to the interscalene brachial plexus block in terms of&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia. Inverstigators postulate that postoperative pain score will not&#xD;
      differ significantly in patients who receive either block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      secondary objectives will consist in looking at the differences in intraoperative anesthetic&#xD;
      consumption, postoperative opioid consumption, arm motor block, diaphragmatic paresis,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and time for readiness to discharge from PACU. investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that these outcomes will be similar in both groups, with the exception of a potential&#xD;
      reduction in arm motor block and diaphragmatic paresis in the combined suprascapular and&#xD;
      costoclavicular block group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having obtained institutional ethics board approval of the study, patients older than&#xD;
      18 years old, scheduled for a first elective shoulder arthroscopy under general anesthesia&#xD;
      will be screened in the pre-anesthesia clinic. patients will be approached and the whole&#xD;
      study procedures will be explained extensively. Interested patients will be invited to sign&#xD;
      the consent form .Patients will have the right to opt out at any time. The investigators will&#xD;
      meet the patients again on the morning of the surgery to address any concerns. After consent,&#xD;
      a study number will be allocated to the patient in ascending order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: single shot US-guided suprascapular nerve block with 5 mL bupivacaine 0.5%,&#xD;
           then single shot US-guided costoclavicular block with 10 ml bupivacaine 0.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: single shot US-guided interscalene brachial plexus block with 15 mL bupivacaine&#xD;
           0.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests will be done to evaluate the nerve block-induced loss of sensation to ice prior to&#xD;
      entering the operating room (OR). Diaphragmatic excursion will be evaluated using an&#xD;
      abdominal curvilinear ultrasound probe, and will be classified as being normal, paradoxical&#xD;
      or immobile. Normal motion is caudad movement during inspiration. Paradoxical motion is&#xD;
      cephalad movement during inspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once in the operating room, all routine monitors are connected.. Both study monitors are&#xD;
      switched on and will record their respective indices continuously for the duration of the&#xD;
      anesthesia. General anesthesia will be induced with propofol (1-2 mg/kg IV), fentanil (1&#xD;
      Âµg/kg IV bolus) and cis-atracium (0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV; ). A bolus of dexamethasone 4mg IV will&#xD;
      be administered after induction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also have received oral acetaminophen 1g preoperatively. Intubation with an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube is performed once the patient is adequately paralyzed . All drugs are given&#xD;
      according to the adjusted body weight of the patient. This is calculated with Robinson's&#xD;
      formula: where TBW is total body weight and IBW is ideal body weight (21-22). Immediately&#xD;
      after intubation, anesthesia is maintained with isoflurane . At the end of anesthesia, when&#xD;
      the surgeon starts closing the wounds, an IV bolus of hydromorphone 0.7 mcg/kg of adjusted&#xD;
      body weight is administered. Emergence and extubation are done in the OR. All times (start&#xD;
      skin closure, start dressing, stop isoflurane) will be precisely reported in the CRF.&#xD;
