    <textblock>
      Background: Duloxetine provides an analgesic effect of patients with OA. The mode of action&#xD;
      of duloxetine is partly believed to act through modulating the descending inhibitory pain&#xD;
      pathways from the brainstem towards the spinal cord thereby dampening pain by gating the&#xD;
      afferent pain signals from the periphery during their passage to the brain. This study aims&#xD;
      to investigate if the analgesic effect of duloxetine is due to modulation of pain mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale: The present study will utilize a set of quantitative pain biomarkers&#xD;
      developed to assess peripheral and central manifestations in OA and the influence of&#xD;
      duloxetine on those manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sequence 1: 20 mg duloxetine QD for 1 week, 40 mg Duloxetine QD for 1 week, 60 mg&#xD;
           duloxetine QD for 10 weeks, 40 mg duloxetine QD for 1 week, 20 mg duloxetine QD for 1&#xD;
           week, followed by 14 weeks of corresponding placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sequence 2: 14 weeks of placebo followed by 20 mg Duloxetine QD for 1 week, 40 mg&#xD;
           duloxetine QD for 1 week, 60 mg duloxetine QD for 10 weeks, 40 mg duloxetine QD for 1&#xD;
           week and 20 mg duloxetine QD for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two treatment periods of 14 weeks each are separated by a washout period of two weeks and&#xD;
      include a two-week titration period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To assess the effect of 60 mg daily maintenance dose administration of&#xD;
      Duloxetine for 10 weeks compared with placebo on pain mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification/Statistics: The sample size was calculated to 32 patients providing&#xD;
      a power of 85% with a significant level of 0.05 to detect a group difference of 1 point in&#xD;
      the change from baseline of the week 12 mean of 24-hour worst pain between duloxetine and&#xD;
      placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection: Up to 40 patients with osteoarthritic knee pain will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study in order to complete 32 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mech-Sense Aalborg University Hospital, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark Study Assessments: As the&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is the assessment of which pain mechanisms are modulated by&#xD;
      administration of the study drug, the primary endpoints will be Experimental Mechanism Based&#xD;
      Pain Measures (EPMs) including 1) Pressure Pain Thresholds (PPTs), Temporal Summation,&#xD;
      Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) and Offset Analgesia. In addition, efficacy will be&#xD;
      evaluated using 1) pain severity (worst daily pain and night pain), 2) Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Index (PSQI), 3) Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), 4) Investigator and Patient Global&#xD;
      Assessment of Changes (IGIC and PGAC), 5) Western Ontario and MacMaster (WOMAC) OA physical&#xD;
      function, 6) PainDetect, and 7) Central Sensitization Index (CSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Discontinuation rates and Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs). Key&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Males or females between 40 and 75 years of age, who are&#xD;
      postmenopausal or using allowed contraception methods, and have a Body Mass Index (BMI)&#xD;
      between 20-35 kg/m2 inclusive Patient with unilateral or bilateral OA of knee diagnosed&#xD;
      according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria based on clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic evidence with pain severity equal to or higher than 5 on a Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
      (VAS) assessed as the worst pain within the last 24 hours.&#xD;
