  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major individual, social and economic&#xD;
      burden worldwide. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a fundamental evidence-based intervention to&#xD;
      manage COPD. However, pulmonary rehabilitation benefits tend to decline over time and&#xD;
      sustaining a long-term physical activity lifestyle is challenging, leading to worse&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Personalised post-pulmonary rehabilitation programmes,&#xD;
      combining different physical activities modalities with social interaction, are warranted to&#xD;
      enable a shift from a disease-based to a patient-centred model and encourage a sustainable&#xD;
      behavioural change. Although such programmes have the potential to sustain pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation benefits and promote patients' long-term adherence to physical activity, their&#xD;
      availability within the community is scarce. Hence, the investigators will implement a&#xD;
      personalised community-based physical activity programme (PICk UP), using the available&#xD;
      resources, adapted to patient's needs/preferences. PICk UP will be a sustainable response to&#xD;
      support healthy lifestyles and enhance pulmonary rehabilitation benefits of respiratory&#xD;
      patients, by integrating them within the community and embracing urban facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of PICk UP, a personalised&#xD;
      community-based physical activity programme, tailored to patients' needs and preferences, on&#xD;
      their physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that PICk UP will empower patients to remain physically active and foster the&#xD;
      maintenance of pulmonary rehabilitation benefits.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD-related morbidity and mortality has been increasing, making COPD already the third&#xD;
      leading cause of death and a growing global health concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a comprehensive intervention, with known cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      in managing patients with COPD. One of the PR goals is to improve physical activity (PA),&#xD;
      since it has shown to reduce exacerbations and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, adopting/sustaining a physically active behaviour is highly challenging and&#xD;
      benefits of PR are usually lost 6 months after its completion. Therefore, PA programmes&#xD;
      capable to maintain the PR effects are urgently needed Community can provide different PA&#xD;
      modalities in various settings, which can be personalised to patients' needs and preferences.&#xD;
      By filling the gaps between healthcare systems and patients' daily environment, these&#xD;
      programmes have the potential to improve patients' HRQoL and self-efficacy, enhancing their&#xD;
      ability to overcome exercise barriers and their motivation to sustain a physically active&#xD;
      behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICk UP will offer patients different PA modalities tailored to their preferences and needs,&#xD;
      thus personalising the community programmes, and aiming at sustaining a physically active&#xD;
      behaviour and enhancing their HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at assessing the effectiveness of PICk UP, a personalised community-based&#xD;
      physical activity programme tailored to patients' needs and preferences, on their physical&#xD;
      activity levels and on the maintenance of pulmonary rehabilitation benefits. To accomplish&#xD;
      these aims a randomised controlled trial will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICk UP randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of PICk UP, a personalised&#xD;
      community-based PA programme, tailored to patients' needs and preferences, on their PA&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims is to determine the short- and mid-term effects of PICk UP on HRQoL&#xD;
      symptoms, number of exacerbations, healthcare use, exercise capacity, functionality,&#xD;
      motivation to exercise, peripheral muscle strength and emotional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Primary healthcare providers of Aveiro and Estarreja or pulmonologists of the&#xD;
      Centro Hospitalar do Baixo Vouga will inform eligible patients about the study. Additional&#xD;
      information will be provided to those interested to participate in a meeting with the&#xD;
      researcher and written informed consent will be acquired. Patients with COPD will be eligible&#xD;
      if they are clinically stable, as determined by their referred doctor, and completed a PR&#xD;
      programme in the previous month. Patients will be excluded if they present signs of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment or have significant cardiovascular, neurological or musculoskeletal diseases,&#xD;
      which may limit their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Patients will be randomised into experimental group (EG) or control group (CG).&#xD;
      The EG will receive the PICk UP programme. The CG will receive no additional interventions&#xD;
      and will only proceed with the physical activity recommendations delivered during the&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation programme. Assessments will be conducted by a second researcher&#xD;
      blinded to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline, after 3 months and after the intervention (6 months). The&#xD;
      researcher will collect:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic, anthropometric, general clinical data (e.g., number of exacerbations&#xD;
           or healthcare utilisation);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity levels (time in sedentary, moderate and vigorous physical activities;&#xD;
           steps/day): accelerometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health related quality of life: St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease impact: COPD Assessment Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise tolerance: six-minute walk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motivations to exercise: Behavioural Regulation and Exercise Questionnaire-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quadriceps muscle strength: Handheld dynamometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatigue: Checklist of Individual Strength-8 and the Functional assessment of chronic&#xD;
           illness therapy fatigue subscale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handgrip strength: dynamometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emotional status: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of adverse events and adherence to the interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the EG will enrol a 6-months personalised community-based physical activity&#xD;
      programme, which will include 2 sessions/week, with the aerobic training being the&#xD;
      cornerstone. Patients will receive the PICk UP manual and a diary to register their physical&#xD;
      activities. During the 1st month the physiotherapist will guide patients through 4 types of&#xD;
      outdoors (e.g., walking, cycling trails) and indoors (e.g., dance, pilates) physical&#xD;
      activities. Patients will then be asked to choose and commit to 1 or 2 activities, according&#xD;
      to their preferences, which they shall integrate for another 5 months. During this period,&#xD;
      the support provided by physiotherapist will decrease over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2nd and 3rd months: support every 2-weeks (face-to-face physical activity sessions&#xD;
           alternated with phone-calls) to reassure safety, clarify doubts, monitor patients'&#xD;
           evolution and enhance their motivation to physical activity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4th month: 1 face-to-face physical activity session;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5th month: 1 phone-call;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6th month: no support. The sport-related professionals will register patients'&#xD;
           attendance to the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated using G*Power 3.1.9.6, with an effect size specification &quot;as in&#xD;
      G*Power 3.0&quot;, for the within-between interaction of a repeated measures ANOVA with two groups&#xD;
      (control and experimental) and 3 measurements (immediately after, 3 and 6 months post-PR) of&#xD;
      the defined primary outcome (time in moderate to vigorous PA). The investigators considered&#xD;
      an α of 0.05, a power of 0.80, a repeated measures correlation of 0.5, a nonsphericity&#xD;
      correction of 1 and an expected effect size f of 0.30. The effect size f was derived from the&#xD;
      partial η2 of 0.21 (f=0.516) obtained from a study which aimed to assess the impact of a&#xD;
      PA-focused behavioural intervention during and after PR on PA levels in patients with COPD. A&#xD;
      smaller f value of 0.30 was chosen to account for a longer follow-up period (up to 6 months&#xD;
      after PR, instead of 3) and differences in selected time-points. The calculated sample size&#xD;
      was 20 (i.e., 10 in each group) COPD patients and considering a possible 50% dropout rate,&#xD;
      the final sample size was determined to be 40.&#xD;
