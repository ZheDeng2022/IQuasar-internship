  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomised, phase II, exploratory, multi-country and multi-centre&#xD;
      clinical trial. Chemotherapy-naïve patients with EML4-ALK rearrangement and with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will receive brigatinib 90mg for the first 7 days (D 1-7 at&#xD;
      cycle 1) and then 180mg daily thereafter for QW4 cycles of duration (28 days ±3days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brigatinib will be administered until progression disease, unacceptable toxicity, patient or&#xD;
      physician decision to discontinue or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brigatinib may continue beyond disease progression per RECIST v1.1 until loss of clinical&#xD;
      benefit, unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician decision to discontinue, or death as per&#xD;
      SmPC recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 1.5 years excluding a run-in-period of 4-6&#xD;
      months. Treatment and follow-up are expected to extend the study duration to a total of 5&#xD;
      years. Patients will be followed for 1 year after the end of treatment independently of the&#xD;
      cause of end of treatment. The study will end once survival follow-up has concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will end with the preparation of the final report, scheduled for 5.5 years after&#xD;
      the inclusion of the first patient approximately.&#xD;
