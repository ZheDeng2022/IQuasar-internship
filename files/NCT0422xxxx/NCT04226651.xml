  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, two-armed, placebo-controlled, cross-over, controlled trial aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) on dental anxiety, pain, and&#xD;
      behaviour among children undergoing dental treatment under local anaesthesia. The null&#xD;
      hypotheses were as follows: VRET has no effect on reducing dental anxiety and dental pain&#xD;
      scores of participants; and there is no difference between subjective and objective measure&#xD;
      scores of dental anxiety and pain when VRET and attention palcebo-controlled (APC) groups are&#xD;
      used to reduce anxiety in children undergoing dental treatment with local anaesthesia.&#xD;

      This randomized, two-armed, placebo-controlled, cross-over, controlled trial adhered to the&#xD;
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, good clinical practice guidelines, and applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirements. Ethics approval was obtained from the Health Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Sivas Cumhuriyet University (Sivas, Turkey; ID: 2018-02/08). All parents or guardians of&#xD;
      children were educated about the study before enrollment and provided informed written&#xD;
      consent to participate. The trial adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials&#xD;
      (CONSORT) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters used to calculate the sample size included a 95% confidence interval (CI), 80%&#xD;
      statistical power, and a standard deviation of 1.90; accordingly, at least 64 subjects were&#xD;
      required. This number was adjusted to 76 subjects to compensate for a projected loss of&#xD;
      approximately 20% during follow-up. Thus, 76 healthy subjects between 7 and 11 years of age&#xD;
      were included in the study. Participants who fulfilled the following criteria were included:&#xD;
      systemically and mentally healthy; required restorative treatment for first mandibular&#xD;
      permanent molar tooth with dentin caries in each mandibular quadrant with a bilateral&#xD;
      inferior alveolar nerve block; absence of co-operative disability; and Frankl Scale score 2&#xD;
      or 3 during first dental examination. Patients with systemic or mental illnesses, reduced&#xD;
      audiovisual capabilities, acute dental pain or trauma, those with previous painful or&#xD;
      negative dental experience, and those who were extremely uncooperative were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present randomized, two-armed, within-subject, cross-over, controlled trial included&#xD;
      patients who applied to Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Cumhuriyet University, for routine&#xD;
      dental treatment.The study comprised three visits: V0, baseline dental examination and&#xD;
      inclusion; V1, first restorative treatment session; and V2, second restorative treatment&#xD;
      session for symmetrical teeth. The initial oral and radiographic examination and Frankl&#xD;
      Behaviour Scale scoring of all patients were performed by one experienced and pre-calibrated&#xD;
      researcher. A dental assistant not participating in the study used a random-order generator&#xD;
      (http://www.random.org) to randomize patients to the experimental group according to block&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants were treated in two different appointments: protective glasses only,&#xD;
      without distraction (APC); or with the treatment condition (VRET). All procedures were&#xD;
      performed by a single experienced and calibrated paediatric dentist (BB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm to receive VR with the first or&#xD;
      second sequential dental treatment session and with protective glasses for the other&#xD;
      treatment session. The investigators were blinded to treatment sequence until before the&#xD;
      first dental treatment was to begin. Before VRET, the VR headset was shown to the patients,&#xD;
      who were permitted to handle it. This enabled the patient to recognize the device and be&#xD;
      familiar with it before treatment. Before starting treatment, the VR headset was placed on&#xD;
      each patient's head, and the patient was asked whether the device caused pain or discomfort,&#xD;
      and the patient's consent was confirmed. In the APC group, each patient was informed about&#xD;
      the dental procedure and was provided with protective glasses. All patients were told that&#xD;
      they were wearing these glasses to ensure a pain- and stress-free treatment, and that the&#xD;
      dentist would devote additional attention to the treatment. This aimed to provide the patient&#xD;
      with feeling like being in an experimental session. The reason for choosing an APC group with&#xD;
      the routine protective glasses without distraction was to mitigate possible Hawthorne&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of experimental group, in the first treatment session, the mandibular first&#xD;
      permanent molar tooth of each patient was restored with composite filling under local&#xD;
      anaesthesia, while the opposite symmetrical tooth was treated in the second session. The&#xD;
      duration of treatment in each session was noted and defined as the time from the subject sat&#xD;
      on the chair to occlusal adjustment of restoration. First, the teeth were cleaned using&#xD;
      fluoride-free prophylactic paste. The preparation was limited to removal of the caries,&#xD;
      followed by rounding of the inner line and point angles. Cavity preparation was performed&#xD;
      using an 80 µm grit diamond bur and completed using a 25 µm grit diamond bur (Intensiv,&#xD;
      Viganello-Lugano, Switzerland). Isolation and contamination were controlled with suction and&#xD;
      cotton rollers. In cases for which this was not sufficient, a rubber dam was used. Metal&#xD;
      matrix bands and wooden wedges were also used where necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY,&#xD;
      USA). Descriptive analysis was used to summarize demographic characteristics and responses of&#xD;
      the participants on each scale. The chi-squared test was used to compare age and sex&#xD;
      differences at baseline. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to analyse changes according&#xD;
      treatment group, dental visit sequence and time point of treatment procedure. Differences&#xD;
      with p &lt; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
