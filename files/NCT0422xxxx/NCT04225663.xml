    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to explore potential methods of rehabilitating changes&#xD;
      observed from repetitive head impacts. Participation in this study will involve functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging, aerobic testing, heart rate variability (HRV) wrist&#xD;
      monitor, hypercapnia challenge, a meditation rehabilitation intervention, and filling out&#xD;
      survey information concerning subjective well-being.&#xD;

      COLLEGE ATHLETES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, participants will undergo an fMRI-cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)&#xD;
      challenge scanning session as well as an aerobic exercise test on a stationary bike. During&#xD;
      the CVR-fMRI scan, the participant will wear a mask that will deliver a blend of oxygen and&#xD;
      nitrogen at varying amounts while lying in an MRI scanner. During the aerobic stationary bike&#xD;
      assessment, the participant will pedal at a steady state against applied resistance for 10&#xD;
      minutes while wearing a 3-lead ECG monitor to observe heart rate. A Biostrap heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV) wrist monitor will be provided which will be worn daily. The data from the&#xD;
      monitor, concerning HRV and sleep, will be collected. The participant will answer a brief&#xD;
      survey concerning the previous night's sleep. After the conclusion of the sport's season,&#xD;
      there will be a follow up scanning session. After the post-season scan, the participant will&#xD;
      participate in a breath work meditation intervention over the following two months, twice a&#xD;
      week for a 30 minute meditation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a Biostrap HRV monitor which will be worn daily. The data from the&#xD;
      monitor, concerning HRV and sleep, will be collected. The participant will answer a brief&#xD;
      survey concerning the previous night's sleep. High school althletes will be randomized into&#xD;
      one of two study groups, the control group or the intervention group. The intervention group&#xD;
      will receive guided meditation. The control group will proceed about their lives normally.&#xD;

The RCADS is scored either manually or by using an automated scoring procedure. Each item is assigned a numerical value from 0-3, where 0 = Never, 1 = Sometimes, 2 = Often, and 3 = Always. The highest score possible is 18, the lowest 0. This is an overall assessment of an individual's mental health and not what is considered better or worse. Examples include separation anxiety disorder or social phobia.</description>

             enrolled in an ongoing NIH funded study of subconcussive head impact exposure&#xD;
             (Whitlow: R01 NS091602), which acquires pre- and post-season MRI scans and cognitive&#xD;
             testing.&#xD;
