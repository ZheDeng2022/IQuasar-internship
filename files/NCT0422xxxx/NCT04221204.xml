    <description>All subjects in each cohort will receive a single oral dose of 3D185, followed by a 7-day washout period (i.e. single-dose PK study period). Then, subjects will receive consecutive daily doses (Once daily [QD], 28 days/cycle) until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdraw of informed consent, whichever comes first. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period includes the single-dose PK study period and the first treatment cycle (within 35 days after the first dose). The enrolled subjects will be sequentially assigned to the planned dose cohorts according to the protocol and receive 3D185 treatment to observe the occurrence of DLT.</description>
