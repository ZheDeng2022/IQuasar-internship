  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a skills training program to help with coping skills for&#xD;
      pain that was designed specifically for women with persistent pain after breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain following breast cancer surgery is increasingly recognized as an important&#xD;
      clinical and public health issue due to the large number of women affected, the powerful&#xD;
      negative impact that persistent pain has on emotional and physical functioning and its&#xD;
      financial costs. Most of the more than a quarter of a million women newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      breast cancer in the U.S. this year will undergo surgery as a part of curative treatment. The&#xD;
      prevalence of persistent pain following surgical removal of the affected breast (mastectomy)&#xD;
      or more limited surgeries (lumpectomy) is high, ranging from 25-60% across studies. Unlike&#xD;
      acute post-operative pain, which is a normal response to surgical trauma, persistent pain at&#xD;
      or near the surgical site has an uncertain multifaceted etiology, and no satisfactory&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment. A critical question is whether key pain-related psychosocial&#xD;
      factors are drivers of the continuing burden of persistent pain, and whether they could be&#xD;
      ameliorated by non-pharmacological intervention. The research planned under this award will&#xD;
      provide a first critical test of the hypothesized driving role of pain catastrophizing in&#xD;
      persistent pain after breast cancer surgery. It also will explore the role of two other key&#xD;
      psychosocial variables that may contribute to the burden associated with persistent pain&#xD;
      after breast cancer surgery: self-efficacy for engaging in valued activities and&#xD;
      psychological inflexibility. We have developed, manualized, and pilot tested a pain coping&#xD;
      skills training intervention that specifically targets the needs of women with persistent&#xD;
      pain following breast cancer surgery (Targeted PCST) and aims to reduce pain catastrophizing,&#xD;
      increase self-efficacy for engaging in valued activities, and decrease psychological&#xD;
      inflexibility. We propose a multiple-site, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the Targeted-PCST intervention. The study will be conducted in diverse oncology clinics&#xD;
      affiliated with Duke University/Duke Cancer Network and the University of Pittsburgh/UPMC&#xD;
      Hillman Cancer Center. Participants (N=564) will be randomized to either receive: 1)&#xD;
      Targeted-PCST, 2) a general health education intervention (control), or 3) enhanced usual&#xD;
      care (control). Participants will complete assessments pre-intervention and at 3 months&#xD;
      (post-intervention), 6 months follow-up, and 12 months follow-up. Study aims are: Aim 1:&#xD;
      Examine the impact of Targeted-PCST on persistent post-surgical pain severity and&#xD;
      interference (i.e., PEG score), emotional distress (anxiety and depression), and&#xD;
      cancer-specific distress. Aim 2: Investigate the impact of Targeted-PCST on pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, and psychological inflexibility, and evaluate these&#xD;
      variables as possible mediators of the benefits of Targeted-PCST. Aim 3: Evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of Targeted-PCST on pain sensitivity and central sensitization, and explore whether changes&#xD;
      in these variables mediate group differences in pain severity and interference.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Study staff conducting assessments will be blind to group assignment. To maintain blinding, we will use the following approaches: 1) all study staff will be trained on the importance of blinding and study procedures to maintain blinding; 2) participants will be provided with the rationale and instructions not to disclose their group assignment; 3) the study staff who conduct post-intervention assessments will not be given information about group assignment prior to the assessment; and 4) if a breach occurs, it will be documented and the participant will complete their assessment with a new assessor.</masking_description>
