  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, and observational real-world study aimed at investigating&#xD;
      the current situation of surgical treatments and prognosis for acute epidural hematoma in&#xD;
      China, and analyzing the optimization of therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Acute Epidural Hematoma (AEDH) among traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients&#xD;
      has been reported to be in the range of 2.7 to 4%. The mortality in patients in all age&#xD;
      groups and GCS scores undergoing surgery for evacuation of EDH is approximately 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people with EDH are generally expected to have a good clinical outcome with the prompt&#xD;
      and correct treatment. However, AEDH still represents a potentially life-threatening&#xD;
      condition when a local mass effect exists due to rapidly elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)&#xD;
      resulted from the rapid build-up of blood. Brain hernia and cerebral infarction might occur&#xD;
      and lead to a terrible clinical outcome. In addition, there is a set of patients who&#xD;
      experience clinical deterioration after an initial hematoma-evacuation craniotomy because of&#xD;
      secondary brain injuries, including massive cerebral infarction (MCI), additional&#xD;
      decompressive craniectomy is recommended as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although DC can reduce the morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients with a sTBI,&#xD;
      the removal of the bone flap is not necessary for the majority of patients with AEDH, because&#xD;
      of the relatively low incidence of MCI secondary to AEDH. Recommendations indicated an&#xD;
      epidural hematoma greater than 30 ml should be surgically evacuated regardless of the&#xD;
      patient's GCS score. Although craniotomy provides a complete evacuation to remove the clot of&#xD;
      the hematoma, there are insufficient data to support a specific surgical treatment method.&#xD;
      The choice of operative technique is influenced by the surgeon's expertise, training, and&#xD;
      evaluation of a particular situation. Therefore, there is a clinical rationale for&#xD;
      investigating the current status of surgical treatments and prognosis for AEDH, thereby&#xD;
      providing a reliable reference for the optimization of therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is indicated by the long-term functional outcomes, including overall mortality and the score on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), &quot;Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale&quot; is the unabbreviated scale title. The minimum value of scale is score 1, and maximum value is scored 8, higher scores mean a better outcome and lower scores mean worse outcome. Specific scored as follows:&#xD;
death;&#xD;
persistent vegetative state;&#xD;
lower severe disability;&#xD;
upper severe disability; (stratum 3 and 4 were considered as severe disability, with permanent requirement for help with daily living);&#xD;
lower moderate disability;&#xD;
upper moderate disability; (stratum 5 and 6 were considered as mild disability, without a need for assistance in everyday life, that might, however, require special equipment for employment);&#xD;
lower good recovery;&#xD;
upper good recovery (stratum 7 and 8 were considered as good recovery).</description>

    <measure>quality of life (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>Unabbreviated scale title is &quot;5-level EuroQol five dimensions&quot; questionnaire. The EQ-5D is a generic instrument for describing and valuing health. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
