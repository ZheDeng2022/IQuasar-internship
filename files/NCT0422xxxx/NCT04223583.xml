    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcoma STS is a group of malignant tumors derived from connective tissue other&#xD;
      than bone and cartilage. It can occur in any part of the body at any age, and there is no&#xD;
      significant gender difference.According to pathological classification, STS has 19 tissue&#xD;
      types and more than 50 disease subtypes.Currently, surgical resection, radiotherapy and drug&#xD;
      therapy are the main treatment methods.But about 50% of the patients with distant metastasis&#xD;
      happened not the surgical removal of, quite a number of in patients with distant metastasis&#xD;
      after died of disease progression 8-12 months in drug treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, the&#xD;
      current widely used chemotherapy regimens for ADM/IFO single-agent or joint IFO ADM is a line&#xD;
      of chemotherapy, in addition, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, dorsey race, it was also used for soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcomas of second-line chemotherapy scheme, however, for some special subtypes of&#xD;
      sarcoma,Such as myxoid liposarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, glandular&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcoma and superficial malignant fibrous histiocytoma, are not sensitive to&#xD;
      chemotherapy or low sensitivity.Therefore, how to improve the survival rate of these patients&#xD;
      is an urgent problem to be solved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anlootinib hydrochloride is a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown good&#xD;
      efficacy in solid tumors such as NSCLC, ovarian cancer, soft tissue tumors, and medullary&#xD;
      thyroid cancer.Especially in the field of soft tissue sarcomas, the results of phase IIb&#xD;
      clinical data were satisfactory.Therefore, Investigator plan to conduct the study of&#xD;
      anrotenil hydrochloride capsule for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas with first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy failure (anthracycline)&#xD;
