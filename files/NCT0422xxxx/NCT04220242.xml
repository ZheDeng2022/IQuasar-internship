  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK and Ireland, it is the second&#xD;
      commonest cancer in both men and women. Very often the diagnosis is made by either&#xD;
      endoscopy/colonoscopy and the surgical treatment is carried out by a minimally invasive&#xD;
      approach (&quot;Keyhole&quot;surgery). Tissue samples gathered by either approach are sent to the&#xD;
      pathologist to confirm the nature of their content. At present this takes some time (days)&#xD;
      and so the information cannot guide the procedure being done or indeed any other&#xD;
      investigations or processes that need implementation as soon as possible until the pathology&#xD;
      process is completed. Fluorescence guided surgery uses an approved dye along with approved&#xD;
      cameras to add more information regarding tissue characteristics then is available by normal&#xD;
      viewing alone. It has already been shown to be associated with an improvement in safety&#xD;
      related to healing after colorectal surgery and the investigators are sooning in a randomised&#xD;
      trial examining this in rectal cancer to prove it. Whether or not this trial proves this or&#xD;
      not, the ability to better understand tissue health during investigation/operation needs&#xD;
      further examination and development. In this study, the investigators will examine the role&#xD;
      of computer vision and machine learning in determining the nature of the tissue being seen in&#xD;
      real-time additive to the surgeons' own opinion and experience. This is needed because the&#xD;
      dynamic phases of fluorescence inflow into any tissue is difficult to interpret most&#xD;
      especially when it relates to microvasculature as is present within a cancer site or deposit.&#xD;
      By this means the investigators hope to better understand the dynamic perfusion in and out of&#xD;
      tissue whether normal or abnormal and define signatures that can speed up and/or help inform&#xD;
      the surgeon regarding the actual nature of the tissue being seen. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare the data being generated with that already being captured with regard to standard&#xD;
      pathology and radiology and other laboratory measures of clinical course. Tissue resected&#xD;
      from a patient will also be examined in the laboratory under near-infrared microscopy and&#xD;
      analysed for fluorescence intensity to understand where exactly and how much of the dye&#xD;
      accumulates in specific regions of tissue. There are no new operations in this study and no&#xD;
      new interventions are being made on the basis of the information being gathered- it's a&#xD;
      comparative study to see how this added information can add value to interventionalists&#xD;
      during surgery. There are four collaborating groups involved in this research consortium, two&#xD;
      are commercial partners as they add value in both this advanced field of analytics and in the&#xD;
      ensuring a clinical business case is included so that findings of this work can be useful for&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      This is a combined retrospective and prospective, unblinded, non-CTIMP, multicentre,&#xD;
      observational study to develop and determine methods of applying CV and AI with IFA in&#xD;
      surgery for clinical benefit in surgery. Surgery can be performed via a minimally invasive&#xD;
      fashion whether by an endoscopic or a laparoscopic or robotic technique (the latter depending&#xD;
      on surgeon's preference) as part of either a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in the&#xD;
      standard way based on the patients' clinical need. Either before or during the procedure, a&#xD;
      visual contrast agent will be administered by peripheral cannula and the area of interest&#xD;
      examined by use of a near-infrared scope to determine presence, persistence and&#xD;
      inflow/outflow pathways of the dye. The video image will be subjected to further analysis by&#xD;
      computer vision and data analytics for the purposes of elucidating specific patterns enabling&#xD;
      machine learning to build algorithms for flow characterisation informed by biophysics and&#xD;
      pseudo-anonymised clinical data. The developmental algorithms will be additionally informed&#xD;
      by mechanistic work quantifying and localising the fluorescence agent within and around sites&#xD;
      of abnormal disease by digital fluorescence scanning and near-infrared microscopy as well as&#xD;
      deep characterisation of dye clearance dynamics and local tissue metabolites (particularly&#xD;
      acidosis). In addition, some tissue from the resected specimens provided in the course of&#xD;
      diagnostic investigation or cancer surgery will be used to develop organoids for the purpose&#xD;
      of examining in vitro tumour uptake and distribution of fluorescence agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all 250 patients will be studied over the three-year period, comprising 100 patients&#xD;
      undergoing anastomotic construction and 100 undergoing cancer diagnostics/resection. Some&#xD;
      patients can be included in both groups). Following development (potentially earlier then&#xD;
      above), prospective validation will be performed on approximately 25 patients in each group.&#xD;
      The follow-up period ends 30 days after recruitment. The trial will not be blinded to&#xD;
      participants, medical staff, or clinical trial staff. The contrast agents used are clinically&#xD;
      approved (including indocyanine green) for such use within this study. While the validation&#xD;
      component of this work will be performed prospectively, the initial model development will&#xD;
      include some data from patients retrospectively who have already undergone similar&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
