      Rationale: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men worldwide. Survival rates are&#xD;
      high due to the typically non-aggressive nature of disease and effective treatments. Radical&#xD;
      treatments such as surgery and radiotherapy often cause toxicity and long term side effects.&#xD;
      Based on current available literature, the choice for primary therapy for clinically&#xD;
      localised prostate cancer has a negative impact on cancer-specific quality of life (QOL). New&#xD;
      interventional treatments are being developed. The investigators aim to build a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary prostate cancer cohort which will serve as a multi-trial facility for&#xD;
      interventional treatment studies. The Trials within Cohorts (TwiCs) design, also known as&#xD;
      cohort multiple Randomized Controlled Trial design (cmRCT) will be conducted and as a&#xD;
      prospective registry for assessment of long-term safety, performance and effectiveness new&#xD;
      treatment interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To set up a cohort that will serve as a multi-trial platform and facilitate&#xD;
      evaluation of new interventional treatment for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Observational, prospective cohort study, according to the 'Trials within&#xD;
      Cohorts' (TwiCs) design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients with newly diagnosed histologically proven prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Clinical parameters (e.g. co-morbidity, oncological history,&#xD;
      symptoms, imaging, technical and treatment data), clinical endpoints (e.g. toxicity, and&#xD;
      survival outcomes) and patient reported outcomes (e.g. QOL).&#xD;

      Introduction to Trials within Cohorts (TwiCs) design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With &quot;Utrecht Prostate Cohort for cancer treatment intervention studies and long term&#xD;
      evaluation&quot;(UPC) the investigators aim to: (1) develop an ongoing observational database with&#xD;
      short- and long-term clinical and patient-reported outcomes during and after treatment for&#xD;
      newly diagnosed prostate cancer. (2) Provide a cohort for multiple randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials for evaluation of new treatment interventions for prostate cancer. The initial&#xD;
      collaborating centers in the UPC study are the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht and&#xD;
      the St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein both regional tertiary referral centers, covering the&#xD;
      total spectrum of prostate cancer care. All patients with newly diagnosed histologically&#xD;
      proven prostate cancer presenting at the UMC Utrecht or the St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein&#xD;
      are eligible for participation in UPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will implement a cohort-based trial infrastructure following the TwiCs&#xD;
      design. The TwiCs design is an efficient alternative to the classic randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) and is considered particularly suitable for evaluation of image guided&#xD;
      interventions. In TwiCs, prospective cohorts or registries serve as facilities for&#xD;
      simultaneous and randomised evaluation of multiple interventions for the same condition. The&#xD;
      basis of the TwiCs is a large prospective observational cohort of patients with the condition&#xD;
      of interest (e.g. prostate cancer), who (in principle) undergo standard treatment and for&#xD;
      whom relevant short and long term outcome measures are captured. For each new intervention,&#xD;
      all eligible patients within the cohort are identified. Some of these eligible patients will&#xD;
      be randomly selected and offered the new intervention. The outcomes of these randomly&#xD;
      selected patients are then compared to those of the eligible patients receiving usual care.&#xD;
      The same process can be repeated (simultaneously) for other experimental interventions.&#xD;
      Advantages of the TwiCs are its ability to facilitate multiple randomised evaluations, the&#xD;
      improved comparability between trials and the patient-centred informed consent procedure.&#xD;
      Higher numbers of eligible patients are expected to be enrolled in studies, improving&#xD;
      generalisability of results. Also, the cohorts can serve as patient pools from which patients&#xD;
      can be selected for the R-IDEAL (Radiotherapy-Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, and&#xD;
      Long-term evaluation) stage 2a technical development studies, and as registries for long term&#xD;
      follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Utrecht region, the investigators have set up multiple cohorts according to the TwiCs&#xD;
      design, in which over 4000 patients have been enrolled, and in which four trials and dozens&#xD;
      of technical development and observational studies are running.&#xD;
