  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a leading cause of brain injury in infants born before&#xD;
      term. Severe IVH, which occurs nearly exclusively in very preterm infants (born before 32&#xD;
      weeks gestation) who are already at risk of neurodevelopmental delays and cerebral palsy at&#xD;
      baseline, results in a ~5 times higher risk of death or moderate-severe neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      impairment, as well as short-term morbidities in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).&#xD;
      Infants with grade I and II IVH, although less severe than the higher grades of IVH, also&#xD;
      have a higher risk of death or moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment compared to&#xD;
      infants with a normal head ultrasound. Outcomes are worsened by the fact that the brains of&#xD;
      these preterm infants are not fully developed, so the progenitor cells that would later&#xD;
      differentiate and mature are damaged, resulting in hypomyelination and gray matter loss that&#xD;
      are associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. There is no available therapy to treat&#xD;
      the IVH or resultant brain injury, other than symptomatic management for resultant&#xD;
      post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus with lumbar punctures and temporary or permanent shunts, which&#xD;
      have significant risks on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I trial to determine whether fresh intranasal human milk (HM) can be safely&#xD;
      delivered as stem cell therapy to preterm IVH patients within a 3-hour window from HM&#xD;
      expression and to identify signals which would indicate whether intranasal HM stimulates the&#xD;
      repair of damaged brain tissue. Outcomes will be compared to HM fed historical IVH controls.&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place in tertiary care NICUs in Toronto, which care for the highest&#xD;
      proportion of very preterm infants with IVH in Canada. These NICUs have already adopted a&#xD;
      common protocolized approach to manage severe IVH and post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus with&#xD;
      intensive monitoring, early symptomatic management, and detailed prospectively collected IVH&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
