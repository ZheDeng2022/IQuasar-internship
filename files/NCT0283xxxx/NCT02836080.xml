  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among youth, the prevalence of mental health and addiction (MHA) disorders is roughly 20%,&#xD;
      yet youth are challenged to access services in a timely fashion. To address MHA system gaps,&#xD;
      this study will test the benefits of an Integrated Collaborative Care Team (ICCT) model for&#xD;
      at-risk youth with MHA challenges. In partnership with community agencies, adolescent&#xD;
      psychiatry hospital departments, and family health teams, investigators have developed an&#xD;
      innovative model of service provision involving rapid access to MHA services. This model will&#xD;
      be implemented and compared to the usual treatment youth receive in hospital-based,&#xD;
      outpatient, mental health clinics in Toronto. A rapid, systematic, approach to MHA services&#xD;
      geared to need in a youth-friendly environment is expected to result in better MHA outcomes&#xD;
      for youth. Moreover, the ICCT approach is expected to decrease service wait-times, be more&#xD;
      youth- and family-centred, and be more cost-effective.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic randomized control trial (RCT) with random allocation occurring&#xD;
      within each hospital site to either treatment as usual (TAU) (4 out-patient hospital sites)&#xD;
      or treatment at one of 3 community-based Integrated Collaborative Care Teams (ICCTs). A total&#xD;
      of 500 youth aged 14-18 with mental health and/or addictions (MHA) concerns, referred for&#xD;
      out-patient services at one of four local hospitals, will be randomized to receive ICCT care&#xD;
      versus TAU. For each youth, a primary caregiver will also be recruited into the study, if&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With wide inclusion criteria and a design meant to emulate a &quot;real world&quot; setting, this study&#xD;
      will rigorously evaluate a service delivery model composed of multiple interventions for&#xD;
      youth presenting with a broad range of MHA problems. The ICCT is expected to result in better&#xD;
      MHA outcomes, show better performance indicators, and be more cost-effective than TAU.&#xD;

    <description>Integrated Collaborative Care Team (ICCTs) are housed in the local community to improve youth access, in three neighborhoods across Toronto (East Metro Youth Services [EMYS]-Scarborough, EMYS-Southeast Toronto, and Delisle Youth Services-Central Toronto). Each ICCT will include a variety of service providers and coordinated patient care delivering evidence-informed interventions in a stepped-care model.</description>

    <description>The comparator arm consists of out-patient TAU in a hospital setting and will occur at one of four outpatient hospital sites across Toronto.&#xD;
Partners include the following four hospitals: Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Michael Garron Hospital (formerly the Toronto East General Hospital), and Sunnybrook Hospital.</description>
