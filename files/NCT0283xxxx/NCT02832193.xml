  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data on prevention of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (pNCDs) are limited. The purpose&#xD;
      of this monocentric parallel - grouped observational registry is to collect study data from&#xD;
      studies with pNCDs as primary or secondary endpoint to estimate prevalence and incidence of&#xD;
      pNCDs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative cognitive trajectories (Perioperative neurocognitive disorders [pNCDs]) are&#xD;
      described with formal cognitive testing (neurocognitive test battery). Definitions are based&#xD;
      on current nomenclature recommendations (Evered et al.) according to DSM-V criteria including&#xD;
      a multi-component cognitive test battery comparing baseline and postoperative follow-up&#xD;
      testing of patients with cognitive test performance of non-surgical control groups.Cognitive&#xD;
      concern and functional ability are described with items from questionnaires, e.g. IQCODE,&#xD;
      MMQ, GDS, ADL/IADL and others specific to the respective study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated cognitive testing with a battery of computerized neuropsychological tests (Cambridge&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery [CANTAB®]) and non computerized (paper based)tests&#xD;
      (e.g. trailmaking test, Grooved pegboard test, Stroop color word interference test, animal&#xD;
      naming test, etc.) are performed at preoperative baseline, after 5-7 days and at three months&#xD;
      follow up, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years follow-up according to the study design of the&#xD;
      registered studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different calculation methods will be applied to the cognitive test data, primarily the&#xD;
      dichotomousapproach established by Rasmussen et al. in the International Study on&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive deficits (ISPOCD). This calculation method defines POCD as a reliable&#xD;
      change in pre- and postoperative cognitive performance (difference scores) of each individual&#xD;
      in the surgical patients cohort as compared to the changes in a non-surgical control group&#xD;
      (reliable change index in either a composite score including cognitive test parameters from&#xD;
      all tests in the cognitive test battery or in at least two of the chosen cognitive test&#xD;
      parameters). Additional calculation methods like &quot;g-factor&quot;, &quot;GCP&quot; and arbitrary definitions&#xD;
      e.g. &quot;20.20- rule&quot; will be used for detailed methodologic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In two subprojects we plan to describe domain-specific changes in formal cognitive testing&#xD;
      over the registered surgical cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subproject 1-Analyses will be performed in joint evaluation with Monument Therapeutics (Spin&#xD;
      off Cambridge Cognition). The analyses aim to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe cognitive change based on raw cognitive data from the applied cognitive test&#xD;
           battery (computerized tests with CANTAB eclipse, CANTAB research suite, CANTAB connect&#xD;
           and non-computerized tests)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify predisposing factors (e.g. patient characteristics, biomarkers, medications)&#xD;
           predictive of cognitive decline following surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify the cognitive domains most sensitive to neuropsychological change following&#xD;
           surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subproject 2-Analyses will be performed in joint evaluation with Cambridge Cognition. The&#xD;
      analyses aim to :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilitate the use of data collected from non-surgical controls as normative material for&#xD;
      future studies in the research area.&#xD;

Each of the 5 items is scored from 5 (all of the time) to 0 (none of the time). The raw score ranges from 0 (absence of well-being) to 25 (maximal well-being). Scores are then converted to a percentage scale from 0 (absent) to 100 (maximal). Higher scores represent greater psychological well-being.</description>
