      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intrathoracic administration of pemetrexed&#xD;
      when given in conjunction with cisplatin in patients with resectable malignant pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma MPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the toxicity and grades associated with cytoreductive surgery and Hyperthermic&#xD;
      Intraoperative Chemotherapy HIOC with cisplatin and pemetrexed in patients with resectable&#xD;
      MPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess overall survival and progression-free survival after PD or EPP and HIOC with&#xD;
      cisplatin and pemetrexed for MPM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pemetrexed when administered as&#xD;
      a hyperthermic intrathoracic lavage after PD or EPP&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the degree of thymidylate synthase and ERCC1 gene expression in MPM&#xD;
      tissue correlates with clinical response to pemetrexed.&#xD;

      TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREOPERATIVE HYDRATION According to our observations, preoperative hydration reduces the risk&#xD;
      of nephrotoxicity from intrathoracic infusion of hyperthermic cisplatin. Therefore, all&#xD;
      patients will be admitted the night before surgery and receive intravenous hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CYTOREDUCTIVE SURGERY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will undergo an extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) or&#xD;
      pleurectomy/decortication (PD) by a Baylor College of Medicine board-certified thoracic&#xD;
      surgeon. Patients will be given ondansetron 8mg x 1 dose after induction of anesthesia,&#xD;
      before initiation of chemotherapy lavage. The anti-emetics will be adjusted if grade III&#xD;
      toxicity is still encountered. Patients will then undergo cytoreductive surgery (PD or EPP)&#xD;
      with curative intent. In the event that not all of the tumor can be removed then the&#xD;
      investigators will allow a total of 1 cm3 or less of disease in one or more areas. If the&#xD;
      tumor is unresectable and debulking cannot be obtained, then the patient will receive&#xD;
      additional treatment off protocol. Mediastinal lymph node sampling will be performed. In the&#xD;
      event that the diaphragm and pericardium are resected, they will be reconstructed with&#xD;
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RENAL PROTECTION STRATEGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will continue our established perioperative renal protection strategy to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative Intravenous Hydration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be admitted the night before surgery for intravenous hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, the anesthesiologist will monitor urine output. At his or her&#xD;
      discretion, diuretics, renal dose dopamine, or fluid challenge will be instituted to maintain&#xD;
      the urine output at least 100 cc per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the immediate postoperative setting, the patient will be aggressively hydrated; a&#xD;
      pulmonary artery catheter will be used to guide management. Cisplatin-induced diuresis (more&#xD;
      than 100 cc per hour) will be replaced with crystalloid for the first 24 hours after surgery&#xD;
      at the following rate: 1cc crystalloid per 1cc of urine after PD and 0.5cc crystalloid per&#xD;
      1cc of urine after EPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amifostine and Sodium Thiosulfate Per Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEATED INTRAOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY PERFUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the cancer resection is complete, the perfusion cannulae will be placed within the&#xD;
           open hemithorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of three temperature probes will be placed within the hemithorax or upper&#xD;
           abdomen (via the chest since the diaphragm is no longer present after most PDs and after&#xD;
           all EPPs) and the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another two temperature probes will be used to monitor the temperature of the solution&#xD;
           in the circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An open well will be created over the thoracotomy using an Omni tract retractor, using&#xD;
           monofilament suture between the skin edges and the retractor, and enclosing the area&#xD;
           with a plastic covering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A slit in the plastic cover is made just large enough to allow the surgeon's&#xD;
           double-gloved hand into the hemithorax to evenly distribute the perfusate. The surgeon&#xD;
           gently (but repeatedly) manipulates all exposed areas to allow uniform distribution of&#xD;
           the heated chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pemetrexed and cisplatin will be admixed together in 1 liter of normal saline. The&#xD;
           admixture of pemetrexed/cisplatin is stable for 4 hours and should be prepared and&#xD;
           delivered immediately before use in the OR. The length of the pemetrexed/cisplatin&#xD;
           lavage will be 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A roller pump forces the heated chemotherapy into the chest and abdomen through the&#xD;
           inflow cannula and pulls it out via an outflow cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the perfusate solution does not fill the chest cavity, one or more intact bags of&#xD;
           saline will be placed in the chest cavity to displace the perfusate. In this manner, the&#xD;
           chest cavity can be filled without diluting the perfusate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A heat exchanger keeps the fluid being infused at 43-45 degrees Celsius so that the&#xD;
           intrathoracic fluid is 42 degrees Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A smoke evacuator is used to pull air from beneath the plastic cover through activated&#xD;
           charcoal, preventing any possible contamination of air in the operating room by&#xD;
           chemotherapy aerosols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics will be drawn per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort Pemetrexed Dose A 300 mg/m2 B 400 mg/m2 C 500 mg/m2 D 600 mg/m2 E 700 mg/m2 F 800&#xD;
      mg/m2 Stop to Analyze Safety G 900 mg/m2 H 1000 mg/m2 Stop to Analyze Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard dose of pemetrexed for systemic administration is 500 mg/m2. However, because&#xD;
      pemetrexed has not been previously studied for direct administration into the chest, the&#xD;
      initial cohorts will receive a slightly lower dose to ensure this method of administering&#xD;
      pemetrexed is safe. Once safety has been established at lower doses, the investigators will&#xD;
      feel confident that pemetrexed intrathoracic doses that are slightly higher than the standard&#xD;
      systemic dose (500 mg/m2) can be given safely. In animal models, these higher doses resulted&#xD;
      in a systemic concentration of pemetrexed (which is correlated with systemic toxicities) that&#xD;
      is potentially lower after intracavitary infusion than after systemic administration 2. These&#xD;
      higher doses may result in superior long-term clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule Assignment for Dose Levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 according the dose escalation/de-escalation rules&#xD;
      specified. For the purposes of executing the dose escalation scheme, toxicity will be&#xD;
      assessed until 4 weeks after treatment. Additional patient cohorts will not be enrolled until&#xD;
      all toxicity evaluable patients treated at the current dose have completed the observation&#xD;
      period. In addition, the investigators will pause after completion of the 800 mg/m2, if the&#xD;
      MTD is not reached, to assure that delayed toxicities don't manifest. If the MTD is not&#xD;
      exceeded at the highest dose level, the escalation schedule may be expanded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 4 treatment-related hematologic toxicity that lasts more than for 5 days or grade&#xD;
           3 thrombocytopenia with grade 3 or 4 bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Febrile neutropenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or greater treatment related non-hematologic toxicity with the following&#xD;
           exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 diarrhea is a DLT only if the patient was compliant with an anti-diarrheal&#xD;
                program consistent with best clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 or 4 nausea and vomiting is a DLT only if the patient was compliant with an&#xD;
                antiemetic program consistent with best clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive Care Guidelines All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will&#xD;
      be given throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive protocol therapy unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Extraordinary medical circumstances: If at any time the constraints of this protocol are&#xD;
           detrimental to the patient's health, protocol treatment will be discontinued&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient withdraws consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is evidence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The treating physician thinks a change of therapy would be in the best interest of the&#xD;
           patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up All patients, including those who discontinue protocol therapy early, will be&#xD;
      followed by their oncologist or primary care providers. The date of death will be recorded.&#xD;
