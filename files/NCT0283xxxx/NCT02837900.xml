      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of a second course of TPX-100 administered by intra-articular injection to subjects with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee who participated in study TPX-100-1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recruit up to 70 subjects whom participated in protocol TPX-100-1. The opposing knee that was&#xD;
      treated will be getting 200mg in 4 weekly injections. The knee that was treated in TPX-100-1&#xD;
      will get randomized to either 200mg dose or a placebo lookalike. The investigators will&#xD;
      follow these subjects for 6 months. Two MRIs of bi-lateral knees will be assessed. Also&#xD;
      collection of ADA samples at 4 time points through the 6 month period.&#xD;
