  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well selumetinib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      neurofibromatosis type 1 and cutaneous neurofibromas. Selumetinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine if selumetinib sulfate (selumetinib) can result in shrinkage of cutaneous&#xD;
      neurofibromas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the effect of selumetinib on target inhibition in cutaneous neurofibroma(s) excised&#xD;
      prior treatment and on treatment with selumetinib for analysis of percent inhibition of&#xD;
      phosphorylated ERK (pERK), and changes in phosphorylated AKT (pAKT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the effect of selumetinib on the development on new cutaneous neurofibromas while&#xD;
      on treatment with selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the effect of selumetinib on target inhibition in cutaneous neurofibroma(s)&#xD;
      excised prior treatment and on treatment with selumetinib for analysis of the tumor kinome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the effect of selumetinib skin related morbidity and pain using the Skindex, the&#xD;
      Global Impression of Change Scale and Numeric Rating Scale, all of which are patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Quantify the development of new cutaneous neurofibromas on treatment with selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Detailed pathologic analysis of cutaneous neurofibromas pretreatment and on treatment with&#xD;
      selumetinib for changes in cell composition (including macrophage and mast cell&#xD;
      infiltration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Investigate alterations that correlate with cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF) response to&#xD;
      selumetinib treatment with pilot genomic, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, and&#xD;
      transcriptomic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive selumetinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who experience a volume decrease in the target cutaneous&#xD;
      neurofibromas may continue treatment for 12 additional cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the size of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumors and cutaneous neurofibromas assessed by digital photography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The width, length, and height will be measured, and the volume of each of the neurofibromas measured will be calculated. The effect of selumetinib will be separately evaluated 3-5 small (longest neurofibroma diameter 3-7 mm) and 3-5 larger (longest neurofibroma diameter &gt;= 8 mm) neurofibromas in each of the 3 regions. The sum of the on-treatment volumes for the smaller tumors will be subtracted from the pre-treatment volumes of the same tumors to arrive at an overall percentage change in tumor size for each patient. This will be repeated for the larger tumors. Then, the average percentage change for each size category will be reported along with its 95% confidence interval, and other associated statistics.</description>

             no limit to number of prior myelosuppressive regimens previously received for NF1&#xD;
             related; or other tumor manifestations&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of selumetinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;

             abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 4&#xD;

             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the patient&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately; please note that the selumetinib&#xD;
             manufacturer recommends that adequate contraception for male patients should be used&#xD;
             for 12 weeks post-last dose due to sperm life cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine eligibility for&#xD;
             this trial must only be done after obtaining written informed consent from all&#xD;

             Branch (POB) screening protocol; studies or procedures that were performed for&#xD;
             clinical indications (not exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for&#xD;
