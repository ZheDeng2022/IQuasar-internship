  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although evidence exists to support cancer rehabilitation, services are fragmented and&#xD;
      rehabilitation professionals are consulted infrequently and often long after treatment ends,&#xD;
      when chronicity of problems limits the impact of intervention. Therefore, the objective of&#xD;
      this project is to develop, implement, and conduct a pilot evaluation of the Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Consult (RC). The RC program goals are to increase knowledge about rehabilitation needs and&#xD;
      resources to meet those needs; to establish individualized rehabilitation goals for HNC&#xD;
      survivors and personalized action plans to meet those goals; and to provide support to HNC&#xD;
      survivors for the implementation and evaluation of action plans. This project consisted of&#xD;
      intervention development and pilot evaluation; this trial registration describes the pilot&#xD;
      evaluation phase only.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A RC for survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) was developed in collaboration with an&#xD;
      Advisory Panel that includes survivors, family members, health care professionals, and health&#xD;
      system representatives. This phase of the study aims to conduct a pilot evaluation of the RC&#xD;
      using a mixed method, single group study with a convenience sample of approximately 35&#xD;
      survivors of HNC post primary cancer treatment, recruited from the Princess Margaret Cancer&#xD;
      Center HNC clinics. In addition to the RC intervention, participants will be required to&#xD;
      attend 3 research assessments (pre intervention, post intervention, and 1 month follow-up)&#xD;
      that are a combination of face-to-face visits and telephone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data analysis will be exploratory and descriptive, and effect sizes will be&#xD;
      calculated for all outcomes to help plan for a future, controlled trial. Means, standard&#xD;
      deviations, and Cohen's d effect size will be calculated for normally distributed data. For&#xD;
      non-normally distributed data, medians, ranges, and a nonparametric effect size r will be&#xD;
      calculated. For qualitative analysis, all interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed&#xD;
      verbatim, and analyzed using a two-phased, hybrid approach that is both deductive and&#xD;
      inductive. Findings will be summarized and reported to the Advisory Panel, who will then make&#xD;
      recommendations regarding any additional modifications to the RC. The research team will make&#xD;
      final decisions about RC modifications and will finalize a version for future evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Self-report quality of life questionnaire. Higher scores indicate a higher self-reported quality of life. The Physical Composite Score (PCS) and the Mental Composite Score (MCS) are reported. Scores range from 0 to 100 for each individual item on the scale. These scores are then converted into composite totals based on the scoring system provided with the outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Change in Goal Performance, Satisfaction, and Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>A) 1 week post-intervention, B) 1-2 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed the Brief Rehabilitation Assessment for Survivors Of Head And Neck Cancer (BRASH), a self report tool where participants rate their current performance, satisfaction with self-selected rehab goals, and rate their confidence in their ability to achieve each goal. Higher scores indicate greater self-reported, performance, satisfaction, and self-efficacy. Scores for each of confidence, performance, and satisfaction can range from 0 to 100. Each category is then compared to itself and the change calculated by subtracting the earlier score from the latter.</description>

    <description>The RC was designed to foster key contributors to self management in the participants. The RC is administered by a rehabilitation professional and consists of an initial one-hour face-to-face consult and follow-up appointment(s) 2-12 weeks later, either telephone or face-to-face. The initial consult consists of orientation, consultation, goal-setting, teaching cognitive strategies, introduction to online resources/action planning/planning coping responses, review/implementation intentions/scheduling follow-up. The follow-up consists of a reminder, reorientation, checking of progress on goals and plans, re-planning as necessary, and discharge or scheduling of further follow-up as necessary.</description>

Rehabilitation Consult (RC): The RC was designed to foster key contributors to self management in the participants. The RC is administered by a rehabilitation professional and consists of an initial one-hour face-to-face consult and follow-up appointment(s) 2-12 weeks later, either telephone or face-to-face. The initial consult consists of orientation, consultation, goal-setting, teaching cognitive strategies, introduction to online resources/action planning/planning coping responses, review/implementation intentions/scheduling follow-up. The follow-up consists of a reminder, reorientation, checking of progress on goals and plans, re-planning as necessary, and discharge or scheduling of further follow-up as necessary.</description>
