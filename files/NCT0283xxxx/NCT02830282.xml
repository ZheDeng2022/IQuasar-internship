      This is a nested multicenter, prospective cohort study within the I-SPY 2 TRIAL for women&#xD;
      undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast cancer who are also undergoing&#xD;
      definitive surgical resection and have clinical or radiographic evidence of residual tumor at&#xD;
      the completion of chemotherapy.&#xD;

        women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast cancer who are undergoing&#xD;
        definitive surgical resection and have clinical or radiographic evidence of residual tumor&#xD;
        at the completion of chemotherapy&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrollment on the treatment phase of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen or assigned treatment on I-SPY 2&#xD;
             and planning definitive surgical resection. Participants who have discontinued&#xD;
             assigned treatment on I-SPY 2, switched to standard of care, and have completed a&#xD;
             standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen are still considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-surgical imaging or clinical examination demonstrating residual disease in the&#xD;
             breast. Participants with any extent of enhancement attributable to tumor on the&#xD;
             pre-surgical MRI are eligible. No minimum extent of palpable tumor pre-surgery is&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood specimen collection per protocol&#xD;
             specifications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinical evidence of distant metastatic disease. Pre-chemotherapy staging scans are&#xD;
             sufficient in the absence of any symptoms or subsequent clinical evidence suggesting&#xD;
             distant metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or over and are able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals under the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who cannot understand and give informed consent. We will not be assessing&#xD;
             decisional capacity; determination of ability to give informed consent will be at the&#xD;
             discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. Participants in the parent I-SPY 2 TRIAL are screened for pregnancy at&#xD;
             enrollment and pregnancy is an exclusion criteria. No additional screening for&#xD;
             pregnancy is required for participants enrolling on SURMOUNT. However if a study&#xD;
             participant does become pregnant while on study or during the course of the 10 year&#xD;
             follow-up, the study participant will remain on the study protocol and will not be&#xD;
             withdrawn. Because this is an observational study and does not have a therapeutic&#xD;
             component, there will be no increased risk to following a study participant through&#xD;
             annual blood draws and medical information abstraction from the medical chart who may&#xD;
             or may not become pregnant during the course of the follow-up period.&#xD;
