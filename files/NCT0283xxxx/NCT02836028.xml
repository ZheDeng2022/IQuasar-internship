    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2, multiple-cohort, randomized, open-label, international study of&#xD;
      talazoparib (a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor) is to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of talazoparib monotherapy and talazoparib plus temozolomide in women with relapsed&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women ≥ 18 years of age and willing and able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed, histologically confirmed ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
             Histologic subtypes include serous, endometrioid, clear-cell, mixed, undifferentiated&#xD;
             histology, and carcinosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient archival tumor tissue available or consent to a fresh tissue biopsy for&#xD;

             HRD test score (myChoice score ≥ 42), which represents a loss of DNA repair function&#xD;
             based on testing performed at a sponsor-approved laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received at least 1 and no more than 3 platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (prior&#xD;
             bevacizumab is allowed) and the last dose is ≥ 28 days before randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior PARP inhibitor treatment (COHORT 1 ONLY)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional criteria for cohorts 2 and 3 include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received at least 2 platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (including first-line&#xD;
             chemotherapy; prior bevacizumab is allowed) and the last dose is ≥ 28 days before&#xD;
             randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received prior PARP inhibitor treatment as a single agent or in combination therapy&#xD;
             regimen and the last dose is ≥ 28 days before randomization, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For cohort 2 only: Received PARP inhibitor treatment for ≥ 6 months and had a response&#xD;
             of CR, PR, or stable disease for ≥ 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For cohort 3 only: Received PARP inhibitor treatment for &lt; 6 months with no response&#xD;
             (disease progression or stable disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated life expectancy of ≥ 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow drugs, have no known intolerance to study drugs or excipients, and&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not recovered (recovery is defined as National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade ≤ 1) from the acute toxicities&#xD;
             of previous therapy, except treatment-related alopecia or laboratory abnormalities&#xD;
             otherwise meeting eligibility requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational agent within 14 days before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had &gt; 2 paracentesis procedures within 28 days before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 14 days before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requirement for intravenous alimentation (at the time of randomization).&#xD;
