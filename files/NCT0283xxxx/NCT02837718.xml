      Background Peripheral nerve blocks with use of USG allowed visualisation of the structures&#xD;
      and nerves and made the block administrations safe, quick and comfortable. However there are&#xD;
      few publications concerning the minimum local anesthetic volume capable of providing blocks.&#xD;
      In this study the investigastors aimed to find Minimum Effective Volume Of Local Anesthetic&#xD;
      For Ultrasound-Guided Axillary Brachial Plexus Block in hand, elbow and forehand operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials &amp; Methods A total of 55 ASA I-II patients underwent hand surgery operation by&#xD;
      administering USG guided-axillary brachial plexus blockage were included in the study. Ulnar,&#xD;
      median and radial nerves were seen and the minimum effective local anesthetic volume was&#xD;
      investigated starting with total 21 ml of %0.5 bupivacain. After accomplishing the blockage,&#xD;
      volume was decreased by 0.5 for each nerves. Block administration time, block onset times,&#xD;
      anesthesia times and time to first analgesic requirement were recorded.&#xD;

      Matherials and Method This randomized, prospective, double-blinded, single-center study was&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the most recent version of the Helsinki Declaration. Approval&#xD;
      for the study was granted by the Ankara Numune Research and Training Hospital Ethics&#xD;
      Committee. A total of 55 adult patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      (ASA) physical status I-II, who were to undergo elective, forearm, wrist or hand surgery were&#xD;
      recruited in this trial. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were patients with coagulopathy, local anesthetic allergy, local infection, any&#xD;
      significant neurological, pysychiatric or congnitive disorder, chronic analgesic use, known&#xD;
      neuropathies, infection in the injection site or unwillingness of the patient. After arrival&#xD;
      in the operating room, an 20-gauge intravenous catheter was placed in the contralateral&#xD;
      forearm. Standard monitoring was used throughout the procedure, including non-invasive&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry. Patients were divided into groups&#xD;
      according to their order of arrival and a five-person group was created. İnitial volume of 7&#xD;
      ml. Per nerve(ulnar, median, radial), totaly 21 ml local anesthetic administered in first&#xD;
      group(first five patient). İf the success rate of block is three or more in the group, volume&#xD;
      was reduced in the next group of 0.5 ml for each nerve. if the success rate is less than&#xD;
      three in the group, study is ended. And minimum effective volume was calculated to be&#xD;
      statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block prosedures All the brachial plexus blocks were performed by the same anesthesiologist.&#xD;
      The patient is made comfortable in supine position with the arm abducted and the elbow flexed&#xD;
      to 90 degrees. After skin and probe preparation, A linear US probe (HFL 38, 6-13MHz) was&#xD;
      placed in the transverse plane at the lateral border of pectoralis major muscle to obtain the&#xD;
      best view of the brachial plexus. Image quality is optimised with selection of appropriate&#xD;
      depth (within 2 cm), focus range (within 1cm) and gain. The structures of interest are very&#xD;
      superficial with the pulsating axillary artery localised within 1 cm . Surrounding the&#xD;
      axillary artery, one will find the three out of four terminal branches of the brachial&#xD;
      plexus: the median (superficial and lateral to the artery), the ulnar (superficial and medial&#xD;
      to the artery) and the radial (posterior and lateral or medial to the artery) nerves. A 5 cm&#xD;
      needle (21G, Locoplex, Vygon, Ecouen, France) is inserted parallel to the long axis of the&#xD;
      transducer from the lateral side. As the needle is in the same plane as an ultrasound beam,&#xD;
      the path of the advancement can be visualised in real time as the needle approaches the&#xD;
      target nerves. Ideally, the radial nerve should be targeted first, as it lies posterior to&#xD;
      artery, in order to prevent displacing the structures of interest to deeper and obscuring the&#xD;
      median and ulnar nerves. The musculocutaneous nerve was blocked separately outside the&#xD;
      neurovascular bundle with 3 ml %0.5 bupivacaine at all of the patient. We were also worried&#xD;
      about the nerve puncture or intraneural injection. In addition, we also confirmed that the&#xD;
      location of the needle tip was not in hypoechoic area before each injection. For further&#xD;
      safety, we injected 0.5 ml of local anesthetic as a test dose. If the patients complained of&#xD;
      paresthesia or pain, or the injection pressure was high, or the spread of local anesthetic&#xD;
      was not visualized, investigastors stopped injection, and withdrew the needles and tried&#xD;
      again. The investigastors regarded the paresthesia or pain, or high injection pressure as&#xD;
      intraneural injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator who testing the block is don't know the dose. Sensory block was evaluated&#xD;
      for each nerve distribution using ice to test cold sensation, comparing the anaesthetized arm&#xD;
      with the contralateral arm, and graded on a three-point scale (0, no difference between&#xD;
      sides; 1, some difference between arms but cold still sensed in the blocked arm; 2, no cold&#xD;
      sensation in the blocked arm). Motor block for each nerve was evaluated by asking the patient&#xD;
      to extend the flexed arm and wrist (radial nerve), flex the wrist and oppose the second and&#xD;
      third fingers and thumb (median nerve), flex and oppose fifth finger towards the thumb (ulnar&#xD;
      nerve) and was graded as 0, no change; 1, reduced contraction; 2, no contraction. Data were&#xD;
      collected every 5 min for the first 60 min, and then 1,2,4,6,8,10,12,18,24 hours. motor and&#xD;
      sensory scale, the total value should be higher than 10, if not surgical anesthesia was&#xD;
      considered unsuccessful. sensitive block score must be at least five. VAS determination was&#xD;
      performed with a scale of numbers between 0 and 10 cm. 1mg/kg tramadol and 15 mg/kg&#xD;
      paracetamol IV infusion were administered to patients with a reequirement for additional&#xD;
      analgesia (VAS ≥ 4) . The total number of patients who required additional analgesic drugs&#xD;
      was noted. During the initial procedures, the operation and postoperatively, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction was evaluated as poor (1), moderate (2), good (3) or very good (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statical Analysis Statistical analysis was applied using SPSS 19.0 statistical software.our&#xD;
      sample size calculation method is dixon and massey up and down method. According to this&#xD;
      account, n = 2 (SD / SEM) ²; n: sample size, SD (standard deviation): The standard deviation,&#xD;
      SEM (standard error of mean) is calculated as the standard error of the mean (SD = 5 mL, SEM&#xD;
      = 1.0 mL) n were found in 50 patients. For the aplicational errors we add 5 patient (%10 ). A&#xD;
      total of 55 patients were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation, made by G * Power 3.0.10 statistical software package (effect&#xD;
      size (effect size) = 0.4, α = 0.05, degrees of freedom (df) = 48 and 0.85 power (power (1-&#xD;
      β)), the number of 50 patients were found to be adequate. However for practical magnification&#xD;
      error with a sample of 10% of 55 patients were included in the study.&#xD;

    <description>Bupivacaine 0,5% The study method was a step-up/step-down sequence model where the dose for following patients was determined by the outcome of the preceding block. The starting dose of bupivacaine was 5 mL per nerve. In the case of block failure, the dose was increased by 0.5 mL per nerve. Conversely, block success resulted in a reduction in dose by 0.5 mL per nerve. Each of the three nerves was treated as a separate entity. Dose adjustments were made to each nerve individually. The volume dose was increased in 0.5 mL at every 5 consecutive cases regardless of the result of the previous block in order to minimize bias occurence. A blinded assistant assessed sensory and motor blockade at 5-min intervals up to 30 min.</description>
