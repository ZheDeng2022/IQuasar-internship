  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized study is designed to assess&#xD;
      the healing effects of AR/101 on chronic Hard-to-Heal wound(s) of different etiologies&#xD;
      including arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers and venous ulcers, of at least 3 months duration.&#xD;
      After collection of comprehensive medical data to confirm eligibility of patient and&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent , patients will enter Screening run-in Period where all wounds&#xD;
      will be cleaned if necessary by surgical debridement and irrigation (isotonic solution) prior&#xD;
      to initiation (run-in phase) of the study according to physician's instructions. During the&#xD;
      14 day screening period, all subjects will receive standard of care (SoC) on a daily basis,&#xD;
      as per indication and patients status, according to physicians instructions. Wounds will be&#xD;
      morphologically assessed by the treating physician and by photographic evaluation by the PI&#xD;
      once a week - at days 7 and 14 of the screening run-in phase. Following the run-in period,&#xD;
      Subjects with wounds of ≥ 5cm2 and ≤100 cm2 of at least 3 months duration that fail to&#xD;
      respond to treatment with SoC during the screening run-in phase will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study. Eligible subjects with wounds will be randomized and treated topically with AR/101+&#xD;
      SoC or placebo +SoC once daily for up to 14 days. During this treatment phase I, depending on&#xD;
      their wound size and wound type, subjects will receive treatment dose applied topically daily&#xD;
      and wounds will be dressed according to physician's instructions. Wounds will be photographed&#xD;
      daily and assessed by the treating physician in the clinic once a week (at the end of each&#xD;
      weekly period). During the treatment period, adverse events and concomitant medications will&#xD;
      be monitored; wounds will be morphologically assessed by photo documentation and followed for&#xD;
      wound bed progression and granulation tissue formation. At the end of Treatment period I,&#xD;
      patient's wounds will be analyzed and all patients from both treatment arms with wound score&#xD;
      0-2 will be assigned to receive the study drug for and additional up to 14 days treatment&#xD;
      phase II in full accordance with the treatment regimen described in Treatment phase I. A&#xD;
      termination visit will be performed at day 14 of Treatment phase I or II or earlier if the&#xD;
      wound has reached the maximum score on the granulation scale or if the wound is ready for&#xD;
      skin grafting; or in any case of early withdrawal that is not due to withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
