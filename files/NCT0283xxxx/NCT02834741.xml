    <textblock>
      This is a first in human study of NYX-2925. This is a randomized, double-blind, sponsor-open,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose, parallel safety, tolerability, and PK&#xD;
      study of oral NYX-2925 in healthy volunteers. The single ascending dose phase will comprise&#xD;
      up to five dose groups. There will be up to 3 dose groups in the multiple ascending dose&#xD;
      phase. One open-label dose group will be repeated in the multiple ascending dose phase to&#xD;
      collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, in order to explore central nervous system&#xD;
      penetration. One elderly cohort (single dose) will be completed after all single and multiple&#xD;
      dose escalation groups have completed. One open-label dose group will be repeated in the&#xD;
      single ascending dose phase to collect CSF samples, in order to establish a more complete&#xD;
      cerebral spinal fluid pharmacokinetic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of food (&quot;food effect&quot;) on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of NYX-2925&#xD;
      will be explored in one dose group in the single ascending dose phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data review committee will review safety and tolerability (adverse events and other&#xD;
      relevant data), plus preliminary pharmacokinetic data, prior to proceeding to the next higher&#xD;
      dose group, cohort, and/or phase of the study, as well as administration of the fed dose in&#xD;
      the food effect group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules for individual study participants and dose groups or cohorts are established&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the dose escalation scheme, the need to stop or terminate dosing, or to&#xD;
      establish the maximum tolerated dose. If a cohort is stopped due to safety or tolerability&#xD;
      concerns, the previous cohort may be repeated to determine the highest tolerated dose.&#xD;
