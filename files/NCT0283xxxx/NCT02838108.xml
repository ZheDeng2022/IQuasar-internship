      This is an observational study examining outcomes and treatment patterns in a community-based&#xD;
      cohort of subjects with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are based in the&#xD;
      Kannapolis, NC area.&#xD;

      This study is designed to collect information on the current level of symptoms and ability to&#xD;
      breathe, treatment and outcomes of patients with 1) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      (COPD), or 2) in current or former smokers with respiratory symptoms but preserved pulmonary&#xD;
      function or 3) in current or former smokers with respiratory symptoms and preserved ratio&#xD;
      with impaired spirometry. This information will be used by the researchers to better&#xD;
      understand the impact of COPD on patients. It will also help the researchers study the&#xD;
      current recommendations for treatment of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a growing public health problem and&#xD;
      is now the third leading cause of death in the United States. The risk of exacerbations,&#xD;
      hospitalizations and death in patients with COPD tends to increase with increasing severity&#xD;
      of airflow limitation. However, the correlation between forced expiratory volume in 1 second&#xD;
      (FEV1), symptoms, and health-related quality of life is weak. The shortcomings of using&#xD;
      airflow limitation alone to assess the clinical severity of COPD led the Global Initiative&#xD;
      for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) committee to develop a potentially more&#xD;
      clinically meaningful approach to assess the impact of COPD on the patient. The GOLD&#xD;
      committee has subsequently proposed a model for pharmacologic therapy of patients with stable&#xD;
      COPD (i.e. those not currently experiencing a COPD exacerbation) according to GOLD risk&#xD;
      group. The therapeutic recommendations proposed by GOLD are widely cited as a strategy for&#xD;
      selecting therapy even though this model is predominantly based on expert opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will acquire data in a community-based cohort in which patients with COPD or&#xD;
      current or former smokers with respiratory symptoms will be classified into GOLD risk groups&#xD;
      A-D at enrollment and followed longitudinally. This study will assess the frequency of change&#xD;
      in GOLD risk group during 5 years of follow-up, look at the use of COPD medications this&#xD;
      cohort and how provider-selected therapy for COPD compares to GOLD-recommended pharmacologic&#xD;
      therapy thus addressing a critical knowledge gap in the scientific community.&#xD;
