  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of supervised group exercise on mental&#xD;
      wellbeing and signs of depression among pregnant women at risk of perinatal depression in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that 70 minutes of supervised group exercise twice a week for&#xD;
      12 weeks by pregnant women at risk of perinatal depression, will improve the participants&#xD;
      mental wellbeing and reduce their symptoms of depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with a current or a previous history of depression and/or anxiety have a&#xD;
      significantly increased risk of perinatal depression and disruptions in the mother-infant&#xD;
      attachment. In addition, pregnant women with anxiety and/or depression are at higher risk of&#xD;
      preterm birth, low birth weight, and complications during birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well described that physical exercise in general is associated with psychological&#xD;
      well-being and a reduced risk of morbidity and mortality in non-pregnant women. Several&#xD;
      studies have documented that physical exercise during pregnancy is associated with health&#xD;
      benefits for both infants and mothers. Physical exercise during pregnancy is associated with&#xD;
      a lower risk of pregnancy- and delivery related complications such as preeclampsia,&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus, low back pain, preterm delivery, emergency caesarean section&#xD;
      and postpartum depression, as well as contributing to improved mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, in the existing literature there are few and only small studies which have&#xD;
      examined the effect of exercise on depression among mentally vulnerable pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of supervised group training for pregnant&#xD;
      women with a current or a previous history of depression and/or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient enrollment. The participants will be recruited from the Department of Obstetrics,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet, Denmark, from July 2016 to March 2019. Participants will be selected on the&#xD;
      basis of 1) the information provided by the participants general practitioner and 2) an&#xD;
      electronic questionnaire received by email and completed by all pregnant women registered to&#xD;
      give birth at Rigshospitalet. The information from the questionnaire is routinely transferred&#xD;
      to the pregnant women´s medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first contact to the participant will be made by phone at about 12-14 weeks of gestation,&#xD;
      when, as a part of routine care, all mentally vulnerable pregnant women are contacted by a&#xD;
      midwife from the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet. In this interview, the pregnant&#xD;
      woman will be given brief information about the trial. If the woman is interested in further&#xD;
      information, written participant information about the trial will be send. If the pregnant&#xD;
      woman would like to participate in the project, an appointment for a personal meeting is&#xD;
      made, where the participant is given more information about the project before written,&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained and randomization can take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management. Questionnaire number one, baseline data: all participants&#xD;
      complete a baseline-questionnaire electronically and data are stored in a secured database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire number two (29-34 weeks of gestation) and questionnaire number three (two&#xD;
      months after giving birth): the two questionnaires will be sent to the participants by email&#xD;
      and the electronically answered questionnaires are stored in a secured database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data will be obtained from patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. The calculations have been made based on the primary endpoint, World Health&#xD;
      Organisation Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) at 29-34 weeks of gestation. The WHO-5 wellbeing&#xD;
      index score ranges from 0-100, where 100 is the best possible wellbeing. The average value&#xD;
      measured by the WHO-5 wellbeing index at 10-12 weeks of gestation is 62 points with a&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD) of 16. This has previously been assessed among pregnant women at the&#xD;
      University Hospital, Rigshospitalet. For the calculations at 29-34 weeks of gestation we will&#xD;
      use the SD observed at 10-12 weeks of gestation. The investigators expect that the effect of&#xD;
      the intervention causes a 10 point higher WHO-5 index score in the intervention group than in&#xD;
      the control group at gestational week 29-34, which is clinically significant (&quot;Guide to the&#xD;
      well-being index: WHO-5&quot;, Danish Health Authority).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 50% of the participants will be following the program for at least 75%&#xD;
      of the sessions (high participation, 19-24 sessions) while 35% will be following 50-75% of&#xD;
      the sessions (moderate participation, 12-18 sessions) and 15% will be following less than&#xD;
      half of the sessions (low participation). The investigators expect that high participation in&#xD;
      the training course will lead to an increase of 10 points in the WHO-5 wellbeing index, that&#xD;
      moderate participation in the training course will lead to an increase of 7 points, while low&#xD;
      participation will lead to an increase of 2 points, all compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will lead to an average value in the intervention group which is 7.75 points (0.50 x 10&#xD;
      + 0.35 x 7 + 0.15 x 2) higher than the average value in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a power of 90% and a two-sided significance level of 5%, a difference in wellbeing-level&#xD;
      of 7.75 points (SD = 16) in the two groups at 29 - 34 weeks of gestation can be detected by a&#xD;
      two-sample t-test with 91 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that it will be necessary to include a total of 300 pregnant women,&#xD;
      as the investigators anticipate that 12.5% in each group will drop out because of discomfort&#xD;
      or complications related to pregnancy and that 30% of the remaining 130 participants in each&#xD;
      group will not answer the questionnaire at 29-34 weeks of gestation, which leaves 91&#xD;
      participants in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis. The primary data analysis will be performed on the basis of the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle. The investigators compare baseline data for the two groups with&#xD;
      Student's t-test, chi-square test or non-parametric tests. A large proportion of missing&#xD;
      values for the outcome variable is expected due to drop out and non-response to the&#xD;
      questionnaire. Data will be assumed Missing At Random (MAR) and therefore observed patient&#xD;
      characteristics will be used to impute missing data, by means of multiple imputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is expected that there will be a drop-out of 12.5% in each group, and that some&#xD;
      pregnant women only participate in the group training a few times, the investigators will&#xD;
      perform a per-protocol analysis of the pregnant women who performed ≥ 75% of all training&#xD;
      sessions, in addition to the intention-to-treat analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study with 9 women in the intervention group and 11 women in the control group, will&#xD;
      be carried out from April - June 2016.&#xD;
