             patients for supportive care studies and vaccination studies. This does not include&#xD;
             long-term follow-up periods without active drug treatment of previous studies during&#xD;
             the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Patient has other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would,&#xD;
             in the investigator's judgment contraindicate her participation in the clinical study&#xD;
             (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, active chronic hepatitis ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No subject will be allowed to be enrolled in this trial more than once.&#xD;
