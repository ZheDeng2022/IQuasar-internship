  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to demonstrate that perampanel given as adjunctive&#xD;
      anti-epileptic treatment is superior to placebo in reducing the number of drop seizures in&#xD;
      participants with inadequately controlled seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome&#xD;
      (LGS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of&#xD;
      perampanel as adjunctive therapy in participants with inadequately controlled seizures&#xD;
      associated with LGS. The study will consist of 3 phases: Prerandomization (4 to 8 weeks),&#xD;
      Randomization (18 weeks), and an Extension A (52 weeks). An additional Extension B with&#xD;
      open-label treatment will be available for optional participation to participants who reside&#xD;
      in Japan and in countries where an expanded access program (EAP) cannot be implemented or has&#xD;
      not yet been implemented.&#xD;
