  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of dialysis in Taiwan remains higher as compared to past several&#xD;
      years. The number of dialysis reported about 6-7 million people each year and the 2014&#xD;
      full-year cost estimation was about 330 million NTDs. According to age-standardized&#xD;
      population statistics in 1995, the number of dialysis per million population in 2006 year&#xD;
      were 372.2 people, 381.9 people in 2012 year and the annual growth rate of 0.43 percent&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EarlySense system is certified by TFDA, FDA and many other countries, which consists of&#xD;
      mainly two parts. One for the sensing element, which placed under the mattress and the other&#xD;
      one is AC-powered display panel bed. This system has the ability to monitor the patients&#xD;
      physiological functions just be in contact via bed. When the patient laid on bed, the sensor&#xD;
      which is placed under the bed would detects heart rate, breathing rate and activity level as&#xD;
      well as other physiological signals. The system is also able to distinguish between patients&#xD;
      in bed and out of bed during the operation to save the patient's records and information&#xD;
      (including heart rate, respiratory rate and level of activity, and may render trends). The&#xD;
      system is also have capability for real-time data transmission information which includes a&#xD;
      warning to the nurses' station or other monitoring center of the screen by providing&#xD;
      real-time information to nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project, we will use EarlySense equipment for continuous monitoring the&#xD;
      dialysis patient's physiological data along with clinical data such as A. acute complications&#xD;
      such as rapid changes in blood pressure, respiratory rate, movements of patients and Nausea&#xD;
      or vomiting, etc phenomenon's) B. Lab examination data C. Status of patient whether patients&#xD;
      hospitalized or not and patient death occurred or not. The study is expected to have a pilot&#xD;
      study for more than three months' duration. Through this EarlySense continuous monitoring and&#xD;
      gather the data, we will analyse to develop a prediction model and confirmed with indicators.&#xD;
      Evidences from these analytics would help to propose ways to improve it and implement&#xD;
      Positive predictive validity models.&#xD;
