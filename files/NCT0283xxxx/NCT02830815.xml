      This will be a prospective, blinded, cross-over study to compare the effects of two&#xD;
      anesthetic techniques on the interpretability of auditory brainstem response testing in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a single-center, prospective, crossover-controlled study of the&#xD;
      two anesthetic techniques (propofol and sevoflurane). The investigators plan to enroll 80&#xD;
      patients who receive general anesthesia at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center&#xD;
      Department of Radiology for ABR testing. A sample size recalculation will be performed during&#xD;
      the study to determine the exact number of subjects necessary for sufficient power. As per&#xD;
      standard anesthesia practice for this test in radiology department, all subjects will serve&#xD;
      as their own control, receiving both anesthetic techniques within the same ABR testing&#xD;
      session. The audiologist will employ broadband click stimulus testing after induction with&#xD;
      Sevoflurane, after which the patient will be switched over to a propofol infusion and the&#xD;
      sevoflurane stopped. After the completion of the remainder of the ABR (tone-burst testing),&#xD;
      the audiologist will repeat the broadband click testing (now while under propofol&#xD;
      anesthesia), and the results will be recorded. At this point, results will be de-identified,&#xD;
      with the exception of which ear was tested and the intensity level, and these results will be&#xD;
      reviewed by a panel of 5 audiologists. These audiologists will be blinded to the anesthetic&#xD;
      technique and patient information. They will provide a judgment at each intensity level, for&#xD;
      each ear whether or not a response is present (in a Yes/No format). A study coordinator&#xD;
      blinded to the anesthetic technique will record the outcome data. The anesthesia providers&#xD;
      and nursing team will not be blinded.&#xD;
