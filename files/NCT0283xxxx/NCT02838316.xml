  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of Autologous Muscle Derived&#xD;
      Cells for Gastro-Intestinal Repair (AMDC-GIR) during the 12 months following treatment of&#xD;
      tongue dysphagia in male and female patients who have undergone surgery and/or chemo- and/or&#xD;
      radiotherapy for squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This preliminary, prospective, dose escalating clinical study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      potential efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells for Gastro-Intestinal Repair (AMDC-GIR)&#xD;
      for the treatment of tongue dysphagia (TD) that develops following treatment for head and&#xD;
      neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery, chemo- and radiotherapy can induce significant TD resulting in long-term TD.&#xD;
      Therefore, augmenting tongue muscle function may be beneficial to patients. Autologous muscle&#xD;
      cell therapy, which involves isolation of cells from skeletal muscle biopsies, ex vivo&#xD;
      expansion, and subsequent injection into the tongue, may serve as a potential durable&#xD;
      therapy. In animal studies, muscle derived cells have successfully integrated within tissue&#xD;
      to improve tongue strength and function. Intramuscular injection of AMDC-GIR is expected to&#xD;
      produce localized tissue changes near the injection site and is not expected to produce a&#xD;
      systemic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a single treatment intramuscular injection of 1 of 2 doses of AMDC-GIR.&#xD;
      Patients will have quantitative and qualitative measures of dysphagia assessed before&#xD;
      treatment and at various times after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will treat up to 20 patients at 1 clinical site. Enrollment is expected to be&#xD;
      completed within 2 years of initiating the study. Patients will be followed for 24 months&#xD;
      post-treatment. The first 3 patients at each dose must reach 1-month follow-up before&#xD;
      subsequent patients can be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female patients at least 18 years of age who have undergone surgery and/or chemo-&#xD;
      and or radiotherapy for primary treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer and who&#xD;
      present with symptoms and findings of TD will be eligible for participation. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will have muscle tissue harvested using a needle biopsy technique during an&#xD;
      outpatient procedure. The harvested muscle tissue will be transported to the manufacturer for&#xD;
      cell processing. The muscle derived cells (MDC) will be isolated and expanded in culture over&#xD;
      several weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reaching the desired concentration, the isolated and expanded AMDC-GIR will be frozen&#xD;
      and shipped back to the investigating physician. The physician will thaw the AMDC-GIR and&#xD;
      dilute the sample with an approximately equal volume of physiological saline. Under direct&#xD;
      vision, the resulting suspension will be injected into the patient's tongue in a brief&#xD;
      outpatient procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for improvement in TD symptoms at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and&#xD;
      24 months following treatment. Adverse events will be assessed at those visits, as well as&#xD;
      during follow-up calls at 1-2 days, 1 week, 15 months, 18 months and 21 months.&#xD;
