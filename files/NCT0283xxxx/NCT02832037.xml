    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Function as Measured by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) Overall Composite T-score After 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MCCB overall composite T-score was derived from scores of 7 cognitive domains (Speed of Processing, Verbal Learning, Working Memory, Reasoning and Problem Solving, Visual Learning, Social Cognition, Attention) obtained from a total of 10 tests (Trail Making, Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, Hopkins Verbal Learning, Wechsler Memory Scale, Letter-Number Span, Neuropsychological Assessment Battery, Brief Visuospatial Memory, Category Fluency, Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence, Continuous Performance) and ranges typically between -20 and +99, a larger T-score indicates better cognition.&#xD;
Change from baseline in MCCB overall composite T-score after 12 weeks of treatment was modeled using a MMRM with fixed, categorical factors of treatment at each visit, and continuous factors of baseline at each visit, using visit (week 6 and week 12 of treatment) as repeated measures, subject as random effect, adjusted mean (standard error) after 12 weeks of treatment is reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Everyday Functional Capacity as Measured by Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) Total Score After 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>SCoRS total score was derived as the sum of non-missing responses from 20 interview-based items rated by an interviewer on a 4-point scale. A response of &quot;not available&quot; to an item was treated as missing. If six or more of the 20 items were missing for a participant at a visit, then the corresponding SCoRS total score was missing for that participant at the visit. If five or less of the 20 items were missing for a participant at a visit, then the item(s) with missing value(s) were imputed first with the average of the non-missing item values, then the SCoRS total score for the participant at the visit was derived as the sum of non-missing item values and the imputed item values. SCoRS total score is between 20 and 80 where higher score values represent greater degree of impairment in day-to-day functions due to cognitive deficits.&#xD;
Analysis of covariance model was fitted to calculate adjusted mean and standard error, model details in the Statistical Analysis section.</description>

          <description>The Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) overall composite T-score was derived from scores of seven cognitive domains (Speed of Processing, Verbal Learning, Working Memory, Reasoning and Problem Solving, Visual Learning, Social Cognition, Attention/Vigilance) obtained from a total of ten tests. MCCB overall composite T-score ranges typically between -20 and +99, where a larger MCCB overall composite T-score indicates better cognition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Function as Measured by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) Overall Composite T-score After 12 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>MCCB overall composite T-score was derived from scores of 7 cognitive domains (Speed of Processing, Verbal Learning, Working Memory, Reasoning and Problem Solving, Visual Learning, Social Cognition, Attention) obtained from a total of 10 tests (Trail Making, Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, Hopkins Verbal Learning, Wechsler Memory Scale, Letter-Number Span, Neuropsychological Assessment Battery, Brief Visuospatial Memory, Category Fluency, Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence, Continuous Performance) and ranges typically between -20 and +99, a larger T-score indicates better cognition.&#xD;
Change from baseline in MCCB overall composite T-score after 12 weeks of treatment was modeled using a MMRM with fixed, categorical factors of treatment at each visit, and continuous factors of baseline at each visit, using visit (week 6 and week 12 of treatment) as repeated measures, subject as random effect, adjusted mean (standard error) after 12 weeks of treatment is reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Everyday Functional Capacity as Measured by Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) Total Score After 12 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>SCoRS total score was derived as the sum of non-missing responses from 20 interview-based items rated by an interviewer on a 4-point scale. A response of &quot;not available&quot; to an item was treated as missing. If six or more of the 20 items were missing for a participant at a visit, then the corresponding SCoRS total score was missing for that participant at the visit. If five or less of the 20 items were missing for a participant at a visit, then the item(s) with missing value(s) were imputed first with the average of the non-missing item values, then the SCoRS total score for the participant at the visit was derived as the sum of non-missing item values and the imputed item values. SCoRS total score is between 20 and 80 where higher score values represent greater degree of impairment in day-to-day functions due to cognitive deficits.&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>After identifying a new major metabolite (BI 761036), the sponsor communicated a voluntary hold of Phase II to relevant competent authorities on 16-Sep-2016. This was formalized to a full clinical hold of the development program by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 26-Oct-2016. Before start of the hold, 1 patient was screened, but not randomized. Clinical hold was removed by FDA on 21-Nov-2017, the trial was re-initiated with version 3 of the clinical trial protocol, dated 13-Dec-2017.</limitations_and_caveats>
