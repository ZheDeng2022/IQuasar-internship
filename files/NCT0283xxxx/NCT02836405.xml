  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to study brain plasticity (the changes that occur in the brain through&#xD;
      experience) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Research suggests that during&#xD;
      development, the brains of individuals with ASD may change in response to their experiences&#xD;
      differently than the brains of typically developing individuals. Investigators want to&#xD;
      understand why and how this difference may contribute to the symptoms of ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are diagnosed clinically, based on key symptoms. As ASD&#xD;
      phenotypic variability is large, and symptoms can manifest at different ages and degrees, the&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis is challenging. To date, there remains an unmet need for a valid and&#xD;
      reliable endophenotype that would facilitate ASD diagnosis early in life, enable efficient&#xD;
      study of ASD risk factors, and eventually serve as a useful biomarker to inform the&#xD;
      development of effective therapies and assess treatment response in future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As compared with behavioral or neuroimaging methods, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      offers the advantage of providing behaviorally independent results that are largely&#xD;
      unaffected by attention or cognitive ability. Therefore, a TMS based endophenotype may be&#xD;
      applicable to all individuals across the autism spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Boston Children's Hospital, each subject's participation in the study will consist of four&#xD;
      visits: two screening visits, and two TMS sessions. At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,&#xD;
      each subject's participation will consist of three visits: one screening visit, and two TMS&#xD;
      sessions. Each screening visit is expected to last between 2-3 hours, during which&#xD;
      participants will first provide informed consent. Participants will then receive a thorough&#xD;
      medical examination by a neurologist, and a neuropsychological evaluation (including IQ&#xD;
      measures and ASD specific evaluations). If eligible to continue, participants will then come&#xD;
      back for two identical TMS visits, that are spaced 1-5 weeks apart. These visits are expected&#xD;
      to last between 3-4 hours, and include the TMS measures of brain plasticity.&#xD;

    <description>Synaptic plasticity will be measured using the MEPs in response to cTBS. Baseline MEPs will be calculated before cTBS, and at different time points following cTBS up to 120 minutes. The investigators will compare post-cTBS MEPs to the baseline MEPs to calculate the percent change from baseline.</description>
