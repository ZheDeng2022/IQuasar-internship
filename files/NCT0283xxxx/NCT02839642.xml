  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disease from the&#xD;
      parkinsonian syndrome group. It represents 5 to 10% of all parkinsonian syndromes and affects&#xD;
      3,000 to 10,000 persons in France. PSP is characterised by a doparesistant parkinsonism with&#xD;
      axial signs such as early gait instability and falls, oculomotor signs such as a vertical&#xD;
      gaze palsy, dysphagia and dysarthria, and both cognitive and behavioural disturbances. The&#xD;
      latter predominantly manifest as psycho-motor slowness, apathy and frontal executive&#xD;
      deficits. Swallowing impairments and falls may lead to life-threatening situations and death&#xD;
      occurs 6-9 years after disease onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from L-dopa which may transiently and inconsistently improve motor symptoms no&#xD;
      effective symptomatic, disease-modifying or neuroprotective therapy is presently available to&#xD;
      reduce disability in any way. Therefore these patients often receive mostly non-medical care&#xD;
      such as physiotherapy and speech therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to dopaminergic degeneration there is evidence of cholinergic deficits in PSP&#xD;
      correlated with gait and balance impairments . This stands in contrast with the limited&#xD;
      number of studies of cholinergic augmentation strategies in PSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trials of cholinesterase inhibitors in PSP have produced rather conflicting results:&#xD;
      donepezil improves cognition but deteriorates some motor functions whereas a case series of 5&#xD;
      PSP patients treated with rivastigmine found an improvement in several cognitive aspects and&#xD;
      no deterioration of motor functions .On the other hand in Parkinson's disease there is&#xD;
      convincing evidence of a positive effect of rivastigmine on cognition , apathy and falls&#xD;
      Investigators' hypothesis is that rivastigmine (an acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase&#xD;
      inhibitor) may reduce gait and postural impairment in PSP and may therefore limit the number&#xD;
      of falls and their consequences both in terms of injuries sustained (fractures etc...) and on&#xD;
      the patients' autonomy. In addition investigators hypothesise that rivastigmine may also&#xD;
      reduce the cognitive and behavioural impairment associated with PSP. Taken together these&#xD;
      improvements are likely to produce a significant effect on the patients' quality of life and&#xD;
      their caregiver burden.&#xD;
