    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out how safe the study drug, pembrolizumab, is when combined with stereotactic&#xD;
           body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see how well subjects can tolerate treatment with pembrolizumab and SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out how often colorectal cancer comes back 1 year after surgically removing all&#xD;
           known disease and being treated with SBRT and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b feasibility study to evaluate the use of PD-1 blockade in combination with&#xD;
      ablative radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). This study&#xD;
      will examine the sequential combination of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab for patients for whom the goal is eradicating all known sites of disease. It is&#xD;
      very likely that for many patients the SBRT therapy will be completed following other&#xD;
      modalities including operative resection or ablation.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will receive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) within 4 weeks of enrollment. Following SBRT, subjects will receive one cycle of pre-operative pembrolizumab given as an IV over approximately 30 minutes. Surgical management to remove all known sites of metastatic disease should occur 2 weeks post pembrolizumab treatment. Approximately 4-8 weeks after surgery subjects will being the second phase of pembrolizumab treatment. They will receive this treatment every 3 weeks (cycle) for 8 more cycles after surgery. Prior to the 5th cycle of pembrolizumab subjects will also have tumor imaging (CT or MRI).</description>

    <description>Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilumumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.</description>
