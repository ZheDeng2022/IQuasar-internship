      Abstract: Empowerment interventions for chronic diseases are an evolving process. No&#xD;
      agreement exists regarding the necessary components and methodologies to be applied.&#xD;
      Systematic reviews have assessed the effect of self-management interventions. Improvements in&#xD;
      illness beliefs, adherence to drug therapy and glucose monitoring have been reported. In the&#xD;
      long term, no major changes have been achieved in weight, physical activity, smoking status,&#xD;
      and depression scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for additional studies. The Center for Comprehensive Care of Patients with&#xD;
      Diabetes (CAIPaDi) program is an intervention designed to provide education and empowerment&#xD;
      techniques (using simple low-cost interactive tools) over a short period of time followed by&#xD;
      at-distance support using internet or cell phone technology. The target population consists&#xD;
      of patients with type 2 diabetes, free of chronic complications who are non-smokers. The&#xD;
      intervention is composed of four monthly visits followed by a continuous at-distance support&#xD;
      system. At each visit, patients stay for six hours in the center. Information is presented in&#xD;
      group sessions. Empowerment techniques are applied during individual exchanges with the team&#xD;
      or during facilitated group sessions. In summary, empowerment programs are an unmet need in&#xD;
      many healthcare services.&#xD;

      1. Background: There are major deficiencies in the attention quality provided to people&#xD;
           with diabetes in Mexico. The percentage of compliance of therapeutic objectives is&#xD;
           noticeably lower than the one informed in developed countries. It is required to have&#xD;
           structured management strategies, adapted to traits of our population, which allow&#xD;
           improving attention quality in the medium term. The National Institute of Medical&#xD;
           Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubir√°n (INCMNSZ) developed an integrated management&#xD;
           program by using the best evidence available. The target population is people with type&#xD;
           2 diabetes, with less than 5 years with the diagnosis, and is free from chronic&#xD;
           complications. Selection criteria allow the intervention benefit to diminish incidence&#xD;
           of chronic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis: &quot;The management strategy applied at the Center of Comprehensive Care for the&#xD;
           Patient with Diabetes (CAIPaDi) allows achieving the international treatment standards&#xD;
           (proposed by NCQA) in a two-year period&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. General and Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           General objective: To quantify the results one year after starting the integrated&#xD;
           management program oriented to self-care activities applied at CAIPaDi.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To measure the program impact (after 4 months, one and two years) based on the&#xD;
                following variables: self-care (measured with standardized questionnaires),&#xD;
                efficacy parameters (HbA1c, fasting glycemia, blood lipids, arterial pressure and&#xD;
                use of anti-platelet aggregates), execution parameters (compliance of evaluations&#xD;
                and preventive measures such as the search for microalbuminuria, ophthalmologic&#xD;
                check, influenza vaccination, among others), incidence of micro- and macrovascular&#xD;
                complications of diabetes, hospitalizations, use of emergency service or unforeseen&#xD;
                expenses related to diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To compare the efficacy and execution parameters of the cases attended at the&#xD;
                center, with patients with similar characteristics attended at the &quot;Internal&#xD;
                Medicine&quot; service of the INCMNSZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To carry out a study of the social-economic impact of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Goals: It is intended to validate an intervention that provides integrated attention to&#xD;
           people with diabetes, in order to generate in the patient and his/her family, the&#xD;
           competencies required for self-care in the long term and the prevention of chronic&#xD;
           characteristics. Intervention is low-cost. This characteristic, along with the&#xD;
           intervention systematization will allow the model to be exportable to the first-contact&#xD;
           units.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Scientific Methodology: CAIPaDi has the mission of improving quality of life of patients&#xD;
           with diabetes by means of an intervention adapted to the needs of patients, applying&#xD;
           step-by-step action programs&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention consists of four monthly visits, each one being 6 hours long. The visits&#xD;
           have individual and group sessions. The nine specialists in the multidisciplinary team&#xD;
           are endocrinologists, diabetes educator, nutritionists, psychologist, dentists,&#xD;
           psychiatrist, specialist in physical activity, ophthalmologist and foot care. Some of&#xD;
           the functions may be fulfilled by the same health professional, previously trained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At each session, standardized actions are applied, which are assessed with preset&#xD;
           indicators. At the initial and at yearly visits the following laboratory tests are&#xD;
           taken: glycated hemoglobin, blood chemistry, lipid profile, liver function tests,&#xD;
           albumin-creatinine index in an isolated urine sample, and 12-deviation&#xD;
           electrocardiogram. At the yearly visits the patients receive reinforcement and treatment&#xD;
           modifications as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Contact is kept with patients via phone calls, e-mails and messages on the mobile phone.&#xD;
           Patients are asked to send their assessments on preset dates. Materials and tools are&#xD;
           developed, which allow measuring information from the study in real time, empowerment of&#xD;
           patients and decision-making by the multi-disciplinary team, based on clinical practice&#xD;
           guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There will be information from 1200 patients with 2-year follow-up. Besides having&#xD;
           information from 1200 additional cases with follow-up at one year, and other 1200 others&#xD;
           with assessments at 6 months. Therefore, the population for assessing execution&#xD;
           variables shall be of 3600 participants. Such sample size allows us to detect&#xD;
           differences higher than 5% in the percentage of cases that comply with the therapeutic&#xD;
           objectives by comparing them with the initial assessment. As a secondary analysis,&#xD;
           results will be compared with the population that receives attention the &quot;Internal&#xD;
           Medicine&quot; service in the INCMNSZ (n=300 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be referred from clinics or first contact physicians outside the&#xD;
           Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Expected impacts at medium and long term: This proposal allows validating the&#xD;
           intervention designed and applied at CAIPaDi. In case of demonstrating its usefulness&#xD;
           and cost-effectiveness, intervention will be exported to first-contact units. Manuals&#xD;
           and tools have been developed which will allow the implementation of the program with&#xD;
           minimum resources. Such action will allow creating a network of health units that&#xD;
           operate with the same quality standards as INCMNSZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Infrastructure available at the participating institutions: The INCMNSZ has an area&#xD;
           where the center operates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Deliverable results: Procedure manuals for each of the actions included in the&#xD;
           intervention, tools for decision making based on clinical practice guidelines which will&#xD;
           be patented, educational materials designed for empowering patients (patentable&#xD;
           products), an internet portal, an electronic file, a database, articles in high impact&#xD;
           magazines, diploma courses for generating specific competencies related to diabetes&#xD;
           treatment and to the center management.&#xD;
