      The primary objective of the study is to determine the role of transdermal vasodilators as an&#xD;
      adjunct to parenteral vasodilators in reducing radial artery spasm, improving patient&#xD;
      comfort, and post procedure radial artery patency during transradial coronary angiograms and&#xD;
      interventions. The study hypothesis is that transdermal vasodilators will increase radial&#xD;
      artery size and reduce radial artery spasm as well as improve patient comfort and post&#xD;
      procedure radial artery patency. This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study comparing the effect of transdermal preparations of lidocaine +&#xD;
      nitroglycerine and lidocaine + placebo on radial artery spasm in patients undergoing&#xD;
      transdermal coronary angiograms. Prior to the procedure, each patient will be randomized into&#xD;
      either the control arm, lidocaine + placebo, or study arm, lidocaine + nitroglycerine.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular access site complications (VASC) during cardiac catheterizations are significantly&#xD;
      higher in femoral access compared to radial access. Main disadvantage in radial access is the&#xD;
      restriction in size of catheters as well as incidence of radial artery spasm. Radial spasm is&#xD;
      identified by pain in the forearm aggravated by movement of the catheter/sheath; difficulty&#xD;
      in manipulating the catheter; loss of radial pulse or damping of radial arterial pressure.&#xD;
      Tortuosity and loops in upper extremity arterial tree could mimic some findings of radial&#xD;
      artery spasm. Incidence of radial spasm has been reported to range between 4% and 20%. Risk&#xD;
      factors include smaller radial artery diameter, atherosclerotic lesions, entrance of&#xD;
      guidewires into side branches, vessel tortuosity, larger arterial sheath diameters, procedure&#xD;
      duration, female sex, younger age, lower BMI, Diabetes, number of catheters used, volume of&#xD;
      contrast, unsuccessful access at first attempt, fear and anxiety. Mean size of radial artery&#xD;
      is reported at 2.44 mm. Women and persons of south Asian descent tend to have smaller radial&#xD;
      arteries with means of 1.91mm and 2.00 mm respectively. Outer diameters of commonly used 5&#xD;
      French (5F) and 6 French (6F) sheaths are 2.16 mm and 2.62 mm respectively. Ratio of radial&#xD;
      artery to sheath size affects post-procedural radial artery flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transdermal vasodilators prior to vascular access would increase chance for successful&#xD;
      arterial access in first attempt and increase radial artery to sheath size ratio both of&#xD;
      which should have additive benefit to intraarterial (IA) vasodilators in reducing spasm.&#xD;
      Transdermal lidocaine would reduce pain during subcutaneous lidocaine, which can further&#xD;
      ameliorate the risk of radial artery spasm. Use of transdermal nitroglycerine has been shown&#xD;
      to safely increase radial artery size without significant hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the role of transdermal vasodilators as an adjunct to parenteral vasodilators, in&#xD;
      reducing radial artery spasm and improving patient comfort and post procedure radial artery&#xD;
      patency during radial coronary angiograms and interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transdermal vasodilators will increase radial artery size and reduce radial artery spasm as&#xD;
      well as improve patient comfort and post procedure radial artery patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center, double blinded, randomized placebo-controlled study comparing effect of&#xD;
      transdermal preparations of lidocaine + Nitroglycerine and lidocaine + placebo on radial&#xD;
      artery spasm and procedural success in patients undergoing radial coronary angiograms and&#xD;
      interventions. All patients will receive standard parenteral cocktail including intraarterial&#xD;
      or intravenous (IV) heparin and IA nitroglycerine and / or verapamil. Exact doses and&#xD;
      combinations would be at the discretion of individual provider based on patient's hemodynamic&#xD;
      status and comorbid conditions.&#xD;

           the patient prior to arrival in Ambulatory Cardiac Unit (Same Day) (preferably at the&#xD;
           time of scheduling). When not feasible, patients will be contacted via phone prior to&#xD;
           the day of procedure or approached in the Ambulatory Cardiac Unit (Same Day) unit on the&#xD;
           day of the procedure by one of the investigators to assess interest in participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Patients who are interested and meet all inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
           exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the trial in the Ambulatory Cardiac Unit (Same&#xD;
           Day) on the day of their scheduled procedure. One of the participating investigators&#xD;
           will obtain informed consent after the patient has had time to review the consent and&#xD;
           all questions have been answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Inpatient: i. Hospitalized patients who are interested and meet all inclusion&#xD;
           criteria and none of the exclusion criteria may be enrolled in the trial on or before&#xD;
           the day of their scheduled procedure, but always prior to transfer to the&#xD;
           Catheterization Lab. One of the participating investigators will obtain informed consent&#xD;
           after the patient has had time to review the consent and all questions have been&#xD;
           answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After reviewing the most current vital signs, patients without any exclusion criteria&#xD;

           (centered approximately 1 inch proximal to radial styloid process) at least 60 minutes&#xD;
           before procedure start time at a dose of 40mg (6 ribbons of 2 inches each) of 5%&#xD;

&#xD;
       10. If SBP &lt; 100 mm Hg and patient complains of dizziness or light-headedness or if SBP &lt; 90&#xD;
           mm Hg, the topical preparation will be removed promptly, 250 ml of 0.9% Normal Saline&#xD;
           (NS) IV bolus will be given over 15 minutes, and provider will be notified immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. If patient complains of headache, one or two tablets of 500 mg acetaminophen will be&#xD;
           given by mouth every 4 hours as needed. One tablet will be given if the patient reports&#xD;
           a value of 0-3 on the pain scale, and two tablets will be given if the patient reports a&#xD;
           value of 4 or greater on the pain scale. The maximum dose of acetaminophen is 4g in 24&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. If 30 minutes after acetaminophen administration, headache intensity ≥ 5/10 or patient&#xD;
           unable to tolerate intensity of headache, the topical preparation will be removed&#xD;
           promptly and provider will be notified immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. If any of the safety endpoints occur, an investigator will be notified immediately and&#xD;
           further decision to proceed with cardiac catheterization or additional workup or&#xD;
           treatment would be at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Immediately prior to sterile preparation of access site, transdermal preparation will be&#xD;
           removed in Cath Lab and post-dilation cross sectional image of ipsilateral radial artery&#xD;
