  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, plays an important role in the disease&#xD;
      development and tumor growth in many solid organ malignancies. Bevacizumab was the first&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic drug to be approved in solid tumors and has shown advantageous activity with&#xD;
      multiple tumor types. However, the responses from Bevacizumab are often transient due to the&#xD;
      tumor's manipulative abilities to circumvent the usual pathways to find salvage pathways&#xD;
      instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nintedanib has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and renal cell cancer. The combination of Bevacizumab and&#xD;
      Nintedanib are being proposed to target the tumor's manipulation processes to generate&#xD;
      alternate pathways for angiogenesis thus creating a potential benefit to delay tumor growth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase I dose-escalation study of Nintedanib combined with&#xD;
      standard-dose Bevacizumab for advanced solid tumors in which Bevacizumab has an indication.&#xD;
      The primary endpoints will be safety and tolerability of the drug combination and a&#xD;
      determination of recommended Phase II dose for Nintedanib in combination with standard dose&#xD;
      Bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three patients will be treated with Nintedanib daily plus Bevacizumab on day one of&#xD;
      each three week cycle. If there are no dose limiting toxicities, then three additional&#xD;
      patients will be treated with the same drugs with Nintedanib at a slightly higher level.&#xD;
      Finally, a third cohort of three patients will be dosed at an even higher level. Once the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of Nintedanib is reached, then an additional six patients will be&#xD;
      treated at that dose in combination with Bevacizumab until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities.&#xD;
