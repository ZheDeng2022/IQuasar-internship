  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on promising data from our laboratory demonstrating synergy between ablative local&#xD;
      radiotherapy and FLT3 ligand immunotherapy in murine NSCLC models, investigators are&#xD;
      performing a phase II study combining FLT3L immunotherapy and SBRT for patients with advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC that has progressed following standard systemic therapy. All patients will receive&#xD;
      daily subcutaneous injections of CDX-301 (75 Âµg/kg) for 5 days, beginning on the first day of&#xD;
      SBRT. SBRT will be delivered to a single pulmonary or extrapulmonary lesion. The SBRT regimen&#xD;
      will depend on the size and location of the target lesion. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      progression-free survival at 4 months, defined using immune-related response criteria (irRC).&#xD;
      A total of 29 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the efficacy of combining stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with FLT3&#xD;
           ligand immunotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the feasibility and safety of combining SBRT with FLT3 ligand immunotherapy&#xD;
           for advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify and evaluate potential surrogate outcomes for clinical efficacy of this&#xD;
           treatment approach, including radiographic responses, immunologic responses, and&#xD;
           circulating tumor cell levels.&#xD;

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is progression-free survival rate at four months (PFS4), defined as the rate estimate of the percentage of patients who are alive and progression-free at 16 weeks (~4 months) after initiation of study therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs): For the purposes of this study, a DLT will be defined as any treatment-emergent grade 3-5 toxicity, scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, and occurring within 30 days after treatment with SBRT in combination with FLT3 ligand therapy.Asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities (eg: leukocytosis) that do not require intervention will not be counted as DLTs. For subjects who receive more than one &quot;cycle&quot; of SBRT and FLT3 ligand, only adverse events that occur after the first cycle will be scored as potential DLTs.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to a single pulmonary or extrapulmonary lesion as well as FLT3 immunotherapy.&#xD;
FLT3 Ligand Therapy (CDX-301)&#xD;
Daily subcutaneous injections of CDX-301 (75 ug/kg) will be administered for 5 days, beginning on the first day of SBRT.&#xD;
Additional cycles of SBRT (to distinct lesions) and CDX-301 may be administered every 2-4 months to subjects who demonstrate evidence of clinical benefit (lack of treatment-related toxicity and no disease progression).&#xD;
Study therapy will be discontinued in cases of treatment-related toxicity or disease progression.</description>
