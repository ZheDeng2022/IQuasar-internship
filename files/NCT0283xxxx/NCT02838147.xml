      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as carbohydrate intolerance first diagnosed&#xD;
      during pregnancy [1]. It is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome for the mother, and the&#xD;
      fetus with consequences regarding future health and development of the neonate. Maternal&#xD;
      consequences include increased rate of operative and cesarean delivery, hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders during pregnancy and future risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as&#xD;
      other aspects of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, cardiovascular morbidities and&#xD;
      recurrent GDM [2-4]. Also, children born to mothers affected by gestational hypertension have&#xD;
      been found to have higher body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, glucose and insulin&#xD;
      levels [5]; this risk extends into adulthood, with an 8-fold increased risk of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes among young adults exposed to gestational diabetes during fetal life [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of all types of diabetes, GDM accounts for approximately 90-95% of all cases [4, 7]. It&#xD;
      complicates up to 14% of all pregnancies. Its prevalence is increasing and parallels the&#xD;
      rising incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus worldwide [3,4]. Risk factors for developing GDM&#xD;
      in pregnancy include obesity, previously GDM, glycosuria, family history, ethnicity and&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as carbohydrate intolerance first diagnosed&#xD;
      during pregnancy [1]. It is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome for the mother, and the&#xD;
      fetus with consequences regarding future health and development of the neonate. Maternal&#xD;
      consequences include increased rate of operative and cesarean delivery, hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders during pregnancy and future risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as&#xD;
      other aspects of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, cardiovascular morbidities and&#xD;
      recurrent GDM [2-4]. Also, children born to mothers affected by gestational hypertension have&#xD;
      been found to have higher body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, glucose and insulin&#xD;
      levels [5]; this risk extends into adulthood, with an 8-fold increased risk of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes among young adults exposed to gestational diabetes during fetal life [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of all types of diabetes, GDM accounts for approximately 90-95% of all cases [4, 7]. It&#xD;
      complicates up to 14% of all pregnancies. Its prevalence is increasing and parallels the&#xD;
      rising incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus worldwide [3,4]. Risk factors for developing GDM&#xD;
      in pregnancy include obesity, previously GDM, glycosuria, family history, ethnicity and&#xD;
      hypertension [5,6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been clearly demonstrated that intensified management and the achievement of&#xD;
      established levels of glycemic control using memory-based self-monitoring blood glucose,&#xD;
      glyburide treatment or if needed multiple injections of insulin, diet, and an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team effort was associated with enhanced pregnancy outcome [8-10]. The&#xD;
      above recommendations support the routine use of self-monitoring blood glucose in the&#xD;
      management of the pregnancy compromised by diabetes. The recommendation of the American&#xD;
      Colleague of Obstetrics and Gynecology as recently published [11] are four-times daily&#xD;
      glucose monitoring preformed as fasting and either 1 or 2 hours after each meal with possible&#xD;
      modifications made in diet-controlled GDM patients after reaching well controlled glucose&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of self-monitoring blood glucose in intensified therapy in non-pregnant and pregnant&#xD;
      women has become the standard to achieve targeted levels of glycemic control. Yet,&#xD;
      self-monitoring blood glucose may have some disadvantages. It is painful to perform. Another&#xD;
      shortcoming in the use of reflectance meters is that each glucose determination represents a&#xD;
      sole glucose value during the day, a &quot;snap shot&quot; of glucose value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several companies have attempted to develop a new technology that measures&#xD;
      continuous glucose. Some of these techniques are non-invasive while others are minimally&#xD;
      invasive. Continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) employs four different approaches:&#xD;
      transdermal, glucose electrode, micro-dialysis or open-flow micro perfusion. Currently, two&#xD;
      are commercially available. The transdermal approach (Glucowatch; Cygnus, CA, USA) employs&#xD;
      reverse iontophoresis by applying low voltage current to the skin surface causing&#xD;
      interstitial fluid (containing glucose) to pass through the skin [12]. Glucose is then&#xD;
      measured by an oxidase reaction. This data also contains information about skin temperature&#xD;
      and sweat that are all included in the calculation process. The MiniMed CGM System (Sylmar,&#xD;
      CA, USA) is composed of a disposable subcutaneous glucose-sensing device and an electrode&#xD;
      impregnated with glucose oxidase connected by a cable to a lightweight monitor which is worn&#xD;
      over clothing or a belt [13]. The system measures glucose levels every 10 seconds, based on&#xD;
      the electrochemical detection of glucose by its reaction with glucose oxidase, and stores an&#xD;
      average value every 5 minutes, for a total of 288 measurements per day. The glucose&#xD;
      measurement is performed in subcutaneous tissue in which the interstitial glucose levels are&#xD;
      in the range of 40-400 mg/dl. The data are stored in the monitor for later downloading and&#xD;
      reviewing on a personal computer. The patients are unaware of the results of the sensor&#xD;
      measurements during the monitoring period. Glucose values obtained with CGMS have been shown&#xD;
      to correlate with laboratory measurements of plasma glucose levels [14] and with home glucose&#xD;
      meter values [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CGMS has been studied in non-pregnant patients where it has demonstrated clinical&#xD;
      usefulness by enhancing decision-making through detecting previously unrecognized&#xD;
      postprandial hyperglycemia and nocturnal hyper-and hypoglycemia [16]. Scientific evidence on&#xD;
      a HbA1c-reducing effect of CGMS use is limited [17, 18]. Although some studies do evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of CGMS use on biochemical endpoints, such as HbA1c levels, data on clinical&#xD;
      endpoints like diabetic complications, are lacking. The usefulness of CGMS use during&#xD;
      pregnancy has hardly been evaluated up to now [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are only limited randomized clinical trials assessing the usefulness of CGMS in&#xD;
      reducing the rate of diabetes related pregnancy complications with conflicting results [19,&#xD;
      20]. Murphy et al. [19] showed in 71 pregnant women with Type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus that&#xD;
      intermittent (4-6 weeks interval) CGMS resulted in a significant reduction of HbA1C at 32-36&#xD;
      weeks of gestation, lower birth weight, and reduced risk of macrosomia (odds ratio 0.36, 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval 0.13 to 0.98, P&lt;0.05) compared to standard antenatal care. However, this&#xD;
      study was hampered by small sample size and both study groups differed in composition (e.g. 5&#xD;
      set of twins in the intervention group as opposed to none in the control group). In contrast,&#xD;
      a recently published study [20] of 154 pregnant women with preexisting diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      randomized to either real time CGM for 6 days at 8,12,21,27 and 33 weeks of gestation or&#xD;
      routine care only showed neither an improvement in glycemic control, reflected in similar&#xD;
      rates of hypoglycemia events and HbA1C levels, nor a reduction of large for gestational age&#xD;
      neonates rate in the CGM group. In a recent study, Wei et al. included a total of 106 women&#xD;
      with GDM in gestational weeks 24-28 were randomly allocated to the antenatal care plus CGMS&#xD;
      group or the self-monitoring blood glucose group [21]. The authors showed The proportion of&#xD;
      GDM women with excessive gestational weight gain was lower in the CGMS group than in the&#xD;
      self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) group (33.3% vs. 56.4%, P=0.039), and women who&#xD;
      initiated CGMS earlier gained less weight (P=0.017). In addition, the investigators showed&#xD;
      that the mode of blood glucose monitoring (adjusted OR 2.40; 95% CI 1.030-5.588; P=0.042) was&#xD;
      an independent factor for weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since obstetric complications in diabetic pregnancies, especially macrosomia and large for&#xD;
      gestational age newborn, seem to be related to glycemic control, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the additional use of will reduce adverse pregnancy outcome related to&#xD;
      pregnancies complicated with gestational diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial evaluates the clinical effectiveness, costs and cost-effectiveness of Continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring using FreeStyle Freedom Lite CGMS use with the aim to optimize glycemic&#xD;
      control and pregnancy outcome of pregnancies diagnosed with GDM relative to standard control&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
