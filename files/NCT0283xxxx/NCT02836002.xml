    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open label study. The primary aim of this project is to develop a&#xD;
      controlled human malaria infection transmission model (&quot;CHMI-trans&quot;) or &quot;challenge model&quot; to&#xD;
      evaluate the capacity of vaccines, biologics (monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs), and drugs to&#xD;
      block malaria parasite transmission by assessing infectiousness of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)&#xD;
      gametocyte carriers for Anopheles mosquitoes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 32 volunteers will be randomly assigned to four groups (n=8) and subjected to a&#xD;
      standard controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) delivered by five Pf-infected mosquitoes&#xD;
      (3D7 clone). Treatment is subsequently initiated to induce gametocytaemia (treatment 1, DT1)&#xD;
      and to clear pathogenic asexual parasites whilst leaving gametocytes unaffected (treatment 2,&#xD;
      DT2). At the end of the study, treatment of all parasite stages is provided following&#xD;
      national treatment guidelines (end treatment, ET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once malaria infections are detected by 18S qPCR positive (day of treatment 1 [DT1]), groups&#xD;
      1 and 2 will be treated with a course of subcurative sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (SP low,&#xD;
      500mg/25mg). Groups 3 and 4 will receive piperaquine (Pip) in a low-dose (Pip low, 480 mg).&#xD;
      After DT1, volunteers will receive a curative treatment (DT2) when a recrudescence of asexual&#xD;
      parasitaemia occurs or on day 21 post challenge infection, whichever comes first. Volunteers&#xD;
      in group 1 (SP low/SP high) will be treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (1000mg/50mg) and&#xD;
      group 2 (SP low/Pip high) with piperaquine (960mg). Volunteers in group 3 (Pip low/Pip high)&#xD;
      will be treated with piperaquine (960mg) and group 4 (Pip low/SP high) with&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (1000mg/50mg). To ensure the radical clearance of all parasite&#xD;
      stages, all volunteers will receive a final treatment (ET) according to national guidelines&#xD;
      with atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone®) on day 42. Daily blood samples will allow detailed&#xD;
      quantification of gametocytes, gametocyte sex ratio and ex vivo assessments of gametocyte&#xD;
      fitness.&#xD;
