  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INSIGHT study aims to phenotype individuals with subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)&#xD;
      disorders specifically lipedema and Dercum's disease with an aim to find a cure for the SAT&#xD;
      in these disorders that is resistant to diet and exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lipedema is a syndrome of painful fatty enlargement of the buttocks, hips and thighs&#xD;
      primarily in women which cannot be lost by diet, exercise or bariatric surgery. Arms are&#xD;
      affected in 80% of women with lipedema to varying degrees. The etiology of lipedema is not&#xD;
      known and there are no evidence-based treatments that work for a majority of individuals&#xD;
      except for excision of the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) by liposuction which has risks.&#xD;
      Millions of women are affected with lipedema yet they are grossly under-diagnosed, have&#xD;
      mobility issues and can develop lymphedema. The goal of this project is to better understand&#xD;
      the etiology of lipedema SAT, find out how it is different from non-lipedema SAT, to improve&#xD;
      our ability to identify the abnormal SAT and determine the response of the tissue to&#xD;
      therapeutics by imaging and biomarkers. People with diffuse Dercum's disease (DD) appear to&#xD;
      have lipedema plus a tissue inflammation that causes illness and pain. People with SAT&#xD;
      disorders that have similarities to lipedema will also be included in this protocol. More&#xD;
      research is needed to determine how these fatty disorders are similar and different from each&#xD;
      other and from obesity so they can be distinguished clinically and by laboratory testing and&#xD;
      imaging. Since these painful fatty disorders are associated with SAT growth, research focused&#xD;
      on these disorders may provide unique insight into mechanisms of obesity.&#xD;

          1. Ambulatory males and/or females of any race able to understand the consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 19-70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of lipedema, Dercum's disease or familial multiple lipomatosis or other&#xD;
             similar fat disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individuals without a fat disorder (will be matched by age, sex, race and body mass&#xD;
             index to individuals in &quot;2&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Weight stable for past three months within a 10 pound range per personal report of the&#xD;
             subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Overweight or obese (BMI &gt; 26 kg/m2) in order to be able to get enough SAT for the&#xD;
             biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Individuals with BMI &lt; 26 kg/m2 may participate in all aspects of the study protocol&#xD;
             except the SAT biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Thyroid levels in the normal range as confirmed by a TSH level. May have treated&#xD;
             hypothyroidism that is stable over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HIV infection (because of the associated lipodystrophy and fatty growths [lipomas]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects will be excluded from having a SAT biopsy with any history of scleroderma,&#xD;
             keloid formation or other skin condition that would result in substantial scarring&#xD;
             after biopsy, a history of recurrent cellulitis, any history of bleeding diathesis&#xD;
             that would place the subject at great risk for persistent bleeding after a&#xD;
             biopsy/liposuction, any history of major complication after a previous biopsy&#xD;
             including requirement of a blood transfusion, hospitalization, failure to heal, or&#xD;
             major infection, requiring intravenous antibiotics, or anyone whose skin and tissue&#xD;
             would put them at risk for an infection after the biopsy per the assessment of study&#xD;
             staff and the principal investigator. These individuals may participate in the&#xD;
             remainder of the protocol, just not the SAT biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of any immunosuppressant or corticosteroid medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of any anti-inflammatory medication such as NSAIDs, aspirin, histamine (H) 1&#xD;
             blocker, H2 blocker, tetracycline or corticosteroids within five days of the study&#xD;
             procedure visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of medications that might cause weight gain (e.g., second generation&#xD;
             anti-psychotics).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Blood donation less than 56 days prior to screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Tobacco or marijuana use which may alter inflammation in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any antibiotics within the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Barium enema in the last week which would affect gut bacteria and the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnancy due to the risks associated with the fat biopsy in the area of the fetus and&#xD;
             because pregnancy will alter hormone levels.&#xD;
