  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently many surgical options for patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension&#xD;
      (OHT), including the Hydrus Microstent implant, HiFU (High intensity Focused ultrasound),&#xD;
      STAR flo, Kahook Dual Blade, Diode laser, trabeculectomy and the Baerveldt implant, but&#xD;
      little is known about how these different surgical techniques used to treat glaucoma affect&#xD;
      the flow of fluid through and out of the eye (aqueous dynamics).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trial objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: The following aqueous dynamics parameters will be measured: IOP,&#xD;
      aqueous flow rate, trabecular outflow facility and uveoscleral outflow. These parameters will&#xD;
      be measured pre-treatment (up to 2 months before glaucoma surgery) and repeated 3 months and&#xD;
      12 months post-surgery. Measures will be taken from the operated eye and the contra lateral&#xD;
      non-operated eye which will be used as the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study with the contra lateral untreated eye being used as&#xD;
      control. Baseline measures will be conducted at a routine clinic visit up to 2 months before&#xD;
      glaucoma surgery after 4 weeks of treatment washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment follow-up measurements of the main outcomes will be conducted 3 months and 12&#xD;
      months after surgery, again, after 4 weeks wash out. A number of additional eye tests will&#xD;
      also be performed to collect data for the study at the pre-operative appointment when the&#xD;
      baseline measurements are taken and at the post-operative follow-up appointments 3 months and&#xD;
      12 months after the surgery. Other data will be collected from eye tests that are routinely&#xD;
      performed pre-operatively and at the post-operative follow-up appointments 1 day, 1 week, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited from patients attending the Ophthalmology Department&#xD;
      Outpatients Clinic at St Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom who have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      glaucoma or OHT (ocular hypertension) requiring glaucoma drainage surgery. One hundred&#xD;
      patients with glaucoma or OHT and where a clinical decision has been made that they need&#xD;
      glaucoma surgery will be included in the study such that 100 eyes undergoing surgery will be&#xD;
      included together with the contra-lateral untreated eyes that will be used as controls for&#xD;
      comparison with the treated eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for the study at the following routine appointments that patients&#xD;
      undergoing glaucoma surgery are asked to attend: a pre-operative appointment, surgery, and&#xD;
      follow-up assessments 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery. Baseline measurements will be taken up to 2 months before glaucoma surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline assessment demographic information will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of participants' relevant past medical history will be collected at the baseline&#xD;
      pre-operative assessment and at 12 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be performed on both eyes as the contra-lateral non-operated eye will be used&#xD;
      as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aqueous parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Aqueous flow rate: Participants will be asked to self-administer 3 to 6 drops (depending on&#xD;
      their age) of fluorescein sodium 2% topically into both eyes at 5 minute intervals on the&#xD;
      night before the fluorophotometric scans. Fluorophotometry will be performed using a scanning&#xD;
      ocular fluorophotometer from 9:00 am -12:00 midday. Four sets of triplicate scans will be&#xD;
      collected at 1 hour intervals to determine the aqueous flow rate (Ft). The 3 scans are done&#xD;
      in quick succession, taking approximately 2 seconds in total to complete the set. Following&#xD;
      each set of scans, IOP will be measured using pneumatonometry. and rebound tonometry. IOP&#xD;
      will be recorded as the mean of a total of 12 measurements per eye: 3 measurements every hour&#xD;
      alternating between eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have had previous cataract surgeries or iridotomy/iridectomy will be excluded&#xD;
      from this aspect of the measurements as fluorophotometry is inaccurate in these eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outflow facility: Tonographic outflow facility (C) measurement will be performed using&#xD;
           an electronic Schiøtz tonographer (Model 720, Berkeley Bioengineering Inc, USA) between&#xD;
           9:00 am -12:00 midday. The facility of outflow will be measured from the rate of decay&#xD;
           of IOP in the supine position during application of a recording Schiøtz tonometer over a&#xD;
           period of 4 minutes with a standard 5.5 gram weight. The &quot;R&quot; values of the curve at&#xD;
           every 30-second time point will be manually entered into the McLaren tonography computer&#xD;
           program. The program fits a second-degree polynomial by least squares to the nine data&#xD;
           points and determines the best-fit values for time 0 and time 4 minutes by&#xD;
           extrapolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraocular pressure (IOP): Pneumatonometry and rebound tonometry will be used to&#xD;
           measure IOP for patients undergoing fluorophotometry. The IOP measurements will be&#xD;
           recorded at 1 hour intervals between the hours of 9:00 am -12:00 midday following each&#xD;
           set of fluorophotometric scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uveoscleral outflow: There are currently no reliable clinical methods of measuring&#xD;
           uveoscleral outflow (Fu) and episcleral venous pressure (Pv). Fu will be therefore&#xD;
           calculated using the Goldmann equation (see below) with an assumed episcleral venous&#xD;
           pressure of 8-11 mmHg:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ft = C(IOP - Pv) +Fu Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ft = Measured aqueous flow rate Fu = Ft - C(IOP - Pv) Fu = Calculated uveoscleral outflow C =&#xD;
      Tonographic outflow facility (value computed by the measurement device) IOP = Mean morning&#xD;
      intraocular pressure as measured by pneumatonometry Pv = Episcleral venous pressure (8-11&#xD;
      mmHg, exact value calculated based on patient parameters)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the pre-operative visit when baseline measurements are taken and at each routine&#xD;
      post-operative follow-up visit (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months&#xD;
      after surgery) patients will undergo a clinical ophthalmological examination including the&#xD;
      following tests and examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual acuity measurement (Snellen and ETDRS charts will be used. Best Corrected&#xD;
           Distance Visual Acuity (BCVA) and Non Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (NCVA) will be&#xD;
           measured using ETDRS (early treatment diabetic retinopathy study) charts. Best Corrected&#xD;
           Near Visual Acuity (BCVA) will be measured using a standard near vision chart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Slit lamp examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual fields&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IOP (intraocular pressure) measurement (Goldmann applanation tonometry will be used to&#xD;
           measure IOP, except when there is irregular corneal astigmatism or other corneal&#xD;
           problems which may preclude accurate reading. The IOP measurement will be done after&#xD;
           application of topical anesthetic (eye drop) with fluorescein)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gonioscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dilated fundoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anterior chamber depth and axial length&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central corneal thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refraction (routine at baseline only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the surgical interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are potentially four types of operation that patients may have as part of their&#xD;
      glaucoma care in the department:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trans-trabecular meshwork implants (Hydrus implant or iStent implant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ciliary Ablation Treatment (Diode laser or HiFu ultrasound treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  External (sub-conjunctival) Drainage Surgery (Trabeculectomy, Baerveldt implant or Ahmed&#xD;
           Implant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suprachoroidal Shunt Surgery (STARflo)&#xD;
