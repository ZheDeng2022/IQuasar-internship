  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is relatively rare but exhibits higher incidences in&#xD;
      less developed countries. PSCC is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by early&#xD;
      spread. Pembrolizumab has recently been FDA-approved for the treatment of melanoma but will&#xD;
      serve as the investigational agent for this penile cancer study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter trial to evaluate Pembrolizumab for patients with advanced penile&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma following prior chemotherapy. Participating institutions are the&#xD;
      University of Alabama at Birmingham (coordinating center), M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,&#xD;
      University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, and Emory University. Patients will receive&#xD;
      intravenous Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and undergo a clinical exam. Radiographic scans will&#xD;
      be done at baseline and every 9 weeks. Therapy will continue until disease progression or&#xD;
      there are intolerable toxicities.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Is pregnant expecting to father children within the projected duration of the trial,&#xD;
             starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has known active Tuberculosis infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
