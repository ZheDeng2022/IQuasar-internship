  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nurses were learned the theoretical and practical skills previously during their&#xD;
      studentship period. The procedures will be the first time the nurses wanted to perform in&#xD;
      ICU. All clinical situations including patient, procedure, and shift will be similar for&#xD;
      nurses. The end point will be reaching to the 95 score of learning curve. The reason for&#xD;
      selection less than 5 percent variation was the flattening of learning curve (the plateau&#xD;
      section).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All new registered nurses in intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 April 2016 until next 24 months&#xD;
      from 10 mixed beds ICUs will be selected through convenience sampling and according to&#xD;
      fulfilling the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data collection, a specific checklist as many as selected techniques according to the&#xD;
      three panel of expert sessions was validated. The members of expert panel were three&#xD;
      intensivists, five anesthesiologists, three pulmonologists, five internists, one&#xD;
      nephrologist, one cardiologist, and ten highly experienced ICU nurses. Firstly, extensive&#xD;
      review of the literature based on the latest documents and articles for techniques was done.&#xD;
      The Kendal agreement coefficient between the panel of expert members for selecting the&#xD;
      primary materials to constitute the checklist was 0.976 (P Value &lt;0.0001). According to the&#xD;
      extensive review of the literature, a primary checklist as many as selected techniques was&#xD;
      generated. The primary checklist as many as selected techniques generated in the first expert&#xD;
      panel session. After the 90 minutes discussion about the primary checklist as many as&#xD;
      selected techniques, the primary consensus was achieved. The primary checklist as many as&#xD;
      selected techniques sent to the expert members for purifying, improving and editing. The&#xD;
      results of the second 120 minutes distance session were analyzed meticulously by principle&#xD;
      investigator and two independent researchers (K=0.943 with P Value &lt;0.0001). Based on the&#xD;
      results of the second session, the third version of the checklists as many as selected&#xD;
      techniques was prepared. According to the 120 minutes final session, the checklists as many&#xD;
      as selected techniques for clinical survey was prepared. The checklists had different domains&#xD;
      according to the selected techniques. The scoring of each checklist's questions was based on&#xD;
      the 3 status. Ability to perform alone (2 score), ability to perform with helping (1 score)&#xD;
      and inability to perform (0 score). Each question had specific importance coefficient among 1&#xD;
      to 5. The philosophy of the different coefficients for the questions in the domains was&#xD;
      related to the importance degree of question. Thus, besides the domain scores, each domain&#xD;
      had specific importance coefficient. The total score of the checklist comes from multiplying&#xD;
      the question score to question importance coefficient with percent. Then, the highest score&#xD;
      of the checklist was 100 percent and the lowest score was 0 percent. The nurses received full&#xD;
      classical education according to the final three-step checklist components by a full ICU&#xD;
      trainer in five 120 minutes sessions as theoretically. The trainer did not inform from the&#xD;
      research questions and study. During the three validation sessions, content validity ration&#xD;
      (CVR) with 28 panelists were 0.59 and content validity index (CVI) 0.95. Reliability of the&#xD;
      checklist was determined based on the inter-rate reliability with Kappa agreement test among&#xD;
      principle investigator and intensivists (r= 0.94), anesthesiologists (r= 0.92),&#xD;
      pulmonologists (r= 0.90), internists (r= 0.93), nephrologist (r= 0.97), cardiologist (r=&#xD;
      0.95), and three of the nurses (r= 0.91, 90, and 92), separately. Reliability of the&#xD;
      checklist was determined based on the intera-rate reliability with Kappa agreement test by&#xD;
      principle investigator (r= 0.96), intensivists (r= 0.91), anesthesiologists (r= 0.92),&#xD;
      pulmonologists (r= 0.94), internists (r= 0.92), nephrologist (r= 0.93), cardiologist (r=&#xD;
      0.90), and three of the nurses (r= 0.90, 93, and 94), separately. For decreasing the&#xD;
      researcher effect on the nurses, the results of two primary weeks will not be considered.&#xD;
      Following each nurse will be continued until achieving the flattening of the learning curve.&#xD;
