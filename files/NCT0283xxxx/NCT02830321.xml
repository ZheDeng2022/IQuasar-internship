    <textblock>
      This study included 90 pregnant women during their first trimester who attended Ain Shams&#xD;
      University Maternity Hospital antenatal clinic and admitted in the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were divided into two groups: 46 cases of pregnant women with H.G and 44 healthy&#xD;
      control pregnant women with no vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups were matched regarding the inclusion criteria which includes maternal age (18-40&#xD;
      years), gestational age (&lt;16 wks), and signs and symptoms of H.G for cases (vomiting&#xD;
      affecting the general condition, ketonuria, weight loss) and excluding cases or controls with&#xD;
      multiple gestation, hyadatiform disease or maternal disease causes vomiting such as ;&#xD;
      pyelonephritis, gastroenteritis, cholecystitis or hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups were subjected to full history taking, clinical examination, routine&#xD;
      laboratory investigations (urine analysis, CBC, liver, kidney function tests Na, k, PT, PTT &amp;&#xD;
      INR) Abdominal ultrasound was done to assess fetal life and gestational age and to exclude&#xD;
      gestational trophoblastic disease and multiple gestation pregnancy.H.Pylori infection was&#xD;
      assessed by using One step H.pylori Stool Antigen Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (CER TEST BIOTEC) pol. Industrial Rio Gallego II,Calle J, No 1, 50840, San Mateo de Gallego,&#xD;
