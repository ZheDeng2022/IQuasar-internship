  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OSABI is a pilot study of a sleep hygiene protocol for sleep disruptions associated with TBI&#xD;
      during inpatient rehabilitation. Twenty participants will be allocated (by minimization)&#xD;
      either into a standard of care protocol or a sleep hygiene protocol for 4 weeks. Sleep&#xD;
      efficiency (via actigraphy), post traumatic amnesia (OLOG), agitation (Agitated Behavior&#xD;
      Scale) and cognitive function (Confusion Assessment Protocol) will be monitored during the&#xD;
      trial period to examine relationships among them.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Estimates of sleep disruption after traumatic brain injury (TBI) reach 81%, but the incidence&#xD;
      nature, course and effect on recovery from TBI are not well understood because most TBI sleep&#xD;
      studies included mixed TBI severity samples at varied times post injury. In the early&#xD;
      rehabilitation phase of recovery from moderate-to-severe TBI, sleep disturbance has been&#xD;
      estimated at 78% and has been associated with the presence of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA); a&#xD;
      transient period of disorientation, confusion and inability to store memories that occurs&#xD;
      after TBI. Individuals with TBI who are in PTA not only have severe memory dysfunction that&#xD;
      significantly impairs their ability to benefit from verbal instruction, but are often in a&#xD;
      confusional state with agitated behavior. They require a 24-hour, highly structured&#xD;
      environment for safety until their PTA resolves. PTA can last from days to weeks, during&#xD;
      which time the individual and his/her family are significantly distressed. Its duration also&#xD;
      has practical implications in terms of resources, length of hospitalization and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There appears to be a relationship between sleep disturbance and PTA during early recovery&#xD;
      from TBI, but the nature of the relationship is not fully understood. Sleep disturbance has&#xD;
      been associated with delirium in non-TBI medical patients, and sleep deprivation has been&#xD;
      associated with significant negative effects on attention, reaction time, visual-motor&#xD;
      performance, language functions, memory processes, and executive functions in normal&#xD;
      populations. Sleep disturbance appears to negatively affect cognitive functioning in both&#xD;
      medical and normal samples. In the TBI population, sleep disruption could further exacerbate&#xD;
      the already compromised cognitive functions and prolong PTA. The relationship between sleep&#xD;
      disruption and PTA presents a potentially significant therapeutic opportunity because PTA is&#xD;
      largely considered to be fixed and immutable with no therapeutic options. Therapeutic efforts&#xD;
      to improve sleep may reduce the length of PTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will begin to address the gap in knowledge about the nature, incidence and&#xD;
      effect of sleep disturbances on recovery from moderate-to-severe TBI during the early&#xD;
      rehabilitation period. It will also pilot a sleep hygiene protocol to improve sleep for&#xD;
      individuals in the early rehabilitation phase after TBI. It will employ 24-hour per day sleep&#xD;
      observations and actigraphy to characterize the incidence and type of sleep disturbances in&#xD;
      the early rehabilitation phase of TBI. In addition, the study will serially test participants&#xD;
      multiple times a week with the Orientation Log (OLOG) and the Confusion Assessment Protocol&#xD;
      (CAP) to closely monitor changes in alertness, orientation, attention, memory functions and&#xD;
      behavior as they emerge from PTA. The sleep observations and actigraph information can then&#xD;
      be compared to the cognitive measures of PTA to examine the relationship of sleep quantity&#xD;
      and quality on cognitive functions during recovery from PTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized controlled trial with minimization allocation (RCT) pilot component of the&#xD;
      study will be the first therapeutic attempt that we are aware of; to normalize sleep cycles&#xD;
      and sleep quality in individuals with TBI who have sleep disruptions during early&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Twenty individuals with TBI who have low sleep efficiency on actigraphy&#xD;
      during the initial night time screening will be randomized into a comprehensive sleep hygiene&#xD;
      protocol (SHP = 10) or a standard of care (SOC = 10) protocol for three weeks. Both groups&#xD;
      will have access to all rehabilitation facilities, therapies, services and programs. The&#xD;
      difference between the groups is the systematic attempt to improve sleep in the SHP by five&#xD;
      principle components: 1) improved night sleep environment, 2) increased daytime activation,&#xD;
      3) enhanced circadian stimuli, 4) morning ADL routines individually adjusted to pre-injury&#xD;
      biological sleep patterns and 5) no caffeine intake. In the SOC group, there will be no&#xD;
      systematic efforts to influence circadian rhythms, daytime activation or nighttime sleep&#xD;
      environment. Participant's sleep in both groups will be monitored with 24-hour actigraphy and&#xD;
      staff ratings of sleep-awake periods throughout the 24 hour period on the Makley Sleep Scale&#xD;
      (MSS) for four weeks. Additionally, nursing staff will rate agitation on the Agitated&#xD;
      Behavior Scale and therapy staff will monitor cognitive functioning with the Orientation Log&#xD;
      (OLOG) and Confusion Assessment Protocol (CAP) until after emergence from PTA. The sleep&#xD;
      data, cognitive testing and behavioral information for both groups will enable examination of&#xD;
      the relationship of sleep to PTA and the potential benefit of the SHP on normalizing sleep&#xD;
      and enhancing cognitive recovery, including resolution of PTA.&#xD;
