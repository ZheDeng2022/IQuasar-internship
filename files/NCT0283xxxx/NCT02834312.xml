    <textblock>
      This dose-finding study is being conducted to select the daily oral dose of estetrol (E4) for&#xD;
      the treatment of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in post-menopausal women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oestrogen therapy is the most consistently effective treatment used in the US and Europe for&#xD;
      menopausal VMS. Following the safety issues reported in the primary Women's Health Initiative&#xD;
      publications and with continued subject requests for treatment, a challenge to clinicians has&#xD;
      been to identify the lowest effective dose of oestrogen for alleviating menopausal symptoms.&#xD;
      In addition, it is a challenge to develop a safer oestrogen than those currently used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the minimum effective dose (MED) of E4 has to be defined for the treatment&#xD;
      of menopausal symptoms. The present study is intended to evaluate changes in frequency and in&#xD;
      severity of moderate to severe VMS in order to define the MED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly allocated to either treatment group (2.5 mg E4, 5 mg E4, 10 mg E4,&#xD;
      15 mg E4, or placebo) in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. All treatments (E4 or Placebo) will be&#xD;
      administered once daily (QD) per os for at least 12 consecutive weeks until the last&#xD;
      biological assessments (Day 90 maximum) have been performed.&#xD;
