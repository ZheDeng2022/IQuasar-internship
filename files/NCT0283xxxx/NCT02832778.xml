      The purpose of the study is to measure the drug levels in the blood of HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals taking anti- HIV medication efavirenz 400 mg once daily in the presence of&#xD;
      anti-TB medication rifampicin and isoniazid. The study is being run in two-stages - London&#xD;
      (Stage 1) and Kampala (Stage 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In London (Stage 1): HIV-1 infected patients (without tuberculosis infection) on established&#xD;
      treatment with a combination based on 600 mg efavirenz dose will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Kampala (Stage 2): Patients with both HIV-1 and tuberculosis infection being treated with&#xD;
      600 mg efavirenz combination for HIV AND undergoing TB treatment with a dual therapy regimen&#xD;
      contaning rifampicin and isoniazid will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efavirenz-containing regimens are recommended as first-line therapy for HIV-TB co-infected&#xD;
      patients. It has been shown there is a lack of a significant difference between efavirenz 400&#xD;
      mg and efavirenz 600 mg, indicating that 400 mg efavirenz is non-inferior to the standard&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of antiretroviral dose reductions may translate into greater benefits for more&#xD;
      individuals infected by HIV globally, since they may allow access programs to reach higher&#xD;
      numbers of infected patients and compensate for the finite global manufacturing capacity and&#xD;
      increasing demand. For efavirenz, significant price reductions have been achieved through&#xD;
      elimination of trade, logistics and manufacturing capacity barriers, and further price&#xD;
      reductions could be achieved with a significant reduction in the cost of pharmaceutical&#xD;
      ingredients. However, no data on the PK and effectiveness of efavirenz 400 mg once daily&#xD;
      during TB treatment has been produced. Given that many patients on Efavirenz- based ART will&#xD;
      need to be treated for TB during their lifetime and rifampicin is one of the most commonly&#xD;
      used treatment for tuberculosis, it is important to study the reduced dose under carefully&#xD;
      monitored conditions prior to roll out of a lower dose standard treatment. Therefore, we aim&#xD;
      to investigate the PK of efavirenz 400 mg once daily in HIV-infected individuals in the&#xD;
      presence of rifampicin and isoniazid in London, UK and in HIV/TB-co-infected individuals on&#xD;
      dual anti-TB treatment in Kampala, Uganda&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the comparison of efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) Ctrough during combined treatment with efavirenz and rifampicin/isoniazid treatment for tuberculosis, versus efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) treatment alone. The efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) Ctrough from each patient will be compared between the two phases using geometric mean ratios (log10 transformed data). For this sequential design, a sample size of 25 patients would provide at least 80% power to detect a decrease in efavirenz Ctrough of 20% during the combined rifampicin/isoniazid-efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) phase, compared to the efavirenz alone phase. This calculation assumes two-sided testing with a 5% significance level and a within-patient coefficient of variation in efavirenz levels of no more than 30%.</description>
