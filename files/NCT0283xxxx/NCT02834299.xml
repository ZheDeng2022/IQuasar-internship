      This study will compare unguided and guided dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) self-help to&#xD;
      an attention-placebo self-help control condition. Participants with binge eating disorder&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of the three self-help conditions for 12 weeks. Six guided&#xD;
      self-help sessions will take place via secure video-calling. Assessments will take place&#xD;
      before, mid-way through, and after the self-help program as well as at 3-month follow-up. Six&#xD;
      guided self-help sessions will take place via secure video-calling.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is&#xD;
      to compare the effectiveness of two methods of administering a dialectical behavior therapy&#xD;
      (DBT) self-help intervention in a community sample of individuals with BED in NL: guided DBT&#xD;
      self-help (DBT-GSH) and unguided DBT self-help (DBT-USH). A third condition designed to&#xD;
      control for non-specific or common factors (e.g., receiving a self-help book) will also be&#xD;
      included (NS-SH). This condition will be a self-help manual focused on improving low&#xD;
      self-esteem using CBT strategies with no reference to binge eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis was based on the primary outcome variable: frequency of binge eating episodes.&#xD;
      Assuming the three randomized groups (DBT-USH, DBT-GSH and NS-UGS) are equivalent at&#xD;
      baseline, a between groups ANOVA will be used to compare them at post-treatment. Based on the&#xD;
      findings of Masson et al. (2014), assuming an effect size of 0.40 and Type 1 error rate equal&#xD;
      to .05, a sample size of at least 21 participants per group will yield 80% power. Assuming an&#xD;
      attrition rate of 20%, we will require 25 participants per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from the community in the province of&#xD;
      Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Family doctor practices around the province will be&#xD;
      informed about the study and brochures/posters will be sent to them. Posters advertising the&#xD;
      study will be posted in hospitals, colleges, medical clinics, and universities.&#xD;
      Advertisements will be placed on a local radio website and the PI will appear on the radio to&#xD;
      advertise the study. Interested participants will be instructed to go to a website where they&#xD;
      will fill in an initial screening questionnaire. Those who appear to meet the study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be scheduled for an initial assessment interview via telephone or video-calling&#xD;
      to confirm their eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study inclusion/exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Participants will be male or female aged 18 and older who meet the DSM-5&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for BED based on Eating Disorder Examination (Version 17). Additional&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will include: 1) body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) of at least 18.5; 2) ability&#xD;
      to read English; 3) high school graduate or equivalent; and 4) access to a computer, tablet&#xD;
      or cell phone (with camera and microphone) and to high speed internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Participants will be excluded for the following reasons: a) current&#xD;
      specialized psychological treatment specifically for BED; b) current major medical illness&#xD;
      that would interfere with treatment (e.g., cancer); c) current acute suicidal risk as&#xD;
      assessed using the BDI-II ; d) current substance use disorder; and e) current psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms . Individuals on a stable dose of antidepressant medication and/or sleep medication&#xD;
      for at least 3 months will be eligible to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be randomized to one of the three intervention conditions&#xD;
      (DBT-USH or DBT-GSH or NS-SH) using block randomization, with a block size of 5. Since no&#xD;
      reliable predictors of BED outcome have been identified to date, we will not stratify the&#xD;
      groups. The randomization list will be prepared by a research assistant not involved in the&#xD;
      current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Treatment will last 12 weeks in all conditions. Participants in both DBT&#xD;
      self-help conditions will be provided with the DBT self-help manual &quot;Dialectical Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy for Binge Eating: A Self-Help Program&quot;. This manual is a self-help version of the&#xD;
      well-established therapist-administered DBT treatment manual used in previous trials of DBT&#xD;
      for BED. It consists of nine modules that aim to teach three skills to help participants stop&#xD;
      binge eating: mindfulness, distress tolerance and emotion regulation. In the GSH condition,&#xD;
      participants will receive six 30-minute one-on-one GSH sessions via a secure web-based&#xD;
      video-calling program (Bluejeans) with a clinical psychology doctoral student therapist. GSH&#xD;
      sessions will take place weekly for the first 2 weeks, biweekly for 6 weeks and then a final&#xD;
      session will take place at week 12. The video-calling program allows GSH sessions to be&#xD;
      recorded for supervision and treatment monitoring purposes. GSH therapists will have weekly&#xD;
      group supervision meetings with the principal investigator to discuss any questions or&#xD;
      challenges that arise. In both unguided self-help conditions, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      do their best to follow the advice in the self-help manual on their own over the next 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapist Training and Supervision: After completing preparatory readings, therapists will&#xD;
      attend a half-day training workshop with the principal investigator (JCM). Thereafter,&#xD;
      therapists will meet weekly with JCM for group supervision to ensure competence and adherence&#xD;
      to the GSH therapist manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guided Self-Help (GSH) Therapist Manual. This manual was used in three previous CBT GSH&#xD;
      trials, including one by the PI. It was adapted for the present study to guide therapists'&#xD;
      DBT-GSH sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapist Adherence to the GSH Therapist Manual: A random sample of 15% of video-taped GSH&#xD;
      sessions will be reviewed by an independent rater to insure adherence to the Therapist&#xD;
      Manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant drop-out: Consistent with an intention-to-treat approach, participants who drop&#xD;
      out will be asked to continue to participate in the study assessments. To assess participant&#xD;
      adherence, we will measure the number of times participants access the self-help manual&#xD;
      website and the number of minutes they spend on each module. The number of eligible&#xD;
      individuals who: decline to participate, are randomized, begin the study, or drop out of the&#xD;
      study (and the week at which this occurs) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Measures: Except for the initial assessment interview, which will be conducted via&#xD;
      video-calling, all study measures will be administered on-line via Qualtrics. Measures will&#xD;
      be administered at baseline (Week 1), and post-treatment (Week12), as well as 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up. A subset of measures (EDE-Q and DERS) will also be administered at mid-treatment&#xD;
      (week 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, body weight, height, weight history, marital status, education level, ethnicity, age of&#xD;
      onset of binge eating, and treatment history will be collected at baseline. Body weight will&#xD;
      also be re-assessed at mid- and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating Disorder Psychopathology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eating Disorder Examination Interview, Version 17 (EDE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q 6.0). General Psychological Distress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Emotion Regulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Treatment Suitability and Expectancy&#xD;
           (TSE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceived treatment suitability and expectations will be measured at baseline using two&#xD;
           10-point visual analogue scales used in previous self-help study on eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: The primary analysis will focus on the main outcome variable - number&#xD;
      of binge eating episodes over the previous 28 days. If, after randomization, the three groups&#xD;
      (i.e., GSH and USH) are equivalent at baseline, then an ANOVA will be used to compare the&#xD;
      groups on binge eating frequency at post-treatment. Impact on eating disorder&#xD;
      psychopathology, general psychological distress, quality of life, and difficulties with&#xD;
      emotion regulation will also be examined. Eating disorder psychopathology, general&#xD;
      psychological distress, quality of life, and difficulties with emotion regulation will also&#xD;
      be examined.&#xD;
