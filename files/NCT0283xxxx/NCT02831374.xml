      Purpose: This prospective randomized comparative clinical study was conducted to assess the&#xD;
      effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel on soft tissue healing and bone regeneration&#xD;
      potential on lower third molar extraction sockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: For the study, 50 Patients (37 male, 13 female) requiring surgical removal of a&#xD;
      lower impacted third molar and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were recruited. The&#xD;
      patients were categorized into two groups, Group A and Group B. For each group 25 patients&#xD;
      were randomly allocated. The predictor variable in Group A was the application of PRP Gel&#xD;
      whereas in Group B had no PRP. Postoperative pain, swelling, trismus, soft tissue healing and&#xD;
      osseous regeneration was assessed using standard methods. These outcome variables were&#xD;
      assessed on 1, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 14-postoperative day. Patients were recalled at the 4th, 10th,&#xD;
      and 16th postoperative week for assessment of bone healing. The data were recorded and&#xD;
      tabulated.&#xD;

      The study is designed as a prospective randomized comparative clinical study. The sample&#xD;
      population was composed of fifty consecutive patients who needed surgical extraction of lower&#xD;
      third molar under local anesthesia. The study included 37 male and 13 female with age ranging&#xD;
      from 20 to 40 years. All Patients were categorized into GROUP A (wound in which PRP is&#xD;
      placed) and GROUP B (socket without PRP). The patients were allocated randomly to each group&#xD;
      equally by single-blind technique, irrespective of age and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee prior to the beginning&#xD;
      of the study. The signed consent form obtained from all the patients after explaining the&#xD;
      risks and benefits of the surgical procedure. The group A (test group) received topical&#xD;
      application of PRP, whereas the group B (control group) was left to heal without PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain was assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) with a score of 0&#xD;
      equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 equals &quot;very severe pain&quot; Facial swelling was assessed by&#xD;
      modification of Schultze-Mosgau et al method, and this involved measuring the length from the&#xD;
      tragus to the oral commissure and tragus to the pogonion. The arithmetic sum of the two&#xD;
      measurements was considered as facial swelling at the time point. The maximum distance&#xD;
      between the maxillary central incisors and the mandibular central incisors was taken as mouth&#xD;
      opening. The difference between postoperative and preoperative mouth opening value was&#xD;
      considered as trismus. Assessment of soft tissue healing was based on the criteria given by&#xD;
      Landry et al. and Gonshor et al. Third molar sockets were assessed radiographically for bone&#xD;
      healing by modification of Kelley's method as described by Olufemi et al. The percentage of&#xD;
      facial swelling and mouth opening was estimated using the method described by Ogundipe et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for preparation of PRP gel Under all aseptic conditions, PRP was processed by means&#xD;
      of a modification of the method of Sonnleitner et al. Before surgery, 10 mL of venous blood&#xD;
      was collected from the antecubital fossa of the patient's forearm and stored into sterile&#xD;
      tubes containing anticoagulant (0.5 mL citrate phosphate dextrose) from each patient of group&#xD;
      A in the experimental group using routine venipuncture procedure. The tube was thoroughly&#xD;
      agitated to ensure mixing of anticoagulant with the venous blood. The whole blood is then&#xD;
      centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for ten minutes. The supernatant layer obtained was platelet poor&#xD;
      plasma (PPP) and Buffy coat (BC) and RBCs (red blood cells) at the bottom part. PPP, BC and&#xD;
      upper 1-2 mm of RBC (red blood cell) layer was collected in a new sterile tube and&#xD;
      centrifuged again at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. The upper half of the supernatant is removed and&#xD;
      the lower half is mixed carefully to get PRP. The platelet concentration of the PRP was&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP gel was prepared by adding Five drops of the mixture of 10 % CaCl2 and 1000 U bovine&#xD;
      thrombin to 2mL (milliliter) PRP just before its use in extraction socket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure The surgical extraction procedure was the same in all patients and carried&#xD;
      out by the same operator. After achieving Local anesthesia using 2% lignocaine hydrochloride&#xD;
      with 1:100,000 epinephrine, standard Terrence Ward's incision was placed to raise a full&#xD;
      thickness mucoperiosteal flap. Distobuccal bone was carefully exposed and bone surrounding&#xD;
      the buccal aspect of impacted tooth was performed using surgical bur under copious irrigation&#xD;
      with 0.9% saline. The tooth was elevated using Coupland elevator and if required situations&#xD;
      tooth was sectioned with surgical bur to facilitate its removal. The socket was checked for&#xD;
      any tooth or bony debris. The bony margins smoothened using a file and irrigated with normal&#xD;
      saline. Subsequently, PRP gel was placed into the extraction sockets of patients in the group&#xD;
      A and wound closure was done using simple interrupted 3.0 black silk sutures. In group B the&#xD;
      wound is closed without application of PRP gel. Patients were advised regular post extraction&#xD;
      and prescribed 500 mg of paracetamol postoperatively (1 tablet every 6 h for 2 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were also advised to not consume any medications but those advised and not to&#xD;
      get medical help somewhere else for postoperative discomfort or pain without prior&#xD;
      information to the operator. The patients were reviewed postoperatively on 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-,&#xD;
      and 14-day to record pain, mouth opening, Soft tissue and bony healing index. Patients were&#xD;
      recalled at the 4th, 10th, and 16th postoperative week for assessment of bone healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 21.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics such as mean, SD (standard deviation ) and percentage were used.&#xD;
      Normality of data was tested by using Kolmogorov and Smirnov method. Unpaired t-test was used&#xD;
      to compare between groups with normally data and Mann-Whitney test for non-normally data. For&#xD;
      categorical variables, Chi-square test was employed. A p-value less than 0.05 were considered&#xD;
      as significant.&#xD;
