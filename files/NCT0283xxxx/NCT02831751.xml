    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine study is intended to replicate and extend the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety results obtained in earlier Phase 1-2 and Phase 2 studies. The&#xD;
      study is being conducted to evaluate that the immunogenicity profile of the Quadrivalent VLP&#xD;
      Vaccine meets the US Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) licensure criteria&#xD;
      and to evaluate if the immunogenicity and the safety profile of the Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine&#xD;
      is acceptable and comparable to that of the FluLaval® Tetra and Fluzone® High-Dose (HD). The&#xD;
      study will also help to define the optimal dose in this population, establish potential&#xD;
      competitive advantages, and support the design of future studies.&#xD;

      This randomized, observer-blind, multicenter, Phase 2 study will be conducted at multiple&#xD;
      sites across the United States and Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influenza strain composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine used in this study includes&#xD;
      2 influenza A virus strains (A/California/7/2009 [H1N1] and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013&#xD;
      [H3N2]) and 2 influenza B virus strains (B/Phuket/3073/2013 [Yamagata lineage] and&#xD;
      B/Brisbane/60/2008 [Victoria lineage]), based on the 2015-2016 recommended World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) strains for vaccination in the Northern hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1000 elderly male and female subjects, aged 65 years or older, will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1of 4 parallel treatment groups such that 500 subjects&#xD;
      receive Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine (250 each for the 30 µg/strain and 60 µg/strain groups), 250&#xD;
      subjects receive FluLaval® Tetra (15 µg/strain) and 250 subjects receive Fluzone® HD (60&#xD;
      µg/strain). Subjects in each group will be stratified into 2 age strata: 65 to 74 years and&#xD;
      75 years old and older, where 70 % of subjects will be enrolled into the 65 to 74 years old&#xD;
      age group and 30 % into the 75 years old or older group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 8 months, during which 5 visits&#xD;
      will be scheduled, and phone contact will be made on Day 1, Day 8, and every 2 months&#xD;
      thereafter for up to 6 months post-Day 21 visit (Day 201). Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      for immunogenicity analyses at Days 0 and 21 for all subjects. Safety laboratory assessments&#xD;
      will be performed at Screening, on Day 3 and within 48 hours of Day 3 results availability,&#xD;
      for grade 3 or grade 4 abnormalities or if deemed necessary by the investigator or early&#xD;
      termination. Subsequent follow-up of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be&#xD;
      done according to the investigator's discretion.. Subjects will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study for safety, including the reporting of solicited local and systemic reactions.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must be able to read, understand, and sign the informed consent form (ICF);&#xD;
             complete study-related procedures; and communicate with the study staff at visits and&#xD;
             by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects are considered by the Investigator to be reliable and likely to cooperate&#xD;
             with the assessment procedures and be available for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male and female subjects must be 65 years of age or older at Screening (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects have a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 32.4 kg/m2 at Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be in good general health prior to study participation (no more than 30&#xD;
             days prior to study vaccine administration) with no clinically relevant abnormalities&#xD;
             that could jeopardize subject safety or interfere with study assessments as assessed&#xD;
             by the Principal Investigator or Sub-Investigator (thereafter referred as&#xD;
             Investigator) and determined by medical history, physical examination, biochemistry,&#xD;
             hematology, and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will be allowed to participate if the&#xD;
        disease is stable and, according to the Investigator's judgment, the condition is unlikely&#xD;
        to confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subject by&#xD;
        participating in the study. Stable disease is generally defined as no new onset or&#xD;
        exacerbation of pre-existing chronic disease 6 months prior to immunization. Based on the&#xD;
        Investigator's judgment, a subject with more recent stabilization of a disease could also&#xD;
        be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. According to the Investigator's opinion, history of significant acute or chronic,&#xD;
             uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric illness. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study&#xD;
                  vaccine administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requiring a change in medication dosage during one month prior to study vaccine&#xD;
                  administration due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity, or for chronic&#xD;
                  diseases, significant change in medication dosage within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
                  vaccine administration based upon the investigator's judgment (elective dosage&#xD;
                  adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or&#xD;
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject unable to&#xD;
             provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety observations and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any autoimmune disease other than hypothyroidism on stable replacement therapy or any&#xD;
             confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including known&#xD;
             or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or C infection, or the&#xD;
             presence of lymphoproliferative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Administration or planned administration of any non-influenza vaccine within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to randomization up to blood sampling at Day 21. Immunization on an emergency&#xD;
             basis will be evaluated case-by-case by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Administration of any adjuvanted or investigational influenza vaccine within 1 year&#xD;
             prior to randomization or planned administration prior to the completion of Day 201.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Administration of any 'standard', non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (e.g., live&#xD;
             attenuated trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine intranasal or split&#xD;
             trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine by either intradermal or&#xD;
             intramuscular [IM] route) within 6 months prior to randomization and up to completion&#xD;
             of Day 21 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days or 5 half-lives,&#xD;
             whichever is longer, prior to randomization or planned use during the study period.&#xD;
             Subjects may not participate in any other investigational or marketed drug study while&#xD;
             participating in this study until Day 201 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding 10 mg of prednisone per&#xD;
             day, or equivalent for more than 7 consecutive days or for 10 or more days in total,&#xD;
             within one month of study vaccine administration, any other cytotoxic or&#xD;
             immunosuppressant drug, or any immunoglobulin preparation within 3 months of&#xD;
             vaccination and until the completion of Day 21 visit. Low doses of nasal or inhaled&#xD;
             glucocorticoids are allowed. Topical steroids are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any significant disorder of coagulation including treatment with warfarin derivatives&#xD;
             or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet medications (e.g., low-dose&#xD;
             aspirin [no more than 325 mg/day]), and without a clinically apparent bleeding&#xD;
             tendency are eligible. Subjects treated with new generation drugs that do not increase&#xD;
             the risk of intramuscular bleeding (e.g. clopidogrel) are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of allergy to any of the constituents of the Quadrivalent VLP vaccine&#xD;
             (including H1N1, H3N2, B/Bris, and B/Phuket), to any components of the licensed&#xD;
             quadrivalent/trivalent vaccine, or tobacco allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of anaphylactic allergic reactions to any food, medication, or bee sting.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any history of serious asthma (e.g., status asthmaticus, hospitalization for asthma&#xD;

             (≥ 1 episode/year)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Continuous use of antihistamines in the last 4 weeks prior to immunization or use of&#xD;
             antihistamines 48 hours prior to study immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Use of prophylactic medications (e.g. acetaminophen/paracetamol, aspirin, naproxen, or&#xD;
             ibuprofen) within 24 hours of randomization to prevent or pre-empt symptoms due to&#xD;
             vaccination. Subject discovered to have taken a prophylactic medication within the 24&#xD;
             hours prior to planned randomization must be delayed until the 24 hours period is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Have a rash, dermatological condition, tattoos, muscle mass, or any other&#xD;
             abnormalities at injection site that may interfere with injection site reaction&#xD;
             rating.&#xD;

             diastolic BP ≥ 90mmHg, heart rate ≤ 45 beats/min and ≥ 100 beats/min. Even if one or&#xD;
             more vital signs are out of the acceptable ranges, a subject may still be included in&#xD;
             the study based on Investigator's judgment (e.g. a resting heart rate ≤ 45 in&#xD;
             highly-trained athletes). Presence of any febrile illness (including oral temperature&#xD;
             (OT) ≥ 38.0 ˚C within 24 hours prior to immunization). Such subjects may be&#xD;
