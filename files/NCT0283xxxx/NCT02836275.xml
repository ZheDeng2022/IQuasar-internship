    <textblock>
      Gynecological ultrasound is well known as the preferred exam to assess patients with ovarian&#xD;
      tumors. The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group developed the 'Simple Rules' to&#xD;
      classify an ovarian tumor as benign or malignant. In about 1/5 of patients the Simple Rules&#xD;
      give an inconclusive result and therefore a suitable second line test is necessary. Recently&#xD;
      the ADNEXMR SCORING system was developed, this is the first Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      score system that focuses on ovarian tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the performance of pelvic MRI examination&#xD;
      with perfusion -and diffusion- weighted sequences and the application of the ADNEXMR SCORING&#xD;
      system in ovarian tumors that cannot be classified by the IOTA Simple Rules (regarding the&#xD;
      prediction of malignancy). Other aims are the determination of the malignancy rate per&#xD;
      ADNEXMR SCORING system class, the evaluation of interobserver reproducibility and the&#xD;
      assessment of the accuracy of the specific diagnosis based on MRI images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicenter prospective study. In centers where perfusion -and diffusion&#xD;
      weighted MRI imaging is not a part of clinical routine in unclassifiable ovarian masses based&#xD;
      on ultrasound, the study is considered to be interventional. However, in other centres,&#xD;
      depending on the local guidelines, perfusion -and diffusion weighted MRI imaging can be&#xD;
      standard of care. In these centres, the study can be considered to be observational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IOTA-MRI project is linked to the IOTA study. In this multicenter study different&#xD;
      diagnostic ultrasound algorithms are tested prospectively in patients with an ovarian mass&#xD;
      prior to surgery. This study allows to define a subgroup of patients in which Simple Rules&#xD;
      are inconclusive, in other words the population eligible for inclusion in the IOTA-MRI&#xD;
      project. We plan to include 250 patients in the IOTA-MRI study. Patients will be included&#xD;
      consecutively, yet only after completing the informed consent. Recruitment will take 2 years&#xD;
      of time as of the start of the individual center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard is the histopathology diagnosis of the mass within 120 days after&#xD;
      ultrasound evaluation. The surgical approach is chosen by the managing clinician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is a common and lethal disease for which early detection and treatment in high&#xD;
      volume centers and by specialized clinicians is known to improve survival. Hence, accurate&#xD;
      methods to preoperatively characterize the nature of an ovarian tumor are pivotal. The IOTA&#xD;
      group has suggested Simple ultrasound based rules that can be used to classify adnexal masses&#xD;
      as benign or malignant. In about 1/5 of patients the Simple Rules give an inconclusive result&#xD;
      and therefore a suitable second line test is necessary. The benefit of using MRI in&#xD;
      sonographically indeterminate masses has been evaluated previously. However, the ability of&#xD;
      MRI to correctly classify tumors unclassifiable by the IOTA Simple Rules has not been&#xD;
      examined. The group of Thomassin-Naggara et al has recently developed the ADNEXMR SCORING&#xD;
      system, this is the first Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) score system that focuses on&#xD;
      ovarian tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the performance of pelvic MRI&#xD;
      examination with perfusion -and diffusion- weighted sequences and the application of the&#xD;
      ADNEXMR SCORING system in ovarian tumors that cannot be classified by the IOTA Simple Rules&#xD;
      (regarding the prediction of malignancy). Secondary aims are the determination of the&#xD;
      malignancy rate per ADNEXMR SCORING system class, the evaluation of interobserver&#xD;
      reproducibility and the assessment of the accuracy of the specific diagnosis based on MRI&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicenter prospective study. In centers where perfusion -and diffusion&#xD;
      weighted MRI imaging is not a part of clinical routine in unclassifiable ovarian masses based&#xD;
      on ultrasound, the study is considered to be interventional. However, in other centres,&#xD;
      depending on the local guidelines, perfusion -and diffusion weighted MRI imaging can be&#xD;
      standard of care. In these centres, the study can be considered to be observational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IOTA-MRI project is linked to the IOTA study. In this multicenter study different&#xD;
      diagnostic ultrasound algorithms are tested prospectively in patients with an ovarian mass&#xD;
      prior to surgery. This study allows to define a subgroup of patients in which Simple Rules&#xD;
      are inconclusive, in other words the population eligible for inclusion in the IOTA-MRI&#xD;
      project. We plan to include 250 patients in the IOTA-MRI study. Patients will be included&#xD;
      consecutively, yet only after completing the informed consent. Recruitment will take 2 years&#xD;
      of time as of the start of the individual center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, a standardized patient history will be registered, followed by a standardized&#xD;
      transvaginal gynecological ultrasound. All variables required for the diagnostic models as&#xD;
      well as the subjective diagnosis and certainty of diagnosis by the examiner will be&#xD;
      collected. Quality control is provided by the fact that all examiners involved in&#xD;
      gynecological ultrasound have completed IOTA-training and succeeded in a certification test.&#xD;
      All data will be registered in an online Clinical Data Miner system (CDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case that the results of the Simple Rules are inconclusive, and surgery is justifiable,&#xD;
      the patient will be informed about the IOTA-MRI study. If the patient agrees to participate,&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria are met and if there are no contra-indications, the patient will be&#xD;
      referred to the radiology department of the same center or an affiliated center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, at the radiology department, a standardized pelvic MRI examination will take place&#xD;
      (diffusion- and perfusion- weighted sequences). All the variables that are needed for the&#xD;
      classification of the ADNEXMR SCORING system as well as the subjective diagnosis of the&#xD;
      radiologist, will be registered in CDM. Quality control in this part is provided by the fact&#xD;
      that all radiologists involved in the study are certified by EURAD (EURopean ADnex mr score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard is the histopathology diagnosis of the mass within 120 days after&#xD;
      ultrasound evaluation. The surgical approach is chosen by the managing clinician. In case of&#xD;
      malignancy, staging of the tumor will be reported by the International Federation of&#xD;
      Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification. All results will be registered in CDM.&#xD;
