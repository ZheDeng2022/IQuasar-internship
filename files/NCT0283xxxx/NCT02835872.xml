  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to assess the LDL-C-lowering abilities of a dietary fiber ingredient, in&#xD;
      order to confirm the product's efficacy. Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of 3g dietary fiber on lowering serum LDL-C in otherwise healthy men and women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of 3g/d dietary fiber ingredient on lowering serum LDL-C in&#xD;
      otherwise healthy men and women. Subjects will be generally healthy men and women&#xD;
      (approximately equal number of men and women) 21-79 years of age, inclusive, each with a&#xD;
      fasting LDL-C level ≥130 mg/dL and &lt;190 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, controlled, 28-day parallel study will include one screening Visit (Visit 1,&#xD;
      Day -14), two baseline visits (Visits 2 and 3; Days -3 and 0) and three test visits (Visits&#xD;
      4, 5, and 6; Days 14, 25, and 28), and two contact reminders (Days 7 and 21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study ingredients will be provided in three servings of study products each day. During the&#xD;
      study, subjects will be instructed to consume one serving of study product at each mealtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable will be the percent change in LDL-C concentration from baseline&#xD;
      (average of Days -3 and 0) to the end of each intervention condition (average of Days 25 and&#xD;
      28).&#xD;
