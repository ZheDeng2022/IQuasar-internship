  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess correlation between ANI/NIPE values and external evaluation&#xD;
      COMFORT B scale during painful medical cares and during said comfort medical cares in&#xD;
      intubated children admitted in pediatric intensive care unit postoperative of cardiac surgery&#xD;
      with extracorporeal circulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ANI/NIPE monitors is a continuous noninvasive measurement of the parasympathetic tone, as a&#xD;
      component of the autonomous nervous system. It uses the tiny variations of heart rate induced&#xD;
      by each respiratory cycle (natural or induced) to quantify parasympathetic tone (respiratory&#xD;
      sinus arrhythmia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developed in surgical units, the ANI monitor has rarely been studied in pediatrics (only 2&#xD;
      publications, and only concerning peroperative measures). The NIPE monitor has only been&#xD;
      available since 2014. Nevertheless, adult surveys and fundamental scientific publications on&#xD;
      heart rate variations suggest that these monitors can evaluate pain on a continuous way. No&#xD;
      study has been led in pediatric intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, a continuous blinded monitoring will be set up as soon as patients' admittance&#xD;
      for all eligible subjects. We will study, for children in cardiac post-surgery, ANI/ NIPE&#xD;
      values and COMFORT B values during both painful and non-painful cares to determine&#xD;
      correlation between those values. We will analyze a posteriori the ANI/NIPE values, through a&#xD;
      standardized protocol, to recount the sequence of care and to determine discrepancies in drug&#xD;
      consumption. Data gathering will be made in the first 48h after admittance in Pediatric&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units (PICU). Patients will not be followed after leaving PICU.&#xD;
