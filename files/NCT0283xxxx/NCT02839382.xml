    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to build capacity for quality improvement (QI) in small&#xD;
      primary care practices across Washington, Oregon and Idaho by improving risk factors for&#xD;
      heart attacks such as blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking. The Northwest Coalition for&#xD;
      Primary Care Practice Support will assist practices by providing them with a QI coach,&#xD;
      creating group learning opportunities, and conducting educational outreach activities. An&#xD;
      innovative study design will be used to determine what levels and types of support are most&#xD;
      helpful and effective.&#xD;

      The Northwest Coalition for Primary Care Practice Support will provide a comprehensive and&#xD;
      robust external practice support infrastructure for small and medium primary care practices&#xD;
      across Washington (WA), Oregon (OR) and Idaho (ID) to build their internal quality&#xD;
      improvement (QI) capacity and improve performance on the heart health indicators of aspirin&#xD;
      use, blood pressure and cholesterol control and smoking cessation (ABCS indicators) by&#xD;
      disseminating and supporting the implementation of relevant Patient Centered Outcomes&#xD;
      Research findings. This coalition of partners has a remarkable track record of collaboration&#xD;
      and improving primary care practice: the MacColl Center for Health Care Innovation and the&#xD;
      Center for Community Health Evaluation at Group Health Research Institute; Qualis Health, the&#xD;
      Health IT Regional Extension Center (REC) and designated Quality Improvement Organization&#xD;
      (QIO) for WA and ID; and the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), along with&#xD;
      state-level partners who are membership organizations for clinicians in small practice&#xD;
      settings. Recruitment will leverage existing small practice relationships between Qualis&#xD;
      Health as the health information technology (IT) REC for WA and ID and ORPRN's existing&#xD;
      network of small practices with a goal of enrolling 320 small practices out of an estimated&#xD;
      1,479 with stage 1 meaningful use of their electronic health record across the three states.&#xD;
      In addition to providing health IT support for the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS)&#xD;
      to measure the ABCS indicators in all practices, our comprehensive approach to building QI&#xD;
      capacity and improving the ABCS measures consists of: 1) practice facilitation as a unifying&#xD;
      strategy, 2) academic detailing/outreach to support implementation of PCOR findings, and 3)&#xD;
      shared learning collaboratives. We will employ an innovative study and evaluation design by&#xD;
      providing two levels of support for each of the latter three practice support components. By&#xD;
      randomly assigning practices to one of eight possible combinations of practice support, we&#xD;
      will &quot;â€¦develop new evidence about the contribution of various components of the comprehensive&#xD;
      approach and the effect of the intensity of the approach on outcomes.&quot; Our rigorous&#xD;
      mixed-method evaluation is based on the RE-AIM framework and will employ multi-level models&#xD;
      and interrupted time series regression. Data will be collected from a control group of&#xD;
      practices to examine secular trends. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Identify, recruit and&#xD;
      conduct baseline assessments in 320 small to medium size primary care practices across the&#xD;
      geographically contiguous region of WA, OR and ID; 2) Provide comprehensive external practice&#xD;
      support to build QI capacity within these practices; 3) Disseminate and support the adoption&#xD;
      of PCOR findings relevant to the ABCS quality measures; 4) Conduct a rigorous evaluation of&#xD;
      the effectiveness of providing external practice support to implement PCOR findings and&#xD;
      improve ABCS measures; and 5) Assess the sustainability of changes made in QI capacity and&#xD;
      ABCS improvements and develop a model of dissemination and primary care practice support&#xD;
      infrastructure.&#xD;
