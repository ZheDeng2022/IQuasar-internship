      This study is a randomized, single-center, cross-over, comparative bioavailability and&#xD;
      adhesion study, comparing single administrations of a new scopolamine transdermal delivery&#xD;
      system formulation to the current established reference transdermal delivery system in&#xD;
      healthy adult participants. The study will consist of an ambulant screening day within 21&#xD;
      days prior to the first investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration at study Day 1&#xD;
      and two treatment periods. Each treatment period will consist of 4.5 days (108 hours) of&#xD;
      in-house confinement.&#xD;
