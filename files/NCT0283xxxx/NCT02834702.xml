      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinew acupuncture is a superficial needling technique with the advantage of minimal pain,&#xD;
      feasible manipulation, and no apparent adverse effects. The proposal aims to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of sinew acupuncture for chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinew acupuncture can reduce pain intensity, and improve neck pain disability and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life without significant side effects for CMNP subjects compared to&#xD;
      a sham acupuncture treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, subject- and assessor-blind, sham acupuncture-controlled clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (N=130) will be randomized into sinew acupuncture or sham acupuncture group (in 1:1&#xD;
      ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instrument:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) and Short Form-36&#xD;
      (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinew acupuncture group will receive five sessions of needling in two weeks. Sham group will&#xD;
      receive the non-invasive treatment with the same procedures. All subjects are followed up for&#xD;
      4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS for neck pain intensity at week 3 serves as the primary outcome. VAS at other time&#xD;
      points, NPQ score and SF-36 at week 1, 2, 3, and 6, and adverse events are analyzed as the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be on the 'intention to treat' principle. T-test and mixed-effect model&#xD;
      analysis will be used to measure primary and secondary outcomes respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five sessions of sinew acupuncture treatment can significantly reduce neck pain intensity,&#xD;
      and improve neck pain disability and quality of life without obvious side effects.&#xD;

    <description>The subject is asked to be on sitting posture. The skin around the needling points is disinfected with a 75% alcohol swap. A tube-guided, sterilized, disposal needle is then inserted (at a small angle to the skin) into the acupoint at 0.5-1 cun (depending on point location and body size of the subject). No needle sensation (deqi sensation) is required. A piece of surgical adhesive tape will be applied to the needle immediately after insertion.</description>

    <description>The procedure in the sham acupuncture group will be as similar to that of the acupuncture group as possible. In the sham acupuncture group, however, a mock plastic needle guiding tube is tapped on the surface of each acupoint (Ashi point and traditional acupoints) to produce some discernible sensation. A piece of adhesive tape is immediately applied to fix the needle on the dermal surface tapped, without needle insertion. In addition, a plastic tube-guided needle is superficially inserted at the sham point at less than 5mm in depth.</description>
