      Long-term transfusion therapy, a supporting treatment for patients with intractable chronic&#xD;
      anemia is currently the most frequent cause of secondary iron overload. Both Aplastic anemia&#xD;
      (AA) and low risk (low and intermediate-1 risk) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are&#xD;
      classified into bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFs) as they have a lot of characters in&#xD;
      common. Iron overload (IOL) can then become a significant problem in regularly transfused&#xD;
      patients, leading to organ damage, particularly in the liver and heart. Iron overload also&#xD;
      has a suppressive effect on erythroid progenitors and may increase transfusion requirements.&#xD;
      In those cases, iron chelation therapy may help to improve their quality of life and prolong&#xD;
      their survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the importance of iron chelation in patients with AA and low and&#xD;
      intermediate-1(int-1) risk MDS complicated with iron overload, it is necessary to monitor&#xD;
      their iron overload status to find the suitable patients to be chelated and follow up the&#xD;
      effectiveness of therapy. Using quantitative Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2* to detect&#xD;
      the iron deposit of different organs has been introduce to China since 5 years ago. Compared&#xD;
      to the traditional methods for evaluating iron overload like clinical manifestations, serum&#xD;
      ferritin (SF) level, transferrin saturation (TS), CT and echocardiography (UCG) etc., which&#xD;
      are widely used so far in China, MRI T2* provides an more accurate, convenient and affordable&#xD;
      non-invasive way of monitoring iron overload. More important, it is very reliable to monitor&#xD;
      the improvement of iron chelation therapy since the variation of MRI detection between&#xD;
      different detections is very low. Few reports have been focused on IOL of MDS and AA in China&#xD;
      so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of liver iron concentration (LIC) by MRI yields similar results to those coming&#xD;
      from liver biopsy analysis, and is a validated tool for detection of iron overload. Data has&#xD;
      been published from a multi-center trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of deferasirox&#xD;
      (DFX) in low and intermediate-1 risk MDS patients with transfusion-dependent IOL and showed&#xD;
      DFX yields sufficient reduction of excess iron indicated by serum ferritin levels and most&#xD;
      importantly by liver MRI. But the median duration of DFX treatment is only 354 days and no&#xD;
      data of Chinese patients was included. Most of the studies for MDS lack data of long term&#xD;
      follow-up and there is scarcely any data on AA so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In China, more and more patients with iron overload can afford adequate iron chelation&#xD;
      therapies, although there are still some patients who cannot afford at all or can only be&#xD;
      chelated irregularly. And some patients can only accept deferoxamine instead of deferasirox&#xD;
      because of the medical insurance policies. It is important to include patients with different&#xD;
      situations and monitor their iron change in their major organs based on different chelation&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is anticipated to evaluate prospectively 80 patients with AA and low or&#xD;
      int-1 risk MDS with IOL, by the traditional methods and MRI T2*. Clinical parameters and&#xD;
      T2*values will be monitored every 12 months for 3 years. Other parameters like clinical&#xD;
      follow-ups ( rate of infection, liver disease, cardiac disorders, endocrine function and&#xD;
      other co-morbidities associated with MDS/AAs, etc.), SF, liver and kidney function, UCG tests&#xD;
      will be monitored as well at the interval of every 6 months. At the end of the study,&#xD;
      patients will be classified as well chelated groups (defined as those received deferasirox&#xD;
      20mg/kg or deferoxamine 40 mg/kg for more than 255 days/year) or poor chelated groups&#xD;
      (defined as those received iron chelation therapy dose less than above) and compared the&#xD;
      differences of their outcome and change of iron status. The investigators aim to give an&#xD;
      overview of IOL of patients with AA and low and int-1 risk MDS and their sequelae under&#xD;
      different chelation treatment. And the investigators also aim to evaluate the relationship of&#xD;
      LIC and T2*/R2*. It is the first and longest prospective clinical trial on AA and low risk&#xD;
      MDS and will give us a better understanding of the value of proper chelation treatment for&#xD;
      the organ function.&#xD;
