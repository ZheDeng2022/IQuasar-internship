      This study will examine how abstinence-induced brain changes contribute to smoking cessation&#xD;
      outcomes in treatment-seeking smokers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden.&#xD;
      Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a&#xD;
      quit attempt. Nicotine replacement therapy, the most widely used pharmacotherapy, yields end&#xD;
      of treatment quit rates of &lt;25% suggesting that managing nicotine withdrawal is not&#xD;
      sufficient. To improve quit rates significantly, a more refined mechanistic understanding is&#xD;
      needed. Neuroimaging can identify mechanisms underlying behavior change beyond self-report&#xD;
      and behavioral measures. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show that brief&#xD;
      (e.g., 24 hr.) abstinence from smoking produces working memory deficits associated with&#xD;
      reduced neural activity in cognitive control circuits and weakened resting state functional&#xD;
      connectivity. Neural reactivity to smoking cues also increases risk of relapse, and&#xD;
      psychological stress can enhance neural responses to smoking cues and increase smoking&#xD;
      intensity. This study will examine how abstinence-induced brain changes contribute to&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in treatment-seeking smokers. Using a validated fMRI abstinence challenge&#xD;
      paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre-treatment fMRI scans:&#xD;
      after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. The investigators will&#xD;
      examine brain responses during performance of tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity,&#xD;
      and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then&#xD;
      set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6 months&#xD;
      to assess time to relapse using a validated smoking relapse protocol.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome will be the number of days to relapse following the target quit date. Relapse will be confirmed using a conventional SRNT guideline criterion of either a positive biochemical verification of smoking or 7 consecutive days of smoking based on self-report (it is very unlikely that a subject would meet the latter criterion without also meeting the former, given the long half-life of cotinine). The days to relapse will be based upon time from target quit date to the first day of the relapse period. Self-reported daily smoking data will be collected using a validated timeline follow-back method. Self-reported abstinence will be biochemically verified on a weekly basis using urine cotinine (&lt;100ng/ml) and a CO reading of â‰¤5PPM. Drop-outs will be considered relapsers following the last date of abstinence data provided.</description>

    <description>Participants will discuss reasons for quitting, the model of smoking as a learned habit, triggers for smoking, and trigger management; receive brief training in how to manage withdrawal symptoms and relapse prevention counseling and receive the NCI Clearing the Air self-help smoking cessation booklet. The target quit date (TQD) session will be scheduled to occur up to 2 weeks following the pre-quit session. Participants will then meet with a smoking cessation counselor for a 15 minute booster counseling session. During the first week following TQD there will be two monitoring visits to closely monitor abstinence. Weekly thereafter for four weeks, participants will attend a brief booster counseling session.</description>
