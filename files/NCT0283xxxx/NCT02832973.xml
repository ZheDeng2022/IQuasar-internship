      A randomized clinical trial comparing sequential nephron blockage (SNB) with dual blockade of&#xD;
      the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) plus bisoprolol (DBB) in the treatment of resistant&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (RH) was designed to investigate the importance of the SNB and the&#xD;
      contribution of its volume component versus DBB and the importance of the serum renin in&#xD;
      maintaining BP levels. This randomized trial with two treatment arms could help tailor&#xD;
      therapy by identifying a more effective choice to control hypertension whether by acting on&#xD;
      the control of volume or sodium balance, or by acting on the effects of the RAAS on the&#xD;
      kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods - Participants: 80 patients undergoing treatment for RH with losartan (100-200 mg),&#xD;
      chlorthalidone (25 mg), and amlodipine (5 mg) will be randomly divided into two groups after&#xD;
      applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Sequential nephron blockade (SNB Group) n = 40 Group 2: Dual blockade of the RAAS&#xD;
      plus bisoprolol (DBB Group) n = 40 Intervention: SNB consists in a progressive increase in&#xD;
      sodium depletion. After the administration of a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone) and&#xD;
      aldosterone receptor blocker, low doses of furosemide are administered and subsequently&#xD;
      amiloride is prescribed to enhance the natriuretic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dual blockade of the RAAS plus bisoprolol is used to increase the effect of angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor 1 blockers (ARBs). Therapy then requires sequentially adding an angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to reduce the levels of angiotensin (Ang) II resulting from&#xD;
      blockage of the Ang II receptor and then to administer a beta-blocker to decrease the&#xD;
      elevated renin secretion due to both the ACE inhibitors and ARBs Objective: This study, which&#xD;
      compares two antihypertensive treatment regimens in patients with RH, has the following&#xD;
      objectives: to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of SNB against DBB in RH patients, and to&#xD;
      assess the side effects and adherence to treatment over 20 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: The eligibility criteria will follow those shown in the flowchart for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of RH of the First Brazilian Position on RH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if they have: chronic renal failure, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation/atrioventricular block, contraindication to the drugs that will be used, refusal&#xD;
      or failure to follow the regimen and secondary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patients will be analyzed in five visits at intervals of 28 days for 20 weeks&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistant hypertension (RH) is characterized when the blood pressure (BP) remains above the&#xD;
      recommended goal after taking three antihypertensive drugs with synergistic actions, at their&#xD;
      maximum recommended tolerated doses for at least six months; one preferably should be a&#xD;
      diuretic. True RH should be differentiated from pseudo resistance, which occurs due to&#xD;
      non-adherence to treatment, inadequate BP measurements, inadequate doses of medications,&#xD;
      inappropriate therapeutic regimens, or the presence of the so-called white-coat effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact prevalence of RH is unknown. In controlled randomized studies with thousands of&#xD;
      hypertensive patients, approximately 25% to 30% of participants did not achieve the BP goal&#xD;
      recommended by guidelines despite receiving three or more antihypertensive drugs; these&#xD;
      studies included careful assessments of adherence to therapy and even ambulatory BP&#xD;
      monitoring (ABPM), which excludes patients with pseudo resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational data from the North American National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&#xD;
      (NHANES) collected in 2003-2008 showed that the prevalence of RH among adults diagnosed with&#xD;
      hypertension (HTN) in this period was 8.9% and among adults on antihypertensive treatment, it&#xD;
      was 12.8%. Similarly, a large population study in Spain (68,000 patients) found that the&#xD;
      prevalence of RH was 14.8% among those treated for HTN. Based on these recent studies, it is&#xD;
      justifiable to say that the prevalence of RH is about 14%. RH is a difficult-to-manage&#xD;
      clinical condition due to failure of patients to adhere to treatment, the physician's&#xD;
      difficulty to adjust the medication because of genetic factors that hinder the effectiveness&#xD;
      of treatment and medical inertia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology of resistant hypertension: The mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      RH are the vascular smooth muscle tone and increased blood volume, intensification of the&#xD;
      activity of the sympathetic system and hyperactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
      system (RAAS). Increased sensitivity to sodium appears to be the main factor in understanding&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of this syndrome, not only as it incorporates the above mechanisms, but&#xD;
      also as it explains, in part, the variability of therapeutic response of patients with RH.&#xD;
      The RAAS is vital to the regulatory system that controls total body sodium as are atrial&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide factors and pressure receptors in the atria and kidney. Sodium and water&#xD;
      retention can lead to resistance against antihypertensive drugs. Under the physiological&#xD;
      point of view, BP is maintained by continuous regulation of cardiac output and peripheral&#xD;
      vascular resistance exerted at three anatomic sites: arterioles, postcapillary venules&#xD;
      (capacitance vessels) and the heart. A fourth anatomical site of control, the kidney,&#xD;
      contributes to the maintenance of BP by regulating intravascular volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, identifying the contribution of volume and serum renin in maintaining BP levels could&#xD;
      help tailor treatment with a more effective choice for hypertension control, whether by&#xD;
      acting on the control of volume or sodium balance, or by acting on the effects of the RAAS on&#xD;
      the kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential nephron blockade consists in a progressive increase in sodium depletion. After the&#xD;
      administration of a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone) and aldosterone receptor blocker, low&#xD;
      doses of furosemide are administered and subsequently amiloride is prescribed to enhance the&#xD;
      natriuretic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blockade of the RAAS is to increase the effect of the angiotensin receptor 1 blockers&#xD;
      (ARBs). Therapy then requires sequentially adding an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)&#xD;
      inhibitor to reduce the levels of angiotensin (Ang) II resulting from the blockage of the Ang&#xD;
      II receptor and then to administer a beta-blocker to decrease the elevated renin secretion&#xD;
      due to both the ACE inhibitors and ARBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following research questions will be explored: Do sequential nephron blockade (SNB) and&#xD;
      dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plus bisoprolol (DBB) constitute&#xD;
      good therapeutic options in the reduction of peripheral blood pressure of patients with RH?&#xD;
      Which therapeutic option is able to reduce the central BP of resistant hypertensive patients?&#xD;
      Is the strategy of SNB as good as DBB? Objectives: This study will compare two&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatment regimens in RH patients of the Medical School in Sao Jose do Rio&#xD;
      Preto. It aims to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of SNB against DBB in RH patients, and&#xD;
      to assess the side effects, and adherence to therapy over 20 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized clinical trial with two therapeutic regimens for RH, SNB and DBB, will be&#xD;
      compared in an open-label prospective study at the Medical School in Sao Jose do Rio Preto.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty patients undergoing treatment for RH with losartan (100-200 mg), chlorthalidone (25&#xD;
      mg), and amlodipine (5 mg) will be randomly divided into two groups after applying inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Sequential nephron blockade (SNB Group) - 40 patients will receive in addition to&#xD;
      the basal therapy, spironolactone (25 mg), spironolactone 25 mg plus furosemide (20 mg),&#xD;
      spironolactone (25 mg) plus furosemide (40 mg) and spironolactone (25 mg) plus furosemide (40&#xD;
      mg) plus amiloride (5 mg), sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plus bisoprolol (DBB&#xD;
      Group) - 40 patients will receive, in addition to the basal therapy, ramipril (5 mg),&#xD;
      ramipril (10 mg), ramipril (10 mg) plus bisoprolol (5 mg) and ramipril (10 mg) plus&#xD;
      bisoprolol (10 mg), sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients fulfilling the following criteria will be enrolled in each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital de Base of the Medical&#xD;
      School in São José do Rio Preto (FAMERP) and Brazilian Research Ethics Committee (#&#xD;
      33943014.6.0000.5415).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of the study was carefully explained to patients and all individuals, after&#xD;
      agreeing to participate in the study, signed informed consent forms and filled out a standard&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of BP including 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM): The BP will be measured by&#xD;
      the indirect method, following the VI Brazilian Guidelines for the Treatment of Hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABPM and home BP measurement will be carried out as additional tools to investigate&#xD;
      hypertension according to the technical norms of the 5th Brazilian Guidelines on Ambulatory&#xD;
      Blood Pressure Monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABPM will be performed using the Mobil-O-Graph (Netherlands). Anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      (Weight and height), measured by anthropometric scales, will be used to calculate the body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) utilizing the formula BMI = weight (kg)/height squared (m²). The abdominal&#xD;
      circumference will be measured at the midpoint between the iliac crest and the lower costal&#xD;
      margin. Values equal to or below 80 cm and 94 cm are considered appropriate for women and for&#xD;
      men, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical tests and imaging: Blood samples will be drawn from all patients at the first and&#xD;
      last visits after fasting for 12 hours to measure total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, glucose, insulin, creatinine, sodium and potassium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be submitted to electrocardiography, echocardiography, carotid Doppler,&#xD;
      ultrasound with Doppler of the renal arteries, stress testing and radial artery applanation&#xD;
      tonometry (AT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be analyzed in five visits at 28-day intervals. V zero: Week -4 to Week 0. All&#xD;
      patients will remain under treatment with losartan (100 - 200 mg), chlorthalidone (25 mg),&#xD;
      and amlodipine (5 mg). Individuals with BP &gt; 135/85 mmHg by ABPM will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V1: Week 0 to Week 4. Individuals receive 25 mg of spironolactone (SNB Group) or 5 mg of&#xD;
      ramipril (DBB Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V2: Week 4 to Week 8. Individuals with BP &lt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will continue using the same&#xD;
      regimen. Subjects with BP &gt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will receive in addition to their existing&#xD;
      regimen, furosemide (20 mg) for the SNB Group and ramipril (10 mg) for the DBB Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V3: Week 8 to Week 12. Subjects with BP &lt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will continue on the same&#xD;
      regimen. Individuals with BP &gt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will receive an extra 40 mg of furosemide&#xD;
      for patients in the SNB Group and 5 mg of bisoprolol for patients in the DBB Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V4: Week 12 to Week 16. Subjects with BP &lt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will continue using the same&#xD;
      regimen. Individuals with BP &gt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will receive an extra 5 mg of amiloride for&#xD;
      patients in the SNB Group and 10 mg of bisoprolol for patients in the DBB Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V5: Week 16 to Week 20. Subjects will continue using the same regimen. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn from all patients. Radial artery applanation tonometry and ABPM will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The t-test or Wilcoxon test for quantitative variables and chi-square&#xD;
      and Fisher test for qualitative variables were used in the comparative analysis of the&#xD;
      clinical characteristics of RHTN patients. Data were expressed as means ± 1 standard&#xD;
      deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated at 72 individuals for an expected zero difference with a SD of&#xD;
      12 mmHg to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the strategy of SNB compared to RASDB plus&#xD;
      bisoprolol assuming an absolute difference of ≤ 5 mmHg for systolic BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inferiority was evaluated for a one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) estimated by a&#xD;
      linear mixed model for repeated measures. P-values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean BP and pulse pressure after 20 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with sequential nephron blockade compared to dual blockade of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plus bisoprolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability, biochemical changes, evaluation of the renal function and&#xD;
      recognition of hypotension (ABPM). Assessment of BP outcomes (mean of three measurements by&#xD;
      an automatic electronic device - Omron 711) and hemodynamic parameters (Omron 9000 device)&#xD;
      will be measured in the office at all follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing or dropout Participants: Patients will be registered with a phone number and address&#xD;
      for further contact in case of missing visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation of the sample size with an alpha error of 5%, statistical power of 80%,&#xD;
      standard deviation of 8 mmHg, and maximum acceptable absolute difference of 6 mmHg (diastolic&#xD;
      BP), indicated the necessity to study 36 patients per group (SNB versus DBB). However,&#xD;
      considering a potential rate of 10-15% dropout or loss to follow-up, 40 will be considered&#xD;
      for each group. The difference of 5 mmHg (diastolic BP) has been achieved, on average, in&#xD;
      clinical trials that have demonstrated the advantage of one drug over placebo or other&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatments in the prevention of major cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No washout period will be used. Results Baseline clinical characteristics and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters of the 72 patients with primary resistant hypertension randomized to SNB (n=35) or&#xD;
      RASDB (n=37) were similar across both study groups. At the end of the study, a significant&#xD;
      reduction of the office pressure was observed (SBP and DBP) in both after intervention groups&#xD;
      SNB group: initial SBP: 174.5 ± 21.08; final SBP: 127.0 ± 14.74; Initial DBP: 105.3 ± 15.5,&#xD;
      final DBP: 78.11 ± 9.28 (p &lt;0.0001), RASDB group: initial SBP: 178.4 ± 21.08, final SBP:&#xD;
      134.4 ± 23.25, initial DBP: 102.7 ± 11.07, final DBP: 77.33 ± 13.75 (p &lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central systolic pressure had a greater reduction in the SNB group (p &lt;0.005). ABPM had a&#xD;
      significant reduction of SBP and DBP in both groups (SNB group p &lt;0.0001 for SBP and DBP&#xD;
      before x after intervention, RASDB group p &lt;0.0001 for SBP and DBP before x after&#xD;
      intervention). No discontinuation due to drug-related adverse events in both study groups.&#xD;
