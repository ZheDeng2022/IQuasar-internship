    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB033-B&#xD;
      and to compare the PK profile with that of BIIB033-A in healthy volunteers. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are: To assess the safety and tolerability of BIIB033-A and BIIB033-B; To assess&#xD;
      the secondary PK parameters of BIIB033-A and BIIB033-B; To assess the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      BIIB033-A and BIIB033-B.&#xD;

             -1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  - Serious infection (e.g., pneumonia, septicemia) as determined by the Investigator,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  - History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions, or history of any allergic&#xD;
             reaction that in the opinion of the Investigator is likely to be exacerbated by any&#xD;
             component of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  - Prior exposure to BIIB033.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  - Female participants who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Day -1, or&#xD;
             plan to become pregnant during the study or during the 6 months following study drug&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  - History of, or positive test result at Screening for, human immunodeficiency virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  - History of, or positive test result at Screening for, hepatitis C virus antibody or&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (defined as positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis B&#xD;
             core antibody).&#xD;
