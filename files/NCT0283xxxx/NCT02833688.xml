  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether dexmedetomidine reduce liver injury after hepatectomy. During&#xD;
      hepatectomy, surgeons always took inflow occlusion to reduce blood loss with Pringle&#xD;
      maneuver. A few clinical studies had shown dexmedetomidine could reduce ischaemia/reperfusion&#xD;
      (IR) injury caused by the secretion of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
      Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was a sensitive and specific marker for hepatic injury in&#xD;
      several studies before. So the investigator decided to use it as the primary endpoint.&#xD;
      Besides, in our center, there are some liver resection surgeries that didn't need occlusion.&#xD;
      So it can serve the best placebo for determine the the actual effect of dexmedetomidine on&#xD;
      the IR injury in further subgroup analysis.&#xD;

      The purpose of our study is to compare liver injury with dexmedetomidine. The enrolled&#xD;
      patients were randomized into two group. In the study group, dexmedetomidine, diluted in 0.9%&#xD;
      sodium chloride with the concentration of 4 ug ml-1 is administered with an loading dose of&#xD;
      0.5ug kg-1 of 10 min, and maintained with infusion rate of 0.5 ug kg-1 h-1. While, 0.9%&#xD;
      sodium chloride serves as the placebo with the same loading dose and infusion rate in the&#xD;
      control group. The infusion is ceased after the resection of the hepatic issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GST is a sensitive and specific marker for hepatic injury in several studies before and is&#xD;
      taken as the primary endpoint. And the investigator use other inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      reflecting the systemic inflammatory response in serum. Besides these, the investigator&#xD;
      observe the hemodynamic changes during the operation time and complications related with&#xD;
      anesthesia and surgery.&#xD;
