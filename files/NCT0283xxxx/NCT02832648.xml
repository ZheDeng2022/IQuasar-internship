  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to determine whether selenium supplements improve bone and muscle health&#xD;
      in older women at risk of osteoporosis (low bone density or weak bones) and fracture (broken&#xD;
      bones).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is a major public health problem. One in two women and one in five men over age&#xD;
      50 will have a fracture. Fractures cause pain, disability and reduce life-expectancy. Women&#xD;
      with below-average bone density around the time of the menopause might have previously taken&#xD;
      hormone replacement (HRT) to prevent osteoporosis, but HRT is much less used now due to side&#xD;
      effects. Therefore there is a need for safe, effective and inexpensive preventative&#xD;
      interventions for women at risk of osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selenium is a chemical nutrient present in several human proteins, including anti-oxidants.&#xD;
      Anti-oxidants may protect against ageing of tissues, including bone, by mopping up damaging&#xD;
      reactive oxygen molecules (sometimes called 'free radicals'). Selenium is present in soil,&#xD;
      and so is obtained from many foods. However, soil selenium levels are low in Europe, and&#xD;
      dietary intake in the UK is below recommended levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously found that women with higher blood selenium levels have stronger bones, but&#xD;
      this doesn't prove that giving selenium will improve bone strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomised controlled trial to compare selenium supplements with&#xD;
      a placebo (dummy treatment) in women with below-average bone density. The investigators will&#xD;
      give selenium (at two different doses) or placebo to 120 women for six months and use blood&#xD;
      and urine tests and bone density scans to see if giving selenium does have any effect on&#xD;
      bone. The investigators will also do muscle function tests and measurements of free radical&#xD;
      molecules.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial. We will evaluate two doses of&#xD;
      selenium (50 and 200mcg) vs placebo over six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis (T-score -1.0 to -3.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include participants with any baseline serum selenium concentration&#xD;
      for generalisability, but the primary endpoint efficacy analysis will only include women with&#xD;
      baseline serum selenium below 120 mcg/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX/Cr). Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
      other bone turnover markers, BMD, muscle function, thyroid function, blood glucose,&#xD;
      anti-oxidant activity, inflammatory markers The investigators will make the primary analysis&#xD;
      based on women with baseline serum selenium below 120 mcg/l. To ensure adequate power for&#xD;
      this analysis we will plan to recruit 120 women (we expect that 100 of the 120 will have&#xD;
      serum selenium below 120 mcg/l based on our previous cross-sectional study). The&#xD;
      investigators will review the baseline serum selenium results when 40 women have been&#xD;
      recruited to confirm the expected distribution of baseline levels, and we will adjust the&#xD;
      total recruitment number accordingly to ensure at least 99 women with serum selenium below&#xD;
      120mcg/l have been randomised for the final primary endpoint intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised according to a schedule produced by Sheffield Teaching&#xD;
      Hospitals pharmacy according to their standard operating procedure. Randomisation will be&#xD;
      carried out independently of the study investigators using block randomisation. The blind&#xD;
      will only be broken if judged by the PI as clinically necessary for the wellbeing of a&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may be stopped early if the investigators, sponsor or DMEC identify a safety&#xD;
      concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial management will be done by the Academic Unit of Bone Metabolism CTIMP group (who meet&#xD;
      monthly), and progress reported to the AUBM management group and Lay Panel. We will establish&#xD;
      a TSC and DMEC.&#xD;
