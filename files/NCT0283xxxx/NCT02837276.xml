      This pilot study aims at investigating the relationship between intermittent hypoxemia (IH)&#xD;
      and acute kidney injury (AKI) in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Test the hypothesis that intermittent hypoxemia is associated kidney injury in preterm&#xD;
      infants, as reflected by a rise in serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that there is rise in acute kidney injury urinary biomarkers with&#xD;
      increased intermittent hypoxemia.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm birth is a major health care concern and although survival of premature infants has&#xD;
      improved, the incidence of neonatal morbidities has slightly decreased especially in cases of&#xD;
      extreme prematurity. Apnea of prematurity (immature respiratory control) is a major&#xD;
      complication in Neonatal Intensive Care Units occurring in virtually all infants born before&#xD;
      28 weeks gestation. Intermittent Hypoxemia (IH), episodic oxygen desaturation events, is&#xD;
      generally attributed to apnea of prematurity often superimposed upon suboptimal lung&#xD;
      function. Intermittent hypoxemia events are common in preterm infants and may lead to both&#xD;
      short-term and long-term morbidities. Typically, the incidence of intermittent hypoxemia (IH)&#xD;
      increases over the first 4 weeks of life before plateauing at weeks 6-8. In addition to&#xD;
      inducing oxidative stress by increasing production of reactive oxygen species, this&#xD;
      hypoxemia/reoxygenation cycle is thought to induce a pro-inflammatory cascade of&#xD;
      transcription factors that promotes activation of inflammatory cells resulting in multisystem&#xD;
      morbidity. These morbidities include retinopathy of prematurity, cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      instability, and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. A potential morbidity that has yet to be&#xD;
      investigated is acute kidney injury (AKI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AKI is associated with morbidity and mortality in critically ill neonates. The risk of AKI is&#xD;
      higher in very low birth weight infants requiring assisted ventilation and ionotropic&#xD;
      support, and in infants with congenital heart disease. Additionally, AKI occurs more&#xD;
      frequently in infants who suffered severe birth asphyxia. While it has been established that&#xD;
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is associated with worsening sleep apnea in adults, it has&#xD;
      been proposed that sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxemia may contribute to kidney injury, the&#xD;
      development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the progression to kidney failure. Proposed&#xD;
      mechanisms of kidney disease via intermittent nocturnal hypoxemia include 1: direct&#xD;
      intrarenal hypoxemia (resulting in tubulointerstitial injury) 2: an increase in oxidative&#xD;
      stress, inflammatory cytokines, and systemic blood pressure (via activation of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system). Hence It is plausible that IH may modulate AKI in preterm&#xD;
      neonates. The investigators goal is to test the hypothesis that intermittent hypoxemia is&#xD;
      associated with Acute Kidney Injury in preterm infants. Investigation of relationship between&#xD;
      IH and AKI may provide further insight into onset and prevention given the recent&#xD;
      advancements in the detection and characterization of AKI in this vulnerable population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Test the hypothesis that intermittent hypoxemia is associated kidney injury in preterm&#xD;
      infants, as reflected by a rise in serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH: Premature infants with GA 23 to 31 weeks will be prospectively recruited from&#xD;
      Kentucky Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). High resolution oxygen&#xD;
      saturation monitoring will be performed for the first 2 months of life. Creatinine levels&#xD;
      will be collected as they are obtained routinely on premature infants in the NICU.&#xD;
      Demographic data will be collected including gestational age, postnatal age, gender and race.&#xD;
      Clinical data including respiratory support, caffeine use, vital signs and neonatal&#xD;
      morbidities will be documented. Scores to predict severity of disease and mortality in&#xD;
      newborns will be used. The investigators will assess the cumulative effect of IH on AKI as&#xD;
      reflected by serum creatinine measurements at 1 month, 2 months, and discharge in extremely&#xD;
      preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that there is rise in acute kidney injury urinary biomarkers with&#xD;
      increased intermittent hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH: Similar to Aim 1, premature infants with GA 23 to 31 weeks will be prospectively&#xD;
      recruited from Kentucky Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). High&#xD;
      resolution oxygen saturation monitoring will be performed for the first 2 months of life.&#xD;
      Urine will be collected daily in the first week of life and then weekly until 2 months of age&#xD;
      and hospital discharge. Collecting urine is noninvasive and minimal risk. Samples will be&#xD;
      de-identified and stored in the investigators research laboratory. Standardized kits to&#xD;
      measure biomarkers associated with kidney injury such as albumin, β2-microglobulin (β2MG),&#xD;
      cystatin C (Cys C), epidermal growth factor (EGF), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin&#xD;
      (NGAL), osteopontin (OPN), and uromodulin (UMOD) will be used. Since IH increases with age&#xD;
      and persists during NICU stay, the cumulative effect of intermittent hypoxemia will be&#xD;
      correlated with biomarker concentrations weekly throughout the study period and at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen saturation will be continuously monitored upon admission with high resolution pulse&#xD;
      oximeters, with 2 second averaging time and 1Hz sampling rate. Novel software will be&#xD;
      utilized to analyze raw data per the following definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intermittent Hypoxemia is primarily defined as a drop in oxygen saturation (SpO2) to&#xD;
           less than 80% for more than 4 seconds and less than 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary measures for IH include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A drop in SpO2 of &lt;85% for &gt;4 seconds and &lt;3 minutes duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A decline in SpO2 by &gt;4% from baseline to &lt;90% that lasted &gt;4 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Percent time spent below above threshold, includes sustained hypoxemia (&gt;3min duration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number of hyperoxemic events defined as an increase in SpO2 of &gt;95%&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Duration and nadir of each oxygen desaturation and hyperoxemic event&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Mean SpO2/day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: There is no data available in the literature to calculate sample size. Based on&#xD;
      NICU census, consent success rate, and accounting for data loss, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit a total of 50 patients for this pilot project. To maintain a balanced sample, the&#xD;
      investigators will stratify enrollment by gestational age targeting 15-18 subjects in each of&#xD;
      the following groups: 23-25 weeks gestation, 26-28 weeks gestation, 29-31 weeks gestation.&#xD;
