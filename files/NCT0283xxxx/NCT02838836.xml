      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with resectable solid primary cancers and even limited number of metastases are&#xD;
      potentially curable. However, most patients develop recurrences despite surgery. Circulating&#xD;
      and disseminated tumor cell (CTC/DTC) and circulating cell-free (cf) DNA isolation from the&#xD;
      blood, urine and bone marrow will increase understanding of cancer spread and advance&#xD;
      knowledge to develop individualized therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTCs/DTCs and cfDNA isolated from the blood, urine and bone marrow during cancer surgeries&#xD;
      undergo pheno- and/or genotype changes. CTCs/DTCs have potential for dissemination and tumor&#xD;
      growth in vivo. Investigating the biology of liquid biomarkers in the blood, urine and bone&#xD;
      marrow will significantly increase understanding of cancer biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTCs/DTCs and cfDNA isolated from cancer patients will be characterized for genetic&#xD;
      alterations and expression of key signaling/proliferation biomarkers and grow in vivo in nude&#xD;
      mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients undergoing solid cancer surgeries will be recruited for perioperative&#xD;
      CTC/DTC/cfDNA isolation from the blood, urine and bone marrow with innovative techniques. In&#xD;
      addition, 20 patients undergoing similar surgeries for benign disease will also be included&#xD;
      as controls. CTCs/DTCs, cfDNA and cancer tissue pheno- and/or genotype analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with different innovative techniques. Furthermore, CTCs/DTCs will be enriched,&#xD;
      cultured and characterized. Tumor growth potential will be studied in nude mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This translational cancer trial addresses fundamental aspects of cancer disease being the&#xD;
      cause of death in 1 out of 4 persons in the US. Innovative CTCs/DTCs characterization can&#xD;
      shed light on the tumor biology, and identify therapy targets. Results of this study can be&#xD;
      fundamentally important to understanding cancer spread and development of personalized&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;

        Subjects with the diagnosis of a solid cancer of all stages will be included (lung,&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects older than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects of all genders and ethnicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with the diagnosis of a solid cancer (n=100) of all stages will be included&#xD;
             (lung, esophageal, stomach, bile duct/pancreas, colorectal, melanoma, sarcoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ten patients with no present suspicion and no previous history of any cancer (except&#xD;

             will serve as controls (n=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients undergoing surgery for cancer the histopathology should preferably be&#xD;
             pathologically proven by a previous or novel biopsy. Yet, patients with a high cancer&#xD;
             suspicion by radiology and clinical picture that undergo cancer surgery will not be&#xD;
             excluded. No additional biopsies, testing or interventions will be performed for the&#xD;
             purpose of this study if the medical treatment will not require it.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be capable of giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with the concurrent diagnosis of an active secondary (synchronous) malignancy&#xD;
             besides basal cell carcinoma of the skin will be excluded, if there is evidence of&#xD;
             disease burden or if the patient is currently being treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a hemoglobin of &lt;8g/dl in the morning of the procedure will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In subjects who require intraoperative transfusions of &gt;4 units of red packed blood&#xD;
             cells (RPBCs), no further blood will be drawn for CTC/DTC/cfDNA analysis during&#xD;
             surgery or on postoperative day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with coagulation disorders that could lead to significant bleeding (such&#xD;
             as hemophilia, significant thrombocytopenia) requiring prophylactic administration of&#xD;
             coagulative products, no bone marrow aspiration will be performed.&#xD;
