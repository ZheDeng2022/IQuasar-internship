  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been discovered in laboratory animal&#xD;
      models. The objective of this study is to find whether similar markers are detectable in the&#xD;
      body fluids of human subjects that have sustained a TBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Staff of the Neurosurgical ward is asked to report to the study coordinator all patients who&#xD;
      are hospitalized due to a suspected brain injury. After an informed consent is received, the&#xD;
      patient has been enrolled in the study and sample collection can be started. Plasma samples&#xD;
      are taken by the TYKSlab personnel, and the other samples by the nurses in the Neurosurgical&#xD;
      ward. The sampling will be organized so that all the samples from a patient are preferably&#xD;
      collected at one event. Samples will stored in the TYKSlab at the temperature of -70 Â°C.&#xD;
      Collection of a sufficient number of samples (patients) will take a few months, and&#xD;
      subsequent analysis by the Sponsor a few months. All the activities will be done during the&#xD;
      years 2016 to 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the samples of 24 subjects have been collected, they will be transferred to the Sponsor&#xD;
      who will ship them further to the sub-contractors. The results received from the research&#xD;
      laboratories will be evaluated by the scientist team at Medicortex Finland Oy. The results&#xD;
      will be published in a scientific journal, when considered to be of high enough quality and&#xD;
      impact.&#xD;

Different lectin bound complexes will be studied in body fluid samples collected from the patients (the trial is not following the patients nor is it intended to evaluate clinical outcome).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is hospitalized because of a head trauma and suspected TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or above. The subject (including the control subjects) must be an independent&#xD;
             adult who is not under guardianship.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient, or the next of kin in the case of an incompetent person, has signed the&#xD;
             Informed consent. This concerns the control subjects, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The samples can be collected during regular office hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient needs lumbar puncture for treatment reasons. This is not a limiting&#xD;
             criterion however. If it is difficult to find an adequate number of patients for&#xD;
             lumbar puncture, CSF samples of some patients can be omitted after the study&#xD;
             coordinator's consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has been found positive for HIV or hepatitis-B in the involved laboratory&#xD;
             studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a chronic mental disorder which is mentioned on the sickness insurance&#xD;
             card.&#xD;
