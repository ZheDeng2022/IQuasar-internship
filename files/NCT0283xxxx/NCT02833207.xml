      The growing population of obese adults is predicted to create a large public health burden in&#xD;
      the next few decades. This study examines function of small blood vessels providing blood&#xD;
      flow to skeletal muscles, to test if younger obese individuals (≤40 years old, BMI &gt;30) are&#xD;
      already displaying reductions in blood vessel function. This study will test if the signals&#xD;
      blood vessels use to increase blood flow are changing in these same subjects. Findings from&#xD;
      this study may help create treatments to delay or prevent some of the negative effects of&#xD;
      obesity on vascular health.&#xD;

      This study initially started in June 2011(IND 122211). The original Aim 1 was completed and&#xD;
      showed lean and obese groups did not differ in endothelial dependent dilation (EDD) and&#xD;
      exercise dilation responses. The original Aim 2 was contingent upon there being a difference&#xD;
      between lean and obese groups in Aim 1 and therefore was not pursued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now plan to continue this study by assessing 2 additional aims that are&#xD;
      consistent with the original purpose of the study and are discussed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growing population of obese adults is predicted to create a large public health burden in&#xD;
      the next few decades. Obese humans also exhibit reduced exercise capacity and lower muscle&#xD;
      blood flow. The overall goal of this research program is to investigate the obesity-related&#xD;
      changes in microvascular function contributing to impaired muscle blood flow. This proposal&#xD;
      seeks to directly test vascular control in human skeletal muscle resistance arteries in&#xD;
      exercising humans. The investigators propose to study younger obese adults, without&#xD;
      confounding effects of age, metabolic syndrome, or diabetes-before the negative effects of&#xD;
      obesity can exert their full negative impact. The general hypothesis is that endothelium&#xD;
      dependent dilation (EDD) and functional (exercise) vasodilation is impaired via shift away&#xD;
      from nitric oxide bioavailability and a shift toward increased reliance on potassium (K+)&#xD;
      mediated vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To determine whether role of K+ mediated vasodilation differs between lean&#xD;
      and obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that obesity induces an endothelial phenotype change that&#xD;
      creates an environment for both EDD and exercise dysfunction. The investigators propose that&#xD;
      obesity alters endothelial enzymes, which help explain the mechanistic changes in&#xD;
      vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that obesity elicits altered endothelial-dependent (EDD) and&#xD;
      functional vasodilation due to altered functional potassium channel signaling. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that potassium (K+) channel function accounts for unexplained&#xD;
      differences in EDD and functional vasodilation. More specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that inhibition of K+ mediated hyperpolarization (Inward Rectifying K+&#xD;
      channels-KIR) will identify differential vasodilator mechanisms between lean and obese&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Overview of Procedures This study is designed to test cardiovascular control&#xD;
      in clinically healthy humans. There will be 2 separate, scientifically distinct experimental&#xD;
      trials that will be conducted in lean and obese subject: 1) EDD or 2) Rapid Onset Vasodilator&#xD;
      (ROV), which studies the immediate increase in blood flow at the onset of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common procedures between protocols: After screening to determine eligibility, subjects visit&#xD;
      the lab for either EDD or Rapid Onset Vasodilator (ROV) study visit. All pre-screening and&#xD;
      pre-visit procedures will be identical. A physician will place a brachial arterial catheter&#xD;
      in the non-dominant arm for local drug infusion. Changes in blood flow will be quantified by&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound at the brachial artery. Monitoring of subject hemodynamics (Heart Rate,&#xD;
      Blood Pressure, blood oxygen) is identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EDD experiments: EDD agonists are drugs than cause vasodilation to increase blood flow&#xD;
      temporarily. The investigators will use 4 different agonists to test EDD function from&#xD;
      several perspectives. After control EDD agonist infusions, subjects will repeat EDD agonists&#xD;
      under conditions of K+ channel inhibition, and again under K+ channels plus nitric oxide and&#xD;
      prostaglandin inhibition. This last phase of the study is aimed at testing acute&#xD;
      compensatory/redundant vasodilator mechanisms. These trials will involve infusion of&#xD;
      endothelial agonists, with and without inhibition of specific vasodilatory mechanisms.&#xD;
      Agonists include: ATP, Bradykinin (BK), Isoproterenol (ISO), and Acetylcholine (Ach), will be&#xD;
      infused 3 times each (order randomized). Agonists will be infused under the following&#xD;
      conditions: 1) Alone (control) 2) in combination with Barium Chloride (BaCl2) 3) in&#xD;
      combination with BaCl2, L-N-monomethyl Arginine Acetate (L-NMMA), and Ketorolac. EDD agonists&#xD;
      each cause a temporary increase in forearm blood flow, which returns to baseline within&#xD;
      minutes after infusion has stopped. Antagonists (BaCl2, L-NMMA and ketorolac) will likely&#xD;
      reduce EDD responses to agonists, and may also reduce resting forearm blood flow or increase&#xD;
      blood pressure (e.g. L-NMMA may decrease forearm blood flow 30-50% an increase BP 5-10 mmHg).&#xD;
      The entire EDD study visit will be ~5 hours (1 hour setup and 4 hours experimental&#xD;
      procedures). The EDD protocol is further described here:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs (IND approval) are used to test basic science vascular function &amp; associated mechanisms&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers. Drugs not used to improve a health condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs: acetylcholine, isoproterenol, bradykinin, adenosine triphosphate, barium chloride,&#xD;
      L-N-monomethyl Arginine Acetate, ketorolac.&#xD;

      ROV experiments: After control single forearm muscle contractions, subjects will repeat&#xD;
      single contractions under conditions of K+ channel inhibition, and again under K+ channel&#xD;
      plus nitric oxide and prostaglandin inhibition. This last phase of the study is aimed at&#xD;
      testing acute compensatory/redundant vasodilator mechanisms. This trial consists of three&#xD;
      sets of 6 singular muscle contractions (three at 30%, three at 60% of maximal effort), each&#xD;
      contraction lasting less than 3 seconds with ~90s rest in between. These single contractions&#xD;
      evoke a robust (100-600% increase) and rapid (3-6 heart beats post contraction) increase in&#xD;
      blood flow that returns to normal typically in about 30 seconds. This rapid and robust&#xD;
      response is why these single muscle contractions are termed &quot;Rapid Onset Vasodilation&quot;. 3&#xD;
      minutes of rest before each trial will allow for baseline measurements and loading of&#xD;
      inhibitors of K+ mediated vasodilation. During this 3 min, subjects will perform a single&#xD;
      contraction at 15, 30, and 45s of the 3-min loading/resting period to facilitate delivery of&#xD;
      the drug to the active tissues (this adds an additional 18 contractions. The first&#xD;
      experimental set of single contractions will be completed without drugs (saline control).&#xD;
      Next, an ATP infusion (no exercise) will also be used to test the pharmacological efficacy of&#xD;
      subsequent inhibitor (BaCl2). The first ATP infusion will be performed without other drugs.&#xD;
      Following this, a second set of single contractions will be conducted with infusion of BaCl2.&#xD;
      This is then followed by a second ATP infusion to determine the efficacy of BaCl2. The final&#xD;
      set of single contractions will start and be performed with simultaneous infusion of all&#xD;
      three inhibitors (BaCl2, L-NMMA, and Ketorolac). This last phase of the study is aimed at&#xD;
      testing acute compensatory/redundant vasodilator mechanisms. ROV (exercise) studies will be&#xD;
      ~4 hours (1 hour set up and 3 hours experimental procedures). The ROV protocol is further&#xD;
      described here:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs: adenosine triphosphate, barium chloride, L-N-monomethyl Arginine Acetate, ketorolac&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 3 muscle contractions during 3 minute saline infusion followed by 3 additional muscle&#xD;
           contractions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Repeat 3 muscle contractions during 3 minute saline infusion followed by 3 additional&#xD;
           muscle contractions ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 10 minute washout,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Two minutes of ATP infusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 10 minute washout,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 3 muscle contractions during 3 minute BaCl2 infusion followed by 3 additional muscle&#xD;
           contractions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 3 muscle contractions during 3 minute BaCl2 infusion followed by 3 additional muscle&#xD;
           contractions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. 10 minute washout,&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Infusion of BaCl2 (3 minutes) and ATP (2 minutes),&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. 10 minute washout,&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. 3 muscle contractions during Infusion of BaCl2 (3 minutes) and L-NMMA and ketorolac&#xD;
           infusion (5 minutes) followed by 3 additional muscle contractions,&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. L-NMMA and ketorolac will be infused throughout remainder of protocol at a lower dosage&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. 3 muscle contractions during Infusion of BaCl2 (3 minutes) and L-NMMA and ketorolac (5&#xD;
           minutes) followed by 3 additional muscle contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that obesity induces an endothelial phenotype change that&#xD;
      creates an environment for both EDD and exercise dysfunction. We propose that obesity alters&#xD;
      endothelial enzymes which help explain the mechanistic changes in vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To test the hypothesis that obesity elicits altered EDD and functional vasodilation&#xD;
      due to altered functional potassium channel signaling. We propose that K+ channel function&#xD;
      accounts for unexplained differences in EDD and functional vasodilation. More specifically,&#xD;
      we hypothesize that inhibition of K+-mediated hyperpolarization (via inward rectifying K+&#xD;
      channels (KIR)) will identify differential vasodilator mechanisms between lean and obese&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
