&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure: Changes in gastrointestinal tolerance and acute bowel changes in 3&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, 2-arm, single-blinded, controlled, cross-over trial design&#xD;
      focused on determining the health benefits associated with Polydextrose intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 20 will be enrolled into the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening visit and 2 weekly study visits. This study will take approximately 2-3&#xD;
      weeks per subject to complete both 3-hr study visits on two different occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subject with the informed consent document and&#xD;
      determine subject eligibility through anthropometric measurements, vital signs, fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose test (finger prick), and completion of a survey relate to general eating, health, and&#xD;
      exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will be invited to participate in the study&#xD;
      for 2 study visits. Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual diet pattern and&#xD;
      physical activity throughout study duration. A dinner meal will be provided the day before&#xD;
      the study visit to control the second meal effect from the food and beverage intake of the&#xD;
      night before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will arrive at the center in a fasted state for at least 10 hours, well hydrated and&#xD;
      rested. Each study visit will require blood draws throughout the visit. After evaluation of&#xD;
      subject's health status (via anthropometric, vital sign and blood glucose measurements and&#xD;
      in-person interview), a Licensed health Care Professional will place a catheter in subject's&#xD;
      arm for the purpose of multiple blood sample collections and take the initial blood draw in&#xD;
      the fasting state. Subjects will be randomized to receive a placebo or test food based on&#xD;
      randomized treatment sequences for 2 study visits on two different occasions. The sequences&#xD;
      of receiving the test food at each visit will be randomly assigned to one of sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study visit will involve with blood samples collection at time points 0 (fasting), 0.5,&#xD;
      1, 2, 3 hour (h) for assessment of change in plasma glucose concentrations.&#xD;
