  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few scientific reports on preterm infants with birth weights between 1500 and&#xD;
      2000g. Adequate and properly balanced supply of nutrients believed to better growth and&#xD;
      cognitive development in this patient group, and optimized nutrition is an important part of&#xD;
      treatment There is a need for more studies that can provide knowledge of growth and weight&#xD;
      development in preterm and small for gestational age (SGA) infants with a birth weight&#xD;
      between 1500 and 2000g.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been little focus, at least there are few scientific reports on preterm infants&#xD;
      with birth weights between 1500 and 2000g, at least in Norway. Studies have shown the benefit&#xD;
      of enhanced protein and energy supplements in very low birth weight infants (VLBW, birth&#xD;
      weight &lt; 1500g), regarding growth and neurodevelopment . Adequate and properly balanced&#xD;
      supply of nutrients is believed to give better growth and cognitive development in premature&#xD;
      infants with slightly higher birth weight, i.e between 1500 and 2000g (1). In an intervention&#xD;
      study of VLBW children at four Norwegian hospitals we found lower supply of energy and&#xD;
      protein than international recommendations (2). A larger proportion of premature children&#xD;
      were stunted growth (weight below 10 percentile for age) during hospitalization. Although&#xD;
      this applies to preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g, this may also be the case&#xD;
      for larger premature patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More studies that can provide knowledge of growth rate, weight and neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes in preterm and small for gestational age (SGA) infants are warranted. This study&#xD;
      examines those with birth weight between 1500 and 2000g. Overall, this may provide new and&#xD;
      useful knowledge that can help to optimize the nutrition to preterm and SGA infants with a&#xD;
      this range of birth weights&#xD;
