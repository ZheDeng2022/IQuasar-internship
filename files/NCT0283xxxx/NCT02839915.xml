      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of folinic acid in the treatment&#xD;
      of language problems in children with autism spectrum disorder. Folinic acid, also known as&#xD;
      leucovorin, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decrease side&#xD;
      effects during cancer chemotherapy. Folinic acid may be helpful in treating language problems&#xD;
      in children with autism spectrum disorder, but this is not known. Therefore, folinic acid is&#xD;
      an investigational new drug for this study. Investigators will enroll a total of 134&#xD;
      participants across all three centers, over a 5 year period and participation will last&#xD;
      between 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder often with&#xD;
      life-long consequences that affects young children during critical developmental periods. The&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control estimates that ASD affects as many as 14.7 per 1000 children (1&#xD;
      in 68). Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two&#xD;
      decades, no effective medical treatment has been developed to address core ASD symptoms&#xD;
      (social communication and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language&#xD;
      impairment, or the underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment&#xD;
      for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment&#xD;
      over several years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of folinic acid in the treatment&#xD;
      of language problems in children with autism spectrum disorder. Folinic acid, also known as&#xD;
      leucovorin, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decrease side&#xD;
      effects during cancer chemotherapy. Folinic acid may be helpful in treating language problems&#xD;
      in children with autism spectrum disorder, but this is not known. Therefore, folinic acid is&#xD;
      an investigational new drug for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose&#xD;
      folinic acid for improving the closely associated symptoms of language impairment in children&#xD;
      with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Improvement in delayed language may also benefit the&#xD;
      core ASD problem of social communication. The study will also focus on identification of&#xD;
      biomarkers in pre-specified subgroups of children with ASD that may moderate positive&#xD;
      response to folinic acid. The study model is that high-dose folinic acid will improve&#xD;
      language and set the stage for improved social communication in children with ASD and&#xD;
      moderate language impairment. To test whether folinic acid is superior to placebo, 134&#xD;
      children (age 5 to 12 yrs 6 months, inclusive) with ASD and moderate language will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to folinic acid or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. The&#xD;
      study team will also test whether abnormalities in folate-dependent pathways, such as&#xD;
      dysfunctional transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier, will moderate positive&#xD;
      response to folinic acid treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals 4 (CELF-4) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Scale title is the &quot;Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals 4&quot; which is abbreviated as CELF-4 as indicated in the title above. Higher Scores indicate better performance. The Minimum Scaled Score is 40 and the Maximum Scaled Score is 160. The CELF-4 will be administered for participants between &gt; 6.6 and &lt; 12.5 years of age. The CELF-4 is comprised of 4 subtests intended to identify language problems and can be used to track progress over time. Administration of the CELF takes 30-45 minutes. The Core-CELF score is a composite that includes receptive and expressive language. Using the tables in the manual, raw scores from the four subtests are compared to normative data by age. The population mean = 100 + 15.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Preschool (CELF-P) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Scale title is the &quot;Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Preschool&quot; which is abbreviated as CELF-P as indicated in the title above. Higher Scores indicate better performance. The Minimum Scaled Score is 40 and the Maximum Scaled Score is 160. The CELF-P will be administered for participants between &gt; 5.0 and &lt; 6.5 years of age to obtain an estimate of expressive and receptive language skills (based on population mean of 100 +15). Administration of the Core CELF-P takes 20-30 minutes. To make the CELF-P match the CELF-4, one additional subtest on CELF-P called the Concepts and Following Directions was added (this subtest is included in the Core of the CELF-4, but not included in the Core CELF-P).</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinician Global Impression for Improvement (CGI-I) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point measure of overall symptomatic change compared to baseline that will be used as a key secondary outcome measure. Scores range from 1 (Very Much Improved) through 4 (Unchanged) to 7 (Very Much Worse). The CGI-I will be rated by a clinician who is blind to treatment assignment, and will not engage in discussion of adverse events and medication dose. Ratings of &quot;Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Very Much Improved&quot; on the CGI-I will be used to define positive response. Subjects who drop out will be rated as non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Home Situations Questionnaire- Modified for ASD (HSQ-ASD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HSQ-ASD is a parent-rated scale of child noncompliance. The parent reports on the child's difficulties with compliance in 24 everyday situations. Questions answered affirmatively are then rated on a 1 to 9 Likert scale, with higher scores indicating more severe noncompliance. The scale yields a count of &quot;yes&quot; responses (0 to 27) and a severity score (total of 1 through 9 for all &quot;yes&quot; responses, for a range of 0 to 216</description>

    <description>The CYBOCS-ASD is a modified version of the CYBOCS developed for use in children with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Each item is scored from 0 (least symptomatic) to 4 (most symptomatic), yielding a Total score from 0 to 20. It has established reliability and validity65 and is sensitive to change</description>
