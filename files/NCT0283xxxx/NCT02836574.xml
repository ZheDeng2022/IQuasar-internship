      Study Part 1: Multi-center, prospective, open-label, randomized, double-arm, deferred&#xD;
      treatment study whereby eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 after kidney biopsy to&#xD;
      receive up to 2 injections of REACT (made from expanded autologous selected renal cells) into&#xD;
      the biopsied kidney beginning as soon as REACT can be prepared, or the same series of up to 2&#xD;
      injections given 6 months (+4 weeks) apart beginning 12 months after renal biopsy. Subjects&#xD;
      will be followed through 24 months after the last injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Part 2: An open-label extension study in which eligible subjects will be followed for&#xD;
      an additional 36 months of long-term follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REACT is made from expanded autologous selected renal cells (SRC) obtained from each&#xD;
      individual subject's kidney biopsy. To manufacture REACT, biopsy tissue from each enrolled&#xD;
      subject will be sent to ProKidney LLC, in whose facilities renal cells will be expanded and&#xD;
      SRC selected. SRC will be formulated in a gelatin-based hydrogel at a concentration of 100 x&#xD;
      106 cells/mL, packaged in a 10 mL syringe, and shipped to the clinical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preclinical data, the dose of REACT will be 3 x 106 cells/g estimated kidney weight&#xD;
      (gKWest). Since the concentration of SRC per mL of REACT is 100 x 106 cells/mL, the dosing&#xD;
      volume will be 3.0 mL for each 100 g of kidney weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the Active Treatment Group or the Deferred Treatment&#xD;
      Group following renal biopsy. Subjects in the Active Treatment Group will receive their first&#xD;
      REACT injection as soon as the REACT product is manufactured and shipped to the clinical&#xD;
      site. After 6 months (+4 weeks), a second injection will be given, as appropriate. In&#xD;
      contrast, subjects in the &quot;Deferred Treatment Group&quot; will undergo a period of observation&#xD;
      after renal biopsy. During this time, they will receive contemporaneous, standard-of-care&#xD;
      therapy for CKD while undergoing follow-up evaluations every 3 months similar to subjects in&#xD;
      the Active Treatment Group. After 12 months , subjects from the Deferred Treatment Group will&#xD;
      receive a series of up to two REACT injections given 6 months (+4 weeks) apart, as&#xD;
      appropriate. Consequently, the study design includes a randomized control group receiving&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatment for the first 12 months and a randomized, active treatment group&#xD;
      receiving up to two REACT injections and follow-up evaluations during the same period of&#xD;
      time. In addition, each subject's baseline rate of renal decline, based on adequate&#xD;
      historical, clinical data obtained 18 months prior to REACT injection, will serve as a&#xD;
      comparator for monitoring the rate of progression of renal insufficiency over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of progression of renal insufficiency for the Active Treatment Group (assessed via&#xD;
      serial measurements of eGFR pre-randomization through 24 months after the last REACT&#xD;
      injection) will be compared against that of the Deferred Treatment Group (ie, contemporaneous&#xD;
      control group). In addition, each subject's baseline rate of eGFR decline (derived from&#xD;
      adequate historical, clinical data) will be compared against the individual subject's rate of&#xD;
      eGFR decline through 24 months following the final REACT treatment. The rate of progression&#xD;
      of renal insufficiency from subjects (if any) who received a single REACT injection may be&#xD;
      compared against that from subjects who received two REACT injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete the KDQOL survey, which is a kidney-specific measure of health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (ie, Kidney Disease and Quality of Life™ [KDQOL™-36] Version 1) and the&#xD;
      EQ-5D-5L. Scores from the Active Treatment Group will be compared against scores from the&#xD;
      Deferred Treatment Group. Subjects from the Deferred Treatment Group will comprise the&#xD;
      contemporaneous control group for the analysis of KDQOL scores. In addition, each subject's&#xD;
      baseline scores will be compared against the individual subject's KDQOL scores obtained&#xD;
      through 24 months after the last REACT injection. Additionally, KDQOL scores from subjects&#xD;
      who received a single REACT injection may be compared against scores from subjects who&#xD;
      received two injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who elect to enroll into the OLE, serial measurements of eGFR, rate of&#xD;
      progression of renal insufficiency (slope) based on pre-randomized annual rate of eGFR&#xD;
      measurements, use of dialysis, subject survival, procedure- and investigational&#xD;
      product-related AEs, renal-specific AEs, laboratory assessments, clinical evaluations,&#xD;
      concomitant medications, and patient reported outcomes from the KDQOL survey will be&#xD;
      evaluated through an additional 36 months of long-term follow-up.&#xD;

             as having an eGFR between 20 and 50 mL/min/1.73m2 inclusive at the Screening Visit and&#xD;

          5. The subject has blood pressure less than 150/90 at the Screening Visit, prior to renal&#xD;
             biopsy, and prior to REACT injection(s). At the time of the biopsy and injections, the&#xD;
             subject's BP should not be significantly below the previously recorded stable&#xD;
             pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has stable blood pressure and is maintained on a stable anti-hypertensive&#xD;
             medication regimen, if treatment for hypertension is necessary. If treatment includes&#xD;

             (ARB), that treatment must have been initiated at least 8 weeks prior to renal biopsy.&#xD;
             Treatment must be stable during the 6-week period immediately prior to REACT&#xD;
             injection. Stable treatment is defined as dose adjustment to no less than one half of&#xD;

          7. A minimum of 2 measurements of eGFR or sCr should be obtained at least 3 months apart&#xD;
             prior to the Screening Visit or within the previous 18 months to define the rate of&#xD;
             progression of CKD. The subject should have adequate, historical clinical data to&#xD;
             provide a reasonable estimate of the rate of progression of CKD. The Medical Monitor&#xD;

             injection(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
