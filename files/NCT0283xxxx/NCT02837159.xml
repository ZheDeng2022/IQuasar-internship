      The purpose of this randomized study is to assess the efficacy of a mobile application for&#xD;
      the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits (diet and exercise) in colorectal cancer survivors&#xD;
      (CCR).&#xD;

      Background: Among all types of cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent,&#xD;
      and Spain is among the countries with the highest incidence of CCR with a ratio of about&#xD;
      100,000 people. Fortunately the data of survival are very encouraging according to the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute, it is around 70% at 5 years when the cancer is regional and it&#xD;
      could reaching up to 90% when it is more localized. During this survival, however, a high&#xD;
      number of patients suffer physical and psychological sequelae that limited their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why that, to try to minimize these effects, it is essential to try to instill healthy&#xD;
      habits (food and physical exercise), since as it confirms the current literature, obesity is&#xD;
      related to a lower survival and a greater presence of other diseases, and increased&#xD;
      consumption of fruits and vegetables and physical activity practice improves the quality of&#xD;
      life in survivors of CRC. However, changes in lifestyle are complicated to maintain&#xD;
      long-term. In this sense, the technological development offers possibilities to try to&#xD;
      resolve this lack of adherence in patients with cancer. However, the evidence highlights the&#xD;
      need to improve knowledge about its applicability and efficacy in patients with this&#xD;
      pathology betting on technologies more innovative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The purpose of this randomized study is to assess the efficacy of a mobile&#xD;
      application for the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits (diet and exercise) in CRC&#xD;
      survivors. In a more specific way, analyze the effectiveness of the implementation to&#xD;
      maintain healthy lifestyle habits in patients newly diagnosed with CRC through adherence to a&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle (exercise and diet), as well as facilitate changes in clinical variables:&#xD;
      body composition, quality of life, physical condition related to health (functional ability,&#xD;
      strength and flexibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 54 patients will be recruited from the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital from Granada&#xD;
      (Spain). Patients will be randomized in two groups: control and experimental group. The&#xD;
      assessment of the end points will be made in IMUDS (Instituto Mixto Deporte y Salud) from&#xD;
      Granada (Spain) at three moments: at baseline, at 8 weeks (at the end of the program) and at&#xD;
      12 months of follow-up. The intervention will consist in: 1)Feedback daily or weekly of&#xD;
      physical exercise and diet through the application (notice) according to the records of diet&#xD;
      and exercise and following recommendations of International Organizations 2) Participation in&#xD;
      three sessions of seminars (1 hour each every 15 days) on habits of life healthy and cancer&#xD;
      and the self-regulation through measurements performed by the application 3) Calls weekly to&#xD;
      the patients of way individual to comment possible errors or doubts about the application, of&#xD;
      10 min of duration (8 calls). The control group will follow the usual indications of their&#xD;
      oncologist and completion of the study will be offered access to the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Health mobile applications (mobile health, mHealth) are potential tools to&#xD;
      address the needs of cancer patients, because it enabling personalized interventions and the&#xD;
      adherence to them. Previous studies have showed: 1) Are effective for weight loss in people&#xD;
      with obesity or overweight. 2) You can count on are to promote a healthy lifestyle focused on&#xD;
      the loss of weight in cancer patients. 3) Strategies based on self-regulation will not only&#xD;
      improve the regulation of the exercise by the patient, but they also produce a greater&#xD;
      adherence to the same. However, despite all these advances, are few them studies that have&#xD;
      analyzed the efficiency of mobile applications as tool appropriate for foster the acquisition&#xD;
      of habits of life healthy in cancer patients. Therefore are necessary studies that improve&#xD;
      the adequacy of interventions to the needs of patients with CRC with support from&#xD;
      technologies that show its effectiveness.&#xD;
