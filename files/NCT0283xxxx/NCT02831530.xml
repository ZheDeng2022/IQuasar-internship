  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyclins CDK4 / 6 are extensively involved in the proliferation and growth of numerous cancers&#xD;
      including breast cancer. The objective of this study is to identify if a new preoperative&#xD;
      oral treatment, abemaciclib directed against the CDK / 6 compared to no treatment, inhibits&#xD;
      tumor growth or induced senescence (aging) tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This early study is offered to women who are going to be operated on for breast cancer with&#xD;
      expression of hormone receptor (ER and / or PR). These women will have 3 chances to receive&#xD;
      one for up to 14 days in the waiting period of their surgery abemaciclib as tablets. Other&#xD;
      patients do not receive treatment. The decision to receive or no treatment will be done by a&#xD;
      random computer draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug's effectiveness will be evaluated primarily on the biological parameters of the&#xD;
      tumor itself when comparing surgery to before treatment. These results biomarkers will allow&#xD;
      us to better know how this treatment and eventually will be used in future to identify&#xD;
      patients for whom treatment with abemaciclib more efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated in the protocol will then receive treatment entirely conventional in their&#xD;
      breast cancer within the parameters of their tumors: their participation is very limited in&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to the treatment arm will start treatment from 15 days before the surgery (day 1 of the study) to receive the last dose of treatment the day before the surgical procedure (day 14 of the study). Abemaciclib will be taken orally at a dose of 150 mg/ twice a day (Every 12h +/- 2h) on day 1 to day 14. The treatment should be taken in the morning and evening with a big glass of water (250ml) at approximately the same time.</description>
