  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 Ointment was&#xD;
      evaluated in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typical&#xD;
      actinic keratosis (AK) on the face or scalp.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was an open-label, multicenter, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK study of&#xD;
      KX2-391 Ointment administered topically to the face or scalp of participants with AK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. Eligible participants were&#xD;
      received 3 or 5 consecutive days of topical treatment, applied at the study site. Blood&#xD;
      samples for PK analysis were collected. Activity (lesion counts) and safety evaluations were&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational Product (IP). An AE did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose, resulted in death, was life-threatening (i.e, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this did not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death), required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). TEAEs were defined as either those AEs with an onset after dosing or those pre-existing conditions that worsened after dosing. TEAEs included both serious and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

Local skin reactions assessment included signs of erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration on the treatment area. These signs were assessed using a 5-point grading scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (worst), where (grade 0 = absent, grade 1 = slight, grade 2 = moderate, grade 3 = severe, grade 4 = very severe).</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational Product (IP). An AE did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose, resulted in death, was life-threatening (i.e, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this did not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death), required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). TEAEs were defined as either those AEs with an onset after dosing or those pre-existing conditions that worsened after dosing. TEAEs included both serious and non-serious TEAEs.</description>
