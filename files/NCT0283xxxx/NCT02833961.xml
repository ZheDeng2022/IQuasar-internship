    <textblock>
      Cerebral vascular disorder is one of the most fatal diseases despite current advances in&#xD;
      medical science. The large number of negative clinical trials on neuroprotection in acute&#xD;
      stroke is a pointer to the fact that translating better understanding of the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      pathophysiology to clearly beneficial treatment strategies remains a daunting task. This&#xD;
      project aims at elucidating the plausible biophysical events that affect water and metabolite&#xD;
      diffusion in brain tissue after ischemia, by combining the information provided by two&#xD;
      advanced methods of magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion imaging: diffusional kurtosis imaging&#xD;
      and diffusion-weighted spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has been established as a major tool for the early detection&#xD;
      of stroke. However, information obtained using conventional DWI may be incomplete.&#xD;
      Diffusional kurtosis (K) is a quantitative measure of the complexity or heterogeneity of the&#xD;
      microenvironment in white and grey matter, which offers complementary information and may&#xD;
      potentially be a more sensitive biomarker for probing pathophysiological changes. In&#xD;
      addition, to gain more specific insights into molecular mobility in the intracellular&#xD;
      environment, it is beneficial to assess the diffusion properties of metabolites, such as&#xD;
      N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and choline containing compounds&#xD;
      (Cho). Assessment of metabolite diffusion changes by diffusion-weighted spectroscopy (DWS)&#xD;
      provides information specific to the intracellular environment. In particular, thanks to the&#xD;
      specific compartmentation of NAA almost exclusively in neurons and of Cho in glial cells, the&#xD;
      diffusion properties of these metabolites may provide specific insights into the pathological&#xD;
      processes occurring independently in the two cell types. In addition, measuring a temporal&#xD;
      profile of diffusion coefficient of these compounds may help clarify underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiological changes in neuronal cells during acute ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the help of these two advanced methods, a proof-of-concept trial is proposed on 24&#xD;
      healthy subjects and 24 ischemic stroke patients. Ischemic stroke patients will be scanned&#xD;
      three times with a 3T MR scanner (before day 10 post-stroke, around week 4 and 3 months), in&#xD;
      order to extract diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and DWS metrics and understand the dynamics&#xD;
      of the cellular mechanisms at play in cerebral ischemia. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate neuronal and glial metabolite diffusion changes at different time points after&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, in both infarcted and non-infarcted hemispheres. The aim is to get&#xD;
      non-invasively important information on the evolution of the cellular damage in this disease,&#xD;
      and possibly distinguishing between neuronal and glial processes (by measuring the metrics&#xD;
      extracted for these two sequences), as well as on the different mechanisms leading to&#xD;
      metabolite diffusion changes in the two brain areas, thus providing a great impact on the&#xD;
      strategy of treatment for patients with cerebral infarction.&#xD;
