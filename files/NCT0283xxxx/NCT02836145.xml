  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are common diseases especially in aged&#xD;
      women that frequently cause urogenital infection, voiding difficulty, urinary retention,&#xD;
      pelvic pain, constipation, and coital difficulty, as well as impact the quality of life of&#xD;
      women. Risk factors of the above diseases include pregnancy, vaginal delivery, and menopausal&#xD;
      status. Despite playing a crucial role in the pathophysiology of the above diseases, the&#xD;
      urogenital skeletal muscular dysfunction cannot be fully corrected via the current treatment&#xD;
      modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a prime candidate cell type for&#xD;
      current research and future cell therapy because of their significant self-renewal,&#xD;
      differentiation potential and the relative lack of ethical conflict. With the advent of&#xD;
      efficient technology of reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into hiPSCs,&#xD;
      researchers can generate personalized lines of cells from which it will be possible to obtain&#xD;
      differentiated cells in a less invasive way, introducing opportunities in treating diseases&#xD;
      that are now considered incurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until very recently, little success has been achieved in terms of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      differentiation from hiPSCs. The purpose of this study is to explore the applicability of the&#xD;
      differentiation into skeletal muscle progenitor cells from hiPSC cell lines and the&#xD;
      associated biomolecular messages. It is anticipated that the derived skeletal muscle&#xD;
      progenitor cells can be reprogrammed from PBMCs of female patients with urinary incontinence&#xD;
      and/or pelvic organ prolapse and used in preclinical testing for relieving female urogenital&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
