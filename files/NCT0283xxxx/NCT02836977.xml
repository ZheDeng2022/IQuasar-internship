      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare 3-year disease free survival (DFS) of tegafur-uracil following adjuvant&#xD;
      oxaliplatin-based regimen to observation following adjuvant oxaliplatin-based regimen in&#xD;
      patients with stage III colon cancer after radical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess 5-year overall survival (OS) in each arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profiles&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare 3-year disease free survival (DFS) of tegafur-uracil following adjuvant&#xD;
           oxaliplatin-based regimen to observation following adjuvant oxaliplatin-based regimen in&#xD;
           patients with stage III colon cancer after radical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess 5-year overall survival (OS) in each arm&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the safety profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection and Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects: Eligible patients will be randomized in 2 arms in the ratio of 2:1, to&#xD;
      reach approximately 546 patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Design This is an open-label, randomized, comparative, double arm, multicenter&#xD;
           study to assess disease free survival, overall survival, safety profiles with&#xD;
           tegafur-uracil following adjuvant oxaliplatin-based regimen as maintenance for one-year&#xD;
           in patients with stage III colon cancer after radical resection in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject Number Eligible patients will be randomized in 2 arms in the ratio of 2:1, to&#xD;
           reach approximately 546 patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Schedule Study date: the time getting approval letter issued by both regulatory&#xD;
           authority and institutional review board (IRB) Expected recruitment rate: 23&#xD;
           subjects/month Duration of recruitment: at least 2 years. Duration of the study: at&#xD;
           least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visit Schedule The schedule of assessments (please refer section 8.4 for the details)&#xD;
           indicates the number and timing of the planned visits, which must be maintained as&#xD;
           accurately as possible. The visit schedule must be maintained as accurate as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Duration of Treatment Treatment should be administered up to maximum one year, disease&#xD;
           progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal during any time of the study,&#xD;
           the patient will be withdraw.&#xD;
