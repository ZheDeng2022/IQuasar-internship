      INTRODUCTION Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition that results in impaired hand&#xD;
      function. In cases of CTS the &quot;pinch grip&quot; force between the thumb and index finger becomes&#xD;
      unnecessarily high to prevent objects from slipping when they are picked up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES The proposed study will investigate the following hypotheses regarding CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an object is picked up, the investigators suspect there will be several points at which&#xD;
      grip force will be different between patients with different severities of CTS, i.e. grip may&#xD;
      deteriorate as CTS gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also suspect grip force will be affected depending on the weight of the&#xD;
      object, i.e. patients with CTS may struggle with objects of a certain weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CTS sweat less, and this may affect their grip. The investigators suspect that&#xD;
      pinch grip in CTS patients is disproportionately altered by the frictional properties of the&#xD;
      object and by the moistness of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suspect patients with CTS will be less able to adapt to sudden changes in&#xD;
      an object's weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to examine how the above are affected after surgical treatment of CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The investigators will include patients with symptomatic, idiopathic CTS, aged&#xD;
      between 18 and 80 years. The investigators' centre will recruit CTS patients who will attend&#xD;
      their National Health Service (NHS) outpatient appointment followed by nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies. An equal number of healthy participants will be recruited for comparison purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the aforementioned appointment, patients will undertake a pinch grip force test using a&#xD;
      device that will test the above points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have normal care under their surgeon, which may include an operation for&#xD;
      treatment of CTS. Therefore some patients will be invited back to have grip tests again after&#xD;
      their operation. No aspect of the study will prevent a patient from receiving their normal&#xD;
      National Health Service (NHS) care.&#xD;

      RESEARCH QUESTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will ask important questions about CTS that builds on previous research in the&#xD;
      field. The research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How is precision pinch grip force affected by CTS throughout the activity of picking up&#xD;
           and replacing an object, for a range of CTS severities, especially in more severe CTS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How is precision pinch grip force affected in patients with CTS when picking up objects&#xD;
           of different weights?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How is precision pinch grip force affected in patients with CTS when the frictional&#xD;
           properties of the skin-device interface are altered?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How does precision pinch grip force in CTS alter after a sudden increase in downward&#xD;
           load force?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do these parameters change after surgical treatment of CTS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS AND STUDY JUSTIFICATION Answers to the above questions will inform&#xD;
      understanding of both precision pinch grip force control, and CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CTS drop things, and the investigators feel that impaired hand function in CTS&#xD;
      is related to poor grip control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous authors have recognised that pinch grip force is affected by in CTS (Hsu et al.&#xD;
      2013). The investigators intend to extend this work by showing how other aspects of force&#xD;
      control are altered in CTS throughout the action of picking an object up, and how they&#xD;
      correlate with CTS severity. This will allow us to use different readings taken during a&#xD;
      pinch grip test to assess CTS severity. This will also reveal how heavy objects may have a&#xD;
      greater adverse affect on grip control in CTS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, pinch grip testing could form a table-top test for CTS and nerve injury&#xD;
      evaluation and may allow better patient selection for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also account for skin hydration, as sweating is impaired in CTS, and&#xD;
      rarely accounted for in previous work. (This has since been abandoned mid-study). When&#xD;
      examining how friction impacts on precision pinch force in CTS, investigators may inform&#xD;
      understanding of how investigators could design occupational aids for those with median nerve&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating how patients with CTS compensate when an object they are holding suddenly&#xD;
      changes weight, will help us understand reflexes that are co-ordinated by the hand, and may&#xD;
      help us in working towards rehabilitating patients after nerve injury affecting the upper&#xD;
      limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We currently do not have good evidence about which patients should have surgery in CTS or&#xD;
      whether surgery restores the hand function that was lost when patients were suffering with&#xD;
      CTS. Investigating what happens to the above after surgery, may show us the best time to&#xD;
      operate on these patients, which patients we should prioritise and whether surgery actually&#xD;
      improves pinch force control post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH PROPOSAL This research proposal has been formulated with experience&#xD;
      from senior hand surgeons and multidisciplinary team professionals at a regional hand surgery&#xD;
      centre with an active research base (The Birmingham Hand Centre, University Hospitals&#xD;
      Birmingham, UK). Consultation has been carried out with the attached University of&#xD;
      Birmingham's Department of School of Psychology. A lead collaborator is the department's&#xD;
      Professor of Human Movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT Patients with CTS will routinely be referred to the investigators' centre for&#xD;
      assessment and treatment of CTS. They would normally be referred to the centre by their GP,&#xD;
      receive an appointment letter and attend the hospital. They would then be evaluated&#xD;
      clinically and with nerve conduction tests. This may be by a hand surgery consultant or&#xD;
      member of the hand team. Patients may then receive a date for surgery and would be followed&#xD;
      up if necessary. The Principle Investigator and one Local Collaborator are both consultant&#xD;
      hand surgeons who would receive referrals and see these patients in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will occur at one of the following points;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the point at which patients are referred to the Principle Investigator, patients will&#xD;
           be offered the chance to participate in their appointment letter which will contain the&#xD;
           Participant Information Sheet. This will be further assessed upon presentation to&#xD;
           clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Some patients are listed for surgery without being seen in the investigators' research&#xD;
           clinic, but are suitable for inclusion and are therefore &quot;missed&quot;. The investigators&#xD;
           intend to recruit these patients already listed for operations for carpal tunnel&#xD;
           syndrome on the day of surgery. The Chief Investigator will approach these patients on&#xD;
           the day of their operation to seek their permission to carry out pinch-grip testing&#xD;
           before surgery. Patients would receive the Patient Information Sheet from the Chief&#xD;
           Investigator, and would be consented for study inclusion and tested within the&#xD;
           Ambulatory Care Unit of the hospital whilst waiting for their operation. There would be&#xD;
           no alteration to their normal care and certainly no delay to their operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will not affect normal NHS (National Health Service) care in any way. Very&#xD;
      limited data (if any) can be collected until the point at which the patient attends for their&#xD;
      normal NHS (National Health Service) appointment. If they choose not to take part, they can&#xD;
      attend their normal NHS (National Health Service) appointment without the need to undergo&#xD;
      grip testing. No therapeutic promises are made by the Participant Information Sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of &quot;control&quot; participants; Healthy, age-gender matched controls will be invited&#xD;
      from the staff and student body from the University of Birmingham to take part in the pinch&#xD;
      grip testing exercise alone to act as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will request responses from university members aged 18-80. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be invited to take part by email circulated to staff and students.&#xD;
      Interested participants who respond by email will receive the full Participant Information&#xD;
      Sheet for Controls. This will specify that the only information collected will comprise their&#xD;
      age, gender, hand dominance and the grip test data (GP Contact details will be stored&#xD;
      anonymously in the case that incidental findings are discovered and warrant action).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be invited to attend the University Hospital Birmingham where grip strength tests&#xD;
      are performed to undergo testing according to the same protocol outlined for the patient&#xD;
      group. This is the point at which consent will be taken by the Chief Investigator or an&#xD;
      appropriate member of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be determined by the power analysis run at the beginning of the study,&#xD;
      but is expected to comprise 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This recruitment process was noted mid-study to be failing to recruit age-matched controls.&#xD;
      As an alternative, patients were matched with their own, contralateral hand if it was free of&#xD;
      symptoms of CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No formal power analysis took place, as the minimally important clinical difference was not&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION/ EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with symptomatic, idiopathic CTS (as affirmed by clinical examination and NCS)&#xD;
      presenting to clinic Aged between 18 and 80 years In contrast to other studies the&#xD;
      investigators would include patients with; Previous upper limb injuries Previous upper limb&#xD;
      surgery or CTS intervention (e.g. steroid injections) Diabetes mellitus Any other upper limb&#xD;
      nerve neuropathies or upper limb neurology Upper limb musculoskeletal degenerative disease&#xD;
      (osteoarthritis) Thyroid disease, (Zhang et al. 2011). This will create a pragmatic study&#xD;
      design, generalisable to a wider population in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central neurological or psychiatric disease Visual impairment or any other impairment that&#xD;
      would interfere with the patient's ability to perform the study tests Pregnant patients.&#xD;
      (Criteria based on prior research (Zhang et al. 2011)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT The consent form is that suggested by the Medical Reseach Council (MRC) Health&#xD;
      Research Authority and the Participant Information Sheet follows their guidelines. Both will&#xD;
      be distributed in appointment letters sent to patients. Informed consent to participate will&#xD;
      be confirmed during the original clinic appointment. Members of the hand team consent&#xD;
      patients for operations almost daily, and should be fully familiar with assessment of&#xD;
      capacity and understanding the ethical principles underpinning informed consent. Consent will&#xD;
      be obtained by the Chief Investigator (CI). The study will not include the assessment of&#xD;
      children or vulnerable adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS, BURDENS AND BENEFITS Patients will be informed of all risks and benefits anticipated&#xD;
      using the Participant Information Sheet. The investigators cannot guarantee any treatment&#xD;
      benefits and do not yet know what the results will show. However, patients will be helping us&#xD;
      understand an important problem affecting many other similar patients. These patients may&#xD;
      benefit from this research in the future. With their consent, a lay summary will be&#xD;
      circulated to the patients and controls after the completion of the study to inform them of&#xD;
      the results of the work. They will be consented for this and informed of this in the&#xD;
      participation sheets. Their preferred contact details will be stored separately in the index&#xD;
      spreadsheet on the trust computer system and will not be linked with clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent is to carry out pinch grip force testing on CTS patients. This will add to the&#xD;
      time patients are asked to stay in clinic by about 30 minutes. They will be fully informed&#xD;
      and asked whether they wish to participate, prior to being invited to take part in precision&#xD;
      pinch grip testing. This will not affect their access to assessment or treatment of their&#xD;
      CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent is to test precision pinch grip testing with a custom built device being developed&#xD;
      by the University of Birmingham. This device is based on those already used by Zhang and Hsu&#xD;
      et al, and is not anticipated to pose any risk of harm to the patient. The investigators do&#xD;
      not know of any side effects that there may be from the grip test. Patients may find their&#xD;
      hand to be a little tired after the test; however this should not last long and should not be&#xD;
      severe. The investigators think the risk of injury posed to patients by the grip device is&#xD;
      very small. The investigating team will have trialed the device on healthy volunteering&#xD;
      members of the research team prior to use in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not think that there will be any risks; including but not limited to&#xD;
      psychological or physical harm, posed by the study that fall outside the risks inherent in&#xD;
      normal clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality breech is extremely unlikely, as all information will be stored on NHS&#xD;
      (National Health Service) trust computers, however the investigators acknowledge this risk.&#xD;
      Only clinicians involved in patient care or researchers from within the study team will have&#xD;
      access to patients' clinical details. Patients will be consented to allow non-clinical&#xD;
      members of the research team (university staff) access to essential information for the&#xD;
      study; however this information will be kept to an absolute minimum. For example, if a&#xD;
      researcher performs the &quot;pinch-grip&quot; test, it is fair to assume that researcher will become&#xD;
      aware that the patient has a diagnosis of CTS. Patients will have been consented for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden of patients being requested to attend three subsequent follow-up appointments is&#xD;
      acknowledged, however the above benefits patients may feel in contributing to this study will&#xD;
      encourage them to attend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor (UHB) will be updated throughout, with special emphasis placed on drawing&#xD;
      attention to any risks or burdens that emerge after the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above risks are all conveyed in the Participant Information Sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY Confidentiality Principles Principle 1: The purposes of obtaining patient&#xD;
      information are outlined above. Principle 2 and 3: Person-identifiable data will not be&#xD;
      collected. Participants will be identified by UHB Patient Number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principle 4: Access to person-identifiable data will be limited to members of the treating&#xD;
      clinical team only. If non-clinical collaborators perform the precision pinch-grip test in&#xD;
      clinic, they will not have access to patient-identifiable clinical details, during the test&#xD;
      or afterwards during analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principle 5 and 6: All clinical team members are aware of their commitment to confidentiality&#xD;
      and the law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not anticipate that these principles will need to be breached in order&#xD;
      to prevent serious patient harm. If however, this situation arises, it will be discussed&#xD;
      between the Chief and Principle Investigators, the relevant authorities will be contacted for&#xD;
      advice and action taken whilst taking all steps to safely inform affected patients as early&#xD;
      as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The Principle or Chief Investigators will be involved in clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of CTS patients at their appointment. Special care will be taken to ensure&#xD;
      patients are aware that study participation does not affect their normal care in any way.&#xD;
      Care will be taken to avoid any form of coercion. The Principle or Chief Investigators may&#xD;
      also perform surgical treatment on appropriate patients, however this is separate to the&#xD;
      study and should not affect care in any way. Effort will be made to ensure patients are not&#xD;
      coerced into returning for follow-up grip testing after their operation. Patients may wish to&#xD;
      attend extra follow-up appointments. At the end of the study, patients are discharged back to&#xD;
      the care of their GP, to be referred back if any concerns arise (as is normal practice).&#xD;
      Participants will be aware that they will not know the results of their grip tests, but the&#xD;
      intent will be to publish a full paper within twelve months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HUMAN TISSUE Non- applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER ETHICAL ISSUES The intent is to carry out pinch grip force testing on CTS patients.&#xD;
      This will add to the time patients are asked to stay in clinic. They will be fully informed&#xD;
      and asked whether they wish to participate, prior to being invited to take part in precision&#xD;
      pinch grip testing. This will not affect their access to assessment or treatment of their&#xD;
      CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent is to test precision pinch grip testing with a custom built device being developed&#xD;
      by the University of Birmingham. This device is based on those already used by Zhang and Hsu&#xD;
      et al, and is not anticipated to pose any risk of harm to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER LEGAL ISSUES As the device is being custom-built by the University of Birmingham,&#xD;
      intellectual property rights are being addressed by the department developing the device,&#xD;
      with a view to drawing up a confidentiality agreement, although this is not a pre-requisite&#xD;
      to commencing the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER MANAGEMENT ISSUES This intention is to set-up an National Health Service (NHS) clinic&#xD;
      of back-to-back CTS patients, who will have a clinical assessment, followed by nerve&#xD;
      conduction studies, followed by pinch grip assessment. This will require logistic planning,&#xD;
      however this will be co-ordinated internally through UHB and will make the process clear to&#xD;
      patients when they are recruited to the study via the Participant Information Sheet.&#xD;
