      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sights, sounds, and smells can be associated with alcohol and tempt people to drink. The&#xD;
      connection between encountering cues and wanting to drink might be reduced by behavioral&#xD;
      techniques, like giving the cues at certain times, in certain circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if visual imagery and behavioral techniques can reduce alcohol craving and drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 21 65 who are mildly concerned about their drinking and have had these&#xD;
      habits in the past 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women: More than 3 drinks any single day and more than 7 drinks per week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men: More than 4 drinks any single day and more than 14 drinks per week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood tests, alcohol&#xD;
      breath tests, hepatitis tests, and alcohol and drug use questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a smartphone to carry throughout the study. They will use it to report&#xD;
      on their drinking, moods, and activities daily. The phone s GPS will record their locations&#xD;
      throughout each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 6 study visits over 4 weeks. Visits will last up to 4 hours, but the final&#xD;
      visit lasts up to 7 hours. Visits include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not drinking alcohol or using illicit or over-the-counter drugs at least 24 hours before each&#xD;
&#xD;
      visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing urine and breath samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to various cues. Participants reactions will be monitored by measuring heart rate,&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood pressure, and skin temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drinking alcohol or soft drinks. For visits with alcohol, transportation to and from the&#xD;
&#xD;
      visit will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About a month after the last visit, participants will be called to ask about their drinking&#xD;
      and cravings.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate alcohol memory retrieval-extinction, a novel behavioral procedure for&#xD;
      reduction of craving and drinking, in problem drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We will collect evaluable data from up to 75 participants. Participants are&#xD;
      evaluable if they complete geographical momentary assessment (GMA, described below). All&#xD;
      participants will be adult alcohol drinkers (men: &gt; 14 drinks/week or &gt; 4 drinks/day; women:&#xD;
      &gt; 7 drinks/week or &gt; 3 drinks/day) whose drinking scores as hazardous on the Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorders Identification Test. Participants will not be seeking treatment for an alcohol-use&#xD;
      disorder, be physiologically dependent on alcohol, or have other drug use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized study with three groups. Participants will use smartphones to provide&#xD;
      geotagged reports of alcohol craving and drinking in daily life (GMA reports) before,&#xD;
      between, and after a series of laboratory sessions. During sessions, participants will drink&#xD;
      an alcoholic beverage (individualized to produce a 0.06 g/dL blood alcohol content) or a soft&#xD;
      drink. Participants will then be repeatedly presented with alcohol- or soft-drink-associated&#xD;
      cues without further drinking. These are the memory retrieval and extinction portions,&#xD;
      respectively, of memory retrieval-extinction. Previous studies suggest this procedure can&#xD;
      robustly reduce Pavlovian associations between cues and responses such as craving. The&#xD;
      mechanism seems to involve memory reconsolidation, in which freshly retrieved associations&#xD;
      (e.g., drink cues and consumption - pleasant effects ) become more vulnerable to disruption&#xD;
      by extinction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups will be tested: (1) alcohol retrieval / alcohol extinction will be compared to&#xD;
      (2) soft-drink retrieval / alcohol extinction and (3) alcohol retrieval / soft-drink&#xD;
      extinction. Before and after retrieval-extinction, participants will be tested for alcohol&#xD;
      craving and cue-induced physiological responses in laboratory sessions. Retrieval-extinction&#xD;
      will be followed by 1 week of follow-up GMA reporting, with telephone contact 30 days&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters: The co-primary outcome measures are: self-reported alcohol craving in the&#xD;
      laboratory sessions before and after retrieval-extinction, and GMA reports of alcohol craving&#xD;
      and drinking. Daily-life responses are important because the version of retrieval-extinction&#xD;
      we will be using, with retrieval induced by drinking alcohol itself, rather than alcohol cues&#xD;
      alone, may be especially likely to have effects that generalize from the laboratory to daily&#xD;
      life. Secondary outcome measures are: (1) self-reported alcohol craving and drinking at&#xD;
      30-day follow-up, (2) physiological reactivity during sessions, and (3) urine biomarkers for&#xD;
      alcohol consumption.&#xD;
