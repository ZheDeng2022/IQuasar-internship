      To evaluate effectiveness and safety of HHRS in subjects undergoing total hip arthroplasty&#xD;
      (THA). Effectiveness will be evaluated using patient-reported, clinical, radiologic, and&#xD;
      radiostereometric outcomes. Safety will be evaluated through the collection of device-related&#xD;
      and unanticipated device-related adverse events.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The HIT Hip Replacement System (HHRS) is a Metal-on-Polyethylene (MoP) conventional hip&#xD;
      prosthesis. The HHRS consists of a femoral stem, an acetabular cup and a Cobalt Chromium&#xD;
      Molybdenum (CoCrMo) ball that articulates within a polyethylene liner. The ball sits on the&#xD;
      acetabular cup, and the polyethylene liner is attached to the femoral cup, which attaches to&#xD;
      the femoral stem, instead of the acetabular cup. The acetabular component of the HHRS&#xD;
      consists of a hemispherical acetabular shell with a clustered screw-hole design. The outside&#xD;
      of the shells are coated with titanium plasma to facilitate bone in-growth and provide secure&#xD;
      intermediate fixation with the prepared bone surface at the site of implantation. The&#xD;
      acetabular cup has a 3-hole design that accommodates three titanium alloy bone screws. Inside&#xD;
      the acetabular cup is a male taper for assembly with the acetabular ball. The femoral&#xD;
      component consists of a femoral stem manufactured from titanium and a mating cobalt chrome&#xD;
      femoral cup lined with a highly cross-linked ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene&#xD;
      (UHMWPE). As with the acetabular cup, the femoral stem is porous coated using a plasma spray&#xD;
      of pure titanium, which is intended to facilitate bone in-growth and provide secure&#xD;
      intermediate fixation with the prepared bone surface at the site of implantation. The femoral&#xD;
      stem incorporates a female taper for assembly with the male taper of the femoral cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device has undergone extensive pre-clinical testing. There is no clinical experience with&#xD;
      the HRS.&#xD;
