      The study is an observational, multi-center, prospective, non-interventional and open-label&#xD;
      data collection study assessing outcomes, treatment patterns, adverse events and costs in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid. The patient enrollment period will be 1 year with&#xD;
      a follow-up (observation period) of 1 year for each patient. Four dermatology centres in&#xD;
      France will participate. The hypothesis to be answered by the study is that superpotent&#xD;
      topical corticosteroid therapy is properly used to treat bullous pemphigoid in real-world&#xD;
      life as recommended by French guidelines and whether this treatment influences the medical&#xD;
      costs by comparison with systemic therapies (e.g. methotrexate or prednisone).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid is the most common autoimmune blistering disease of the skin, usually&#xD;
      affecting the elderly. It is a chronic disease characterized by spontaneous exacerbations and&#xD;
      remissions. Bullous pemphigoid is mediated by IgG autoantibodies directed against&#xD;
      hemidesmosomal proteins (BP180, BP230), which are involved in dermal-epidermal adhesion in&#xD;
      the skin. The diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid is based on clinical and immunopathological&#xD;
      findings, including skin direct immunofluorescence. The disease usually requires on average a&#xD;
      1-year duration of treatment although a long-term maintenance therapy may be necessary some&#xD;
      cases. High doses oral corticosteroids have been considered as the mainstay of treatment for&#xD;
      many years, but are deleterious, with a high rate of treatment side effects, including&#xD;
      mortality. Topical superpotent corticosteroids have been demonstrated to be as effective but&#xD;
      safer than high doses of oral corticosteroids, reducing side effects and mortality rate,&#xD;
      while controlling the disease in between 95% to 100% of cases. Despite its high efficacy,&#xD;
      topical superpotent corticosteroid therapy is often considered as poorly convenient. In&#xD;
      addition, immunosuppressant drugs and methotrexate are poorly tolerated or frequently&#xD;
      contra-indicated in those elderly patients with bullous pemphigoid. To date, no study has&#xD;
      evaluated the real-world use and costs of the different treatments in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The project is an observational, multi-center, prospective, non-interventional and&#xD;
      open-label data collection study assessing outcomes, adverse events, treatment patterns and&#xD;
      related costs in patients diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid. The patient enrollment period&#xD;
      will be 1 year with a follow-up (observation period) of 1 year for each patient. Four&#xD;
      dermatology centres in France will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific goal is to describe in each patient with bullous pemphigoid the therapeutic&#xD;
      management, including: i) all topical and systemic medications and nursing cares; ii)&#xD;
      clinical and biological monitoring and iii) clinical outcome during the first year of&#xD;
      treatment. The hypothesis to be answered by the study is that topical superpotent&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy is properly used to treat bullous pemphigoid in real-world life as&#xD;
      recommended by French guidelines and whether this treatment influences the medical costs by&#xD;
      comparison with systemic therapies (e.g. methotrexate or prednisone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the factors influencing the first-line therapy : topical superpotent&#xD;
           corticosteroid therapy (treatment scheme 1 or TS1) versus systemic therapy (treatment&#xD;
           scheme 2 or TS2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the factors influencing disease outcome during the first year of treatment,&#xD;
           especially TS1 versus TS2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine total, medical and non-medical costs, during the first year of treatment&#xD;
           and to compare these costs between patients treated according TS1 versus TS2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To sequentially evaluate several blood biomarkers, including anti-BP180 and anti-BP230 IgG&#xD;
      autoantibodies, IL-17, IL-23, IL-12 or other biologic makers and to compare them according&#xD;
      the treatment scheme (TS1 versus TS2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients with bullous pemphigoid will be followed for 1 year. Baseline and 6&#xD;
      follow-up visits are planned to record disease activity, treatment and laboratory monitoring&#xD;
      modalities and to collect blood samples for ancillary studies. Clinical data recorded at&#xD;
      baseline are gender, age and associated medical conditions (neurological disorders: dementia,&#xD;
      stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis; malignancy; other diseases). Baseline&#xD;
      clinical evaluation includes the number of daily new blisters for 3 consecutive days,&#xD;
      localization of skin or mucous membrane blisters and erosions and BPDAI (bullous pemphigoid&#xD;
      disease area index). Extensive bullous pemphigoid is defined as the occurrence of at least 10&#xD;
      new daily blisters. The first-line treatment used will be recorded (superpotent topical CS,&#xD;
      i.e. clobetasol propionate cream, 20-30g per day; methotrexate; other systemic therapy). At&#xD;
      each visit, the presence of pruritus, erythematous or eczematous or urticarial plaques, and&#xD;
      the number of new daily blisters are recorded and a BPDAI (bullous pemphigoid disease area&#xD;
      index) is calculated. Topical and systemic treatments for bullous pemphigoid are recorded at&#xD;
      each visit, as the occurrence and date of relapse, which eventually occurred. Relapse is&#xD;
      defined as the reappearance of â‰¥3 new daily blisters along with pruritus and/or erythematous,&#xD;
      eczematous or urticarial plaques.&#xD;
