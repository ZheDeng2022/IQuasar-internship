      The use of hypnosedation in the context of anesthesia is validated. This is a technique that&#xD;
      combines the hypnosis procedure as intravenous sedation. For surgery, it is associated with&#xD;
      local anesthesia surgical site. It can favorably replace general anesthesia if surgery or&#xD;
      endoscopy allows but doctors will always need local anesthesia surgical site where surgery&#xD;
      The hospital Paris Saint joseph introduced gradually this technique from first in 2007 to the&#xD;
      operating room and in the various services of conventional and ambulatory hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the investigators is to evaluate these parameters on a prospective cohort of&#xD;
      patients supported by hypnosedation in Paris Saint Joseph hospital for an endoscopy or&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of medical hypnosis has been developing for about fifteen years in several health&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hospital Group Paris Saint-Joseph has progressively introduced first this technique from&#xD;
      2007 to the operating room and in the various services of conventional and ambulatory&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care (SFAR) recognizes the hypnosedation as&#xD;
      sedation technique that can be used in acute pain and anesthesia (operating theater,&#xD;
      emergency, painful treatments ...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently many quality scientific papers published in international journals in&#xD;
      particular by the team of Pr. M. E. Faymonville Liege, who explained the mechanisms and&#xD;
      consequences of hypnosedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of hypnosedation in the context of anesthesia is validated. This is a technique that&#xD;
      combines the hypnosis procedure as intravenous sedation. For surgery, it is associated with&#xD;
      local anesthesia surgical site. It can favorably replace general anesthesia if surgery or&#xD;
      endoscopy allows but doctors will always need local anesthesia surgical site where surgery.&#xD;
      It can also complement a regional anesthesia to increase patient comfort (less stress,&#xD;
      anxiety and pain) .If necessary, the conversion of general anesthesia hypnosedation is always&#xD;
      possible during surgery or gastrointestinal endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Paris Saint joseph Hospital facility, several anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists&#xD;
      are trained in medical hypnosis. Now, a common practice in surgery hypnosedation (inguinal&#xD;
      hernia, thyroid and para-thyroid surgery) and endoscopy (colonoscopy, gastroesophageal&#xD;
      gastroduodenal endoscopy) .On a period of 3 years, 414 acts were carried out under&#xD;
      hypnosedation. When digestive endoscopy adding sedation is not systematic and, if the patient&#xD;
      is comfortable enough without conscious sedation, only hypnoanalgesia is used (use of&#xD;
      hypnosis in the prevention or relief of acute pain or chronic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique is part of the panel modes of analgesia and anesthesia can be offered to&#xD;
      patients. However, little is known about patient satisfaction and their experiences during&#xD;
      the procedure under hypnosedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate these parameters on a prospective cohort of patients supported&#xD;
      by hypnosedation in Paris Saint Joseph hospital for an endoscopy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation is part of the evaluation of professional practices (EPP) recommended by the&#xD;
      HAS (french High Authority of Health) and the ARS (Regional Health Agency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective / secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure satisfaction of patients resorted to hypnosedation or hypnoanalgesia during an&#xD;
      endoscopy or surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure the doses of drugs used for conscious sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DESIGN: Prospective cohort single-center, non-interventional kind EPP on the&#xD;
           satisfaction of patients who underwent hypnosedation for surgery or endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of the study: 8 months (November 2015-June 2016): the estimated number of 80&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acquisition of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, weight, height, gender, ASA (Physical status score) score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of surgery or endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous history of surgery or endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Names and doses of treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conversion to general anesthesia yes / no&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of management in operating room&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events during surgery and in recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation using a numerical scale from 0 to 10:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient anxiety during the pre- and per-interventional&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The per-Interventional Pain, Interventional immediate post-and before the release of the&#xD;
           SSPI (The post-interventional surveillance room)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The feeling of active participation in the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality of the relationship with the hypnotist during surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall satisfaction during surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptance or not the patient to repeat surgery or examination under the same terms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptance or not to recommend the patient to the relatives hypnosedation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Case open for any comments or suggestions obviousness&#xD;
