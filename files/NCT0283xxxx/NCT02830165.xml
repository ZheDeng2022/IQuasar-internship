    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer that is likely to come back or spread (high-risk) undergoing surgery.&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver&#xD;
      radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses&#xD;
      over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Delivering radiotherapy before&#xD;
      prostatectomy by SBRT is more convenient, conformal, and may spare normal tissues better than&#xD;
      delivering radiotherapy after prostatectomy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess feasibility of pre-operative stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients at high risk for recurrence after prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety and acute toxicity of SBRT followed by prostatectomy. This will be based&#xD;
      on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and patient reported&#xD;
      quality of life (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] and International Prostate&#xD;
      Symptom Score [IPSS] questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Investigation of the radiobiology of SBRT in prostate cancer using resected prostate&#xD;
      tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluation of the nature of the immune response to prostate cancer generated by SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo 3 fractions of SBRT over 1-2 weeks, 2-4 weeks prior to radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up at 0 to 4 weeks, and every&#xD;
      3 months for 1 year.&#xD;
