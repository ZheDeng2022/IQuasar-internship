  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to the date of objectively documented progression (per tumor-specific response criteria) or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first (approximately 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). Best overall response is defined as the best response designation, as determined by investigator, recorded in the specified timeframe, according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of first confirmed response to the date of the first documented progression (approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from first confirmed response (Complete Response, CR or Partial Response, PR) to the date of the first documented tumor progression (as determined by investigator) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Objective Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dosing date to the date of the first confirmed response (approximately 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first confirmed response (Complete Response, CR or Partial Response, PR), as assessed by investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dosing date to the date of the last dose (approximately 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival Rate at 1 Year</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dosing date to 1 year later</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the first dosing date to the date of death. A participant who has not died will be censored at last known date alive. OS rate at 1 year is measured as the proportion of participants still alive at 1 year after first dosing, measured from Kaplan-Meier curve of OS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Died</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 100 days following last dose (approximately 27 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who died for any cause</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 30 days following the last dose (approximately 25 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who experienced any grade, any cause AEs</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 30 days following the last dose (approximately 25 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who experienced any grade, any cause SAEs</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 30 days following the last dose (approximately 25 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Immune-mediated Adverse Events (IMAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 30 days following the last dose (approximately 25 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who experienced IMAEs. IMAEs are AEs consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism or immune-mediated component for which non-inflammatory etiologies (eg, infection or tumor progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an alternate etiology which were exacerbated by the induction of autoimmunity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Select Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 30 days following the last dose (approximately 25 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who experienced Select Adverse Events. Select Adverse Events categories include: any select AEs, drug-related select AEs, serious select AEs, drug related serious select AEs, any select AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related select AEs leading to discontinuation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Dose Delay</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 30 days following the last dose (approximately 25 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who experienced AEs leading to dose delay. A dose will be considered as delayed if the delay is exceeding 3 days after the intended dose date (i.e., greater than or equal to 4 days from scheduled dosing date)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Specific Laboratory Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 30 days following the last dose (approximately 25 months)</time_frame>
