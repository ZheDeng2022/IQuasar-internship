  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enterobacteriaceae are bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract which are also the most&#xD;
      frequently involved in bacterial infections, especially urinary tract infections. Because of&#xD;
      their presence in the gut, these bacteria are the most exposed to antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      administered to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, many antibiotic resistance mechanisms are observed in some of them. Quinolone&#xD;
      antibiotics are often used because of their distribution in the body, of the great number of&#xD;
      bacterial species that are sensitive to these antibiotics and the possibility to give oral&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a long time no transferable resistance gene to quinolones from one bacterium to another&#xD;
      had been observed. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in 1998 in a bacterium of the&#xD;
      Klebsiella pneumoniae species carrying a qnrA gene which encodes a protein that protects the&#xD;
      target of the antibiotic in the bacteria. Since several genes have been observed. These genes&#xD;
      reduce the sensitivity of the bacteria without ever reach detectable resistance levels on the&#xD;
      tests commonly used in the laboratory. However, these genes are often found among&#xD;
      enterobacteria in combination with other mechanisms of resistance to other classes of&#xD;
      antibiotics including beta-lactam antibiotics that are widely used antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it is considered that quinolone administration to bacteria carrying these qnr genes&#xD;
      could promote the emergence of mutants resistant to quinolones to a more high-level. That&#xD;
      furthers multiresistance emergence when the bacteria is already resistant to beta-lactam&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study performed between April 2008 and March 2009 was to collect strains&#xD;
      resistant to beta-lactams because of the production of enzymes, called extended-spectrum&#xD;
      beta-lactamase to determine quinolone resistance gene frequency in these bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, control patients were selected to seek the emergence of these genes risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study failed to identify specific risk factors, however, the biological study&#xD;
      enhanced the knowledge on this issue with the setting-up of a method for rapid detection of&#xD;
      these plasmidic mediated quinolones resistance genes and the description a new plasmid&#xD;
      containing a qnr gene, qnrD, whose study is still ongoing.&#xD;

      The multidrug resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is a recurring concern for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients. Given their epidemic character, the bacteria that produce extended spectrum&#xD;
      beta-lactamase (ESBLs) are subject to extensive and costly preventive measures. Gene location&#xD;
      of the first described ESBL were plasmids which could transfer from one species to another&#xD;
      often associated with resistance to aminoglycoside. Quinolone resistance was not&#xD;
      transferable. In 1998, was discovered a Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying a qnr A plasmid gene&#xD;
      encoding a protein protecting girases and topoisomerase IV against quinolones. Yet the levels&#xD;
      of ciprofloxacin MIC achieved by strains harboring this gene without any other quinolones&#xD;
      resistance mechanism associated, remain low. However, the ciprofloxacin MICs for Escherichia&#xD;
      coli lacking any other quinolone resistance mechanism can go from 0.003 mg / L to 0.25 mg /&#xD;
      L, depending on the type of qnr. Currently, three types of qnr genes have been described,&#xD;
      encoding proteins having several variants (qnrA (n = 6), qnrB (n = 10) and qnrS (n = 2). The&#xD;
      qnrA and qnrB genes are carried by plasmids of 54-180 kb. Gene environment on plasmid DNA is&#xD;
      that of class 1 integron or Type sul1 called. However the sequenced plasmids carrying qnrS do&#xD;
      not have integron-like structures. These genes are more common in the Enterobacteriaceae&#xD;
      strains producing ESBL strains than in the others. The low prevalences observed up to date,&#xD;
      are increasing in some studies. We have observed qnr in 9 of 138 (6.5%) strains isolated in&#xD;
      Champagne-Ardenne in 2004, including 4 of 10 strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Furthermore it&#xD;
      has been shown in vitro that the presence of qnrA gene facilitated mutant selection for&#xD;
      high-level quinolone resistance. Therefore, given the increasing trend in the prevalence of&#xD;
      this gene reported by some authors, it is necessary to establish a monitoring and identify&#xD;
      factors favoring the emergence of these strains. The purpose of the study is to observe the&#xD;
      evolution of the prevalence of qnr genes within ESBL-producing strains, to detect the&#xD;
      emergence of an epidemic clonal strain, and look for the emergence of risk factors of these&#xD;
      genes. Given the low prevalence of these genes that research involves a multicenter study&#xD;
      which will be organized on 9 East region's inter hospitals from 1 April 2008 to 31 March&#xD;
      2009. It is therefore a descriptive study that clinicobiological aims to: - To collect a&#xD;
      sufficient number of producer strains of these genes, - To characterize their different&#xD;
      variants (CHU Reims), - To identify the clones possibly associated with these genes (Besan√ßon&#xD;
      University Hospital), - To study their genetic environment (CHU Dijon), - Seek clinical&#xD;
      factors and antibiotic treatments favoring their presence. All ESBL-producing&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae isolates, identified in the 5 CHU inter region and CH 4, Colmar, Vesoul,&#xD;
      Troyes and Charleville for one year will be centralized at the Bacteriology Laboratory of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Reims. The non duplicate isolates will be included (one isolate per&#xD;
      patient resistance phenotype, by species and by month). 600 ESBL-producing strains are&#xD;
      expected in this period and among them 50 strains carrying the gene qnr. The clinical study&#xD;
      is a retrospective record. For each patient with a isolate carrying qnr, 2 control patients&#xD;
      from the same hospital with an age difference of less than 10 years with the &quot;case&quot; will be&#xD;
      drawn in the list of patients who had a ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae. And 150 patient&#xD;
      records will be included in the study. Parallel sequencing of qnr genes will allow their&#xD;
      precise identification and highlight variants. The quinolones MICs will be determined to&#xD;
      detect any increase in the level of resistance. The rest of the study include ESBL&#xD;
      identification by sequencing. The study of the genetic environment of qnr will be performed&#xD;
      for one isolate by gene type and by species for detecting genetic factors promoting their&#xD;
      dissemination (plasmid, integron), variabilities compared to the literature data and get&#xD;
      additional epidemiological markers. Genotyping of the isolates will highlight a possible&#xD;
      epidemic clone. For Escherichia coli phylogenetic group will be determined at the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Besancon. The distribution of E. coli strains. coli carrying the qnr among&#xD;
      different phylogenetic groups will be compared to that of a number of isolates of Escherichia&#xD;
      coli drawn among the ESBL strains having no qnr (2 controls for 1 case). The major clinical&#xD;
      parameters recorded from the files will be, among others, the reason for hospitalization, the&#xD;
      main underlying disease, antibiotic treatment before and after the isolation of ESBL&#xD;
      bacteria. It will determine if the strains carrying the gene qnr are statistically more&#xD;
      resistant to certain molecules that stem not having.&#xD;

        For one year, plasmidic mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) were detected all the&#xD;
        Extended- Spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in the 5 teaching&#xD;
        hospitals and 4 general hospitals of the french East inter region during the first nine&#xD;
        months of 2009. A case-control study was performed. The cases were the 29 patients in whom&#xD;
        a qnr gene was detected in an enterobacteriaceae. The controls were 104 patients&#xD;
        hospitalized in the hospital with a age difference &lt; 10 years with a case and having an&#xD;
        Enterobacteriaceae without a qnr gene. At least, 2 control patients were selected. for each&#xD;
