      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a new cancer therapy, researchers take a person s blood, select a certain white blood cell&#xD;
      to grow in the lab, and then change the genes of these cells using a virus. The cells are&#xD;
      then given back to the person. This is called gene transfer. For this study, researchers will&#xD;
      modify the person s white blood cells with anti-CD70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if a gene transfer with anti-CD70 cells can safely shrink tumors and to be certain the&#xD;
      treatment is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older diagnosed with cancer that has the CD70-expressing cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, and other tests.&#xD;
      They may by admitted to the hospital. Leukapheresis will be performed. For this, blood is&#xD;
      removed through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the white blood cells. The rest of&#xD;
      the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will have an intravenous catheter placed in their upper chest. Over&#xD;
      several days, they will get chemotherapy drugs and the anti-CD70 cells. They will recover in&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take an antibiotic for 6 months after treatment. They will repeat&#xD;
      leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the clinic every 1-3 months for the first year after treatment, every&#xD;
      6 months for the second year, and then as determined by their physician. Follow-up visits&#xD;
      will take 1-2 days. At each visit, participants will have lab tests, imaging studies, and a&#xD;
      physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, blood will be taken and participants will have many tests to determine&#xD;
      the size and extent of their tumor and the treatment s impact.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We generated a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that engages CD70 using its natural&#xD;
           ligand CD27, as the binding moiety. Transducing peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with&#xD;
           this CAR conveys major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent recognition of&#xD;
           CD70-expressing target cells, which include renal cell carcinoma and other cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In co-cultures with CD70+ target cells, anti-hCD70 CAR transduced T cells secrete&#xD;
           significant amounts of IFN-gamma with high specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with anti-hCD70 CAR in&#xD;
           concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;&#xD;
           aldesleukin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Determine if anti-hCD70 CAR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of CD70&#xD;
           expressing tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be/have:&#xD;
&#xD;
           --Metastatic or unresectable CD70-expressing cancer which has progressed after standard&#xD;
           therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may not have:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Allergies or hypersensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin, cyclophosphamide, or&#xD;
                fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I/II, single center study of PBL transduced with anti-hCD70 CAR in&#xD;
           patients with measurable, unresectable cancer expressing CD70.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and&#xD;
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant&#xD;
           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-hCD70 CAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 0, patients will receive PBL transduced with the anti-hCD70 CAR and will then&#xD;
           begin high-dose aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A complete evaluation of lesions will be conducted approximately 6 weeks (plus or minus&#xD;
           two weeks) after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design, with two separate cohorts&#xD;
           for the Phase II component:Cohort 2a, patients with CD70-expressing clear cell renal&#xD;
           cell carcinoma (RCC), and Cohort 2b, patients with a CD70-expressing non-RCC malignancy&#xD;
           (solid tumors only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of up to 124 patients may be required; approximately 38 patients in the Phase I&#xD;
           portion of the study and 43 (41, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable) patients in&#xD;
           each cohort of the Phase II portion of the study.&#xD;
