      Biomargin is a European research program aimed at evaluating the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      biomarkers with respect to renal graft injuries, as well as their prognostic performance with&#xD;
      respect to 3-year and 5-year graft outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nucleic acids, proteins and metabolites previously identified as candidate biomarkers of&#xD;
      individual kidney graft lesions will be determined systematically in urine and blood samples&#xD;
      collected in patients from the time of transplantation onwards, as well as in the graft&#xD;
      tissue when biopsies are required for medical causes or performed systematically in the&#xD;
      investigation centres. Their diagnostic and prognostic performance will be checked against&#xD;
      histological reading of the biopsies and evolution of the graft function over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In renal allograft recipients, 10-year graft survival has not much improved over&#xD;
      the past decades. There is thus a need for robust, non-invasive methods to predict and&#xD;
      diagnose acute and chronic graft lesions, to improve patient treatment, quality of life and&#xD;
      long-term graft survival. Also, there is an unmet need for better understanding of the immune&#xD;
      and non-immune mechanisms of interstitial fibrosis /tubular atrophy and graft loss. Several&#xD;
      teams have searched for biomarkers of renal graft lesions, but there has been no&#xD;
      cross-fecundation of the different &quot;omics&quot; approaches, nor any consolidation of the different&#xD;
      clusters of biomarkers discovered using different technologies. An analysis of these&#xD;
      different omics levels based on the principles of systems biology is therefore necessary to&#xD;
      gain insight into the disease mechanisms and will help to develop predictors at the&#xD;
      individual level. Purpose: The European project BIOMARGIN aims to discover, select and&#xD;
      validate blood and/or urine biomarkers of renal allograft lesions in adult and paediatric&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients by integrating several omics approaches (mRNA, miRNA, peptides,&#xD;
      proteins, lipids and metabolites) in blood, graft tissue and urine. The European cohort study&#xD;
      BECS aims to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of the selected biomarkers&#xD;
      over the first 3 and 5 years post-transplantation. Study design: This is a multicenter,&#xD;
      international, ambispective, open and non-interventional cohort study, with collection of&#xD;
      biological samples. Number of subjects: 450 adult and 50 paediatric renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients. Outcomes: The primary endpoint is the graft outcome, assessed at three years as&#xD;
      any lesion appeared on graft biopsies after patient enrolment, decline in graft function ≥&#xD;
      30%, graft loss or patient death. Secondary endpoints include: histological findings in&#xD;
      indication biopsies as well as in systematic biopsies (as per centre procedures) at 5 years;&#xD;
      cumulated acute rejection episodes; 3-year and 5-year graft survival; and change of renal&#xD;
      function assessed by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated using the MDRD formula.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values&#xD;
      of the different biomarkers or sets of biomarkers will be evaluated for each of the primary&#xD;
      and secondary endpoints. In order to compare the performance of the biomarkers with those of&#xD;
      the other known risk factors for the deterioration of renal graft function, longitudinal&#xD;
      statistical modelling will be used.&#xD;
