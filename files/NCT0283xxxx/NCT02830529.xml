      African Americans with prehypertension have a 35% greater risk of progressing to hypertension&#xD;
      than whites. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is a gold standard intervention&#xD;
      for hypertension self-management. However, the barriers to self-management of hypertension&#xD;
      reported by AAs include stress, including perceived stress related to racism/discrimination;&#xD;
      perceived lack of control over getting hypertension in the future; limited social support;&#xD;
      and low motivation to change behaviors. Activating the emotional and task areas of the brain&#xD;
      are hypothesized to improve self-management behaviors. The purpose of this study is to test&#xD;
      the effects of a promising new self-management intervention for AAs, a Mindfulness Attitude&#xD;
      to Deliver the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (MAD DASH) that departs from&#xD;
      conventional interventions to address prehypertension by combining two self-management&#xD;
      interventions (Mindfulness and DASH) in a group setting. Teaching mindfulness; a form of&#xD;
      meditation and the DASH diet to participants is expected to result in a reduction in blood&#xD;
      pressure as compared to usual care or DASH diet education alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HTN), known as the &quot;silent killer&quot; affects 1 in 3 adults in the United States&#xD;
      at a cost of $50 billion annually and disproportionately affects African Americans (AA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant proportion of the AA population is living with blood pressures consistent with&#xD;
      the clinical criteria for prehypertension or hypertension and many are untreated and&#xD;
      undiagnosed. AAs with prehypertension have a 35% greater risk of progressing to hypertension&#xD;
      than whites. Salt sensitivity, chronic stress and stress related to racism/discrimination,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, motivation, and activation are among the factors associated with pre-HTN in&#xD;
      AAs. The prevention of the progression from prehypertension to hypertension through sodium&#xD;
      reduction, stress management, and physical activity are a part of the evidence based&#xD;
      treatment, but the efficacy of self-management interventions for pre-HTN in AAs is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is the gold standard for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of hypertension yet in many studies, it was reported that AAs were less likely to&#xD;
      adhere to the DASH intervention as compared to whites. The barriers to self-management&#xD;
      reported by AAs include stress, including perceived stress related to racism/discrimination;&#xD;
      perceived lack of control over getting hypertension in the future; limited social support;&#xD;
      and low motivation to change behaviors. AAs who perceive stress as the cause of their&#xD;
      hypertension are less likely to engage in self-management behaviors. If the brain is in a&#xD;
      prolonged state of stress, then the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) activity is&#xD;
      compromised leading to allostatic load (wear and tear of chronic stress on the body)&#xD;
      increased accumulation of abdominal fat, atrophy of nerve cells in the hippocampus, and&#xD;
      hypertension. The interventions used in large hypertension trials do not adequately address&#xD;
      chronic stress and effects of racism/discrimination and cognitive mediators (self-efficacy,&#xD;
      motivation, activation, decision making, and health information) that hinder the practice of&#xD;
      self-management behaviors in AAs. In addition, none of these DASH intervention studies in AAs&#xD;
      have included mindfulness, a strategy that has been widely applied across clinical&#xD;
      populations to manage obesity, BP, and depression and to motivate patients on a brain level,&#xD;
      not just the task level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-management interventions that activate relevant areas of the brain are needed to&#xD;
      optimize the adaption of health behaviors. There are two distinctively anti-correlated&#xD;
      networks in the brain: analytic brain processing and emotional brain processing that&#xD;
      influence self-management behaviors. The analytic brain processing center, located in the&#xD;
      prefrontal and parietal areas of the brain is activated during attention demanding tasks&#xD;
      (skills, knowledge, and self-monitoring). In contrast, the emotional brain processing center&#xD;
      located in the posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices is activated during wakeful&#xD;
      rest (emotion management, social cognition, and self-awareness). As the activation of the&#xD;
      analytic brain processing center increases, the emotional brain processing center decreases.&#xD;
      Thus, a more comprehensive approach that engages both analytic brain processing and emotional&#xD;
      brain processing is hypothesized to help AAs to improve motivation, activation and&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and garner the necessary social support to succeed in the management of&#xD;
      prehypertension. The investigators will test the effects of a promising new self-management&#xD;
      intervention for AAs, a Mindfulness Attitude to Deliver the Dietary Approach to Stop&#xD;
      Hypertension (MAD DASH) that departs from conventional interventions to address&#xD;
      prehypertension by combining two self-management interventions (Mindfulness and DASH) in a&#xD;
      group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Purpose, specific aims and/or hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this is to gather pilot data to inform a future study using the following&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether there are differences in sodium intake, blood pressure (BP), and&#xD;
           health related quality of quality of life (HRQoL), among those who receive the analytic&#xD;
           component (DASH diet education only), emotional component (MAD-DASH mindfulness plus&#xD;
           DASH diet education) compared to those receiving usual care (DASH pamphlet).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine whether patient activation, motivation, decision-making, self-efficacy, and&#xD;
           health information mediate the relationship between the MAD DASH mindfulness&#xD;
           intervention and self-management behaviors (diet, self-monitoring, and physical&#xD;
           activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if social support, demographics (gender), and allostatic load moderate the&#xD;
           proximal (diet, physical activity) or distal (BP, sodium, and HRQoL) outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore differences in brain activation (fMRI) cortical networks, and HPA Axis/stress&#xD;
           function (cortisol) among MAD DASH intervention, DASH education only intervention, and&#xD;
           usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3) Background and significance The investigators hypothesize that the MAD DASH&#xD;
           intervention will improve the participant's neural brain processing through diet&#xD;
           education and self-monitoring and the emotional brain processing level through&#xD;
           meditation, deep breathing, and monitoring emotions to promote prehypertension&#xD;
           self-management behaviors (diet, self-monitoring, managing emotions, and physical&#xD;
           activity). The investigators further hypothesize that these behaviors will lead to a&#xD;
           reduction in blood pressure mediated through the HPA axis functioning and stress&#xD;
           response (systematic inflammatory effects), cognitive mediators (self-efficacy,&#xD;
           decision-making, motivation, health information, and activation), and contextual factors&#xD;
           (social support, demographics, allostatic load) to modify the effects of interventions&#xD;
           on proximal (increased fruits and vegetables, decreased sodium intake, increased&#xD;
           physical activity) and distal (BP, sodium, HRQoL, cost) outcomes. These mechanisms are&#xD;
           hypothesized to lead to performance of self-management behaviors, which in turn are&#xD;
           expected to lead to subsequent reductions in sodium intake, BP, and improved HRQoL The&#xD;
           MAD DASH intervention is likely to improve health behaviors due to integration&#xD;
           Mindfulness practice is a non-judgmental self-awareness of emotions, sensations, and&#xD;
           cognitions. Mindfulness is believed to affect self-management through self-regulation of&#xD;
           responses, acceptance of emotions (e.g., stress, anxiety, and depression), and&#xD;
           self-control of emotions---that interfere with the person's ability to practice health&#xD;
           behavior management. Improvements in HRQoL are also associated with mindfulness&#xD;
           practices. The MAD DASH eight-session intervention will include body scan exercise&#xD;
           (lying down or sitting with eyes closed to deliberately focus on sensations within the&#xD;
           body), sitting meditation, and yoga exercises along with self-management education&#xD;
           (self-monitoring of sodium intake, physical activity) to incorporate strategies to&#xD;
           reduce sodium intake, manage emotions, and increase physical activity. There may no&#xD;
           direct benefit to subjects, however participation may provide data which will provide&#xD;
           insight into ways African Americans can reduce their blood pressure and improve their&#xD;
           overall health. Understanding both the biological and psychosocial factors contributing&#xD;
           to blood pressure control in African American adults is timely as the population is&#xD;
           expected to grow over 9.9 million by 2050 and substantial disparities in health outcomes&#xD;
           exist in this population. Findings from this study have the potential to elucidate&#xD;
           factors contributing to these disparities in health outcomes in African Americans by&#xD;
           better characterization of the neurobiological mechanisms for self-management of&#xD;
           prehypertension.&#xD;
