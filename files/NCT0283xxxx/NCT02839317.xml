  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of CD could be different according to age at onset of CD symptoms. Indeed we know&#xD;
      that some very young patients at CD diagnosis have particular genetic variants as&#xD;
      abnormalities of the IL10R that are regarded as quite monogenic disease. In the other way,&#xD;
      the microbiota also undergoes substantial changes at the extremes of life, in infants and&#xD;
      older people and the ramifications of which are very few being explored. The comparison of&#xD;
      microbiota by principal component analysis and genetic profile of patients with CD beginning&#xD;
      at the extremes of life could help us to better known physiopathology of CD according to age&#xD;
      and provide arguments that CD beginning at the extremes of life could be different diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to ascertain through population-based study the hypothesis that gut&#xD;
      microbiota is different between paediatric-onset and elderly-onset CD patients in relation&#xD;
      with genetic and environmental mechanisms. The results will provide a better knowledge of the&#xD;
      etiopathogenic ways in CD and propose a personalized therapeutic care based on age at CD&#xD;
      onset (i.e. according to the gut bacteria involved).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to describe by principal component analysis and compare the gut microbiota&#xD;
      between subgroups of paediatric-onset (n=75), elderly-onset CD patients (n=75) and control&#xD;
      subjects (75 paediatric control and 75 elderly control subjects matched on age) without an a&#xD;
      priori approach of high throughput sequencing of bacterial DNA. As it has been shown that the&#xD;
      type of IBD-associated dysbiosis depends on ileal involvement, Paediatric-onset and&#xD;
      elderly-onset CD patients will be stratified according this parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (I) Find specific bacteria involved in paediatric- and elderly-onset patients using PLS&#xD;
           Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) that is a classical PLS regression (with a regression&#xD;
           mode) but where the response variable is categorical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (II) Search for an association between bacterial dysbiosis and different genetic&#xD;
           backgrounds in patients according to age at CD onset (paediatric-onset vs elderly-onset)&#xD;
           and in control subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (III) Quantify of bacteria with invasive properties (E. coli, including&#xD;
           adherent-invasive E.coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter), and fecal&#xD;
           fungal flora (Candida albicans, in particular) and their association with genetic and&#xD;
           serological profiles according to age at CD onset and in control subjects; this study&#xD;
           will include the comparison of the gut microbiome between subgroups of paediatric-onset,&#xD;
           elderly-onset CD patients and control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (IV) Study of environmental risk factors using a questionnaire to be submitted to CD&#xD;
           patients and control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results would provide a better knowledge of the etiopathogenic ways in CD and would&#xD;
      downstream open the way towards clinical trials focused on specific microbiota disorders&#xD;
      according to age at CD onset. This project will help to decipher the potential involvement of&#xD;
      specific bacteria in the physiopathology of CD. This could lead to the development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies either using optimized current treatments targeting bacteria. Data&#xD;
      from clinical trials which for the great majority rarely include paediatric patients and set&#xD;
      an upper limit for study eligibility at 65 years of age are thus focusing on adult-onset&#xD;
      disease. Thus the potential specificities of paediatric- and elderly-onset diseases are not&#xD;
      taken into account. A better knowledge of characteristics of CD at the extreme of life will&#xD;
      be important to set up innovative clinical trials including specific therapeutics adapted to&#xD;
      patients where disease occurred at the extreme age of life, especially as these patients did&#xD;
      not benefited of specific trials. The ultimate goal is a better quality of care delivered to&#xD;
      paediatric- and elderly-onset CD patients.&#xD;
