  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the nature of the change in oral and gut bacterial&#xD;
      resistance profiles after antibiotic therapy for a surgical procedure in two groups. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive a course of amoxicillin and analgesics after surgical&#xD;
      extraction and have bacterial samples taken from saliva, tongue coatings and stool samples at&#xD;
      four appointments over a period of six months. This will be compared to the control group&#xD;
      which receive only analgesics after the surgical extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An examination of the development and sustainability of antibiotic resistance in the oral and&#xD;
      gut microbiome of healthy cohorts will be followed up for 6 months, after surgical extraction&#xD;
      of impacted teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in proportion of antibiotic resistant bacterial components will be studied using&#xD;
      Metagenomic DNA sequencing and quantification of resistant genes .&#xD;

      Trial Design This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, cohort study investigating&#xD;
      young adults undergoing surgical extraction of a wisdom tooth with and without antibiotics&#xD;
      post-operatively. The prescription of antibiotics will be based on clinical judgment based on&#xD;
      case complexity, trauma and length of procedure. No randomization will be performed. Four&#xD;
      observational time points will be undertaken for collecting 3 bacterial samples (tongue&#xD;
      coating, saliva and stool sample at: baseline, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To survey the extent and persistence of a range of bacterial resistance genes within the oral&#xD;
      and gut microbiota of a cohort of systemically healthy young adults before and after the&#xD;
      surgical extraction of third molars who receive and do not receive amoxicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis It is anticipated that a single course of amoxicillin (250 mg three times daily&#xD;
      for five days) prescribed after a surgical tooth extraction, such as an impacted third molar,&#xD;
      alters the short-term and long-term antibiotic resistance profile and causes a significant&#xD;
      shift in the composition of the oral and gut resistome in a healthy cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From analysis of the bacterial resistance, comparison from the baseline data over time will&#xD;
      give insight on the impact of increased antibacterial resistance. Understanding of this&#xD;
      should help pave the way for determining guidelines for the rational prescription of&#xD;
      antibiotics for dental surgical clinical procedures and so form a basis for antibiotic&#xD;
      stewardship as well as determine a potential risk to benefit awareness when prescribing&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This baseline data can be followed-up in a longer timeframe to examine the persistence of&#xD;
      resistance genes over time in a later study. It is expected a significant number of patients&#xD;
      will be from student cohorts at HKU which will make later recall straightforward. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to keep a record log of antibiotic consumption after the initial study that may&#xD;
      inform later research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects scheduled for surgical extractions who give a written consent to be a part of the&#xD;
      study will be recruited. An experienced clinical operator with specialist maxillofacial&#xD;
      surgery training (ML Co-A) will be responsible for performing clinical treatment.&#xD;
      Prescription of antibiotics will be based on case complexity, difficulty of the operative&#xD;
      surgical procedure and time taken. Therefore patients will not be randomized but based on&#xD;
      obtaining 10 patients in each group. Three sets of samples (Saliva, tongue dorsum scrapings&#xD;
      and stool samples) will be collected at the following four time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be asked to refrain from brushing their teeth the night before sample&#xD;
      collection is to be performed and similarly asked not to use dental mouthwashes. Apart from&#xD;
      collection time points, subjects will be asked to maintain their 'normal', routine oral&#xD;
      hygiene procedures for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection of the baseline samples the surgical extraction of the third molar tooth&#xD;
      will be performed. The subject will be given post extraction instructions and analgesics for&#xD;
      pain relief for all the subjects and Amoxicillin for those requiring antibiotics. Compliance&#xD;
      will be checked for by asking the patient and checking the tablet wrapper strips of&#xD;
      amoxicillin at the recall appointments. The subject will be asked to refrain from using any&#xD;
      mouth rinse during the six month study period (if they did not already do so) and a&#xD;
      toothpaste without antibacterial content will be provided for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tongue coating, saliva and stool samples for DNA extraction will be collected at all the&#xD;
      specified time points as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline- antibiotic group On the day of surgery Baseline- no antibiotic On the day of&#xD;
      surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 month 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from the oral cavity will be taken in the morning at least two hours after meals.&#xD;
      Subjects will be advised to collect the stool samples within 24 hours of the scheduled&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sterile micro brush will be used to collect the tongue coatings The tongue coating sample&#xD;
      will be taken after stroking the surface of the tongue for three times from the back to the&#xD;
      front side on one half of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue for each time point of&#xD;
      sampling. After the sample collection, the tip of the micro brush will be cut and placed&#xD;
      inside an Eppendorf vial. The samples will be stored at -800C until DNA extraction is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the saliva samples, the subject will be asked to spit out into a sterile container which&#xD;
      will be immediately transferred into ice and then stored at - 800C. Collection of the stool&#xD;
      samples will be performed based on the guidelines for stool sample collection given for the&#xD;
      human microbiome project (16). DNA extraction will be performed from the samples using the&#xD;
      DNA extraction kit provided by (Qiagen, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomic shotgun sequencing For metagenomic sequencing extracted genomic DNA will be&#xD;
      physically sheared to an average fragment size of 250 bp. The fragmented gDNA will be&#xD;
      sequenced bi-directionally (100 bp each direction) on a lane of an Illumina HighSeq. Quality&#xD;
      filtering will be performed with Trimmomatic (17), after which the paired and unpaired&#xD;
      forward reads will be combined and reads with more than 10% ambiguous bases will be removed.&#xD;
      Next, the reads will be screened for human sequences with Best Match Tagger v3.101 (18),&#xD;
      after which human reads and duplicate reads will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative abundance of resistant genes The blaTEM primer used will be as described by Kim et&#xD;
      al (22). Primers to analyze the presence of erm (G), erm (B) and erm (F) resistance genes&#xD;
      will be as described by Jansonn et al (23). Primers for Tet (M) and Tet (W) genes will as&#xD;
      described by Diaz-Torez et al (24). 16S universal primers will be used for the relative&#xD;
      quantification as a standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 The relative gene abundance will be assessed using real time PCR. Conventional PCR&#xD;
      reactions will be used to generate gene-specific amplicons used as template DNA standards for&#xD;
      qPCR. Amplicons will be purified using a gel/PCR extraction kit QIAquick PCR Purification Kit&#xD;
      (Qiagen, USA) and quantified fluorometrically using a Quant-iTTM PicoGreenÂ® dsDNA Assay Kit&#xD;
      (Invitrogen). The number of DNA molecules will be calculated based on the size and mass of&#xD;
      the amplicons. Tenfold serial dilutions of the amplicons will be prepared and used following&#xD;
      the procedure by Yu et al. (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects Patients will be recruited from the waiting list from&#xD;
      the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, The University of Hong Kong who have been clinically&#xD;
      screened and wish to have their impacted wisdom teeth removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size We would present the outcome in log 10 scale compared to day 0 in community DNA&#xD;
      extracted from fecal samples. From the previous study (15), we anticipate the standard&#xD;
      deviation as 1.25 units. By the sample size determination with the use of software G*Power&#xD;
      version 3.1.9.2 (Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany), we would need at least 8 per group&#xD;
      to have a power of 0.8 to detect the 1.25 unit difference at the 0.05 significance level.&#xD;
      Therefore, in this research, we collect total sample size as 16 (8 per group) in the initial&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Subjects This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, cohort study&#xD;
      investigating young adults undergoing surgical extraction of a wisdom tooth with and without&#xD;
      antibiotics post-operatively. Antibiotics and analgesics will be given post- operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amoxicillin Intra orally, three times daily 250 mg for 5 days Analgesics - Arcoxia 120mg for&#xD;
      three days and Paracetamol 500 mg QID PRN for 3 days or Paracetamol 1 g Plus 16 mg Codeine&#xD;
      Phosphate. The prescription of antibiotics will be based on clinical judgment based on case&#xD;
      complexity, trauma and length of procedure. No 14 randomization will be performed. Four&#xD;
      observational time points will be undertaken for collecting 3 bacterial samples (tongue&#xD;
      coating, mouth rinse and stool sample at: baseline, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patients have to take additional antibiotics in the review period of six months, they&#xD;
      will be asked to inform the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance will be checked for by asking the patient and checking the tablet wrapper strips&#xD;
      of amoxicillin at the recall appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Efficacy The study is not looking into the efficacy of a new drug. The&#xD;
      treatment procedures being carried out are according to the conventional treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Safety The study is not looking to the safety of a new drug. The treatment&#xD;
      procedures being carried out are according to the conventional treatment protocol.&#xD;

    <description>Resistome analysis Changes in the (relative) concentration of total resistance genes (the resistome) in the metagenomic DNA sequences will be analyzed as follows: Antibiotic resistance genes will be downloaded from the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (20). The downloaded dataset (ardbAnno1.0), containing 7828 entries, will be made non-redundant first and UBLAST from USEARCH v7.0.1090 (20) will be used to map the reads to the (ARDB) proteins (E-value threshold 10, post-filtered to include hits with a maximum E-value of 1E-10 inclusive).&#xD;
The results will be processed with HUMAN (21) to assign weights to the proteins. These weights were then normalized by dividing by the total number of filtered (non-human) reads, and summarized per antibiotic resistance type in the resistome. Next, fold changes will calculated for all resistance types with a baseline weight larger than 1E-8.</description>
