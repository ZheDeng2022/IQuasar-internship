    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy of real-time ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance on spinal anesthesia vs the traditional anatomical landmark technique, by comparing&#xD;
      success rate of spinal needle insertion, success rate rate of single needle pass, duration&#xD;
      and immediate complications.&#xD;

      Research hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ultrasound guidance will lead to a significantly different success rate of paramedian&#xD;
           spinal needle insertion, as well as the success rate of single-needle-pass when patient&#xD;
           lying in lateral position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasound guidance of paramedian spinal anaesthesia has a different rate of&#xD;
           complication of spinal anaesthesia, e.g. postdural puncture headache and bloody taps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound guidance of paramedian spinal anaesthesia will cause a significant different&#xD;
           in duration of giving spinal anaesthesia, compared to non ultrasound guided technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound guidance in neuraxial blockade has been shown to be superior to palpation in&#xD;
      correctly identifying lumbar intervertebral level, as well as improve efficiency and reduce&#xD;
      complication of spinal anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paramedian approach to the subarachnoid spaces is useful in situations where the patient's&#xD;
      anatomy does not favor the midline approach, e.g., inability to flex the spine or heavily&#xD;
      calcified interspinous ligaments. Studies have shown that choice of midline or paramedian&#xD;
      approach did not affect the success rate of the subarachnoid puncture in general. Therefore,&#xD;
      this is a technique that worth to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthopedic surgeries involving lower limbs are a common, in which many of the patients might&#xD;
      be unable to sit up due to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is mainly focused to access the optimal approach of doing paramedian approach of&#xD;
      spinal anaesthesia in the condition when patient is lying lateral, in lower limb surgeries,&#xD;
      as there is no local data that is available for our population. This will help to improve&#xD;
      quality of anaesthesia in terms of patient satisfaction, as well as reduce complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting: Operation theater, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. Time frame: 12 months&#xD;
      Population : Patients undergoing elective or emergency lower limb surgeries. On-site audit:&#xD;
      Human Research Ethics Committee USM (HREC) Standard Operating Procedures will be according to&#xD;
      guidelines of Human Research Ethics Committee USM (HREC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was guided by Dr. Yee Cheng Kueh (Lecturer, Unit of Biostatistics and&#xD;
      Research Methodology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia) using Power and&#xD;
      Sample size calculation software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was based on previous literature by WANG et al comparing Real-time&#xD;
      Ultrasound-assisted And Non-ultrasound-assisted Approach in combined spinal-epidural puncture&#xD;
      obese patient. Sample size was calculated for primary outcome 1 (success rate of spinle&#xD;
      needle insertion) and 2 (success rate of single needle pass), and secondary outcome 1&#xD;
      (duration for successful dural puncture and duration for procedure). The largest sample size&#xD;
      was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After approval from Human Research Ethics Committee USM (HREC), patient will be selected&#xD;
           according to inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria during preoperative assessment, from&#xD;
           emergency or elective OT list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explain procedure to patient and get the written consent from patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Consented patients will be randomized into 2 arm: group U (ultrasound guided) and group&#xD;
           P (anatomical landmark technique by palpation) using block randomization method and&#xD;
           allocation concealment as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  6 ballot cards will be put inside the envelope. Each of the cards state 6 different&#xD;
                sequences of grouping (UUPP, PPUU, UPUP, PUPU, UPPU, and PUUP).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 card will be randomly taken each time by the nurse who assists anaesthesia to&#xD;
                decide the group for the first four patients. This will be followed by other cards&#xD;
                until all 6 sequences are completed. This means that at the end of 6 randomized&#xD;
                sequences, there will be an equal 12 patients in each groups with the total number&#xD;
                of 24 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The randomization will be continued again as above until the total samples of&#xD;
                collection are completed. (15x4 =60)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The monitoring of all patients will be standardized :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Heart Rate (HR)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oxygen saturation , SPO2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hemodynamic parameters such as systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
           (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) will be recorded before procedure,&#xD;
           and post spinal 1min, 3 min, 5 min &amp; 10 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient will then be positioned laterally with the operation limb on the dependent site.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. In the ultrasound group, a pre-procedural scan of the lumbar spine will be&#xD;
                performed using portable ultrasound machine, Mindray M5 (Mindray, Shenzhen, China)&#xD;
                with 2.5-3.0 MHz transducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
                After aseptic skin preparation and draping, the convex 2.5-3.0MHz transducer will&#xD;
                be covered with a sterile sheath. Sterile ultrasound gel will be used for&#xD;
                transducer-skin contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
                When the preferred lumbar interspace is in view on monitor, local anaesthetic&#xD;
                (lignocaine 2% 2-3ml) will be infiltrated to the skin and underlying tissue 1-2 cm&#xD;
                lateral to the identified spinous process. Under real-time ultrasound guidance, a&#xD;
                spinal needle introducer is then inserted in-plane to the ultrasound probe,&#xD;
                followed by A 25G Pencan® pencil point spinal needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The backflow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will confirmed a successful dural&#xD;
                puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In the palpation group, the puncture site will be identified by palpation. The site&#xD;
                where Tuffier's line (imaginary line between the iliac crests) crossed the spine is&#xD;
                identified as level of L4 and the L3-4 or L4-L5 intervertebral space is chosen as&#xD;
                the puncture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once dural puncture is obtained, 2.5ml of isobaric bupivacaine and 25mcg of preservative-free&#xD;
      fentanyl was injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using SPSS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For primary outcome 1 (success rate of spinle needle insertion), data obtained in the study&#xD;
      will be analyzed with uncorrected chi-square test for comparison between Group Ultrasound and&#xD;
      Group Palpation. Fisher's exact test was used in cases where assumption of Chi square was not&#xD;
      met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For primary outcome 2 (success rate of single needle pass), data obtained in the study will&#xD;
      be analyzed with uncorrected chi-square test for comparison between Group Ultrasound and&#xD;
      Group Palpation. Fisher's exact test was used in cases where assumption of Chi square was not&#xD;
      met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary outcome 1 (duration for successful dural puncture and duration for procedure),&#xD;
      data obtained will be analyzed with independent t-test for comparison of duration between&#xD;
      Group Ultrasound and Group Palpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary outcome 2 (immediate complication), data obtained will be analyzed&#xD;
      descriptively as sample size will be too big to significantly compare the complication rates&#xD;
      and was not cost effective.&#xD;
