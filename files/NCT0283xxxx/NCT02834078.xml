  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the International Diabetes Federation, one in every 12 individuals is a diabetic&#xD;
      (about 8% of the world population). Major risk factors of diabetes are all the aspects of&#xD;
      modern life which include obesity, over-weight, high-risk behavior like smoking, alcohol,&#xD;
      multiple drug use-recreational or prescribed, environmental risk factors like inactivity and&#xD;
      lack of exercise. However there is a window of opportunity between health and disease, which&#xD;
      is pre-diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-diabetes has been defined by American Diabetes Association as Impaired Glucose Tolerance&#xD;
      (IGT) which is 7.8 -11.0 mmol/l, Impaired Fasting Glucose Test (IFT) which is 5.6-6.9mmol/l&#xD;
      and now added Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 5.7% to 6.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though there are plenty of drugs available for significantly impaired glucose metabolism&#xD;
      (including oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin), their use in marginally impaired glucose&#xD;
      metabolism is questionable due to risk of untoward hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, herbal products like curcumin, as a single ingredient has poor&#xD;
      bioavailability problem that restricts its use as standalone treatment. Inulin works as&#xD;
      pre-biotic and help to maintain gut microbiota which is considered as precursor for progress&#xD;
      of prediabetes to diabetes. However, it does not have any role in primary pathophysiology of&#xD;
      impaired glucose metabolism, i.e. pancreatic β cell dysfunction, insulin resistance, hepatic&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis or intestinal glucose absorption. Resveratrol and omega-3 basically work on&#xD;
      anti-oxidant pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of these popular ingredients has been studied for their role in structural and&#xD;
      functional health of pancreatic β cells which is very important for prediction of further&#xD;
      progress of marginally impaired glucose metabolism to significantly impaired glucose&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an unmet need to develop a product which not only improves insulin sensitivity, but&#xD;
      also help to preserve the structural and functional health of pancreatic β cells. It also&#xD;
      needs to improve overall metabolic and endothelial health of the person considering the close&#xD;
      association between impaired glucose metabolism and these parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed supplement - &quot;Berberine GlucoGold &quot;- is an improved version of successfully&#xD;
      marketed supplement - Berberine GlucoDefense. It has a balanced composition in which all the&#xD;
      ingredients complement each other in such a way that along with the individual role in&#xD;
      glucose metabolism it also takes care of overall bioavailability and stability of the&#xD;
      supplement. As per the previous data on ingredients, the supplement is also expected to&#xD;
      preserve the structural and functional health of pancreatic β cells. The ingredients are also&#xD;
      known to have positive effect on overall metabolic and endothelial health. Thus BGG has been&#xD;
      developed to address the unmet needs in the area of glucose metabolism and overall metabolic&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
