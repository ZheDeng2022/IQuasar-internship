  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 15% to 30% of patients with venous leg ulcers have a peripheral arterial disease (PAD)&#xD;
      associated. The compression band is still a controversial issue in this context. It allows&#xD;
      the reduction of venous hypertension and edema, but it could potentially degrade the arterial&#xD;
      infusion of high levels of compression. The French High Authority for Health (HAS) defines&#xD;
      mixed ulcers by IPS between 0.5 and 0.9. Investigators distinguish mixed ulcers blood&#xD;
      predominance for IPS between 0.5 and 0.7; and mixed ulcers predominantly venous blood with&#xD;
      moderate involvement for IPS values between 0.7 and 0.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that IPS&gt; 0.8 allowed a high compression, between 30 and 40 mmHg.&#xD;
      In the case of mixed ulcers with IPS between 0.6 and 0.8, the HAS recommends using a lighter&#xD;
      compression, bit by elastic bands (exercising low power compression at rest) under medical&#xD;
      supervision, informing the patient to remove the bandage if pain or aggravation. It is&#xD;
      therefore necessary to adapt the compression therapy in case of venous ulcers associated with&#xD;
      arterial disease by providing a lower compression 30 mmHg short stretch. For HAS, IPS &lt;0.6&#xD;
      against indicates compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study showed that compression bit elastic bands could not only improve venous&#xD;
      return, but it would also increase the distal arterial flow in a patient population with&#xD;
      mixed ulcers. In this study, 25 patients had between IPS 0.5 and 0.8; or for certain patients&#xD;
      below the threshold of 0.6 indicates that against a compression according to HAS. To our&#xD;
      knowledge this is the only study that has examined the effect of compression on blood&#xD;
      perfusion.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Principal: Study the distal arterial infusion in a patient population with mixed ulcers&#xD;
           under compression leg with little elastic bands&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: To evaluate the safety of the little compression elastic band in a mixed&#xD;
           population of patients with leg ulcers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study non-interventional prospective single-center that evaluates professional practice&#xD;
           from 25 patients with mixed leg ulcers and followed in the vascular medicine department&#xD;
           of St. Joseph Hospital Group Paris.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Applying a bit compression elastic bandages to a pressure level between 30 and 40mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anonymous data reports on the grid standardized collection, by a numbering system from 1&#xD;
           to 30 and then captured on a computer file&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age, risk factors and cardiovascular history of the patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age, ulcer description&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Palpation of pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  morphological vascular profile of patients with arterial and venous Doppler dating&#xD;
                less than a year,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Series following data before installation, 10 minutes after application and 24&#xD;
                hours after installation of the inelastic compression:&#xD;
&#xD;
                o Evaluation of tolerance:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  measurement of pain numeric scale (NS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  description of the skin condition of the leg by a dermatologist, seeking signs of&#xD;
                suffering skin after application of compression: possible appearance of erythema,&#xD;
                cyanosis, purpura. A search particularly in areas of bony prominences and the banks&#xD;
                of the ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
                o distal arterial pressures of the compression carrier leg:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IPS (systolic pressure index): ankle and arm pressures will be measured with a cuff&#xD;
                and a continuous Doppler. GPI is calculated by dividing the lowest pressure at the&#xD;
                ankle (at the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery) by the humeral pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transcutaneous Oxygen Pressure (TcPO2) o Measuring pressure exerted by low elastic&#xD;
                bandages by Kikuhime® system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of bad tolerance of compression at any time after installation, the compression will&#xD;
      be removed and the study stopped for the patient in question. Poor tolerance is defined by an&#xD;
      increase in pain than or equal to 2 points on the digital scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      expected benefits for patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstration of good tolerance, defined as no worsening of the skin condition and the&#xD;
           lack of increase in pain associated with inelastic compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstration of no worsening of arterial infusion by inelastic compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of improved distal arterial hemodynamics (increased IPS and tcpO2) with a&#xD;
           little elastic compression, which validate the results of the only study ever conducted&#xD;
           on the subject.&#xD;
