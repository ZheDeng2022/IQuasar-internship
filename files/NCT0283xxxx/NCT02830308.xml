  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many endocrine and metabolic-related conditions. Two well-known disorders include&#xD;
      diabetes and thyroid disease. Some of these diseases are caused by a change in genes.&#xD;
      Researchers want to identify the genes involved in these disorders. They hope this will help&#xD;
      them learn more about these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about conditions that affect the hormone-secreting glands (endocrine glands) in&#xD;
      adults. To train doctors to diagnose and treat people with endocrine or metabolic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 years and older with a known or suspected endocrine disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatives ages 18 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors will review all requests and available medical records to determine final eligibility&#xD;
      for the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most participants will have 1 visit, and may have follow up visits if necessary. They may&#xD;
      have tests, surgery, or other procedures to help diagnose or treat their condition. These&#xD;
      could include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and saliva tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging tests. These may include X-ray, ultrasound, or scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits with other specialists at NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide blood, urine, saliva, or tissue samples. Some of these samples may&#xD;
      be stored in the freezer for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to participate in genetic testing. They will give a blood or saliva&#xD;
      sample for this.&#xD;

      This is an observational protocol designed to collect data from adult subjects with known or&#xD;
      suspected endocrine or metabolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: The overall purpose of endocrine evaluations under this protocol is to increase&#xD;
      knowledge of endocrine or metabolic diseases. Adults with known or suspected endocrine or&#xD;
      metabolic-related condition(s) may be evaluated under this protocol for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collection of data for endocrine related conditions (case reports, case series)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collection of data for future research&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collection of samples, including leftover samples from clinically indicated tests, for&#xD;
           future research (including genomics)&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Patients will undergo a history and physical exam, anthropometrics, vital signs and&#xD;
      endocrine laboratory studies.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known or suspected endocrine disorder age 18 years and older are&#xD;
             eligible for this protocol. Protocol investigators will make the actual selection of&#xD;
             patients most appropriate for clinical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relatives ages 18 years and older may be enrolled if clinically indicated for the&#xD;
             diagnosis of a proband.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone under the age of 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical, physical, psychiatric, or social conditions, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, would make participation in this protocol not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient, will exclude participation. Patients who are critically ill, unstable, or&#xD;
             with severe organ failure that may affect/limit the endocrine evaluation and place&#xD;
             unsustainable demands on Clinical Center or NICHD resources will be excluded.&#xD;
