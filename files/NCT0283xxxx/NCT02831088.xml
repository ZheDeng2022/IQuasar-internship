  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy and safety of Neu2000, a multi-target drug designed to prevent both NMDA&#xD;
      receptor-mediated excitotoxicity and free radical toxicity, will be investigated in acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke patients receiving endovascular treatment to remove clot within 8 hours&#xD;
      following stroke onset. Neu2000KWL will be administered before endovascular treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neu2000 was designed as a multi-target neuroprotectant preventing both the NMDA receptor, a&#xD;
      Ca2+-permeable glutamate receptor, and free radicals, two major routes of brain cell death in&#xD;
      stroke. Neu2000 is a moderate NR2B-selective NMDA receptor antagonist and spin trapping&#xD;
      molecule (=free radical scavenger or antioxidant). Therapeutic potential of Neu2000 has been&#xD;
      well demonstrated in four animal models of stroke with better efficacy and therapeutic time&#xD;
      windows than either NMDA receptor antagonist or anti-oxidant advanced to clinical trials. In&#xD;
      human phase I studies of 165 healthy subjects conducted in the United States and China,&#xD;
      Neu2000KWL showed promising safety profiles without any serious adverse events up to a single&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of 6000 mg that is far beyond the therapeutic target dose determined in&#xD;
      animal models of transient ischemic stroke. Very recently, acute endovascular recanalization&#xD;
      therapy has been introduced as the new standard care of care in acute ischemic stroke. The&#xD;
      present study is aimed to examine efficacy and safety of Neu2000KWL in acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      patients receiving endovascular thrombectomy within 8 hours of stroke onset.&#xD;
