  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of supratherapeutic exposures&#xD;
      of ALS-008176 on the QT/ corrected QT interval (QTc) interval in healthy participants (Panel&#xD;
      2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part Phase 1 study consisting of a dose escalation part (Part 1) and a TQT part&#xD;
      (Part 2), performed in two separate panels (Panels 1 and 2). Panel 1 will be a double blind&#xD;
      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is&#xD;
      receiving), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), placebo&#xD;
      controlled dose escalation study in healthy participants to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ALS-008176 after administration of single doses of 1500&#xD;
      milligrams (mg), 2500 mg and 3000 mg under fasted conditions. The final dose to be used in&#xD;
      the Panel 2 will be determined based on the results of this dose escalation part. An interim&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted on Panel 1 to select the dose for Panel 2. Panel 2 will be a&#xD;
      double blind, double dummy, randomized, 3 period crossover (the same medications provided to&#xD;
      all participants but in different sequence), placebo and positive controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of ALS-008176 on the QT/QTc interval in healthy participants.&#xD;
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
