  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxemia is a frequent situation in clinical practice, particularly in intensive care units&#xD;
      or perioperative. The mortality and morbidity increase for cardiovascular reason, due to&#xD;
      hypoxia has been reported several times. It is therefore important to detect hypoxemia very&#xD;
      early and with accuracy. The objective is to correct the causes quickly and thus avoid or&#xD;
      minimize complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the risks associated with hypoxemia, the monitoring of Arterial Oxygen&#xD;
      Saturation also avoids the adverse effects associated with hyperoxia. Indeed oxygen leads to&#xD;
      the formation of free radicals, which in physiological condition are regulated by antioxidant&#xD;
      mechanisms. However, in anesthesiology, it is common to find pathological situations (acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, shock, prolonged inflammatory state) where these regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms are overwhelmed. Oxygen administration to supra-physiological concentrations leads&#xD;
      to a formation of excessive free radicals, aggravating the existing injury (including lung).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen therapy is a fully-fledged treatment requiring monitoring of its effectiveness and&#xD;
      tolerance. Currently, the standard method for assessing oxygenation is the arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis with the Arterial Oxygen Saturation. Its cost and the need for an arterial blood&#xD;
      sample do not allow regular monitoring. Clinical evaluation of hypoxia is completely&#xD;
      unreliable. there is a third method : monitoring devices that measure Arterial Pulsed Oxygen&#xD;
      Saturation, called &quot;pulse oximeters.&quot; Pulse oximeters have become an integral and mandatory&#xD;
      part of the standard monitoring. It is through the measurement of Arterial Pulsed Oxygen&#xD;
      Saturation, supposed to reflect Arterial Oxygen Saturation, that clinicians guide their&#xD;
      therapeutic attitudes to optimize oxygenation and improve the prognosis of patients. So pulse&#xD;
      oximetry is a method considered reliable and especially non-invasive. It is less expensive&#xD;
      and does not require blood sampling. These qualities explain why these devices are easily&#xD;
      used in anesthesia, intensive care and in emergency situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, several studies have demonstrated the inaccuracy of Arterial Pulsed Oxygen&#xD;
      Saturation in frequent situations resuscitation (shock, sepsis, dark skin type). Thus, it is&#xD;
      necessary to objectify the benefits and limitations of pulse oximetry to optimize their use,&#xD;
      especially in these situations of high risk, where a discrepancy between the values measured&#xD;
      by the pulse oximetry and measurement of arterial blood saturation with oxygen gas can be&#xD;
      detrimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It exists several pulse oximetry devices, whose accuracy seems unequal, which necessitates a&#xD;
      comparative study.&#xD;
