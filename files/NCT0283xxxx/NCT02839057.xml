    <textblock>
      Fractures of the second cervical vertebra (C2) are the most common spinal fracture among the&#xD;
      elderly. Non-surgical treatment comprises of cervical collar treatment for 12 weeks, while&#xD;
      surgical treatment for elderly could mean posterior fixation C1-C2 without collar treatment&#xD;
      or anterior screw osteosynthesis C2 with 6 weeks of collar treatment. A meta-analysis of&#xD;
      retrospective studies has recently found an improved survival with surgical treatment. This&#xD;
      national registry study is designed to estimate the survival of non-surgical and surgical&#xD;
      treatment in a population-based cohort.&#xD;

      The Swedish National Patient Registry (NPR) is hosted by the Swedish Agency of Health and&#xD;
      Welfare and contains all patient contacts within Sweden with a coverage of &gt;90% for&#xD;
      orthopaedic diagnoses. Registered are main diagnosis and co-morbidity using the ICD-9 code&#xD;
      until 1996 and from 1997 onward ICD-10 codes. Treatment is coded since 1996 using the Swedish&#xD;
      classification of surgical procedures. Furthermore, information on hospitalisation time is&#xD;
      available from the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Swedish Cause of Death Registry (CDR) all deaths in Sweden are registered with date of&#xD;
      death and cause of death. While date of death coverage is complete, the cause of death has&#xD;
      only 46% agreement with the final hospital diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with the main diagnosis of C2 fracture (ICD-10: S12.1) treated between January&#xD;
      1st 1996 to December 31st 2014 are extracted from the NPR and merged with the CDR for&#xD;
      incident deaths. Prior to data transmission, the Swedish Agency of Health and Welfare&#xD;
      anonymised the individual personal identification numbers using a key which remained with the&#xD;
      Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invalid age data will be excluded either due to missing entries or mismatch with date of&#xD;
      death. Multiple admissions (cases with same identification number but more than 12 months&#xD;
      between admissions) and duplicate entries (cases with same identification number) will be&#xD;
      removed from the dataset, after valuable co-morbidity data from the duplicate entries were&#xD;
      stored in the original record. Duplicate entries originate from separate recordings from each&#xD;
      hospital if the patient is referred to a specialised hospital. Furthermore, primarily&#xD;
      non-surgically treated cases with a change of treatment modality are registered as surgical&#xD;
      patients. The registered hospitalisation time for these patients is the combined non-surgical&#xD;
      and surgical in-hospital treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each record the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is calculated. Using Swedish surgical&#xD;
      procedure codes for spinal fusion (&quot;NAG&quot;) and spinal osteosynthesis (&quot;NAJ&quot;) patients&#xD;
      receiving surgical treatment were marked, and the cohort divided into two groups receiving&#xD;
      non-surgical or surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age distribution differences of patients with C2-fractures treated surgically and&#xD;
      non-surgically was visualised with a density distribution plot. A logit logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis identified covariates of surgical treatment assignment and was presented with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (C.I.) and statistical probability p. Goodness-of-fit of the model was&#xD;
      presented with pseudo-r2 according to McFadden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the Kaplan-Meier method for non-surgical and surgical treatment mean survival, as well&#xD;
      as survival rate at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years was determined, and visualised using a&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier plot with 99% C.I. With the Cox proportional hazards regression method multiple&#xD;
      covariates contributing to survival are entered and hazard ratio (HR) presented with 95% C.I.&#xD;
      and probability p. As relevant covariates for survival besides surgical treatment age,&#xD;
      gender, spinal cord injury, and CCI were identified. Since the assumption was that the&#xD;
      medical advancement improved patient survival in general during the last decades, even year&#xD;
      of admission was included as covariate in the model. In order to identify a cut-off age where&#xD;
      a treatment modality is not associated anymore with greater survival the adjusted HR of a&#xD;
      certain age and above was plotted over age with 95% C.I.&#xD;
