      Study Objective The aim of the proposed study is to examine the effect of Q4 hour multidose&#xD;
      IV acetaminophen on patients' readiness for discharge. In doing so the investigators will&#xD;
      also investigate the various factors that could potentially contribute to a patient's&#xD;
      readiness for discharge such as overall opioid consumption, time to rescue medication,&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, pain scores, and perioperative stress markers&#xD;
      and their overall correlation with IV acetaminophen intake.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel study.. Patients&#xD;
      50kg or more will receive either 1000mg IV acetaminophen or placebo with the first dose given&#xD;
      preoperatively in the holding area followed by re-dosing every four hours from that point up&#xD;
      to a maximum of 4 doses or 4000mg in 24 hours. Patients &lt;50 kg will receive 12.5mg/kg to a&#xD;
      maximum of 75 mg /per kg/per day as per the label dose with repeat dosing Q4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After pre-oxygenation, general anesthesia will be induced with lidocaine (1 mg/kg Ideal Body&#xD;
      Weight), propofol (1-2 mg/kg Actual Body Weight), and fentanyl (up to 5 mcg/kg Actual Body&#xD;
      Weight). Additionally all subjects with receive 2 mg midazolam. Tracheal intubation will be&#xD;
      facilitated with rocuronium (0.6 - 1.2 mg/kg Actual Body Weight). Anesthesia will be&#xD;
      maintained with air/oxygen (60%/40%) and desflurane. A remifentanyl infusion&#xD;
      (0.05-2mcg/kg/min Ideal Body Weight) will be continued throughout the entire case with no&#xD;
      further analgesics being administered. All patients will receive ondansetron 4 mg prior to&#xD;
      the end of operation as well as additional antiemetics in the PACU as judged by the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Patients will be awakened and extubated in the OR meeting standard&#xD;
      extubation criteria. Once extubated all patients will then be transferred to the PACU where&#xD;
      they will be assessed via the SPEEDs criteria 5 minutes after arrival and then every 15&#xD;
      minutes for the duration of their PACU stay. While in the PACU, all patients will be assessed&#xD;
      for pain using the Visual Analog Scale. Pain will be treated as per our protocol with 0.2mg&#xD;
      IV hydromorphone for mild pain (VAS 1-3), 0.4 mg IV hydromorphone for moderate pain (VAS&#xD;
      4-6), and 0.6 mg IV hydromorphone (VAS 7-10). As soon as a patient meets all the SPEEDs&#xD;
      criteria he/she will be transferred to phase II of the recovery. In phase II, if need be,&#xD;
      pain will be managed according to the following orders: 0.2mg intravenous hydromorphone for&#xD;
      mild pain (VAS 1-3), 0.4 mg intravenous hydromorphone for moderate pain (VAS 4-6) and 0.6mg&#xD;
      intravenous hydromorphone for severe pain (VAS 7-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's readiness for discharge will be our primary outcome. Each patient will be&#xD;
      assessed within 5 minutes of arriving in the PACU and then every 15 minutes thereafter until&#xD;
      subject reaches maximum score. The assessment will be done using the SPEEDs criteria, which&#xD;
      has recently been shown to be as specific and more sensitive for phase 1 nursing&#xD;
      interventions and therefore more accurate in predicting which patients are fast-track&#xD;
      eligible as compared to the standard Modified Aldrete 2 and Fast-Track criteria (38).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post-operative pain scores a. Assessed every 15 minutes during the recovery period using&#xD;
           the Visual and Numerical Analog Scales for 2 hours and then every 4 hours thereafter&#xD;
           until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time to first rescue medication a. 0.2mg intravenous hydromorphone for mild pain (VAS&#xD;
           1-3) b. 0.4mg intravenous hydromorphone for moderate pain (VAS 4-6) c. 0.6 mg&#xD;
           intravenous hydromorphone for severe pain (VAS 7-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total dosage of post-operative opioids given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of post operative nausea and vomiting and need for additional antiemetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Phase II satisfaction survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. This will focus on three of the following factors rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being&#xD;
      dissatisfied/unlikely while 5 being most satisfied/very likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. How satisfied are you with the overall experience? ii. How likely are you to recommend&#xD;
      this anesthetic and analgesic to others? iii. How likely would you ask for a similar&#xD;
      anesthetic and analgesic in the future if need be? f) Concentration of the plasma stress&#xD;
      markers including cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and C Reactive Protein (CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Changes in mediator levels in the IV acetaminophen versus placebo groups will be compared.&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be collected before administration of any drug (after placement of IV&#xD;
      lines), before incision, and 60 minutes after arrival in PACU. Blood [15millLiters] will be&#xD;
      collected at the time points described above from an additional intravenous catheter placed&#xD;
      in the patient's arm. These specimens will be placed in vacutainer tubes with no&#xD;
      anti-coagulant. Blood will be drawn with a syringe attached directly to the angiocatheter&#xD;
      which has been placed intravenously. To prevent hemolysis, blood will be transferred without&#xD;
      a needle, to a vacutainer whose top has been removed. The vacutainer top will be replaced and&#xD;
      specimens labeled with study name, subject's study IDentification number, sample number (1,&#xD;
      2, 3,), and dated. Bloods from the first two time points will be kept refrigerated until the&#xD;
      final sample is obtained postoperatively. They will be centrifuged, serum removed, aliquoted&#xD;
      and stored at -80 degrees C until analysis. All samples will be run in duplicate on with&#xD;
      plates and reagents of the same lot. Any samples varying greater than 15% between duplicates&#xD;
