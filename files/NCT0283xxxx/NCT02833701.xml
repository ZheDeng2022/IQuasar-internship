    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ascorbic acid when given&#xD;
      together with bevacizumab in treating patients with high grade glioma that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent). Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Ascorbic acid contains ingredients that may prevent or slow&#xD;
      the growth of high grade glioma. Giving bevacizumab and ascorbic acid together may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with high grade glioma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicities and determine the recommended dose of intravenous ascorbic acid&#xD;
      given three times weekly in combination with intravenous bevacizumab every two weeks in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent high grade glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate changes in the levels of serum ascorbic acid (using high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography [HPLC] with coulometric electrochemical detection) during therapy with&#xD;
      ascorbic acid and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Radiographic assessment of disease status after 2 cycles of therapy with ascorbic acid&#xD;
      and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival of patients with recurrent high grade&#xD;
      glioma treated with therapy with ascorbic acid and bevacizumab. Patients with stable or&#xD;
      responsive disease after every 2 cycles will continue on therapy with ascorbic acid and&#xD;
      bevacizumab until intolerance or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To descriptively examine quality of life (QOL) using European Organization for Research&#xD;
      and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire QLQ-C30 during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ascorbic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ascorbic acid intravenously (IV) over 90-120 minutes three times per week&#xD;
      (at least 24 hours apart) and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year.&#xD;
