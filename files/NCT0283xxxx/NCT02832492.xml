    <textblock>
      Previous studies suggest that the stimulus of pupil near response (PNR) may be a conscious&#xD;
      perception of a blurred image. Moreover, PNR is a reflex that can be objectively observed and&#xD;
      with no motor output, suggesting it might be a more convenient index for consciousness&#xD;
      evaluation and consciousness recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). We&#xD;
      thus hypothesized that PNR+ patients (patients show PNR during the assessment) would have&#xD;
      better prognosis than PNR- patients (patients fail to show PNR during the assessment).Based&#xD;
      on this hypotheis, researchers will assess pupil near response in patients with unresponsive&#xD;
      wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and compare the prognosis difference between PNR+ patients and&#xD;
      PNR- patients to assess its prognosis value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PNR assessments will be conducted in patients with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS)&#xD;
      diagnosed by the Coma recovery scale-revised (CRS-R).An objective index,the ratio of&#xD;
      pupillary constriction (pupil diameter change after a stimulus presentation divided by the&#xD;
      resting state pupil diameter) will be used as the measure of PNR's presence (positive results&#xD;
      indicate the presence of PNR,whereas negative results indicate the absence of PNR).According&#xD;
      to the presence of PNR,patients will be divided into 2 groups,one includes patients who show&#xD;
      PNR during the PNR assessment (PNR+),the other includes patients who fail to show PNR during&#xD;
      the PNR assessment(PNR-).3 months later,a follow-up will be conducted to obtain their&#xD;
      prognosis in the form of another CRS-R assessment.Patients diagnosed as Minimally Conscious&#xD;
      State (MCS) will be considered as favourable prognosis,patients diagnosed as UWS will be&#xD;
      considered as unfavourable prognosis.Their prognosis difference will then be compared to see&#xD;
      PNR's effect on their prognosis (consciousness recovery). And for they couldn't show&#xD;
      conscious visual behaviors (visual behaviors in CRS-R which indicate MCS) in the first&#xD;
      CRS-R,their difference between visual prognosis (difference between each group's proportion&#xD;
      of patients showing conscious visual behavior diagnosed by CRS-R in the follow up) will be&#xD;
      compared to see PNR's capability to predict prognosis in patients without voluntary eye&#xD;
      movements (conscious visual behaviors in CRS-R require voluntary eye movements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers expect to see the PNR+ group have better prognosis in both comparison.&#xD;
