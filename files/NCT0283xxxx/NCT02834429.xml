      The aim of this study is to assess the clinical utility of the whole blood&#xD;
      transglutaminase-based rapid test against current serological tests and the gold standard of&#xD;
      duodenal biopsy. The investigators will recruit patients (n=1000) from the endoscopy&#xD;
      department at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom (UK). The patients&#xD;
      recruited for this study will already have been referred for a consultation and gastroscopy.&#xD;
      In addition, these patients will already have been serologically tested for IgA TTG, EMA and&#xD;
      a total IgA immunoglobulin level (as per normal clinical practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All duodenal biopsy specimens will be fixed in buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin&#xD;
      wax. Standard, 3μm thick sections at three levels will be stained with haematoxylin and eosin&#xD;
      and reported routinely. Additionally, biopsies demonstrating increased intraepithelial&#xD;
      lymphocytes only (changes compatible with but not diagnostic of coeliac disease) will be&#xD;
      stained with KiRAS or CD4/CD8 which are markers for coeliac disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coeliac disease is the most common chronic inflammatory bowel condition encountered by&#xD;
      physicians. Internationally the prevalence estimated by serological screening in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers is between 0.5-1.0%. Historically, patients with adult coeliac disease complained&#xD;
      of symptoms suggestive of mal-absorption, diarrhoea, weight loss or anaemia. This manner of&#xD;
      presentation is now described as the classical (typical) form. Failure to recognise this&#xD;
      disease may be due to the insidious nature of its presentation. Individuals with undiagnosed&#xD;
      coeliac disease may have numerous hospital attendances, prior to diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the presentation of patients with coeliac disease may be protean, serological&#xD;
      markers have provided a cheap and non-invasive method by which clinicians in both primary and&#xD;
      secondary care can initially recognise patients who may have coeliac disease. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the clinical utility of the whole blood transglutaminase-based rapid test&#xD;
      against current serological tests and the gold standard of duodenal biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and Participants Group 1 was a multicentre retrospective analysis of all&#xD;
      patients with anaemia attending a gastroscopy with duodenal biopsy at four UK hospitals&#xD;
      (Addenbrooke's, Bradford, Hull and Whipps Cross) over a 12 month period ranging from 2012 to&#xD;
      2014. The availability of coeliac serology prior to gastroscopy was reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 was a prospective study comparing the sensitivities of Simtomax to conventional&#xD;
      serology in an iron deficient cohort. We prospectively recruited 133 consecutive patients&#xD;
      (age range: 18-89 years, median 53) with iron deficiency with or without anaemia attending a&#xD;
      single coeliac disease research endoscopy list at the tertiary referral centre Royal&#xD;
      Hallamshire Hospital between 2013 and 2015. All recruited patients were consented for the&#xD;
      study prior to the gastroscopy. The patients concurrently undertook the point-of-care test,&#xD;
      Simtomax, conventional coeliac serology (IgA-TTG, IgA-EMA) and total IgA levels at the&#xD;
      endoscopy unit. All patients then had a gastroscopy with quadrantic duodenal biopsy from the&#xD;
      second part of the duodenum and at least one duodenal bulb biopsy. Patients were excluded&#xD;
      from the study if they were known to have coeliac disease or were on a gluten free diet.&#xD;
      Patients with coagulopathy, active gastrointestinal bleeding or a suspected carcinoma&#xD;
      observed during the examination were also excluded. Clinical information of the patients was&#xD;
      available to the endoscopist, however the endoscopist was blinded to the results of the&#xD;
      Simtomax test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 was a retrospective histological analysis of patients attending a separate&#xD;
      non-coeliac specific iron deficiency anaemia clinic at the Northern General Hospital in&#xD;
      2013-2014. We reviewed their duodenal histology and hospital case notes to determine the&#xD;
      yield of alternative causes other than coeliac disease in the context of iron deficiency&#xD;
      anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point-of-care test, Simtomax:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simtomax is a point-of-care test for coeliac disease manufactured by Augurix Diagnostics,&#xD;
      Switzerland. It detects both IgA and IgG antibodies to DGP, as well as the total IgA level.&#xD;
      The assay is based on lateral flow immunochromatography using colloidal gold antihuman&#xD;
      antibodies as a signal detector. A sample of 25 μl of capillary venous blood is required&#xD;
      which can be obtained through a simple finger prick technique. The assay can also be&#xD;
      performed using a plasma sample either in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or heparin&#xD;
      as well as a separated serum sample, although a smaller sample volume of 20 μl is required.&#xD;
      The blood sample is then applied to the test device, followed by the application of 5 drops&#xD;
      of the provided buffer solution. The result can be read after 10 minutes. Positive results&#xD;
      are indicated by the presence of a solid red test line for IgA and/or IgG-DGP positivity. A&#xD;
      second single red line indicates the presence of IgA. An in-built red control line ensures a&#xD;
      correctly functioning test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total IgA was measured on a Behring BN2 nephelometer. IgA-TTG antibodies were evaluated using&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Aesku Diagnostics, Wendelsheim, Germany). An IgA-TTG&#xD;
      titre of &gt; 15 U/ml before 20/5/2014, a new cut off level of &gt;9 U/ml from 20/5-11/12/2014, and&#xD;
      then &gt;7 U/ml from 12/12/2014 onwards, were regarded as positive as per the manufacturer's&#xD;
      guidance. IgA-EMA was detected by immunofluorescence on primate oesophagus sections (Binding&#xD;
      Site, Birmingham, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies and histology&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, at least five biopsies were taken from the duodenum, including at least one from&#xD;
      the duodenal bulb, with each biopsy fixed in formalin at the time of the gastroscopy.&#xD;
      Specimens were then processed, orientated and embedded in paraffin wax by the pathology&#xD;
      department. Standard 3 µm thick sections at three levels were stained with haematoxylin and&#xD;
      eosin, and reported routinely by gastrointestinal histopathologists without knowledge of the&#xD;
      Simtomax results. Villous atrophy was graded according to the modified Marsh criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of coeliac disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of villous atrophy (Marsh 3a-3c) on histology with a positive IgA-EMA or IgA-TTG&#xD;
      were required for the diagnosis of coeliac disease. In cases of seronegative villous atrophy,&#xD;
      human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping was performed, with a negative HLA DQ2 or DQ8&#xD;
      phenotype used to rule out coeliac disease. Supporting information such as family history and&#xD;
      response to a gluten free diet were also taken into account.&#xD;
