    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects of sirolimus and NY-ESO-1 protein with&#xD;
      MIS416 in treating patients stage II-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer. Sirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Vaccine therapy, like Y-ESO-1 protein with MIS416, may strengthen the immune&#xD;
      system to find and kill tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as sirolimus, use substances&#xD;
      made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways&#xD;
      and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving sirolimus and vaccine therapy may work betting in&#xD;
      treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of NY-ESO-1 protein with MIS416 in combination with&#xD;
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effectiveness of these combinatorial therapies by assessing NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      specific cellular and humoral immunity: peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ T-cells; peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies;&#xD;
      peripheral blood frequency of CD4+ CD25+ forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T-cells; explore&#xD;
      time to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I (C1): Patients receive NY-ESO-1 protein with MIS416 vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on&#xD;
      days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, and 113 in the absence of disease progression or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II (C2): Patients receive NY-ESO-1 protein with MIS416 vaccine as in Cohort I.&#xD;
      Patients also receive sirolimus orally (PO) daily for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks off&#xD;
      starting on days 1, 29, 57, and 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
