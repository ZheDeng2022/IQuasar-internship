  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong causal association between persisting genital tract infection with Human&#xD;
      Papilloma Virus (HPV) and gradual progression of infection to cervical (mouth of uterus)&#xD;
      cancer.The robust study from India have shown that single round of HPV DNA screening test to&#xD;
      significantly reduce the cervical cancer mortality. The above findings are very encouraging&#xD;
      since it demonstrates that a simple and reliable HPV DNA test which is now available in low&#xD;
      income countries has a potential to be accepted as primary screening test in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross-sectional studies from developed countries from year 1999-2004 which focused to&#xD;
      determine the test characteristics of HPV Hybrid Capture 2 test (HC2) to determine CIN2 and&#xD;
      higher grade lesions, reported test sensitivity of 90% to 100% with a mean of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly the cross-sectional studies from developing countries from 1993 to 2003 which have&#xD;
      focused on test characteristics of HPV DNA Hybrid capture 2 (HC2) test to determine CIN2 and&#xD;
      higher grade lesions has shown a sensitivity in the range of 50% to 91% with an average&#xD;
      sensitivity of 79%.Among the developing countries cross-sectional study from India which&#xD;
      evaluated test reported sensitivity of only 68.2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a statistical significant difference ( p value = 0.003) of sensitivity of HPV DNA&#xD;
      HC2 test between the developed and developing countries to determine CIN2+ Lesions while&#xD;
      there is no difference in the specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study that was conducted in Chinese women to detected the prevalence of HPV genotype among&#xD;
      women with mucopurulent cervicitis, healthy women and women with Invasive cancer, the author&#xD;
      reported a 10% higher failure rates to extract HPV DNA in cases of mucopurulent cervicitis as&#xD;
      compared to other two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the study will explore if if the presence of untreated co-infections with STIs/RTIs&#xD;
      (Sexually transmitted infections/Reproductive tract infections) resulting in cervical&#xD;
      inflammation is somewhere interfering with low sensitivity of HC2 test due to presence of&#xD;
      blood and excess mucus associated with the conditions leading to low sensitivity of the test&#xD;
      in context to Indian Scenario.&#xD;

      Methodology-The eligible women in the age group of 30-50 years will be screened. Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be determined. Women with clinical cervicitis as per NACO guidelines on per&#xD;
      speculum examination will been rolled as cases after signing the inform consent. Women with&#xD;
      no signs and symptoms of cervicitis (No white discharge P/V,No lower Abdominal pain, No&#xD;
      urinary symptoms,No dysperunia,No pruritis vulvae,No post coital bleeding)will be enrolled as&#xD;
      controls after signing the inform consent. The participants ready to participate will be&#xD;
      explained the details and the purpose of the study by Doctor.All the women enrolled in women&#xD;
      shall be followed up after 7-14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1.Cervical swab from ectocervix and endocervix shall be collected. Additional vaginal&#xD;
      swab Will be taken from lateral vaginal wall and posterior fornices for all women enrolled in&#xD;
      study.The swabs will be evenly spread on a glass slide and heat fixed. The slides will be put&#xD;
      in slide box to be transported to Microbiology Department for Gram staining for Gonococcal,&#xD;
      Non-Gonococcal infections,Bacterial Vaginosis,Candida. Next, cervical cells for HPV DNA&#xD;
      testing will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women diagnosed with clinical cervicitis will receive treatment on the spot and advised&#xD;
      use to use barrier contraception for 15 days.No treated will be given for the women in&#xD;
      enrolled arm i.e women without clinical and lab STIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day7-14- All the women enrolled in study shall be followed up after 7-14 days. Women will&#xD;
      undergo per-speculum examination and clinical signs of cervicitis or cervicovaginitis will be&#xD;
      reassessed again and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeat cervical swab and vaginal swab shall be collected and send for gram staining for the&#xD;
      above mentioned organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeat, cervical cells for HPV DNA testing will be collected. Women who are positive for&#xD;
      HPV DNA and STIs on follow up visits shall be counselled and referred for further evaluation&#xD;
      and treatment to appropriate hospital.&#xD;
