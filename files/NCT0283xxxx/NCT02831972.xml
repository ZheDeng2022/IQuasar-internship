      An Open-Label, 2-Period, Fixed Sequence Study to Determine the Effect of Multiple Oral Doses&#xD;
      of Itraconazole on the Single Dose Pharmacokinetics of AG 120 in Healthy Adult Subjects.&#xD;
      Period 1 consists of a single oral dose of AG-120 will be administered at Hour 0 followed by&#xD;
      PK sampling for 504 hours (21 days). In Period 2, multiple oral doses of itraconazole will be&#xD;
      administered once daily (QD) for 18 consecutive days with a single oral dose of AG-120&#xD;
      coadministered at Hour 0 on Day 1. PK sampling for AG-120 will be taken for 504 hours (21&#xD;
      days) following AG-120 dosing on Day 1.&#xD;
