  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that tumor cell killing by cytotoxic chemotherapy exposes the&#xD;
      immune system to high levels of tumor antigens.The combination of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin and&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab may result in deeper and more durable responses compared with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
