      Study Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the optimal effective&#xD;
      dose for preoperative nutritional supplementation with immunomodulators on immune function&#xD;
      and perioperative outcomes following pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints will be effect on immunological profile (circulating Myeloid derived&#xD;
      suppressor cells, circulating B cells, NK cells, CD4 and CD8 cells), serum arginine levels,&#xD;
      immunological milieu of the tumor (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes), overall morbidity rate&#xD;
      and infectious complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor Safety and Tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Length of Stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readmission rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One-year event free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on nutritional parameters (serum total protein, prealbumin, albumin and&#xD;
           transferrin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on acute phase reactants (CRP, IL6, TNF alpha)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a 1:1:1:1 four-arm single center prospective randomized feasibility&#xD;
      study to compare preoperative nutritional supplementation with an enhanced formula containing&#xD;
      immune-modulating agents (IMPACT AR) for 5 days with 1,2 or 3 cans versus 5 days of 3 cans of&#xD;
      comparable iso-caloric iso-nitrogenous supplementation (Boost) for patients with resectable&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients 20 (5 in each arm) Eligibility Criteria: Patients over 18 years of age,&#xD;
      who have histologic and/or radiologic evidence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the head of&#xD;
      the pancreas, who have been deemed resectable, and who are able to give informed consent,&#xD;
      will be eligible Exclusion criteria would include Active uncontrolled bacterial, viral or&#xD;
      fungal infection within 21 days of study entry OR Inability to take oral, nasojejunal or&#xD;
      jejunostomy tube nutritional supplements OR patients on chronic steroid therapy (i.e. greater&#xD;
      than 3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional Supplement interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the TEST intervention will receive Impact Advanced Recovery™ formula,&#xD;
      which is a commercially available oral nutrition supplement drink that is supplied in 237mL&#xD;
      containers. Each serving provides 1.4 kcal/mL (340 kcal/serving) of which 22% of the kcal are&#xD;
      derived from protein (18.1 gm protein/serving), in addition to their regular diet. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to CONTROL Boost® High Protein Drink will consume their regular diet and 4 cans of&#xD;
      Boost per day for 5 days preoperatively (to maintain equivalent supplementation in terms of&#xD;
      calories and protein with the group receiving the highest dose of Impact AR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/baseline assessments will performed prior to the first treatment within&#xD;
      approximately four weeks of the treatment and will include a detailed medical history and&#xD;
      physical examination,standard of Care Laboratory tests (CBC, CMP), tumor markers: as&#xD;
      indicated: CEA and CA19-9; and coagulation (baseline and as clinically indicated): INR, PTT,&#xD;
      PT. Imaging to confirm respectability would include a high quality tri-phasic CT scan with&#xD;
      0.7mm cuts or Dynamic MRI with contrast to confirm the absence of metastatic disease Study&#xD;
      specific tests include pre-treatment and post treatment (Office visit/ pre-anesthesia visit,&#xD;
      Morning of surgery, postop day 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional parameters and acute phase reactants: serum prealbumin, albumin,&#xD;
           transferrin, CRP, IL6, TNF alpha&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum arginine,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MSDC (myeloid derived suppressor cell) assay of fresh blood and Arginase I expression&#xD;
           Study procedure at the time of surgery: Semi-quantitative assay of Tumor infiltrating&#xD;
           lymphocytes from tissue block of tumor obtained at time of surgery. Tumor tissue will&#xD;
           also be banked for post hoc tests if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow up visits history and physical examination, performance Status evaluation and&#xD;
      Standard of care Laboratory Tests (CBC, CMP, and Tumor Marker Assessment as clinically&#xD;
      indicated per the discretion of the investigator would be done approximately every three&#xD;
      months). Imaging during follow up include a CT/MRI for disease status (approximately every&#xD;
      three months during follow-up) Adverse Event Monitoring and Concomitant Medication monitoring&#xD;
      will be done out to 90 days&#xD;
