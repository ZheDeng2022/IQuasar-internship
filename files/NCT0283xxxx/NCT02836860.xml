      The purpose of this study is to compare combined tactile stimulation and verbal instruction&#xD;
      to verbal instruction only on lumbar multifidus muscle activation in asymptomatic healthy&#xD;
      adults and in patients with LBP.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced lumbar multifidus muscle contraction has been observed in patients with low back pain&#xD;
      (LBP). Currently, considerable evidence supports spinal stabilization exercises for treating&#xD;
      LBP, including lumbar multifidus muscle activation exercises. Clinicians often apply a&#xD;
      tactile stimulation on the muscle in addition to verbal instructions to ensure muscle&#xD;
      activation. However, whether or not the addition of tactile stimulation would increase muscle&#xD;
      activation has not been studied. Therefore, the investigators plan to use electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) to examine if addition of tactile stimulation to verbal instructions would increase&#xD;
      lumbar multifidus muscle activation in healthy adults and patients with LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare combined tactile stimulation and verbal instruction&#xD;
      to verbal instruction only on lumbar multifidus muscle activation in asymptomatic healthy&#xD;
      adults and in patients with LBP. The research hypothesis is that the lumbar multifidus muscle&#xD;
      activation will be increased when the participants are given combined tactile stimulation and&#xD;
      verbal instruction as compared to when the participants are given verbal instruction only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants are English-speaking adults 18 years of age or older. Additional&#xD;
      criteria for asymptomatic healthy adults include no existing LBP and no LBP in the past year.&#xD;
      Additional criteria for patient participants include existing LBP near the L5-S1 level with&#xD;
      an average pain intensity score ≥ 2/10 in the past 24 hours (numeric pain rating scale of&#xD;
      0-10, 0 being no pain, 10 being unbearable pain). Exclusion criteria for all participants&#xD;
      include previous low back surgery, systemic joint disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), cancer&#xD;
      of the lower quadrant, neurological disorders, allergic reaction to ultrasound gel, or&#xD;
      inability to obtain testing positions (prone lying).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll 20 asymptomatic healthy adults, and 20 patients with LBP.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited from the local community (including but not limited&#xD;
      to Texas Woman's University - Dallas) via flyers. The flyers will be posted at the TWU -&#xD;
      Dallas campus and other community centers with approval. Participants who are interested in&#xD;
      taking part in the study will be asked to call investigators to schedule an appointment time&#xD;
      for testing. The consent form will be presented at the beginning of the appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants are informed of the risks, benefits and procedures of the study, they will&#xD;
      be asked to sign a written consent form approved by the TWU Institutional Review Board -&#xD;
      Dallas. Eligible participants will be asked to complete an intake form, asking them about&#xD;
      their age, gender, and past medical history. For participants with existing low back pain,&#xD;
      they will be asked about their pain location, duration, intensity, and nature, medicine use&#xD;
      of their existing LBP and their LBP history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Index (OSW) questionnaire will be used to determine&#xD;
           an individual's perceived disability and function limitation due to his/her low back&#xD;
           pain. The OSW questionnaire has been shown to be reliable and valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Delsys EMG system with 2 wireless surface electrodes (Delsys Inc., Boston, MA) will be&#xD;
           used to obtain muscle activities. The bandwidth of the EMG system will be set at 20 to&#xD;
           450 Hz with a gain of 1,000. The EMG signal will be recorded at a sampling rate of 1,000&#xD;
           Hz. Each surface electrode has a built-in reference electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG Recording Prior to EMG recording, the anatomy and location of the lumbar multifidus&#xD;
      muscle will be explained and shown to participants using a model and pictures. Next,&#xD;
      participants will lie in prone on an examination table with their arms on the sides. A pillow&#xD;
      will be placed under the participant's abdomen to flatten the lumbar lordotic curve and an&#xD;
      inclinometer will be placed on the lumbosacral junction to ensure the lumbar curve ≤10&#xD;
      degrees. The spinous processes of the L4-S2 and sacral sulcus will be identified by palpation&#xD;
      and marked with an erasable pen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, one investigator will prepare the participant's skin in the areas of the 2 electrode&#xD;
      placements. The skin will be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. If there is excessive hair, a&#xD;
      new disposable razor will be used to shave the hair to improve the quality of the EMG&#xD;
      recording. If shaving is required, the investigator will wear gloves to perform shaving&#xD;
      following universal precautions. Once the skin is prepared for EMG recording, 2 electrodes&#xD;
      will be placed on the skin over the right and left lumbar multifidus at two at the L4-5&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMG of lumbar multifidus will be recorded 3 times &quot;at rest&quot; first prior to each of muscle&#xD;
      activation conditions: (1) verbal instruction only, and (2) combined tactile stimulation and&#xD;
      verbal instruction. For both the muscle activation conditions, the participant will be asked&#xD;
      to assume a starting position: abduct the contralateral shoulder and flex the contralateral&#xD;
      elbow to approximately 90°. The contralateral side will be opposite to the painful side of&#xD;
      patients with LBP or the left side of the asymptomatic participants. If the patient has&#xD;
      bilateral LBP, the contralateral side will be the less painful side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During verbal instruction, one investigator will give a verbal instruction and then ask the&#xD;
      participant to perform a contralateral-arm task, in which the participant will lift the&#xD;
      contralateral arm approximately 5 cm above the table and hold for 5 seconds. The verbal&#xD;
      instruction was selected based on our published pilot study which showed that this&#xD;
      instruction seemed to activate lumbar multifidus muscle the most: &quot;Breathe normally, without&#xD;
      moving the pelvis or spine, think about tilting the pelvis forward without actually moving&#xD;
      it, and lift the left (right) arm&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During tactile stimulation, the investigator will place his/her middle 2 or 3 fingers on the&#xD;
      lumbar multifidus at L5-S1 between the 2 electrodes before the verbal instruction is given.&#xD;
      The investigator will then give the same verbal instruction and ask the participant to&#xD;
      perform the contralateral-arm-lift task while maintaining finger contact on the multifidus&#xD;
      muscle during muscle activation. EMG testing will start after the verbal instruction is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each muscle activation condition, participants will hold each contraction for 5-8&#xD;
      seconds, and a 10-minute rest will be given between the 2 contraction conditions.&#xD;
