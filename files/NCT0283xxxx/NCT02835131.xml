      Congenital hyperinsulinism is a rare condition that can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      Current treatment for congenital hyperinsulinism is often suboptimal, and such individuals&#xD;
      may respond to a new somatostatin analog, pasireotide. This is a compassionate use study of&#xD;
      the effects of pasireotide on individuals with suboptimally treated congenital&#xD;
      hyperinsulinism.&#xD;

      Congenital hyperinsulinism is a rare condition that can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      Current treatment for congenital hyperinsulinism is often suboptimal, with diazoxide as the&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment. Individuals who are not adequately treated with diazoxide may undergo&#xD;
      pancreatectomy. Octreotide has been used with some success in congenital hyperinsulinism but&#xD;
      there is limited data on pasireotide, the newest somatostatin receptor agonist, which,&#xD;
      compared to octreotide, has 30-40 times greater affinity for somatostatin receptors 1 (SSTR1)&#xD;
      and 5 (SSTR5), 5 times greater for somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) and a comparable affinity&#xD;
      for somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In human islets, SSTR2 &amp; SSTR5 are present in beta cells. Therefore, there is reason to&#xD;
      believe that pasireotide may have greater effectiveness than octreotide in preventing&#xD;
      hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Indeed hyperglycemia is a known effect of pasireotide&#xD;
      when used for treatment of Cushing's disease and Acromegaly. The current study is of&#xD;
      compassionate use for prevention of hypoglycemia in individuals with congenital&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia who are not adequately treated with diazoxide.&#xD;
