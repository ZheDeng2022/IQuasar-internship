    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation exercise is beneficial for individuals with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD). However, merely 30% patients know how to do the exercise correctly.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is worthy to investigate the applications in clinical practice. In addition,&#xD;
      there are no relative research in Taiwan to see effects of an 8-week pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercise in home care for the non-invasive ventilator-dependent elderly with COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to estimation of the world health organization (WHO), chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) would become the third major cause of death. Moreover, the lung recovery&#xD;
      exercise is proven beneficial for mild, moderate, or severe COPD by the guideline of GOLD.&#xD;
      However, research in Taiwan focused on follow-up medical status for mild or moderate COPD in&#xD;
      clinics, or weaning of severe COPD in intensive care unit (ICU). There was no relative&#xD;
      research investigating non-invasive ventilator-dependent elderly with COPD on home care.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study would explore effects of pulmonary rehabilitation exercise for this&#xD;
      group. The pulmonary rehabilitation exercise program in this study is divided into two stages&#xD;
      in the experimental group. The first four weeks, 10 minutes for each training (upper&#xD;
      extremity without loading, exercise of lower extremity, and respiratory muscles), and totally&#xD;
      30 minutes is required. Consequent four weeks, 15 minutes for upper extremity without&#xD;
      loading, 15 minutes for exercise of lower extremity, and 10 minutes for training of&#xD;
      respiratory muscles, and totally 40 minutes is scheduled.&#xD;
