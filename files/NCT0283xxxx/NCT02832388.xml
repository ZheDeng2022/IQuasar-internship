  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to identify and include consecutively patients with&#xD;
      primary aldosteronism (PA) diagnosed in the Western and Mid-parts of Norway, to describe the&#xD;
      characteristics of these patients, to explore the cardiac effects of PA before and after&#xD;
      specific treatment, and to identify long-term outcomes after treatment. One subgroup of the&#xD;
      PA patients perform echocardiography to assess left ventricular systolic myocardial function&#xD;
      before and after treatment. One subgroup of PA patients perform cardiac MRI to assess&#xD;
      myocardial mass, myocardial fibrosis and myocardial function in rest and during stress,&#xD;
      before and after treatment. For the cardiac MRI substudy, the PA patients are compared with a&#xD;
      group of healthy controls, also included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2020 onwards, PA patients diagnosed or subtyped with adrenal vein sampling at Oslo&#xD;
      University Hospital will additionally be included in the study, thereby providing a national&#xD;
      registration of PA patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From June 2013, all newly diagnosed patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) either diagnosed&#xD;
      at Haukeland University Hospital (HUS) or admitted to HUS for subtype testing with adrenal&#xD;
      vein sampling, have been asked for inclusion in the study. All included patients have a&#xD;
      base-line study visit where clinical information is registered, and baseline blood and urine&#xD;
      samples are collected. Echocardiography will be performed in a subgroup of patients before&#xD;
      and 1 year after start of specific PA treatment. After start of definite medical or surgical&#xD;
      treatment the patients are followed up with regularly new study visits. From 2020 onwards, PA&#xD;
      patients diagnosed or subtyped with adrenal vein sampling at Oslo University Hospital will&#xD;
      additionally be included in the study, thereby providing a national registration of PA&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup of the included PA study patients also perform a Cardiac MRI. Cine-MRI,&#xD;
      velocity-encoded MRI, MRI images during continuous adenosine infusion and MRI images after&#xD;
      gadolinium contrast injection are performed, and compared to a group of age- and sex-matched&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;

SF-36 was used in the period 2013-2016, and has from 2016 onwards been replaced by RAND-36.</description>
