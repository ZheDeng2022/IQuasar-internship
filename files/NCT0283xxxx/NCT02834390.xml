      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were collected from Induction phase Cycle 1, Day 1 up to 35 days after last completed cycle in Consolidation phase, up to approximately 1 year.</time_frame>
      <desc>A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an AE that emerges (or worsens) from the first dose of study drug and coadministered drugs to the follow-up visit, 35 days after the last dose of study drug and co-administered drugs, or the start date of new acute myeloid leukemia post-treatment, whichever was earlier. The serious AEs (SAEs) reported occurred only in the Induction phase. No SAEs occurred during the consolidation phase. TEAEs at ≥5% are reported for both induction and consolidation phases.</desc>
