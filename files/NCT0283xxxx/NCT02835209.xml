  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a life-sustaining intervention in premature infants with&#xD;
      respiratory difficulties. There is relative consensus when to intubate and provide positive&#xD;
      pressure mechanical ventilation in the presence of respiratory failure. In contrast,&#xD;
      discontinuation of mechanical ventilation during recovery remains largely subjective. A&#xD;
      potential predictive tool for neonatal extubation is the Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT).&#xD;
      The efficacy of SBT or other tests used in older patient populations in improving clinical&#xD;
      judgment is questionable in the neonatal population with its unique physiology, respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics and drive factors. Christiana Care Health System NICU currently uses the SBT as a&#xD;
      standard part of neonatal assessment for extubation from mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in the CCHS NICU are routinely cared for in multiple positions (prone, supine,&#xD;
      lateral) throughout the day. What is unknown is the impact of infant positioning on the SBT.&#xD;
      An SBT performed in one position may not predict infant respiratory status after extubation&#xD;
      in another position. Understanding the impact of infant positioning and work of breathing&#xD;
      indices independently or in combination with an SBT will aid clinicians in decision-making&#xD;
      and potentially decrease neonatal morbidity (inaccuracy with timing and safety of&#xD;
      extubation). This pilot study will begin to explore these clinically relevant factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This pilot study will investigate the (1) role of infant position on SBT score&#xD;
      and (2) the relationship of work of breathing indices in reference to the SBT score and&#xD;
      infant position.&#xD;

      Mechanical ventilation is a life-sustaining intervention in premature infants with&#xD;
      respiratory difficulties. There is relative consensus when to intubate and provide positive&#xD;
      pressure mechanical ventilation in the presence of respiratory failure. In contrast,&#xD;
      discontinuation of mechanical ventilation during recovery remains largely subjective.&#xD;
      Typically 25% of infants weighing &lt;1500g who are extubated using these criteria require&#xD;
      reintubation suggesting that the ability of clinicians to predict successful extubation is&#xD;
      limited. A potential predictive tool for neonatal extubation is the Spontaneous Breathing&#xD;
      Trial (SBT). The efficacy of SBT or other tests used in older patient populations in&#xD;
      improving clinical judgment is questionable in the neonatal population with its unique&#xD;
      physiology, respiratory mechanics and drive factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Christiana Care Health System NICU currently uses the SBT as a standard part of neonatal&#xD;
      assessment for extubation from mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SBT used at CCHS is a non-invasive 5-minute test performed on an intubated infant.&#xD;
      Respiratory rates (RR), expired tidal volume (Vte), heart rate, and oxygen saturation by&#xD;
      pulse oximetry (SpO2) are recorded. An SBT is considered passed, when there is no apnea&#xD;
      (defined as no respiratory effort for greater than 20 seconds), no bradycardia (defined as&#xD;
      heart rate less than 100 for greater than 15 seconds), and the SpO2 has been maintained at&#xD;
      greater than 85% or SBT VE greater than 60% than that of the mechanical VE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially confounding the SBT, and unstudied, is the effect of position (prone, supine,&#xD;
      lateral). Similar to adults, infant position has a significant effect on the efficacy of&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing. Infants in the CCHS NICU are routinely cared for in multiple positions&#xD;
      (prone, supine, lateral) throughout the day. What is unknown is the impact of infant&#xD;
      positioning on the SBT. An SBT performed in one position may not predict infant respiratory&#xD;
      status after extubation in another position. Understanding the impact of infant positioning&#xD;
      and work of breathing indices independently or in combination with an SBT will aid clinicians&#xD;
      in decision-making and potentially decrease neonatal morbidity (inaccuracy with timing and&#xD;
      safety of extubation). This pilot study will begin to explore these clinically relevant&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work of breathing (WOB) indices can be non-invasively measured utilizing respiratory&#xD;
      inductive plethysmography (RIP). WOB indices measured by RIP have been utilized by this&#xD;
      research team for clinical and research purposes, including at CCHS. RIP entails that an&#xD;
      infant breathe calmly while wearing soft elastic cloth bands that comfortably encircle the&#xD;
      rib cage and abdomen. Contained within the bands is a flexible sinusoidal wire that measures&#xD;
      motion. Measurements are taken for a minimum of 10 breaths, but preferable throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the 5 minutes SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This pilot study will investigate the (1) role of infant position on SBT score&#xD;
      and (2) the relationship of work of breathing indices in reference to the SBT score and&#xD;
      infant position.&#xD;
