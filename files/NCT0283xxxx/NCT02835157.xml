  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of pediatric shock management; current practices of&#xD;
      fluid resuscitation in children are not evidence based. Normal saline is the preferred&#xD;
      crystalloid recommended during initial resuscitation in shock, as the incidence of&#xD;
      hyponatremia is lower with normal saline compared to all other fluids available and commonly&#xD;
      used. However, normal saline has its own set of undesired physicochemical actions. Emerging&#xD;
      data strongly indicate the increased incidence of hyperchloremia, metabolic acidosis and&#xD;
      consequently, acute kidney injury associated with infusion of large volumes of normal saline.&#xD;
      Balanced salt solutions or crystalloids, which have composition resembling plasma but lower&#xD;
      chloride concentrations than normal saline, clearly decrease the risk of hyperchloremia and&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis in adult as well as pediatric studies when used during the peri-operative&#xD;
      period. The results favored balanced solutions in comparison to normal saline. Recent&#xD;
      systematic reviews comparing balanced or buffered versus non-buffered fluids for surgery in&#xD;
      adults favored the former solution as the metabolic derangements were less with the use of&#xD;
      this type of fluid. In adult patients, the two solutions have been compared in various other&#xD;
      settings as well such as in traumatic brain injury and in shock. The results favored balanced&#xD;
      solutions in comparison to normal saline. However, in the non-surgical setting there is a&#xD;
      paucity of evidence on the use of these solutions in children with shock and more evidence&#xD;
      needs to be generated to support or refute the use of this fluid as compared to normal&#xD;
      saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this background, the investigators decided to compare the effect of two solutions on&#xD;
      the incidence of acute kidney injury in children resuscitated with either of the two fluids.&#xD;
      Children receiving at least one fluid bolus at 20 ml/kg in the first hour would be enrolled&#xD;
      and followed up for the proposed outcome variables. The investigators plan to enroll 708&#xD;
      patients over a period of 3 years. The investigators believe that the proposed study will&#xD;
      provide answer to the research question of which of the fluids could be preferred for&#xD;
      resuscitation.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of pediatric shock management; current practices of&#xD;
      fluid resuscitation in children are not evidence based. Emerging data strongly indicate the&#xD;
      increased incidence of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and consequently, acute kidney&#xD;
      injury associated with infusion of large volumes of normal saline in critically ill adults in&#xD;
      shock. Balanced salt solutions or crystalloids, which have composition resembling plasma but&#xD;
      lower chloride concentrations than normal saline, have shown to decrease the risk of&#xD;
      hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis in adult as well as pediatric studies when used during&#xD;
      the peri-operative period. In adult patients, the two solutions have been compared in various&#xD;
      other settings as well such as in traumatic brain injury and in shock. The results favored&#xD;
      balanced solutions in comparison to normal saline. However, in the non-surgical setting there&#xD;
      is a paucity of evidence on the use of these solutions in children with shock and more&#xD;
      evidence needs to be generated to support or refute the use of this fluid as compared to&#xD;
      normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary To examine if use of 'balanced crystalloids&quot; results in lower incidence of acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (defined as increase in serum creatinine by &gt; 0.3mg/dL within 48 hours or to&#xD;
      1.5 times baseline or more within the last 7 days or urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6&#xD;
      hours) in the first seven days after initial fluid resuscitation as compared to Normal&#xD;
      saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the difference if any, between two fluid types with regard to the following&#xD;
      secondary objectives such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of hyperchloremia (defined as serum chloride levels &gt;108 mEq/L) at 6, 24, 48&#xD;
           and 72 hrs of fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of metabolic acidosis at 6, 24, 48 and 72 hrs of fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Requirement of fluid boluses in first 6 hrs and total fluids in first 24 hours, 48 hours&#xD;
           and 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Proportion of patients achieving the pre-determined therapeutic end points at 6, 24, 48&#xD;
           hours and 72 hours after fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Need for inotrope therapy in first 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Change in SOFA scores and PELOD scores at 24 hours and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Time to resolution of AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. In- ICU mortality rates.&#xD;

      Study Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic shock is defined as children who have a suspected infection manifested by hypothermia&#xD;
      or hyperthermia and have at least two clinical signs of decreased perfusion with or without&#xD;
      hypotension such as decreased mental status, prolonged capillary refill of &gt;2 secs (cold&#xD;
      shock) or flash capillary refill (warm shock), diminished (cold shock) or bounding (warm&#xD;
      shock) peripheral pulses, mottled cool extremities (cold shock), or decreased urine output of&#xD;
      &lt;1 ml/kg/hr).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic end points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appropriate-for-age mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured non-invasively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal pulses with no difference between peripheral and central pulses, warm&#xD;
           extremities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capillary refill time &lt;2 seconds;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal mental status;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine output â‰¥ 1mL/kg/hr,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperchloremia: Defined as serum chloride value of &gt;108 meq/L, based on our laboratory cut&#xD;
      off of 98-108 meq/L Metabolic acidosis: pH of less than 7.35 with serum bicarbonate &lt; 24&#xD;
      meq/L with low to normal pCO2 (&lt;40 mm Hg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute kidney injury: An abrupt (within 48-hr) reduction in kidney function defined as an&#xD;
      absolute increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl, an increase in&#xD;
      serum creatinine of more than or equal to 1.5 fold from the value preceding the abnormal&#xD;
      value, or reduction in urine output (oliguria of less than 0.5 ml/kg per hour for &gt;6-hr).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children with features of shock as per standard definitions will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility. Of these, children who require at least one fluid bolus of 20 ml/kg will be&#xD;
      enrolled. The eligible participants would be enrolled after obtaining informed consent from&#xD;
      one of the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, the participants would be randomized into 2 groups. 'MES' or 'study group'&#xD;
      will receive the balanced fluids and 'saline' or 'control group' will receive normal saline.&#xD;
      Process of randomization will be done by an investigator who will have no further role in&#xD;
      collecting the baseline variables, applying intervention or analysis of outcome(s). Block&#xD;
      randomization will be done in varying block sizes of 2 to 8. The random number table&#xD;
      generated from computer software would be used for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated that a sample size of 354 patients in each group (708 total)&#xD;
      would be required to detect an absolute reduction in incidence of AKI from 25% (current&#xD;
      incidence in children with shock in the unit) to 15% assuming a two-sided Î± level of 0.05 and&#xD;
      a statistical power of 90%. The sample size was calculated using Stata 11. The investigators&#xD;
      expect the required sample size to be collected within 3 years period in the three centers.&#xD;
