  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a combination of study drugs called&#xD;
      selinexor (KPT-330) and ixazomib (MLN9708) with a low dose of dexamethasone. This study tests&#xD;
      different doses of the study drug, selinexor to see which dose is safer in people. Depending&#xD;
      on which group (dose level) you are in, the dose of selinexor will vary, but the ixazomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone doses will be the same among the groups.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM will be treated with ixazomib, selinexor, and dexamethasone, all of which will be administered orally.Ixazomib will be given on Days 1, 8, and 15 on a 28 day cycle.&#xD;
Selinexor will be given twice weekly for three weeks, then there will be 1 week off (Days 1,3, 8,10, 15, 17) This study will follow a 3-by-3 dose escalation design.&#xD;
Dexamethasone will be given on all days of Selinexor but will also be given on the week off from Selinexor (Days 1, 3, 8, 10,15, 17, 22, 24).</description>
