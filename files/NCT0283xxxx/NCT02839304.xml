        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is diagnosed with paroxysmal (PAF), persistent, or long standing persistent&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation (PsAF) for which an ablation procedure was deemed most appropriate&#xD;
             therapy. Paroxysmal AF is defined as recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) that&#xD;
             terminates spontaneously within seven (7) days. Persistent AF is defined as: an&#xD;
             episode lasting longer than seven (7) days, but less than one (1) year documented by&#xD;
             consecutive ECG recordings of 100% AF greater than seven (7) days apart or an episode&#xD;
             requiring electrical or pharmacological cardioversion after 48 hours of AF documented&#xD;
             by continuous recording. Long-Standing Persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that&#xD;
             lasts longer than one (1) year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Reported incidence of at least one (1) documented episode of symptomatic atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation (AF) during the twelve months preceding trial entry (should be documented&#xD;
             by rhythm strip or ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Failure of at least one anti-arrhythmic medication (AAD) for paroxysmal atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation [class I or III, or AV nodal blocking agents such as beta blockers (BB)&#xD;
             and calcium channel blockers (CCB)] as evidenced by recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation, or intolerable side effects due to AAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Left atrial size &lt;55 mm in largest dimension as measured and image documented by&#xD;
             preoperative imaging (CT, MRI and/or TTE)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ≥ 40% (obtained within 12 months prior to the&#xD;
             procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Anticoagulation therapy: patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy four (4) weeks&#xD;
             prior to the ablation procedure (where appropriate) according to 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS&#xD;
             Guideline for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient is at least 18 and ≤80 years of age.&#xD;

             esophageal warming balloon insertion, positioning or inflation.&#xD;
