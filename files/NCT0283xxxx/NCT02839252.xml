      The specific aims of this pilot study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the asthma education intervention on asthma knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether the asthma education intervention improves child and parent asthma&#xD;
           treatment self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the asthma education intervention will significantly improve asthma&#xD;
      knowledge and asthma self-efficacy at 1 month post-intervention as compared to controls.&#xD;

      Potential subjects will be recruited from patients seen at Yacktman General Pediatrics&#xD;
      Clinic. Investigators will initially use the clinic's electronic medical record (EMR) to&#xD;
      identify potentially eligible subjects who have a regularly scheduled visit during the next 4&#xD;
      months. Once the patient is deemed eligible, they will be marked as &quot;ASTHMA STUDY ELIGIBLE&quot;&#xD;
      in a red banner in the EMR. The parent will then be mailed a recruitment letter with parent&#xD;
      permission/consent and child assent forms attached for their review. Once a potentially&#xD;
      eligible patient shows up for a sick visit or a well visit, they will receive a handout&#xD;
      reminding them of the study and asking them to consider participation. After their clinic&#xD;
      visit, a designated pediatric resident will obtain parent permission/consent and child&#xD;
      assent. Designated residents are those 2nd and 3rd year pediatric residents who have&#xD;
      completed appropriate CITI training and financial conflict of interest disclosure, and have&#xD;
      been trained by the PI on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint in this study is asthma knowledge at 2 time points: Immediately after&#xD;
      the intervention (at the end of the initial clinic visit) and at 1-month post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint is asthma self-efficacy at the same 2 time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Involved:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of an asthma educational&#xD;
      intervention. It will compare two groups of children and their parents. One cohort will&#xD;
      receive the asthma education intervention &quot;Iggy and the Inhalers,&quot; and the other cohort will&#xD;
      receive usual care in the outpatient, general pediatric clinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment procedures have been completed and the child and parent come into clinic&#xD;
      for their scheduled visit, a member of the study team (designated resident or PI) will meet&#xD;
      them and bring them to a specially designated room in the clinic. This process will occur&#xD;
      after the patient's regularly scheduled visit. The study team member will then review the&#xD;
      study, answer any questions, and obtain parent permission/consent and child assent. The study&#xD;
      team member will indicate enrollment in the EMR by changing the banner to either &quot;ASTHMA&#xD;
      STUDY DECLINED&quot; or &quot;ASTHMA STUDY ENROLLED.&quot; For those who agree to participate, the parent&#xD;
      and child will each be given 2 tools to complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parent:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Asthma Knowledge: Parent Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parent Asthma Self-efficacy survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Asthma Knowledge: Child Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Child Self-efficacy Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the parent will complete a demographic survey. While they are completing these&#xD;
      tools, the study team member will determine the child's group assignment by consulting a&#xD;
      random assignment log maintained at the clinic. Randomization will occur in blocks of 10 to&#xD;
      allow equal group sizes for interim analyses. After the tools have been completed and&#xD;
      collected, the child and parent will be informed of their group assignment, and study&#xD;
      procedures will continue as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline tools have been completed, the child will be given the Iggy Comic Book and&#xD;
      trading cards. Parents and their children will then watch a 12-minute Iggy Video. At the&#xD;
      completion of the video and prior to going home, the child and parent will complete the same&#xD;
      2 measures on asthma knowledge and self-efficacy. At 1-month after this clinic visit, the&#xD;
      parent will be sent an email with a link to a Qualtrics survey that will contain a few&#xD;
      supplemental questions to assess use of the intervention and the same 2 measures that the&#xD;
      parent and the child completed at the initial visit. If we do not receive the completed&#xD;
      surveys within 1-2 weeks, we will call them to remind them and offer them over the phone&#xD;
      completion. If the parent asks to complete the online surveys they will again be given&#xD;
      another 1-2 weeks. If the surveys are still not received, then we will make a 2nd call to&#xD;
      repeat this process. If no success after this attempt, they will be deemed lost to follow-up.&#xD;
      Once the surveys have been completed or the parent/child are deemed lost to follow up, the&#xD;
      outpatient EMR banner will be changed to &quot;ASTHMA STUDY COMPLETE.&quot; When the parent and child&#xD;
      complete the final surveys, a thank you letter will be sent to the child and parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline tools have been completed, the parent and child will go home. At 1-month&#xD;
      after the initial study clinic visit, the parent will be sent an email with a link to a&#xD;
      Qualtrics survey that will contain a few supplemental questions to assess use of the&#xD;
      intervention and the same 2 measures that the parent and the child completed at the initial&#xD;
      visit. If the study team does not receive the completed surveys within 1-2 weeks,&#xD;
      investigators will call them to remind them and offer them over the phone completion. If the&#xD;
      parent asks to complete the online surveys the parents and children will again be given&#xD;
      another 1-2 weeks. If the surveys are still not received, then investigators will make a 2nd&#xD;
      call to repeat this process. If no success after this attempt, will be deemed lost to&#xD;
      follow-up. Once the surveys have been completed or the parent/child are deemed lost to follow&#xD;
      up, the outpatient EMR banner will be changed to &quot;ASTHMA STUDY COMPLETE.&quot; When the parent and&#xD;
      child complete the final surveys, the PI will send the control group a thank you letter with&#xD;
      Iggy Comic Book, trading cards, and link to Iggy videos included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures / Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Includes: age, gender, ethnicity/race, primary language, residential zip code,&#xD;
           education level of caregiver, annual household income, # of ED visits/hospitalizations&#xD;
           for asthma symptoms over the past 1year. Baseline demographic information will be&#xD;
           collected for each parent and child during the initial visit. These baseline measures&#xD;
           include background information, which could become possible confounders for the study.&#xD;
           This information is based on background information from similar studies published in&#xD;
           this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asthma Knowledge Test Parent/Child&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Asthma knowledge will be assessed using 10-item multiple-choice questionnaires for&#xD;
           both parents and children that was developed by Butz et al. Content was derived from the&#xD;
           current National Asthma Educational Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines, asthma&#xD;
           symptom identification interventions, and was derived from a prior study on asthma&#xD;
           education with the original authors permission. The child form was used in children 6-12&#xD;
           years of age. The final 10-item Asthma Knowledge Questionnaire reading level was written&#xD;
           at a 4.7 grade level (Flesch-Kincaid grade level). Content validity of the parent and&#xD;
           child knowledge scales, were assessed by an expert panel of pediatric allergists and&#xD;
           general pediatricians, was high. Total scores on the asthma knowledge scale range from 0&#xD;
           to 10 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asthma Management Self-Efficacy Survey Parent/Child&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Self-efficacy will be assessed using a 13-question (Parent) and a 14-question (Child)&#xD;
           survey. The survey utilizes a Likert scale response format and was designed to measure&#xD;
           self-efficacy with regard to attack prevention and attack management. Acceptable to very&#xD;
           good internal consistency reliabilities (Cronbach's alpha) were obtained for the final&#xD;
           measures: Parent Asthma Self-Efficacy (alpha = 0.87) and Child Asthma Self-Efficacy&#xD;
           (alpha = 0.87). The Parent Asthma Self-efficacy scale was positively correlated with&#xD;
           parent ratings of their child's overall health, parent treatment efficacy, and child&#xD;
           asthma self-efficacy. Child Asthma Self-efficacy was positively correlated with parent&#xD;
           ratings of their children's health, Parent Asthma Self-Efficacy, Parent Treatment&#xD;
           Efficacy, and the age of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supplemental Questions to Assess Use of Intervention o These questions will allow us to&#xD;
           assess the intervention dose. They will also provide feedback on the education program&#xD;
           and allow it to be tailored to different pediatric populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, primary language, residential zip code, education&#xD;
           level of child and caregiver, household income, # of ED visits/hospitalizations for&#xD;
           asthma symptoms over the past 1year)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asthma Knowledge Test Parent/Child: pre-, post-, and 1-month follow up scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self Efficacy Survey Parent/Child: pre-, post-, 1-month follow up scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Responses to Supplemental Survey to Assess Use of the Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comments on the program from parents and patients&#xD;
