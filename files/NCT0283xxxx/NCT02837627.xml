  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to several promoting factors, gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) is very frequent in preterm&#xD;
      infants. To limit the potentially harmful widespread of pharmacological treatment, a&#xD;
      step-wise approach, which firstly undertakes conservative strategies, is currently considered&#xD;
      the best choice to manage GER in the preterm population. Among the most common conservative&#xD;
      strategies, postural measures seem to effectively reduce GER features in symptomatic preterm&#xD;
      babies, whereas feed thickening is almost ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to their prematurity, preterm infants &lt;34 weeks gestation are often unable to coordinate&#xD;
      sucking, swallowing and breathing, thus requiring a feeding tube to ensure adequate enteral&#xD;
      intakes. Continuous feeding and boluses are the most common techniques of enteral tube&#xD;
      feeding in Neonatal Intensive Care Units; at present, however, the effects of these&#xD;
      techniques on GER features have not been clearly established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational, prospective and explorative study primarily aims to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of different techniques of enteral tube feeding on GER frequency and features in symptomatic&#xD;
      preterm infants (gestational age ≤33 weeks) undergoing a diagnostic combined pH and multiple&#xD;
      intraluminal impedance (pH-MII) for GER evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to several promoting factors related to the physiological immaturity of the&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal tract, gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) is a frequent condition among preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GER clinical presentation may vary within a wide range of symptoms, being vomiting,&#xD;
      regurgitations and cardiorespiratory events the most common in the preterm population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined pH and multiple intraluminal impedance (pH-MII) is currently considered the best&#xD;
      choice for GER diagnosis in preterm infants. While pH monitoring is limited to the detection&#xD;
      of acid reflux, combined pH-MII effectively identifies both acid and non-acid GER, which is&#xD;
      predominant in preterm infants. Moreover, it allows to evaluate the height reached by the&#xD;
      refluxate within the esophageal lumen and to distinguish retrograde fluid bolus movements&#xD;
      (reflux) from the anterograde ones (swallows).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade, GER pharmacological treatment has increasingly widespread in Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units (NICUs). The provision of anti-histamine2 blockers and proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitors in the preterm population, however, might lead to such adverse effects as an&#xD;
      increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and infections. Hence, to avoid a useless&#xD;
      and potentially harmful pharmacological overtreatment, a step-wise approach, firstly&#xD;
      promoting conservative strategies, is currently considered the most advisable choice for GER&#xD;
      management in symptomatic preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural and dietary interventions are the most common conservative strategies and their&#xD;
      efficacy in improving GER symptoms and features has been largely investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously assessed by pH-MII, both prone and left-side positions were more effective than&#xD;
      the right-side or supine ones to significantly improve both acid and non-acid GER features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feed thickening is widely employed to reduce vomiting and regurgitations in symptomatic term&#xD;
      infants; with regard to the preterm population, however, little data is currently available.&#xD;
      The efficacy of thickened fortified human milk on preterm infants with GER symptoms has been&#xD;
      previously investigated, observing no benefits. Furthermore, standard human milk&#xD;
      fortification itself has been shown to increase GER frequency in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to anti-regurgitation (AR) formulas, the effectiveness of a specific AR formula,&#xD;
      thickened with amylopectin and specifically tailored for preterm infants' nutritional needs,&#xD;
      has been recently evaluated; the tested thickened formula effectively reduced the number of&#xD;
      acid GERs, but no difference was observed in the frequency of non-acid GERs and in the mean&#xD;
      esophageal acid exposure, which is known to be the main determinant for the development of&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Thus, according to these data, feed thickening seem&#xD;
      to be almost ineffective in improving GER symptoms and features in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to their prematurity, preterm infants &lt;34 weeks gestation are unable to coordinate&#xD;
      sucking, swallowing and breathing; thus, to ensure adequate enteral intakes, they are usually&#xD;
      fed via an intragastric tube. Continuous and bolus feeding are the most common techniques of&#xD;
      enteral tube feeding in NICU settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latter is shown to stimulate cyclical surges of gastrointestinal hormones, thus being&#xD;
      considered more physiological. It entails the administration of the meal by gravity or&#xD;
      through an infusion pump for a total duration of about 10 minutes, after which the feeding&#xD;
      tube could be removed. However, the short time elapsing between the tube insertion for bolus&#xD;
      administration and its subsequent removal might provoke a vagal response, characterized by&#xD;
      bradycardia and temporary reduction of cardiac output. Moreover, the rapid gastric distension&#xD;
      following bolus administration could increase the pressure of lower esophageal sphincter&#xD;
      (LES), thus contributing to the refluxate of gastric contents into the esophageal lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, continuous feeding allows administering enteral feeds over a longer period&#xD;
      (e.g. 2 or 3 hours), at a slower flow rate. It has been associated with better absorption of&#xD;
      nutrients and faster gastric emptying, thus it may be preferable in case of delayed gastric&#xD;
      motility, gastric residuals and abdominal distension. Moreover, its slow rate of infusion&#xD;
      prevents a rapid gastric distension; however, this feeding method requires the permanence of&#xD;
      the feeding tube through the LES for the whole feeding period, and this could predispose to&#xD;
      the occurrence of gastro-esophageal reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of bolus and continuous feeding on cardio-respiratory events, which could&#xD;
      represent clinical atypical manifestations of GER, has been recently evaluated, observing a&#xD;
      slight but significant increase of apneic episodes during continuous feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review has aimed to evaluate which of these tube-feeding methods could be&#xD;
      more suitable in low birth weight infants with GER symptoms; however, current data are scarce&#xD;
      and controversial and do not allow to draw any definitive conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different enteral tube feeding modalities,&#xD;
      such as bolus and continuous feeding, on pH-MII GER features in tube-fed preterm infants ≤33&#xD;
      weeks gestation, undergoing a diagnostic pH-MII evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, thirty preterm infants ≤33 weeks gestation will be enrolled if suffering from&#xD;
      moderate/severe GER symptoms and if a diagnostic 24-hour pH-MII monitoring has been scheduled&#xD;
      to evaluate GER features, according to our clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 24-h pH-MII monitoring, each infant will receive his meals (usually 8) according&#xD;
      to the following sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1st meal: optional modality (not considered for statistical analysis);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2nd meal: continuous feeding over 3 hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3rd meal: bolus feeding; the feeding tube remains in place for the whole post-prandial&#xD;
           period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4th meal: bolus feeding; the feeding tube is removed after feed administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5th: continuous feeding over 3 hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6th : bolus feeding; the feeding tube remains in place for the whole post-prandial&#xD;
           period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7th: bolus feeding; the feeding tube is removed after feed administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8th: optional modality (not considered for statistical analysis). Healthcare assistants&#xD;
           will inspect the correct application of this sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pH-MII device in use for this study (Comfortec pH-MII Sandhill Scientific®) is a&#xD;
      nasogastric probe with seven rings, composed by six dipolar impedance channels and one&#xD;
      antimony electrode responsible for pH detection and placed in the middle of the distal&#xD;
      impedance dipole. Due to these characteristics, pH-MII is able to measure the esophageal&#xD;
      height reached by refluxate and to identify the direction of esophageal bolus movements,&#xD;
      thereby distinguish between a retrograde flow (reflux) and an anti-retrograde flow (swallow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distance between the infant's nose and LES will be determined with Strobel's formula:&#xD;
      [baby length (cm) x 0.252 + 5)] - 13%. After placement, the probe's position will be&#xD;
      radiographically confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the pH-MII recording will be automatically acquired on a portable Sleuth Sandhill&#xD;
      Scientific system and then stored in a personal computer containing a specific software&#xD;
      (BioVIEW Analysis Sandhill Scientific, version 5.0.9). Data analysis will be performed by the&#xD;
      aforementioned software and confirmed by direct visual evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by SPSS 20 (Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. Differences between the different&#xD;
      modalities in terms of GER frequency and features will be tested by Friedman test (level of&#xD;
      significance: p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
