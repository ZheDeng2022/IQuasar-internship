      Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) which is approved as a treatment for men and women with urgency&#xD;
      urinary incontinence (UUI), urgency frequency syndrome, urinary retention and anal&#xD;
      incontinence, is a procedure designed to deliver electrical pulses to the sacral nerves,&#xD;
      thereby influencing the bladder, sphincters, and pelvic floor. Although the success rates of&#xD;
      this treatment are quite high, the precise mechanism of action of SNM in subjects with UUI&#xD;
      remains unclear. Moreover, there are little data regarding specific patient characteristics&#xD;
      that may serve as &quot;predictors&quot; for SNM success. Recent studies suggest that the bacterial&#xD;
      community that lives in the urinary tract plays a role in the development and continuation of&#xD;
      urinary symptoms. It is proposed that the urinary microbiome may change in women before and&#xD;
      after SNM implantation and this study aims to describe these changes. Investigators in this&#xD;
      study also hope to determine if differences in the urinary microbiome exist in women with a&#xD;
      positive response to SNM treatment (responders) compared to those without symptom improvement&#xD;
      (non-responders). This hypothesis will be tested by collecting urine samples as well as&#xD;
      questionnaire and medical data from subjects with UUI that are already planning on undergoing&#xD;
      SNM as part of clinical care before and after their SNM treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One in four women reports bothersome symptoms of a pelvic floor disorder with 16% reporting&#xD;
      urinary incontinence (UI). Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) which is approved for men and women&#xD;
      with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), urgency frequency syndrome, urinary retention and&#xD;
      anal incontinence, is a procedure designed to deliver electrical pulses to the sacral nerves,&#xD;
      thereby influencing the bladder, sphincters, and pelvic floor. SNM provides symptomatic&#xD;
      relief in 70-86% of patients undergoing the procedure for UUI according to several recent&#xD;
      prospective studies. Although the success rates are quite high, the precise mechanism of&#xD;
      action of SNM in subjects with UUI remains unclear. Moreover, there are little data regarding&#xD;
      specific patient characteristics that may serve as &quot;predictors&quot; for SNM success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiome refers to the genetic material of the micro-organisms present in a particular&#xD;
      environment. The role of the microbiome has recently been implicated in several disease&#xD;
      states (obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional bowel disease. Initially, the&#xD;
      urinary microbiome was not a part of the &quot;human microbiome project&quot; as it was widely accepted&#xD;
      that urine is sterile. However, recent studies have noted the presence of a urinary&#xD;
      microbiota in adult women without clinical urinary tract infections. Furthermore, recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that the urinary microbiome differs among women with UUI versus those&#xD;
      without UUI and also among women with interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome versus&#xD;
      those without it. These studies suggest that the urinary microbiome plays a role in the&#xD;
      development and continuation of urinary symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the invasiveness of the SNM procedure, it would be helpful to have a way to&#xD;
      predict treatment success. Investigators in this study propose that the urinary microbiome&#xD;
      may change in women before and after SNM implantation and hope to describe these changes by&#xD;
      conducting this study. Investigators also hope to determine if differences in the urinary&#xD;
      microbiome exist in women with a positive response to SNM treatment (responders) compared to&#xD;
      those without symptom improvement (non-responders). This hypothesis will be tested by&#xD;
      collecting urine samples from subjects with UUI that are already planning on undergoing SNM&#xD;
      as part of clinical care before and after their SNM treatment.&#xD;
