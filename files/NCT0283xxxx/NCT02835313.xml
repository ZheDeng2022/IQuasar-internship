  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors, as a group, are extremely inactive and this has serious consequences for&#xD;
      them, including an increased risk of a second stroke and developing other diseases. This&#xD;
      study investigates a novel intervention designed to improve everyday activity after stroke by&#xD;
      combining walking training to improve walking capacity with a program to encourage more daily&#xD;
      walking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a group, stroke survivors are more physically inactive than even the most sedentary older&#xD;
      adults. Lack of physical activity has serious consequences in persons with stroke, including&#xD;
      an increased risk of recurrent stroke, developing other diseases and mortality. Current&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions do little to improve real-world walking activity after stroke,&#xD;
      suggesting that simply improving walking capacity is not sufficient for improving daily&#xD;
      physical activity after stroke. Rather, the investigator's hypothesize that the combination&#xD;
      of a fast walking intervention that improves walking capacity, with a step activity&#xD;
      monitoring program that facilitates translation of gains from the clinic to the &quot;real-world&quot;,&#xD;
      would generate greater improvements in real world walking activity than with either&#xD;
      intervention alone. Data from the investigator's lab provides support for this hypothesis;&#xD;
      however, it suggests that the greater efficacy of combining the 2 interventions depends on a&#xD;
      participant's initial walking activity. Thus, the investigator's do not expect that one&#xD;
      intervention will be superior to the others for all participants, but rather that the&#xD;
      combined intervention will be superior for those with low levels of baseline walking&#xD;
      activity, speed and endurance. The specific objective of this study is to test whether and&#xD;
      for whom combining fast walking training with a step activity monitoring program (FAST+SAM)&#xD;
      is superior in improving real-world walking activity compared to fast walking training alone&#xD;
      (FAST) or a step activity monitoring and feedback program alone (SAM) in those with chronic&#xD;
      stroke. Using a randomized controlled experimental design, 225 chronic (&gt; 6 months) stroke&#xD;
      survivors, will complete 12 weeks of fast walking training (FAST), a step activity monitoring&#xD;
      program (SAM) or a fast walking training + step activity monitoring program (FAST+SAM).&#xD;
      Moderation of specific intervention outcomes by baseline characteristics will be evaluated to&#xD;
      determine for whom the interventions are effective.&#xD;
