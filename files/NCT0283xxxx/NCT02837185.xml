      This study will look into the effects of Botulinum Toxin in patients with primary cervical&#xD;
      dystonia. The effects will be determined by neck muscle activity measurements and brain&#xD;
      function activity measurements. The goal of the study is to try to identify markers of the&#xD;
      effects of Botulinum toxin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary Cervical Dystonia (PCD) is the most common type of focal dystonia. In addition to&#xD;
      pain, PCD is associated with disability in many activities of daily living; social stigma and&#xD;
      embarrassment; and decreased quality of life. Botulinum toxin (BoNT) therapy is the &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot; for treatment of PCD. Although effective in improving dystonia symptoms, BoNT&#xD;
      injections have been associated with suboptimal improvements and the benefits of BoNT may&#xD;
      last shorter than the expected time frame of 12 weeks. PCD subjects are referred for deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation surgery if there is poor or inconsistent response to medical treatment. In&#xD;
      addition to the need for repetitive injections, subjects may suffer from side effects such as&#xD;
      neck pain, muscle weakness, head drop, breathing difficulty, and swallowing issues. BoNT&#xD;
      therapy outcomes are not likely to improve until and unless the investigators understand the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to examine the physiological effects of BoNT therapy and to&#xD;
      advance the understanding of the pathophysiology of dystonia. BoNT therapy is commonly&#xD;
      perceived to induce peripheral muscle weakness through inhibition of acetylcholine release at&#xD;
      the neuromuscular junction. However many argue that this is not likely the only or primary&#xD;
      mechanism of action, as many subjects have improvement in dystonia without discernible muscle&#xD;
      weakness and others have significant weakness and no improvement in their dystonia. Indeed,&#xD;
      BoNT has been proposed to induce central effects possibly related to modulation of the muscle&#xD;
      spindle afferent feedback or a retrograde transport of toxin to the central nervous system. A&#xD;
      leading theory underpinning the pathophysiology of dystonia is loss of motor inhibition (or&#xD;
      increased excitability) at the level of the spinal cord, brainstem and the motor cortex.&#xD;
      Thus, modulation of pathology in these central pathways is critical for control of dystonia.&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive physiological technique for&#xD;
      assessment of motor cortex excitability. Paired-pulse TMS paradigms, such as short-interval&#xD;
      intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) are well established&#xD;
      paradigms for evaluation of motor cortex excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SICI is measured by delivering a subthreshold conditioning pulse prior to the suprathreshold&#xD;
      test pulse at short interstimulus intervals (ISI) of 1-5 milliseconds (ms) resulting in a&#xD;
      lower motor evoked potential (MEP) response to the test pulse. SICI is regarded as a&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptor-mediated inhibition that involves activation of&#xD;
      the cortical inhibitory interneurons. ICF is measured using a paradigm similar to SICI but&#xD;
      with a longer ISI of 8-30 ms resulting in increase in MEP response. Glutamate is probably&#xD;
      involved in producing ICF through cortical facilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In focal dystonia, including PCD, there is failure of SICI recorded from hand muscles, and&#xD;
      conversely, there is enhanced ICF recorded from hand muscles. These paradigms were not&#xD;
      recorded from neck muscles as they are technically challenging. Nevertheless an important&#xD;
      finding was noted that in PCD, the motor cortical inhibition is widespread and extends beyond&#xD;
      the area of symptomatic muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS was used to assess the effects of BoNT on SICI in subjects with arm dystonia. SICI in&#xD;
      distal hand muscle increases at one month after BoNT injections and returns to the previously&#xD;
      abnormal levels of excitability at three months. It can be speculated that the BoNT therapy&#xD;
      to arm muscles modulates the afferent input from muscles, which probably results in&#xD;
      reorganization of the motor cortex. It is not clear if the physiological change induced by&#xD;
      BoNT therapy had any correlation with the clinical improvement. In addition, it is not clear&#xD;
      if the change in motor cortex excitability ultimately affects the corticospinal drive to the&#xD;
      dystonic muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will focus on the physiological effects of BoNT using&#xD;
      broader TMS measures of motor cortex excitability. The central hypothesis is that BoNT&#xD;
      modulates the motor cortex excitability and the corticospinal drive to the muscles and that&#xD;
      these physiological effects of BoNT will have a clear correlation with the clinical response.&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators plan to measure the corticospinal drive to&#xD;
      dystonic muscles using electromyographic (EMG) spectral analysis. They will record the&#xD;
      clinical outcome with the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) which&#xD;
      is a standardized validated rating scale for PCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first and second aim will focus on the physiological aspects of BoNT therapy in PCD. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to determine the cortical and corticospinal physiologic changes at the&#xD;
      time of peak BoNT effects (BoNT ON) which are typically seen around 4-8 weeks after the&#xD;
      injections and at the time of wearing off related to BoNT therapy which will correspond to&#xD;
      the time of the next injection cycle (BoNT OFF). The third aim will help the investigators&#xD;
      understand the physiological differences between clinical responders and non-responders.&#xD;
      Healthy controls will be enrolled for normative physiological data. The main significance of&#xD;
      this study is advancement of physiological knowledge related to BoNT therapy in subjects with&#xD;
      PCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of BoNT therapy on the motor cortex excitability in PCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS measures (such as SICI, ICF,...) will be collected using standardized protocols at the&#xD;
      time of peak BoNT effects (BoNT ON) and at the time of trough BoNT effects (BoNT OFF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TMS measures will be normalized to healthy controls at the time of peak BoNT effects and&#xD;
      these effects will reverse once the BoNT effects wear off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of BoNT therapy on the corticospinal drive to the PCD muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG spectral analysis for the auto-spectral peak of 4-7 Hertz (Hz) at the sternocleidomastoid&#xD;
      (SCM) and the 10-12 Hz coherence between the SCM and the splenius capitis (SPL) will be used&#xD;
      at the time of peak (BoNT ON) and trough BoNT effects (BoNT OFF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coherence between SPL and SCM muscles will be lost at the time of peak BoNT effects.&#xD;
      There will be a re-appearance of the auto-spectral peak in SPL muscle as seen in healthy&#xD;
      controls. These spectral analysis changes will reverse as the BoNT effects wear off during&#xD;
      trough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the correlation between the physiological measures (TMS and EMG measures) during&#xD;
      peak BoNT effects and the clinical scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in TMS measures and EMG spectral findings at the time of peak BoNT effects will&#xD;
      correlate with the change in clinical score on the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis&#xD;
      Rating Scale (TWSTRS) scale.&#xD;
