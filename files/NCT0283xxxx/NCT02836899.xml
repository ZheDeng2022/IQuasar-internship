      I. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Methods of enrollment, including procedures for patient registration. Patients will be&#xD;
           screened in the &quot;Cardiac surgery pre-operative clinic&quot;, Massachusetts General Hospital&#xD;
           (MGH) Cox building floor 6 (before surgery). If the patient is eligible and after&#xD;
           obtaining the consent of the primary cardiac surgeon, the patient will be approached for&#xD;
           consent to participate in this clinical trial. Consent will be obtained exclusively from&#xD;
           the patient, and not from a surrogate, because cardiac surgery is usually a scheduled&#xD;
           procedure. The obtaining of the consent directly from the patient is preferred, since&#xD;
           there will be the opportunity of interaction with the patient when he/she is fully&#xD;
           awake. After consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized to the study group. A&#xD;
           de-identified code will be assigned to the patient and registered on a dedicated&#xD;
           enrollment log.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedures for obtaining informed consent (including timing of consent process).&#xD;
           Patients will be screened in the &quot;Cardiac surgery pre-operative clinic&quot;, MGH Cox&#xD;
           building floor 6 (before surgery). If a patient is eligible for the study and after&#xD;
           obtaining the consent of the primary cardiac surgeon, the patient will be approached to&#xD;
           consent to participate in the clinical trial. There is no need for surrogate consent for&#xD;
           this trial, as explained above. Signing the Informed Consent Form will be requested for&#xD;
           participation in the study. Personal Medical Information (PMI) will be accessed by the&#xD;
           investigator(s) only for study purposes. Patients who choose not to participate in this&#xD;
           study will receive standard care according to the procedures of the ICU, without any&#xD;
           repercussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment assignment and randomization (if applicable). To ensure a robust and unbiased&#xD;
           approach, randomization should account for demographic characteristics of the patients&#xD;
           (i.e.: age, sex) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Only patients who are cared for&#xD;
           by experienced anesthesiologists and cardiac surgeons (more than 5 years of staff&#xD;
           experience) will participate in this study. The patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
           either NO (study drug) or N2 (placebo) alone. In order to account for an elevated&#xD;
           baseline pulmonary artery pressure, patients with pre-operative mean PAP ≥30 mmHg will&#xD;
           be allocated equally to the two groups during the stratified randomization process. The&#xD;
           random allocation sequence will be created using a computerized random generation&#xD;
           program. The randomization will be in blocks of 10 patients. The intervention will&#xD;
           consist of administering the test gas via the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine and&#xD;
           after CPB via the inspiratory limb of the anesthetic or ventilator circuit, and&#xD;
           thereafter via the mechanical ventilator in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). When patients&#xD;
           are extubated they will breathe test gas via a facemask or nasal prongs. Test gas&#xD;
           administration will commence at the onset of CPB and last for 24 hours. At the end of 24&#xD;
           hours, inhaled NO (iNO) will be weaned and discontinued while carefully monitoring&#xD;
           hemodynamics for a period of 2-4 hours. Local guidelines for NO gas discontinuation will&#xD;
           be followed. Using commercially available tanks of Nitric Oxide (Airgas Inc, Radnor&#xD;
           Township, Pennsylvania) or volumetrically-calibrated flowmeters, pure N2 (placebo) or&#xD;
           850 ppm NO gas in N2 will be mixed with pure oxygen (O2) or air to obtain the desired&#xD;
           concentration of O2 and, in the NO treatment group, a final concentration of 80 ppm NO.&#xD;
           For safety, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), O2 and methemoglobin (Met-Hb) levels&#xD;
           will be continuously monitored by the personnel unblinded to the study. Patients in the&#xD;
           placebo (N2) group will receive nitrogen test gas during the same 24 hour-period. The&#xD;
           inspired oxygen levels will be maintained at the usual levels required for routine&#xD;
           post-operative care. No changes to the usual and customary standards of care for any&#xD;
           intraoperative or postoperative treatment will be made during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blinding procedure for Nitric Oxide and Nitrogen delivery. A double-blind study will be&#xD;
           performed to avoid potential patient and investigator bias, the study is blinded to:&#xD;
           participants, perfusionists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, ICU physicians and the nursing&#xD;
           staff. The test gas tank and the gas delivery system in the operating room (OR) and at&#xD;
           the bedside will be masked. The respiratory therapist in the ICU and a member of the&#xD;
           study staff will be unblinded and will prepare the appropriate test gas tanks and NO/N2&#xD;
           meters. Blood Met-Hb levels and NO/NO2 concentrations are safety concerns that the&#xD;
           respiratory therapist and one member of the study staff will monitor and regulate (NO2&#xD;
           levels will be maintained below 5 ppm, and Met-Hb below 5%, if necessary by reducing NO&#xD;
           concentration to 40 ppm or less according to MGH guidelines NO therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. STUDY PROCEDURES a. Study visits and parameters to be measured (e.g., laboratory tests,&#xD;
      x-rays, and other testing). SCREENING visit: Screening will take place in the &quot;Cardiac&#xD;
      surgery pre-operative clinic&quot;, MGH Cox building floor 6 (before surgery). Patients will be&#xD;
      screened if they require prolonged CPB (&gt;90 minutes on CPB, i.e., valve replacement ±&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)) and if the primary cardiac surgeon of the patient&#xD;
      agrees on enrolling the patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review eligibility entry criteria of the study: inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the research protocol: This is a protected time for the subject to ask questions&#xD;
           and become familiar with all aspects of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of a brief questionnaire to determine endothelial function with the&#xD;
           subject verbal assent on the day of pre-surgical evaluation. The questionnaire evaluates&#xD;
           medical history, integrating clinical and laboratory data of screened patients. In males&#xD;
           &gt; 40 year old and females &gt; 50 year old, endothelial dysfunction has been shown to be&#xD;
           associated with at least one the following criteria: Previous coronary artery bypass&#xD;
           graft or PTCA (+ stent); History or presence of intermittent claudication; Critical limb&#xD;
           ischemia, or peripheral vascular disease with the Exception of vasculitis; History of&#xD;
           transient ischemic attack and/or ischemic stroke; Diagnosis of diabetes (IDDM or NIDDM)&#xD;
           requiring oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin; Hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol &gt;&#xD;
           200 mg/dl or LDL &gt; 160 mg/dl) treated with statins, ion- exchange resins or other oral&#xD;
           agents; BMI &gt; 40; Hypertension (SBP 140 ≥ mmHg) treated with antihypertensive drugs;&#xD;
           Active smoking ≥ 10 pack - years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent form: The subject will be asked to sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests will be reviewed by the same physician, and if inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are met, subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the test gas study groups&#xD;
      (inhaled 80 parts per million (ppm) nitric oxide in nitrogen) or the placebo group (inhaled&#xD;
      N2). The intervention will consist of giving the test gas both via the CPB machine and after&#xD;
      CPB via the anesthetic circuit, and thereafter via the mechanical ventilator and/or with face&#xD;
      mask/nasal prongs in the ICU/ward. Test gas administration will commence at the onset of CPB&#xD;
      and last for 24 hours. At the end of 24 hours, iNO will be weaned and discontinued while&#xD;
      carefully monitoring hemodynamics for a period of 2-4 hours. Local guidelines for iNO&#xD;
      discontinuation will be adopted. Using an Inovent (Ikaria Inc, N.J., USA) or&#xD;
      volumetrically-calibrated flowmeters, pure nitrogen (placebo) or 850 ppm NO gas in N2 is&#xD;
      mixed with pure O2 or air to obtain a final concentration of 80 ppm NO. During CPB the test&#xD;
      gas is delivered through the extracorporeal oxygenator, after CPB the NO is delivered through&#xD;
      the inspiratory limb of the anesthetic or ventilator circuit. NO, NO2 and O2 and&#xD;
      methemoglobin levels are monitored by an unblinded observer. Patients in the placebo group&#xD;
      will receive nitrogen test gas during the same 24 hour-period. When patients are extubated&#xD;
      they will breathe test gas via a face mask or nasal prongs. The inspired oxygen levels will&#xD;
      be maintained at the usual levels required for routine post-operative care. The test gas tank&#xD;
      in the OR and at the bedside will be covered and blinded from the clinicians treating the&#xD;
      patient. Only the respiratory therapist in the ICU and a member of the study staff will be&#xD;
      unblinded and will prepare the appropriate test gas tanks and NO/N2 meters. No changes to the&#xD;
      usual and customary standards of care for any intraoperative or postoperative treatments will&#xD;
      be made during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Independent monitoring of source data. Informed consent forms, case report forms, and&#xD;
           data will be reviewed by the principal investigator following enrollment of every 5&#xD;
           subjects and an independent data and safety monitor following enrollment of every 50&#xD;
           subjects to the protocol to ensure safety of the study subjects. The safety data that&#xD;
           will be reviewed includes: patient-, nurse-, research-assistant, or&#xD;
           investigator-reported adverse events such as reason for early termination of the&#xD;
           protocol, or adverse reaction to NO. Other data to be reviewed includes appropriate&#xD;
           handling and processing of blood samples and maintenance of patient confidentiality&#xD;
           throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety monitoring (e.g., Data Safety Monitoring Board, etc.). An interim analysis by a&#xD;
           Data Safety management Board (DSMB) comprised of 3 members is planned at reaching 50% of&#xD;
           the study population (125 patients enrolled). The study will only be stopped if the&#xD;
           interim analysis detects a significant increase of mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI),&#xD;
           need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), myocardial infarction (MI), post-operative&#xD;
           hemorrhage, other significant morbidity in the NO test gas group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Members of the Data Safety Management Board (DSMB) consist of an anesthesiologist with&#xD;
           clinical expertise in NO, a cardiologist and a nephrologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outcomes monitoring. Plasma creatinine will be measured daily until day 7 after CPB or&#xD;
           until discharge from the hospital if this occurs earlier. Urine output will be assessed&#xD;
           until day 7 after CPB or until discharge from the hospital if this occurs earlier.&#xD;
           Follow up will be completed at 1 year after surgery as described in &quot;V. Study&#xD;
           procedure&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adverse event reporting guidelines. The principal investigator will review any adverse&#xD;
           events immediately following their occurrence and report them to the Institutional&#xD;
           Review Board (IRB) in accordance with Partners Investigator guidelines. Specifically,&#xD;
           for this study, serious adverse events will be reported by phone, fax, or email within&#xD;
           24 hours to the Human Research Committee (HRC), followed by a full written report within&#xD;
           10 business/14 calendar days. Mild or moderate adverse events will be presented in&#xD;
           progress reports at continuing reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules. The review and decision regarding altering or stopping the protocol will be&#xD;
      performed by the principal investigator together with the DSMB. Mild or moderate adverse&#xD;
      events will be presented in progress reports at continuing reviews. Protocol exit criteria&#xD;
      will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acute worsening hypotension: decrease in mean blood pressure of &gt; 20 mmHg not&#xD;
           attributable to other causes, i.e., hypovolemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, acute heart&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sudden worsening of hypoxemia: decrease of peripheral oxygen saturation (SatO2) &lt; 70% at&#xD;
           100% of inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) not attributable to other causes, i.e.,&#xD;
           pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An increase in NO2 levels &gt; 5 ppm from baseline or any life-threatening symptom&#xD;
           potentially attributed to NO administration by the physician investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Specific data variables being collected for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative collection of patient data from the MGH electronic medical chart (EPIC) will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographics&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Pertinent cardiopulmonary test results: i.e., echocardiography, cardiac catheterization,&#xD;
           pulmonary function tests, and chest imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective collection of patient data will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICU and length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of mechanical ventilation&#xD;

           (ESC)/American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association&#xD;
           (AHA)/World Heart Federation (WHF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal failure requiring dialysis at any time during hospitalization and at 6 weeks, 90&#xD;
           days and 1 year after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute Kidney Injury as difened by KDIGO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organ dysfunction assessed daily in ICU by using Sequential organ failure assessment&#xD;
           (SOFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delirium assessed daily in the first 7 days after surgery by using the confusion&#xD;
           assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular support: vasopressors and inotropic agents requirement&#xD;
           (Vasoactive-inotropic score), need for balloon pump or ventricular-assist device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative infections, cardiac arrhytmias and non cardiac complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood samples will be collected before surgery, at the end of surgery, each day until&#xD;
           day 7 after the cardiac procedure or until hospital discharge if before day 7, and at 6&#xD;
           weeks. The samples will be tested for: creatinine (after surgery, 24 hours after the end&#xD;
           of CPB, 48 hours after the end of CPB, POD3, POD4, POD5, POD6, POD7 and 6 weeks) and&#xD;
           biomarkers for kidney injury (immediately before CPB, 15 minutes after the end of CPB,&#xD;
           24 hours after the end of CPB, 48 hours after the end of CPB and at 6 weeks). Urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected for urinary biomarkers of kidney injury immediately before&#xD;
           CPB, 15 minutes after the end of CPB, 24 hours after the end of CPB, 48 hours after the&#xD;
           end of CPB and at 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statistical methods. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
           supplementation with NO decreases the incidence of AKI in patients with signs and&#xD;
           symptoms suggesting endothelial dysfunction. A total of 250 cardiac-surgery patients&#xD;
           will be enrolled, requiring more than 90 minutes of CPB. The two arms will be compared&#xD;
           for homogeneity of baseline characteristics (age, weight, sex, and GFR), intraoperative&#xD;
           course (CPB time, amount of blood transfusions) and postoperative data (post-operative&#xD;
           transfusions, adverse events directly related to surgery procedures). To examine&#xD;
           differences between the two groups, we will use an unpaired Student's t-test for&#xD;
           continuous variables with a normal distribution, a Mann-Whitney U test for continuous&#xD;
           variables that are not normally distributed and a Fisher's exact test for dichotomous&#xD;
           variables. Continuous variables will be described as mean±standard deviation (SD) when&#xD;
           normally distributed, median with interquartiles (IQR) when not normally distributed, or&#xD;
           count (%) if a dichotomous variable. The change in the laboratory markers over time and&#xD;
           between the two groups will be tested with a repeated measures ANOVA. The incidence of&#xD;
           AKI and postoperative adverse events after prolonged CPB will be described in terms of&#xD;
           relative risk with significance level and confidence intervals for the two groups. Based&#xD;
           on the occurrence of missing data, the strategy to manage them will be decided. However,&#xD;
           our aim would be not to use any kind of imputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Power analysis. The sample size of this trial was calculated based on the primary&#xD;
           endpoint: the reduction of AKI incidence. Despite we do not have track incidence, AKI is&#xD;
           very common in our MGH patients after open-heart surgery, and it is reasonable to assume&#xD;
           that AKI incidence is similar to those recent reports from US and European studies at&#xD;
           major academic centers CPB (AKI incidence has been reported to be between 50 to 60%). In&#xD;
           our prior trial on NO in cardiac surgery, the sample size was calculated to find a 30%&#xD;
           reduction in the incidence of AKI (n=212 in that trial). We estimate a greater (35%)&#xD;
           reduction in the incidence of AKI because we anticipate that this population with signs&#xD;
           and symptoms of endothelial dysfunction will be more affected by the beneficial&#xD;
           therapeutic properties of NO. Thus, in the NO group the incidence of AKI is expected to&#xD;
           decrease from 55% to 35.75%. The sample size needed to detect a difference, assuming an&#xD;
           alpha error of 0.05 (two-sided test) and a study power of 0.8, is 114 patients per&#xD;
           group. In order to account for possible dropouts, we increased our sample size by 10%.&#xD;
           We will enroll 250 patients, 125 in the NO group and 125 patients in the control (N2)&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
