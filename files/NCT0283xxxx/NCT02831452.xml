      The aim of this study is to determine if there is a correlation between digital palpation,&#xD;
      perineometry and dynamometry as PFM function evaluation methods in nulliparous without pelvic&#xD;
      floor dysfunction.&#xD;

      Study design - this study was conducted in Cinesiofunctional Performance Laboratory Pelvic&#xD;
      and Women's Health at the Federal University of Uberlandia (UFU), the volunteers were&#xD;
      recruited from December 2014 to July 2015. This is an observational, cross-sectional and&#xD;
      comparative study, the sample consisted of 141 nulliparous women (non-pregnant nulliparous or&#xD;
      primigravids). All volunteer shave signed an informed consent and the study was approved by&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Uberlandia (No.1067162/2014). Female&#xD;
      students of UFU were invited by personal contact to participate in the study. The&#xD;
      primigravids were participants in the Prenatal Program of the public health system in&#xD;
      Uberlandia city and they have also been invited by personal contact. Inclusion criterion for&#xD;
      volunteers were: never have passed for childbirth situation,ability to contract correctly the&#xD;
      PFM and without urogynecological complaints. Exclusion criterion were: history of previous&#xD;
      pelvic surgery, without previous sexual intercourse, and present neuromuscular diseases. The&#xD;
      experient examiner, with expertise in PFM evaluation conducted the evaluations. After&#xD;
      checking that they were eligible to participate in the survey, participants were asked to&#xD;
      empty the bladder and to remain in the supine position on an appropriate bed with hips and&#xD;
      knees flexed and maintaining the lumbar spine in neutral position.The PFM assessment was&#xD;
      performed by vaginal palpation, vaginal squeeze pressure and dynamometry. The vaginal&#xD;
      palpation and vaginal squeeze pressure are widely used in research involving the female&#xD;
      pelvic floor and many studies have shown its reproducibility and validity(10, 11, 12, 13).&#xD;
      The measurements performed with a dynamometer in this study were similar to the study of&#xD;
      Martinho et al(4) which used the same instrument and have demonstrated reproducibility of the&#xD;
      assessment method. During all PFM assessments, the volunteer was advised to stay relaxed and&#xD;
      breathing normally. To be considered valid, the cranial elevation movement was observed by&#xD;
      the examiner, as well as the absence of visible contractions of the adductor, muscles of the&#xD;
      hip, gluteal muscles or abdominals. Strong verbal command was adopted to request the PFM&#xD;
      contraction in all exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments began after explaining how to perform the PFM contraction. The vaginal palpation&#xD;
      was always the first exam to check the PFM contraction ability and then the order of vaginal&#xD;
      squeeze pressure exam and dynamometry was randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PFM assessment by digital palpation was performed as proposed by Laycock and Jerwood. The&#xD;
      physiotherapist introduced the index and middle fingers about 4 cm inside the vagina, and&#xD;
      requested to hold the maximum contraction of the PFM, according to the instruction of a&#xD;
      movement &quot;inward and up&quot; with the greatest possible strength. Muscle function was classified&#xD;
      by the Oxford Scale Modified, which varies from zero (absence of muscle contraction) to five&#xD;
      (strong contraction). The vaginal squeeze pressure was measured through Peritron equipment&#xD;
      (Cardio Design Pty Ltd, Oakleigh, Victoria, Australia) equipped with a vaginal probe that has&#xD;
      been covered with a non-lubricated condom and then the probe was lubricated with&#xD;
      hypoallergenic gel. The probe sensor was connected to a microprocessor hand with a latex&#xD;
      tube, which allows the measurement of nip pressure in centimeters of water (cmH2O). To obtain&#xD;
      the measurements, the subjects remained positioning and vaginal sensor was introduced&#xD;
      approximately 3.5cm into the vaginal cavity. Then the device was inflated to 100cmH2O&#xD;
      (calibration). The female volunteers were oriented and motivated verbally to perform three&#xD;
      voluntary maximal contractions sustained for five seconds and one minute interval between&#xD;
      them. The correct contraction was checked visually by the physiotherapist. All volunteers&#xD;
      were instructed to avoid using the abdominal muscles, gluteal and hip adductor. For&#xD;
      statistical analysis, the investigator used the peak pressure provided by the equipment. The&#xD;
      PFM contraction strength was assessed by vaginal dynamometer EMG System do Brasil (model DFV&#xD;
      020.101/10). It is cylindrical in shape (9.5 cm in length and 3.3 cm in diameter), made of&#xD;
      steel and is equipped with a load cell 2 cm from its base, which can measure anteroposterior&#xD;
      unidirectional compressive strength in Kg/force (Kgf). The equipment was previously coated&#xD;
      with a condom and lubricated with hypoallergenic gel, which was inserted into the vaginal&#xD;
      cavity with the load cell positioned so that it could capture the anteroposterior compression&#xD;
      strength. The participant was asked to perform three maximal voluntary PFM contractions for&#xD;
      eight seconds with a rest period of 30 seconds between the contractions. The same precautions&#xD;
      for correct contraction were adopted. The best value of maximum strength (difference between&#xD;
      the highest and lowest strength in Kgf) was used for statistical analysis. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSSV17,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL). Data normality was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify the correlation between the variables, the Pearson correlation test was used.&#xD;
      Values of p &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The correlation values were interpreted&#xD;
      according to the following guidelines: 0.00 - 0.19= no to slight; 0.20-0.39= mild; 0.40-0.69=&#xD;
      moderate; 0.70-0.89= high and 0.90-1.00= very high. Data were expressed as mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD).&#xD;
