  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects 1 in 16 people in the UK, and leads to&#xD;
      difficulty controlling blood sugar levels. This is due to an imbalance between two main&#xD;
      hormones: insulin, which lowers blood sugar, and glucagon, which causes it to rise. Most&#xD;
      current anti-diabetic medications work to improve insulin levels, however research is now&#xD;
      shifting to better understand how glucagon levels play a key role in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glibenclamide is a type of anti-diabetic medication (sulfonylurea) which is commonly used to&#xD;
      increase the amount of insulin released by the pancreatic beta-cells. Studies in mice and&#xD;
      human cells from donors with type 2 diabetes have shown that sulfonylureas can also improve&#xD;
      glucagon levels when used in very small doses by working on different cells in the pancreas&#xD;
      (alpha-cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find out whether low doses of glibenclamide can improve glucagon&#xD;
      levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, and whether in the future this could be used to&#xD;
      better control high blood sugar levels, without the risk of causing low blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with type 2 diabetes who are diet-controlled or on metformin will be given a&#xD;
      liquid containing a low dose of glibenclamide. They will need to attend the OCDEM Clinical&#xD;
      Research Unit at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, for early morning blood tests every 3-4 days&#xD;
      over a period of 3 weeks. A continuous glucose monitor will also be fitted during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is funded by the NIHR OxBRC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigator-initiated clinical trial is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised,&#xD;
      dose-finding study. The am is to investigate whether treatment with low-dose glibenclamide&#xD;
      can lead to a decrease in fasting glucagon levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, and&#xD;
      whether this has an impact on overall blood glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be conducted in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) of the Oxford Centre for Diabetes,&#xD;
      Endocrinology and Metabolism (OCDEM) at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford. The aim is to find&#xD;
      the dose of glibenclamide that causes a reduction in fasting glucagon levels in patients with&#xD;
      T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will self-administer increasing doses of an oral glibenclamide suspension from&#xD;
      0.3-6mg every 3 or 4 days, over a period of 21 days. They will attend the CRU for fasting&#xD;
      pre-dose blood tests for insulin, glucagon, C- peptide and glucose prior to each dose change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will have the option of having a continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
      (CGM) sensor attached for the duration of the study, which will be checked and changed at&#xD;
      each visit to CRU. This will measure the impact of treatment on overall blood glucose&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No human trials have used doses of glibenclamide under 5mg previously in the measurement of&#xD;
      insulin and glucagon secretion. Our sample size calculations are based on experimental data&#xD;
      from isolated human islets from T2DM donors, which were performed in Professor Patrik&#xD;
      Rorsman's lab. These suggest that 15 participants (allowing for a 15% dropout) would give the&#xD;
      study 80% power to detect a 57% reduction in baseline glucagon levels with an alpha error of&#xD;
      5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the study visits are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRU visit 1 (1 hour):&#xD;
