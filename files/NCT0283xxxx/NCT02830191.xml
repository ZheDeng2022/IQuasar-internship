  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ciclosporin A (CsA) is an immunosuppressive drug used in organs and tissues transplantations&#xD;
      (kidney, heart, liver, bone marrow ...) to prevent rejection, and in different autoimmune or&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases. A therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is required during a CsA&#xD;
      treatment. It is justified by a narrow therapeutic range between efficiency and&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity, and by large intra- and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. TDM of&#xD;
      CsA is conventionally performed by determining residual concentration, and sometimes&#xD;
      concentration at 2 hours after administration. TDM of CsA is currently performed by venous&#xD;
      sampling on ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling could be&#xD;
      a particularly interesting alternative to conventional blood sampling. With DBS, capillary&#xD;
      blood is obtained from a finger prick by the patient himself, and the blood drop obtained is&#xD;
      deposited on filter paper, which can be stored at room temperature and then be sent to the&#xD;
      laboratory by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sampling method has several advantages : it requires small blood volumes, it is less&#xD;
      invasive than conventional venous sampling, sampling can be performed by the patient himself&#xD;
      at home few days before the consultation, and the results of the analysis can be available to&#xD;
      the clinician on the day of consultation, allowing dose adjustment more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have been published in recent years using DBS sampling method, for various&#xD;
      drugs such as antimalarials, antiepileptics, antiretrovirals, metformin, benzodiazepines, or&#xD;
      immunosuppressants. Only one clinical validation study of TDM of CsA using DBS method was&#xD;
      published by Wilhelm et al. (2013) in a population of 38 patients who received allogeneic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant recipients. The results showed excellent correlation between the&#xD;
      concentrations determined by the two sampling methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an observational study at the University Hospital of Caen for&#xD;
      clinical validation of DBS sampling for TDM of CsA in kidney transplantation, for which there&#xD;
      are no data published. During a nephrology consultation, for each patient, venous and finger&#xD;
      prick blood samples are simultaneously collected. CsA assays were performed by liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the two sampling methods. A specific&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS assay method applied for DBS samples was developed and validated for this study&#xD;
      (DBS/LC-MS/MS). Correlation between the results obtained from the two sampling methods will&#xD;
      be evaluated, on at least 100 samples. Patients have to answer a questionnaire to assess pain&#xD;
      and comfort of DBS sampling, and feasibility of self-sampling at home by this method. The aim&#xD;
      of this clinical validation study of DBS sampling is the establishment of the systematic TDM&#xD;
      of CsA for renal transplant patients by DBS sampling at the University Hospital of Caen.&#xD;
