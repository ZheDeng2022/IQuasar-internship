      Dry Needling (DN) is a skilled intervention that uses acupuncture filiform needles that are&#xD;
      inserted into myofascial trigger points or other tissues underneath the skin. It is used to&#xD;
      treat myofascial or neuromusculoskeletal pain and to improve movement impairments. Although&#xD;
      more and more physical therapists add this treatment tool to their skill box, there is&#xD;
      uncertainty about its working mechanism and its efficacy. The latter is partially due to the&#xD;
      challenging task of finding and using a true control or sham treatment. The investigators&#xD;
      will use blunted needles, which will not perforate the skin, as sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess if DN of a trigger point in the gluteal muscles increases pain&#xD;
      pressure threshold in that muscle, in another muscle innervated by the same segment (L4/5)&#xD;
      and in an area not supplied by the same segment (i.e. the ipsilateral posterior shoulder). In&#xD;
      addition, this study will assess if functionality, as measured by the Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Index (ODI) and 15-point Global Rating of Change Scale (GRoC) questionnaires, improves after&#xD;
      2-3 treatments (1 week) of DN.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Dry Needling (DN) is a skilled intervention that uses acupuncture filiform needles&#xD;
      that are inserted into myofascial trigger points or other tissues underneath the skin&#xD;
      [Dunning]. Trigger points are spots in taut muscle fibers that can produce local and&#xD;
      radiating pain when irritated, for example when pressed upon. Several theories on the&#xD;
      etiology of trigger points exist, such as a local energy crisis and increased acetylcholine&#xD;
      release due to mechanical muscle overuse [Bron]. The existence of trigger points is widely&#xD;
      accepted [Hong], although there are also some vocal opponents [Quintner 2015, Quintner 1994].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of DN is to treat myofascial or neuromusculoskeletal pain and improve movement&#xD;
      impairments. The mechanism which with DN purportedly works has been the subject of debate for&#xD;
      many years. It is generally accepted that the needle has to be inserted into a trigger point,&#xD;
      where it will produce a local muscle twitch response and consequently 'inactivate' the&#xD;
      trigger point [Dunning]. Some propose that the quick muscle contraction induces normalization&#xD;
      of tissue pH and reduction of biochemical and neurotransmitters that stimulate pain receptors&#xD;
      - a local response [Shah]. Others suggest that DN interrupts the trigger point's ongoing&#xD;
      nociceptive input into the dorsal horn - a segmental response [Fernandez-de-las-Penas].&#xD;
      Others again submit that, because some trigger points affect limbic and dorsal hippocampus&#xD;
      activity, DN might have a central response [Niddam].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of DN is also not completely clear, but shows a trend. One early literature&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis concluded that DN was not significantly superior to placebo control&#xD;
      in regards to pain decrease [Tough]. However, since then several systematic reviews with&#xD;
      meta-analyses [Tekin, Kietrys, Boyles] determined that the evidence suggested that DN for&#xD;
      trigger point-derived pain was likely to be the most effective approach, was superior in&#xD;
      decreasing pain compared to stretching and percutaneous electric nerve stimulation and at&#xD;
      least as effective as manual trigger point release and other needling treatments. One&#xD;
      literature analysis supports the use of DN not only for its immediate, but also short-term&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing pain in patients with upper quarter myofascial pain syndrome&#xD;
      [Kietrys].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled trials that assess DN efficacy either use 1) sham or control (such as no or an&#xD;
      inactive treatment) or 2) other treatments (such as lidocaine injections, non-local DN, or&#xD;
      &quot;usual care&quot;, such as stretching and exercise) for the comparison group. A blunted needle&#xD;
      that does not penetrate the skin is a good sham treatment [Streitberger] and has been&#xD;
      recommended as adequate control. As discussed elsewhere [Streitberger], every needle&#xD;
      penetration, be it at a trigger point or not, will induce physiological responses and are as&#xD;
      such not appropriate to use as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Srbely et al. found that one intervention of trigger point stimulation with DN evoked&#xD;
      palliative effects in other areas innervated by the same spinal segment. They dry needled&#xD;
      trigger points in the supraspinatus and assessed pressure sensitivity changes in the&#xD;
      infraspinatus (same segment, C5) and gluteus maximus (different segment, L4/5, S1). Their&#xD;
      results suggest that pain pressure threshold was increased after 3 and 5 minutes of DN in the&#xD;
      areas supplied by the C5 segment, but not in the area supplied by L4/5, S1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above named study only assessed immediate pain-related changes due to the intervention&#xD;
      and did not assess functional improvements. The investigators of this study were not able to&#xD;
      find any articles investigating this phenomenon in the lower extremity. This project will use&#xD;
      a similar set up as the above study, but the subjects will receive sham DN, not real DN in a&#xD;
      non-trigger point tissue (which, as explained above, will still elicit physiological effects&#xD;
      and could have some segmental influence) as in the above named study. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will explore if there are functional improvements in subjects receiving DN.&#xD;
      Consequently, the investigators propose to perform the following controlled study that&#xD;
      explores the questions 'Does site specific trigger point dry needling evoke segmental&#xD;
      neuromodulation in the lower extremity and if so, do these changes make an impact on the&#xD;
      subject's disability?'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Regarding Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess if pain pressure threshold (PPT) decreases in the muscle that received DN&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess if PPT decreases in the muscle that received sham DN (not perforating the skin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess if low back pain decreases more in the treatment group compared to sham group&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) Regarding Functionality&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess if the level of disability due to pain will be lower after one week of treatment&#xD;
           in the subjects who received DN&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess if the level of disability due to pain will be significantly lower in subjects&#xD;
           who received DN compared to those who received sham&#xD;
&#xD;
      III) Regarding Mechanism&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess if specific trigger point DN evokes segmental neuromodulation in the lower&#xD;
           extremity; meaning that if a trigger point in a muscle that is innervated by a certain&#xD;
           segment is DN, other trigger points in the same segment will exhibit decreased PPT as&#xD;
           well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess if PPT associated with trigger points in the infraspinatus change after DN the&#xD;
           lower back&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1: PPT decreases in the gluteus maximus/medius after one week of DN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H2: Trigger points that receive DN with sham needles (not perforating the skin) will not&#xD;
           exhibit the same amount of decreased PPT compared to the trigger points that are DN with&#xD;
           actual treatment DN&#xD;
&#xD;
      II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H3: Low back pain will decrease more in the treatment group compared to sham&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H4: The level of disability due to pain will decrease after one week of DN treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H5: The level of disability due to pain will be significantly lower in subjects who&#xD;
           received DN treatment compared to the subjects who received sham treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      III)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H6: Specific trigger point dry needling will evoke segmental neuromodulation in the&#xD;
           lower extremity; meaning that if the investigators DN a trigger point in the gluteus&#xD;
           maximus/medius, that are innervated by L4/L5, other trigger points in the same segment&#xD;
           (i.e. multifidus at segment L4/5) will exhibit decreased PPT as well&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H7: PPT associated with trigger points in the infraspinatus will not change after DN the&#xD;
           lower back Subjects will have been referred to Peaks Performance Physical Therapy (Baton&#xD;
           Rouge, Louisiana) for diagnosis of 'trigger point gluteal muscles', 'myofascial pain',&#xD;
           'neuromuscular pain' or 'low back pain' (or similar) who demonstrate painful taut bands&#xD;
           of tight muscle tissue in the gluteal muscles and infraspinatus and complain of&#xD;
           radiating pain when point pressure is exerted onto that tight muscle tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective subjects will undergo physical examination by the co-author PC to identify&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main inclusion criterion will be the presence of a painful trigger point in the gluteals&#xD;
      (gluteus maximus or medius) and infraspinatus on the same side. The painful trigger point is&#xD;
      defined as a distinct hypersensitive taut band within a muscle that begins to radiate diffuse&#xD;
      pain into adjacent areas with sustained pressure. In keeping with the study conducted by&#xD;
      Srbely et al. the investigators will only include trigger points with a baseline&#xD;
      (pre-intervention) pain pressure threshold (PPT) value of 35 N or less in order to improve&#xD;
      reliability of their detection. The precise location of each trigger point will be marked on&#xD;
      the skin using a non-toxic marker for ease of follow-up identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is deemed eligible for the study, the investigating PT will explain the study&#xD;
      to the prospective subject and he/she will be asked if he/she wants to participate. The PT&#xD;
      will explain that the subject might not get the actual DN technique, but instead a sham. If&#xD;
      the subject declines he/she will receive treatment as 'normal'. If he/she agrees, he/she will&#xD;
      receive the informed consent to read and sign. If there are study-related questions they will&#xD;
      be answered. After this the subject will fill out an intake sheet for demographic&#xD;
      information, the modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (mOSW) [Copay] as well as a pain&#xD;
      map and visual analog scale (VAS) for low back pain. The subject will then determine his/her&#xD;
      group allocation by drawing a piece of paper out of an opaque envelope. This envelope will&#xD;
      contain 40 pieces of paper; 20 of them will specify 'dry needling A' (for treatment), 20 will&#xD;
      specify 'dry needling B' (for sham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rest of the physical therapy treatment will be pragmatic; the subject will receive&#xD;
      mobilizations (no grade 5: high velocity low amplitude), exercises as indicated and DN for&#xD;
      one week (2-3 visits). Grade 5 mobilizations (or manipulations) will be excluded as treatment&#xD;
      option because they are believed to elicit neurophysiological effects, similar to DN, and&#xD;
      might skew the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study flow/ data intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will measure pressure sensitivity via algometer in the gluteal&#xD;
           muscles, the ipsilateral multifidus at level L4/5 and the ipsilateral infraspinatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will dry needle trigger points found in the gluteal region of one side&#xD;
           (e.g. right) and document of muscle twitching (which would signify appropriate needle&#xD;
           insertion) OR sham dry needle (with blunted needle, no actual penetration through the&#xD;
           skin will occur)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exercises will be performed as needed (pragmatic, but no manipulations). This regimen&#xD;
           will be followed for maximally one week, (less, if pain is abolished).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the end of the week PPT will be measured, VAS, the mOSW and the 15-point Global&#xD;
           rating of change scales (GRoC) [Kamper] questionnaires will be given and results will be&#xD;
           documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPT readings will be normalized to baseline scores so the focus is on the percent changes,&#xD;
      not on the absolute changes in values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1: baseline PPT measurements in the gluteus maximus/medius from 20 subjects who receive&#xD;
           DN will be compared to post PPT measurements, taken after one week of DN will be&#xD;
           analyzed using a paired t-test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H2: change in PPT in the gluteus maximus/medius from 20 subjects who received DN will be&#xD;
           compared to the change in PPT from 20 subjects who received sham DN will be analyzed&#xD;
           with a 2-sample t-test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H3: VAS score changes from 20 subjects who received DN will be compared to the VAS score&#xD;
           changes from 20 subjects who received sham DN will be analyzed with a 2-sample t-test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H4: The baseline mOSW scores from 20 subjects who received DN will be compared to the&#xD;
           post treatment scores of the mOSW and will be analyzed with a paired t-test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H5: The changes in mOSW and GRoC scale scores from 20 subjects who received DN will be&#xD;
           compared to the changes in mOSW and GRoC scale scores from 20 subjects who received sham&#xD;
           DN will each be analyzed with a 2-sample t-test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H6: Pre- to post treatment changes in PPT in the gluteus maximus/medius will be compared&#xD;
           to the changes measured in the multifidus at segment L4/5 and analyzed with a paired&#xD;
           t-test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H7: Pre- to post treatment changes in PPT in the gluteus maximus/medius will be compared&#xD;
           to the changes measured in the infraspinatus and analyzed with a paired t-test&#xD;
&#xD;
      All significance levels will be set at 0.05. The minimally clinically important difference&#xD;
      (MCID) for the VAS is 2 points [Childs], for the OSW it is 12.8 points [Copay] and the&#xD;
      'important improvement' for the GRoC is 5 points [Kamper].&#xD;
