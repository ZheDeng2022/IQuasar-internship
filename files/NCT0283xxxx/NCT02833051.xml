  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine the effects of an acute bout of exercise on&#xD;
      children's energy intake over the course of a day. Previous studies in adolescents and adults&#xD;
      have shown exercise to be effective in decreasing short-term energy intake, with some&#xD;
      variability. Individual characteristics such as habitual physical activity and psychological&#xD;
      factors may influence the effect of exercise on energy intake, but these factors have yet to&#xD;
      be examined. The investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of researchers, with&#xD;
      expertise in eating behavior, exercise, psychology, and clinical research in order to examine&#xD;
      these questions. First, the investigators will examine the difference in energy intake at&#xD;
      lunch, snack, and dinner meals in response to 30 minutes of imposed exercise compared to 30&#xD;
      minutes of rest. Second, the investigators will collect objective measures of children's&#xD;
      habitual physical activity, child characteristics (body composition, eating behavior traits),&#xD;
      and individual responses to the controlled exercise bout. The investigators can then examine&#xD;
      both group and individual differences in the energy intake response to exercise. Children&#xD;
      (ages 9-12) will be tested over the course of three visits. The key outcome will be&#xD;
      differences in energy intake in response to exercise vs. rest. Secondary outcomes include the&#xD;
      influence of differences in habitual physical activity, personal characteristics, and&#xD;
      responses to the exercise bout on children's energy intake. The long term goal of this line&#xD;
      of research is to understand the mechanisms behind the interaction between exercise and&#xD;
      energy intake. The translational potential of this research will be to inform personalized&#xD;
      childhood obesity prevention strategies in children at risk for overweight.&#xD;
