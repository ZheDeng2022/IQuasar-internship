  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the feasibility of administering neoadjuvant carboplatin,&#xD;
      paclitaxel, and bevacizumab without excessive dose modification or cycle delay in patients&#xD;
      with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer. This&#xD;
      study will also investigate the rate of optimal cytoreduction, response rate and progression&#xD;
      free and overall survival, and to assess the quality of life for patients with epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial treatment for ovarian cancer is usually surgical cytoreduction followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      platinum and taxane chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis over 75% of patients present with&#xD;
      stage III or IV disease that has spread into the peritoneal cavity or distally. Despite a&#xD;
      number of new chemotherapeutic regimens survival has improved only modestly over the&#xD;
      preceding two decades. While overall 5-year survival has improved from 30% to 50%, 5-year&#xD;
      survival remains only 25% for women with advanced stage disease. Given these findings it is&#xD;
      clear that improved strategies for the delivery of cytotoxic and biologic agents are needed&#xD;
      for women with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newer drug, called bevacizumab, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) for use in combination with chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer, lung cancer,&#xD;
      and some types of breast cancer that have spread to distant sites in the body. A critical&#xD;
      question which will need to be answered is whether or not it is feasible to administer a&#xD;
      combination of bevacizumab with standard cytotoxic therapy using a neo-adjuvant approach for&#xD;
      patients with epithelial cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneum.&#xD;

    <description>This is to assess the feasibility of delivering multiple cycles of the study treatment without excessive dose modification or cycle delays. The regimen would be considered unfeasible for further study if there were 5 or more of the following events within the first 15 patients, 7 or more of these events within the first 30 patients, or 8 or more of these events within the first 45 patients:&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 3, Cycle 6, Cycle 9</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT Quality of Life (QOL) Score questionnaire is designed to assess the effects of cancer and its treatment on the quality of life, by measuring aspects of an individual's sense of well-being and ability to carry out various activities. When calculating the total QOL score, the score scale of functional well-being was reversed in order to keep consistent with other three domains. The lower the total score, the better the quality of life. The five-point scale ranges from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scoring the FACT-G is performed through a simple sum of item scores. Each subscale is scored, and a total score for the FACT-G is obtained by adding each of the subscale scores. With a total possible score greater than 100, additional scoring methods have been used to simplify interpretation. Modifications of scoring include normalizing the total score on a scale of 0-100 through mathematical transformations, as well as the use of a Trial Outcome Index (TOI).</description>

    <description>Three 21 day cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.&#xD;
After 3 cycles of chemotherapy patients will be considered for surgical cytoreduction. Patients must fulfill all criteria to be considered eligible for surgical exploration: 1) ≥50% reduction in pretreatment cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) and 2) No medical contraindications to surgery.&#xD;
After surgical cytoreduction all patients will receive an additional 6 cycles of chemotherapy (cycles 4-9) regardless of disease status at the time of exploration. Chemotherapy should be re-instituted within 6 weeks of the surgical procedure. Bevacizumab will be omitted from cycle 4 of chemotherapy. Patients who do NOT undergo surgical resection should receive cycles 4-9 of therapy. In this instance bevacizumab may be included in cycle 4.</description>

          -  Patients with clinically significant proteinuria. Urine protein should be screened by&#xD;
             urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR). The UPCR has been found to correlate directly&#xD;

             Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to&#xD;
             be a 24 hour urine). Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine&#xD;
             levels (separate requests). The lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL) and&#xD;
             creatinine concentration (mg/dL). The UPCR is derived as follows: protein&#xD;
             concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL). Patients must have a UPCR &lt; 1.0 to allow&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;

        <title>Quality of Life (QOL) Score</title>
        <description>The FACT Quality of Life (QOL) Score questionnaire is designed to assess the effects of cancer and its treatment on the quality of life, by measuring aspects of an individual's sense of well-being and ability to carry out various activities. When calculating the total QOL score, the score scale of functional well-being was reversed in order to keep consistent with other three domains. The lower the total score, the better the quality of life. The five-point scale ranges from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scoring the FACT-G is performed through a simple sum of item scores. Each subscale is scored, and a total score for the FACT-G is obtained by adding each of the subscale scores. With a total possible score greater than 100, additional scoring methods have been used to simplify interpretation. Modifications of scoring include normalizing the total score on a scale of 0-100 through mathematical transformations, as well as the use of a Trial Outcome Index (TOI).</description>
