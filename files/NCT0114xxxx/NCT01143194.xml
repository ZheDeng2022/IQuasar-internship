  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the dietary supplement oréVida™&#xD;
      (active ingredient on the basis of a culinary herb)administered twice daily in an acute study&#xD;
      on an improvement in vigilance, attention, concentration, memory and mood in 45 healthy men&#xD;
      and pre-menopausal women, aged 35-50 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oréVida™ is considered a dietary supplement, and therefore it is not an approved drug by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is regulated like a food. The U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and dietary supplements. We do not claim that&#xD;
      this supplement is meant to treat any ailment.&#xD;
