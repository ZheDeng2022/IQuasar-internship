        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must have completed study E2020-A001-211 according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female patients between 18-65 years of age. Women of childbearing potential&#xD;
             practiced effective contraception (e.g., abstinence, intra-uterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
             barrier method plus hormonal method), had a negative urine -hCG at Week 0, and be&#xD;
             willing to remain on their current form of contraception for the duration of the&#xD;
             study. Pregnant and/or lactating females were to be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients of any race who were in generally good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient was willing to participate, and has provided written informed consent prior to&#xD;
             being exposed to any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of any clinically significant disorder which was being evaluated medically,&#xD;
             and which had not been shown to be stable on medications or other treatment(s) for a&#xD;
             period of at least 3 months, including active or uncontrolled tumors, non-trauma&#xD;
             related cerebrovascular accidents, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine or&#xD;
             pulmonary disease, cardiovascular system disease or known collagen vascular disease&#xD;
             (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus). Hypertension was medication controlled (supine&#xD;
             diastolic BP &lt; 95 mmHg). Cardiac disease (angina pectoris, congestive heart failure or&#xD;
             arrhythmias) was stable on appropriate medication for 6 months. No elective surgical&#xD;
             procedures were allowed during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a recent history (&lt;/= 2 years) of or on active treatment for any&#xD;
             hematologic/oncologic disorders (other than basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a serious central nervous system (CNS) disorder (e.g., neoplasm,&#xD;
             infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological disease such as&#xD;
             Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, or any other progressive&#xD;
             CNS disease) or who either evidence focal neurological signs or symptoms by&#xD;
             examination or history (e.g., papilledema) or who evidence transient neurological&#xD;
             symptoms without an ensuing headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any medical or psychiatric (e.g., severe depression, psychosis, bipolar disorder)&#xD;
             condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, made the patient unsuitable for&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of chronic alcoholism or drug abuse as defined by DSM-IV criteria or patients&#xD;
             who had previously been hospitalized and/or treated for substance abuse within the&#xD;
             past one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of overuse (&gt; 12 days per four week period on average) of acute headache&#xD;
             medications including analgesics, opioids, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
             (NSAIDs), butalbital containing compounds, ergots and triptans within the past one (1)&#xD;
             year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who were taking any prior or concomitant medications, as defined in the&#xD;
             Protocol (Appendix 16.1.1), during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who were unwilling or unable to fulfill the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with known hypersensitivity to piperidine derivatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who had taken a cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., donepezil, tacrine,&#xD;
             rivastigmine, galantamine, metrifonate) for the acute or prophylactic treatment of&#xD;
             migraines in the past (excluding E2020-A001-211) or who were currently taking a&#xD;
             cholinesterase inhibitor for any other indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients who had taken any unapproved prior or concomitant medications. In particular,&#xD;
             patients were not allowed to take beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, calcium&#xD;
             channel blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, valproate, methysergide,&#xD;
             cyproheptadine or any other ongoing prophylactic treatment for migraines while&#xD;
             participating in this study.&#xD;
