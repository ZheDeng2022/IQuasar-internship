  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone is the most common site of distant breast cancer recurrence, and 65-75% of women with&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer will develop bone metastases during the course of their disease. The&#xD;
      most pressing problem in management of bony metastases today, is the inability to reliably&#xD;
      identify patients at high risk for skeletal related events (SREs) (such as bone fractures,&#xD;
      surgery/radiotherapy for pain or prevention of fractures, high calcium levels, and spinal&#xD;
      cord compression) despite the standard use of bone medication (bisphosphonates). Using the&#xD;
      latest innovations both in imaging and blood tests, this novel pilot project will develop a&#xD;
      risk model for predicting bone metastases, which will be able to identify patients who would&#xD;
      most benefit from novel treatments, such as the multikinase inhibitor Zactima and the Src&#xD;
      inhibitor, AZD0530. Given that approximately 1/3 of patients with metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      and bony disease will sustain an SRE despite use of a bisphosphonate, there is an urgent&#xD;
      unmet need in this large population to introduce effective bone protective agents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bone is the most common site of distant breast cancer recurrence, and 65-75% of women with&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer will develop bone metastases during the course of their disease. Bone&#xD;
      metastases can significantly adversely impact on quality of life by causing pain and skeletal&#xD;
      related events (SREs) such as pathological fractures, surgery/radiotherapy for&#xD;
      pain/prevention of fractures, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression. These complications&#xD;
      of bone metastases may necessitate multiple medical, surgical, and radiation interventions.&#xD;
      Indeed, prior to the widespread use of bisphosphonates, over two thirds (2/3) of women with&#xD;
      bone metastases developed at least one SRE. Despite prolonged bisphosphonate use, many&#xD;
      patients will continue to have progression of their bone metastases and develop SREs. The&#xD;
      most pressing problem in management of bony metastases today, is the inability to reliably&#xD;
      identify patients at high risk for SREs despite standard bisphosphonate use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prospective, observational trial design, we will develop a prognostic model with&#xD;
      baseline serum C-telopeptide (sCTx) as the predictor variable and SREs as the outcome&#xD;
      variable. 60 breast cancer patients with metastases to any site will be approached for&#xD;
      participation in this prospective single centered study. Baseline characteristics (and&#xD;
      potential risk factors) will be recorded upon study enrollment, including clinical factors&#xD;
      (prior fragility fracture, use of corticosteroids, age), bone mineral density, performance&#xD;
      status, measures of quality of life and pain. Novel markers such as sCTx and bone specific&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase (bALP) will also be assessed. The WHO fracture risk assessment tool&#xD;
      (http://www.shef.ac.uk) will be used to estimate baseline fracture risk according to&#xD;
      osteoporosis guidelines and a calcium intake diet history will be taken. In addition,&#xD;
      assessment of vertebral fractures will take place using two novel techniques, bone&#xD;
      densitometric vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) and high resolution quantitative CT&#xD;
      (HR-pQCT). Bone mineral density along with VFA will be performed at baseline and at one year&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed every twelve weeks for twenty-four months with regards to: symptoms&#xD;
      related to SREs, ECOG status, pain (using the BPI, a 7-point scale of analgesic use), and&#xD;
      quality of life (using the FACT-BP, and FACT-BTSQ). In addition to being measured at&#xD;
      baseline, sCTx and bALP will be measured every twelve weeks for twenty-four months. Calcium&#xD;
      and 25-hydroxy vitamin D will be measured annually as part of regular clinical practice, and&#xD;
      a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen as well as a bone scan will be preformed at least once&#xD;
      yearly as part of regular clinical practice for patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the latest innovations both in imaging and medical biomarkers, this novel pilot project&#xD;
      will develop a prospective risk model for predicting bone metastases, which will be able to&#xD;
      identify patients who would most benefit from novel treatments, such as the multikinase&#xD;
      inhibitor Zactima and the Src inhibitor, AZD0530.&#xD;
