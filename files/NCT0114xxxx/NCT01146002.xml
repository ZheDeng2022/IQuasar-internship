      LANGUAGE-BASED LEARNING SKILLS AND ADHD: IMPACT OF TREATMENT WITH SUSTAINED-RELEASE&#xD;
      GUANFACINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often do poorly in school&#xD;
      (1,2,3). Their slow academic progress is typically attributable to inattention, restlessness,&#xD;
      disorganization and distractibility, all of which diminish their ability to learn.&#xD;
      Additionally, these manifestations of ADHD may worsen an underlying specific learning&#xD;
      disability (SLD), which is a common comorbidity of ADHD (1,4,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for ADHD is often initiated with the goal of enhancing learning and fostering&#xD;
      academic success. Yet changes in academic achievement resulting from the pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment of ADHD have been less evaluated in clinical research than changes in specifically&#xD;
      defined behaviors. Such behaviors typically include lack of attention to task, fidgeting,&#xD;
      calling out, disorganization and hyperactivity. These behaviors, rather than overall academic&#xD;
      improvement, are also what are measured with typical ADHD rating scales (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relatively small number of clinical studies have assessed the impact of medications for the&#xD;
      treatment of ADHD on academic progress during childhood or adolescence. Some of these studies&#xD;
      (3,7) have focused on long-term measures, such as lack of grade retention and ultimate&#xD;
      graduation from high school. Other research has tried to directly measure the effect of&#xD;
      medication for ADHD on the ability to perform particular academic tasks. Typically, the&#xD;
      ability to efficiently and correctly solve a series of arithmetical problems - first, with no&#xD;
      treatment, and then while taking stimulant medication, has been measured (8,9). These studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that both methylphenidate-based and amphetamine-based stimulant drugs&#xD;
      enable greater speed, efficiency and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying arithmetical speed and accuracy to determine a medication's helpfulness in the&#xD;
      school setting may be insufficient, however, since mathematics is not relevant to most of the&#xD;
      academic material and skills that children are required to learn. To the investigator's&#xD;
      knowledge no prior studies have evaluated the impact of medications for ADHD on&#xD;
      language-based tasks such as reading or reading comprehension. Yet competency in reading,&#xD;
      reading comprehension, auditory comprehension and writing is arguably more important than&#xD;
      competency in arithmetic during grammar school, and becomes even more essential during middle&#xD;
      school and high school. Moreover, even in apparently &quot;arithmetical&quot; subjects such as&#xD;
      mathematics and science, word problems are often utilized, so that arithmetical ability alone&#xD;
      is insufficient. Finally, it should also be noted that the most common forms of SLD are&#xD;
      language-based disabilities that manifest as a weakness in reading, comprehension, or writing&#xD;
      skill, but not arithmetical skill (10). For all these reasons, we should not assume that&#xD;
      testing arithmetical performance is adequate to demonstrate the effectiveness of medication&#xD;
      for ADHD, whether or not a coexisting SLD is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-arm study in which the language-based academic skills of children&#xD;
      diagnosed with ADHD will be assessed prior to, and then during treatment with&#xD;
      sustained-release guanfacine (GXR). Children will be diagnosed with ADHD using standard&#xD;
      rating instruments (see below). Children meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      undergo testing of language-based academic skills with the Woodcock-Johnson III test prior&#xD;
      initiating treatment with GXR. The daily dose of GXR will then be initiated at 1 mg and&#xD;
      titrated by 1 mg in weekly intervals, based on significant improvement in ADHD rating scales,&#xD;
      the to a maximum dose of 4 mg. Once significant improvement in ADHD manifestations is&#xD;
      recorded using rating scales, upward titration will stop and the dose will be maintained.&#xD;
      After five weeks repeat testing using the WJIII will be done. Results of pre- and&#xD;
      post-medication testing will be compared for the group using appropriate statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will attempt to recruit 20 or more children with ADHD in the setting of a well-established&#xD;
      suburban pediatric neurology office practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistically significant (p&lt;0.05 level) improvement in Woodcock-Johnson test scores during&#xD;
      treatment with GXR compared to pre-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between the ages of 6 to 12 years with newly diagnosed ADHD-inattentive type or&#xD;
      ADHD-combined type will be identified. The diagnosis of ADHD will be established using the&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental and Related Disorder, version IV, Text Revision&#xD;
      (DSM-IV TR, 2000) criteria and the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS; DuPaul et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with any of the following are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intelligence (IQ) below 85 as determined by formal testing (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identified or suspected genetic syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autism or other pervasive developmental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric disorders other than ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart, liver or renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epilepsy or non-febrile seizure history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac arrhythmia, bradycardia, or syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other condition considered to be potentially exacerbated or endangered by treatment&#xD;
           with an alpha-2 agonist drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prior treatment with medication for ADHD will not be an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and initiation of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between the ages of 6 to 12 years with newly diagnosed ADHD-inattentive type or&#xD;
      -combined type will be identified. The diagnosis of ADHD will be made by means of the DSM-IV&#xD;
      -TR criteria and the ADHD-RS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate informed consent to participate in the study will be obtained from the child's&#xD;
      parent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for medical conditions excluding them from the study. Vital signs&#xD;
      will be checked; patients with values below the 2nd and above the 98th percentile will be&#xD;
      also excluded. A comprehensive physical examination will be performed. Intelligence testing&#xD;
      using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th ed. (WISC; Wechsler, 2003) will be&#xD;
      performed. Children with a full-scale IQ below 85 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will then be a one-week period which will serve as a washout for any currently taken&#xD;
      medication for ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with medication and testing of learning parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children qualifying for the study will be administered selected portions of the&#xD;
      Woodcock-Johnson Test III (WJ-III; Woodcock et al., 2006). We will utilize sections of this&#xD;
      test evaluating phonetics, reading fluency, reading comprehension and listening&#xD;
      comprehension. Writing ability will not be assessed because of the confounding influence of&#xD;
      fine motor development on writing speed. Mathematical ability will also not be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test includes an &quot;A&quot; and a &quot;B&quot; form. Only the A form will be used initially so as to&#xD;
      minimize practice effect when the test is later repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with GXR will be initiated immediately after testing, and titrated over a 5-week&#xD;
      period. The initial dosage will be 1 mg daily and will be titrated in weekly intervals to a&#xD;
      maximum dose of 4 mg. Clinical improvement measures at follow-up visits will include the&#xD;
      ADHD-RS and the Clinical Global Impression- Improvement Scale (Guy, 1976). Once a change in&#xD;
      the CGI-I score of &lt; 2 or a decrease in the ADHD-RS score of 30% or greater is noted, we will&#xD;
      not further increase the daily dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return for 5 weekly visits. Vital signs, cardiac auscultation, and a routine&#xD;
      follow-up physical examination will be performed at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients experiencing adverse effects that are judged by the investigator to be clinically&#xD;
      significant, as well as non-serious but bothersome adverse effects that do not respond to&#xD;
      dose adjustment will be taken off SRG. Events judged to be serious will be reported to the&#xD;
      IRB, FDA, and Shire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 5 visits, subjects assessed as having had a significant improvement in the ADHD-RS or&#xD;
      CGI-I will take the WJ-III &quot;B&quot; form (see above) beginning 2 hours after taking their current&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects' scores on the WJ-III, obtained initially and then during treatment with GXR,&#xD;
      will be compared using a one-tailed t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have benefited from the study drug will be given the option of continuing the&#xD;
      medication, prescribed by the same physician, supplied commercially. If they elect not to&#xD;
      continue, the study drug will be tapered off by 1 mg (daily dosage) per week.&#xD;
