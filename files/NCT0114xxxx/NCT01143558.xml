      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lyme disease is an infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacteria that is transmitted&#xD;
      to humans by ticks. It can cause many different symptoms including rash, fever, headache,&#xD;
      meningitis (infection of the central nervous system), and arthritis. While most patients&#xD;
      improve after taking antibiotics, some patients continue to have symptoms. It is currently&#xD;
      unknown why some patients continue to have symptoms. One possibility is that the antibiotics&#xD;
      have not successfully gotten rid of all of the bacteria. Current tests for Lyme disease&#xD;
      cannot tell whether the bacteria have been successfully eliminated from the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xenodiagnosis is a way to look for Borrelia bacteria using the animal that usually hosts&#xD;
      them, Ixodes scapularis (also known as the deer tick). This method takes advantage of the&#xD;
      evolution of the bacteria and the insect that transmits the infection, which can make the&#xD;
      insect particularly good at finding the agent. In studies of animals, xenodiagnosis may be&#xD;
      more sensitive than current tests for detecting the presence of the Lyme disease bacteria.&#xD;
      Researchers are interested in using xenodiagnosis to determine whether uninfected ticks that&#xD;
      feed on humans who have been infected with Lyme disease bacteria can detect the continued&#xD;
      presence of live bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine whether xenodiagnosis can be used to successfully investigate the presence of&#xD;
      Lyme disease bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals at least 18 years of age who are in one of the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Have had the erythema migrans rash (a symptom of Lyme infection) and received antibiotic&#xD;
           therapy less than 4 months ago (but have not had antibiotics in the previous month).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Have the erythema migrans rash and received less than 2 days of antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Have been diagnosed with early or late Lyme disease, have received antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
           but still have high levels of antibodies against the bacteria at least 6 months after&#xD;
           therapy, and have not received antibiotics in the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Have been diagnosed with early or late Lyme disease, have received antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
           and have new complaints of fatigue or other symptoms that are persistent for at least 6&#xD;
           months after completion of antibiotic therapy, and have not received antibiotics in the&#xD;
           past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Have been diagnosed with Lyme arthritis and have not yet received antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Healthy volunteers who have not had Lyme disease will also be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an initial visit for a physical examination, medical history, and&#xD;
           blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the first study visit, researchers will place a strip of filter paper or a small&#xD;
           plastic container with 20 to 30 disease-free ticks on the participant s skin. If&#xD;
           possible, the ticks will be placed at the site of a Lyme disease rash or another&#xD;
           suspicious area, or on the nondominant forearm. Participants will be asked to keep the&#xD;
           ticks in place, and will keep a diary card at home to record any symptoms or problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ticks will be collected 4 to 6 days after placement. At that visit, participants&#xD;
           will have a skin biopsy taken of the area tested, a blood sample will be collected, and&#xD;
           participants will receive a new diary card to keep until the next clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 1 month, participants will provide a final blood sample, and will receive a&#xD;
           follow-up phone call 2 months afterward.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lyme disease is the most common vector borne disease in the United States. Although&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy is clinically effective in treating the symptoms of Lyme disease for most&#xD;
      patients early in the course of disease, a significant number of patients who receive therapy&#xD;
      report persistent symptoms. The cause of persistent symptoms after antibiotic therapy for&#xD;
      Lyme disease is an area of great controversy. Recent studies have shown that the organism&#xD;
      (Borrelia burgdorferi) may persist in animals after antibiotic therapy and can be detected by&#xD;
      using the natural tick vector (Ixodes scapularis) to acquire the organism through feeding&#xD;
      (xenodiagnosis). Whether this occurs in humans is unknown. Currently available tests for&#xD;
      human Lyme disease do not allow determination of persistent infection after antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, the utility of xenodiagnosis for identifying persistence of B. burgdorferi&#xD;
      in treated human Lyme disease will be tested in up to 120 subjects with various stages of&#xD;
      Lyme disease with 30 healthy adults to serve as controls. Subjects will be followed for&#xD;
      approximately 3 months. In Objective #1, subjects who have the characteristic erythema&#xD;
      migrans (EM) rash and have been treated with antibiotics early (within 3 weeks of infection)&#xD;
      in the course of Lyme disease will be tested. After completion of antibiotic therapy, 25-30&#xD;
      larval Ixodes ticks will be allowed to feed on the subject and biopsies of the EM site will&#xD;
      be performed. Repleted ticks will be collected and tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi.&#xD;
      In Objective #2, similar studies will be performed, but enrollment will target subjects with&#xD;
      elevated C6 (region 6 of the VlsE surface protein of B. burgdorferi) antibody levels. In&#xD;
      Objective #3, patients with persistent symptoms after antibiotic therapy will be evaluated.&#xD;
      As an attempt to increase the chances of a positive xenodiagnosis in humans, patients with EM&#xD;
      who are in the first 2 days of antibiotic therapy and patients with untreated Lyme arthritis&#xD;
      will also be evaluated. Evidence that B. burgdorferi can be recovered by xenodiagnosis after&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy in subjects with continued symptoms would change the current paradigm for&#xD;
      potential mechanisms of disease and provide researchers and clinicians a tool for identifying&#xD;
      patients with persistent infection. In Objective #4 we will assess the safety of the planned&#xD;
      xenodiagnostic procedure in humans. All individuals who underwent xenodiagnosis under the&#xD;
      study will be assessed for adverse events.&#xD;
