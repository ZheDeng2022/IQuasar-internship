      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      temozolomide, also work in different ways to kill tumor cells or stop them from growing.&#xD;
      Giving bevacizumab together with temozolomide may be a better way to block tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab and temozolomide&#xD;
      together works in treating older patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme or&#xD;
      gliosarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate overall survival in elderly subjects treated with bevacizumab and temozolomide&#xD;
      for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate 12-months survival. II. To estimate progression free survival for 2 years or&#xD;
      until progression is detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab/temozolomide in elderly&#xD;
      patient with glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To isolate DNA, RNA, and protein isolated from frozen and paraffinized archival tumor&#xD;
      samples for evaluations such as immunohistochemical pathway profiling of VEGF-dependent&#xD;
      angiogenic pathways, gene expression microarray, and MGMT promoter methylation status to&#xD;
      define important molecule features of treatment response and especially age-related molecular&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks and oral temozolomide on&#xD;
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 24 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 4 months.&#xD;
