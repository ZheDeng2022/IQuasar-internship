      Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is considered as the gold standard method for&#xD;
      detection of left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus but is a semi-invasive investigation. The&#xD;
      primary aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of the 64 slices CT using prospective&#xD;
      gating for the diagnosis LAA thrombus. The secondary objective is to defined the optimal&#xD;
      acquisition time offering the best diagnostic performance (early, late or both).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus is a major cause of cardiogenic embolism. It is&#xD;
      responsible of high morbidity and mortality and translates into significant modifications of&#xD;
      patient management. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is considered as the gold&#xD;
      standard method for detection of LAA thrombus but is a semi-invasive investigation. TEE is&#xD;
      indeed performed using intravenous benzodiazepines sedation in order to optimize patient&#xD;
      tolerance and quality for the operator or even under general anesthesia. To date there is no&#xD;
      other validated method for the assessment of LAA thrombus. Multidetector computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) is currently widely used the assessment of cardiac function and geometry as well as&#xD;
      coronary artery anatomy. Technologic improvement with the 64 slices CT, offering a high&#xD;
      temporal and spatial resolution, and the new prospective gating, reducing drastically the&#xD;
      irradiation dose, make it particularly attractive for the assessment of LAA thrombus but it&#xD;
      has never been evaluated is this indication. Furthermore, the addition to the current&#xD;
      arterial or &quot;early&quot; acquisition time, a second &quot;late&quot; acquisition (2 minutes later) may&#xD;
      reduce false positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of the 64 slices&#xD;
      CT using prospective gating for the diagnosis LAA thrombus. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      defined the optimal acquisition time offering the best diagnostic performance (early, late or&#xD;
      both).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study. The present study is a preliminary MONOCENTER study in which TEE is the&#xD;
      reference method and the 64 slices CT with iodine injection and prospective gating the method&#xD;
      to assess. All patients hospitalized at BICHAT hospital and referred for a TEE clinically&#xD;
      motivated by search of a LAA thrombus are potential candidates for the present study. To&#xD;
      insure the feasibility of the study with a rigorous methodology TEE will be performed in all&#xD;
      patients but the prevalence of LAA thrombus will be deliberately increased and patients with&#xD;
      negative TEE (no thrombus) to whom the CT will be performed will be randomized. Both TEE and&#xD;
      CT will be performed within 18 hours. All CT analysis will be centralized and performed&#xD;
      blinded of any clinical of echocardiographic information at the end of the inclusion period&#xD;
      of the study. We planned to enroll 135 patients under a two years period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical implications. Validation of the 64 slices computed tomography with prospective&#xD;
      gating may reduce TEE indications and improve patients' comfort.&#xD;
