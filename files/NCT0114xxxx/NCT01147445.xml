  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if a new candidate vaccine (dmLT) against ETEC (E. coli&#xD;
      infection) is safe. This vaccine will be tested to see what effects it has on the body and&#xD;
      the ability of the vaccine to help the body resist disease. Researchers want to find the&#xD;
      highest dose of dmLT vaccine that can be given without causing severe side effects. Most E.&#xD;
      coli bacteria are harmless to humans and can even be beneficial. However, some are harmful,&#xD;
      and can cause diarrhea. About 32 healthy adults, ages 18-45, will participate in this study.&#xD;
      This study will require volunteers to stay in the research facility for several nights.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to receive 1 of 4 vaccine doses by mouth. Study procedures&#xD;
      include: stool samples, blood samples, and documenting side effects. Participants will be&#xD;
      involved in study related procedures for about 8 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the public health burden of enterotoxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli (ETEC) on&#xD;
      travelers, deployed soldiers and, most significantly, young children in the developing world,&#xD;
      there is no licensed vaccine against ETEC enteritis. The rationale for using an E. coli heat&#xD;
      labile enterotoxin (LT) (R192G/L211A) vaccine, also called double-mutant LT (dmLT), is that&#xD;
      it is expected to be especially well tolerated by subjects. If dmLT is safe and immunogenic,&#xD;
      it may become an anti-toxin vaccine or a component of other ETEC vaccine candidates, as well&#xD;
      as an adjuvant for mucosal immunization. This is a phase I dose escalation study, in which 4&#xD;
      cohorts of 6 subjects each will be enrolled and receive 5 micrograms (mcg), 25 mcg, 50 mcg,&#xD;
      or 100 mcg of dmLT vaccine, plus a fifth cohort of 12 subjects which will be randomized and&#xD;
      double-blinded to receive either 50 mcg or 100 mcg of dmLT vaccine. A Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee (SMC) will be convened for this study, and will review available safety data&#xD;
      through the Day 8 visit for each cohort prior to making a recommendation to the Sponsor on&#xD;
      whether or not to proceed to the next cohort. If a dose is not well tolerated as determined&#xD;
      by the SMC review of the safety data, a Confirmation Cohort of 8 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      and administered the previous dose. The first two cohorts will be enrolled simultaneously,&#xD;
      dosed with investigational product, and observed to ensure the tolerability through Day 8 of&#xD;
      the 5 mcg and 25 mcg dose levels. The first two cohorts will be dosed simultaneously based on&#xD;
      the excellent safety record of these doses for the single mutant LT (LTR192G). Thereafter,&#xD;
      dose escalation and subject enrollment will proceed in a step-wise fashion. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed by solicited symptoms/subject memory aid and laboratory evaluations. Adverse events&#xD;
      (AE)s will be graded according to standardized criteria. The immunogenicity outcome measures&#xD;
      of interest are the rate and titer of seroconversion with serum and fecal immunoglobulin A&#xD;
      (IgA) anti-LT antibodies measured by ELISA and stimulation of anti-LT antibody secreting&#xD;
      cells (ASC). The sample size was chosen based on the exploratory nature of this test article&#xD;
      study that has not previously been given to humans. Participants will include 36 healthy&#xD;
      adult male and female subjects, ages 18 to 45 inclusive. The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to assess the safety of dmLT vaccine when administered as a single oral dose over a range&#xD;
      of dose levels in healthy adult subjects. The primary objective of Cohort 5 will be to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the 50 µg and 100 µg doses of an orally&#xD;
      administered dmLT vaccine in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objectives are to assess&#xD;
      long-term safety follow-up from immunization through Month 6 post vaccination and to evaluate&#xD;
      the immunogenicity of a single oral dose of dmLT vaccine over a range of doses in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects.&#xD;
