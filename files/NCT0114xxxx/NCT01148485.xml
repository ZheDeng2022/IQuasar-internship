  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are only very few data about the prevalence of CA-MRSA in France and no in athletes. In&#xD;
      USA, the clone USA300 is widely disseminated and in Europe the clone ST80 predominates. The&#xD;
      aim of the study was to study the carriage of S. aureus in athletes in a French county&#xD;
      (Limousin) and to evaluate the proportion of CA-MRSA. The athletes will be met during their&#xD;
      training, each one will fill-in a clinical information questionnaire. Nasal, throat, inguinal&#xD;
      and skin lesions swab samples will be performed. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the&#xD;
      Staphyloccocus aureus strains isolated will be performed as well as the detection of the PVL&#xD;
      gene. Strains will also be typed by different molecular methods (PGFE (Pulsed Gel Field&#xD;
      Electrophoresis), SCCmec type (Staphylococcal Chromosome Cassette mec), and MLST (MultiLocus&#xD;
      Sequence Typing)). The CIC (Clinical Investigation Center) of the Limoges University Hospital&#xD;
      will be in charge of the inclusions of the athletes. The sample analysis will be centralized&#xD;
      and performed at the Laboratory of Bacteriology of the Limoges University Hospital. A&#xD;
      Clinical Research Officer of the Limoges University Hospital will be in charge of the survey&#xD;
      of the study and will organize monthly meetings with all the participants of the study.&#xD;
