  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate the therapeutic activity, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      axitinib in patients with advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma who are unsuitable for or&#xD;
      have relapsed after standard chemotherapy. The therapeutic activity will be separately&#xD;
      assessed in angiosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcomas and other sarcomas.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies that account for 0.72% of&#xD;
      new malignancies and 0.65% of malignant deaths. Advanced sarcomas carry a poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Angiogenesis is a hallmark of tumour growth, and there is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      antiangiogenic drugs, including axitinib, can lead to tumour regression and improve patient&#xD;
      survival in a variety of tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with angiosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and other sarcomas will be&#xD;
      separately evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will take axitinib 5mg tablets by mouth twice daily. This will be continued for 2&#xD;
      years or until disease progression, or development of limiting toxicity. In the event of&#xD;
      severe toxicity, axitinib will be stopped until the toxicity has improved. Treatment may be&#xD;
      interrupted for a maximum of 2 weeks. Following this, axitinib can be restarted at a lower&#xD;
      dose of 3 mg twice daily. If the toxicity has not improved sufficiently, axitinib will be&#xD;
      permanently stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored once weekly for the first month, then at 4 week intervals.&#xD;
      Toxicity will be closely monitored. At each clinic visit, patients will have a physical&#xD;
      examination and a routine blood test. A Chest x-ray, CT and/or MRI scans will be done before&#xD;
      study entry, then every 12 weeks and at the end of treatment. Disease evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out 12 weeks after study entry, then every 12 weeks until disease progression. After&#xD;
      disease progression, patients will be followed up every 3 months for survival. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed up until death or a minimum follow up period of 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled from hospitals all over the UK.&#xD;
