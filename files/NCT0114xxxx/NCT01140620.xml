    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the effects of ketamine, which blocks the ion-channel gated by the NMDA&#xD;
      receptor, on performance of cognitive tasks and the extent to which these effects can be&#xD;
      reversed by the dopamine receptor antagonist, risperidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish whether patients with schizophrenia are able to reliably complete the&#xD;
           biomarker test battery and to assess whether their responses are similar to healthy&#xD;
           volunteers treated with ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a multi-site recruitment and assessment capacity based on shared Standard&#xD;
           Operating Procedures across three study centres.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a continuation from a previous study (P1V-SCH-CT01-07). The overall aim of the&#xD;
      2 studies is to identify and validate potential biomarker tasks that may be used to provide&#xD;
      early indications into the use of new treatments for schizophrenia. The studies are&#xD;
      considering two potential models for schizophrenia in healthy volunteers, the first model&#xD;
      looks at high versus average schizotypy, schizotypy being a personality trait. The second&#xD;
      model, explored in this study, is a ketamine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be identified through advertising and will initially be asked to&#xD;
      complete an online questionnaire.Suitability for the next stage of the study will be based on&#xD;
      the responses to the online questionnaire. Telephone interviews will then be conducted to&#xD;
      assess suitability for screening.Screening visits will then be carried out in which a full&#xD;
      medical and lab screening is undertaken. participants will also complete a number of&#xD;
      psychiatric questionnaires and interviews. If participants remain suitable they will be&#xD;
      invited to an assessment day in which they will be randomised to one of four study medication&#xD;
      arms. Participants will then complete the biomarker tasks followed by questionnaires, rating&#xD;
      scales and interviews. Patients with schizophrenia will form the 5th study arm and will not&#xD;
      receive medication. They will complete the biomarkers in the same way as healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.87 participants are planned, 72 healthy volunteers, 15 patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not test any investigational medicinal product (IMP) so any ethical issues&#xD;
      that are associated with introducing a participant to a study drug are not applicable in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is already a widely used anaesthetic agent but when given at sub-anaesthetic doses&#xD;
      is a useful tool for modelling schizophrenia psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to assess the sensitivity of a battery of biomarker tasks (biomarkers&#xD;
      are measures of processes that go wrong in illnesses and that contribute to symptoms) to the&#xD;
      cognitive deficits induced by ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may in future be possible to evaluate the effects of novel treatment for schizophrenia in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers using this model, which would then potentially provide a rapid indication&#xD;
      of the potential efficacy of candidate compounds at an early phase of drug development .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide information about the sensitivity of the biomarker tasks in detecting&#xD;
      the effects of the pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
