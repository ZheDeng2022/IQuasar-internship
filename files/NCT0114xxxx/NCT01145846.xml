    <textblock>
      The purpose of this non-inferiority study is to compare the effectiveness of two induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens (cytarabine plus idarubicin [AI] versus cytarabine plus high-dose&#xD;
      daunorubicin [AD]) in AML. The effectiveness will be evaluated in terms of complete remission&#xD;
      (CR) rate.&#xD;

      1. INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For patients randomized to receive Idarubicin (Arm I, AI regimen) will be given&#xD;
                Cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day by continuous iv infusion over 24 hours daily for 7 days&#xD;
                (D 1-7) along with Idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day iv daily for 3 days (D 1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For patients randomized to receive Daunorubicin (Arm II, AD regimen) will be given&#xD;
                Cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day by continuous iv infusion over 24 hours daily for 7 days&#xD;
                (D 1-7) along with Daunorubicin 90 mg/m2/day iv daily for 3 days (D 1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. INTERIM BONE MARROW EXAMINATION&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be done between 14 to 21 days after start of&#xD;
                induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the bone marrow is hypoplastic and contains no more than 5% blast cells, further&#xD;
                chemotherapy will be deferred and the marrow examination will be repeated at the&#xD;
                time of neutrophils over 1,000/mcL and platelets over 100,000/mcL in the peripheral&#xD;
                blood for the evaluation of complete remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If more than 5% blast cells persist at interim or later repeated bone marrow&#xD;
                examination, a course of re-induction chemotherapy will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RE-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Reinduction chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I (AI regimen) : Cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day by continuous iv infusion over 24&#xD;
                hours daily for 5 days (D 1-5) plus idarubicin 8 mg/m2/day iv daily for 2 days (D&#xD;
                1-2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II (AD regimen) : Cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day by continuous iv infusion over 24&#xD;
                hours daily for 5 days (D 1-5) plus Daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/day iv daily for 2 days&#xD;
                (D 1-2) .Reinduction chemotherapy should be delayed if there is a significant&#xD;
                infection or other co-morbid medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who do not have a complete remission after a second course of induction&#xD;
                chemotherapy will be removed from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. POSTREMISSION CHEMOTHERAPY .The same postremission therapy will be given to the patients&#xD;
           in both arms. .For patients with good- or intermediate-risk cytogenetic features or&#xD;
           unknown cytogenetics (see appendix II), 4 courses of high-dose cytarabine will be given&#xD;
           as post-remission therapy. Cytarabine 3 g/m2 will be administered in a 3-hour iv&#xD;
           infusion every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 (a total of six doses per course).&#xD;
&#xD;
           .For patients with high-risk cytogenetic features (see appendix II), 4 courses of&#xD;
           intermediate-dose Cytarabine plus Etoposide will be given as post-remission therapy.&#xD;
           Cytarabine 1 g/m2 will be given in a 1-hour iv infusion on days 1 to 6 (a total of six&#xD;
           doses per course) and Etoposide 150 mg/m2/day will be administered in a 5-hour iv&#xD;
           infusion on days 1 to 3 (a total of three doses per course).&#xD;
&#xD;
           .Sequential courses of postremission therapy will be given no sooner than every 28 days&#xD;
           or 1 week after adequate marrow recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           .Postremission chemotherapy should be delayed if there is a significant infection or&#xD;
           other co-morbid medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           .One or two doses of Cytarabine can be omitted according to the attending physician's&#xD;
           decision for the followings: .Marrow recovery requires more than 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A confluent maculopapular eruption or drug-induced desquamation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Photophobia or conjunctivitis unrelieved within 24 hours by ophthalmic steroid&#xD;
                drops&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  More than 4 episodes of watery diarrhea per day&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A fourfold increase in a previously normal serum aminotransferase or alkaline&#xD;
                phosphatase level or a total bilirubin level exceeding 3.0 mg/dL .Treatment with&#xD;
                high-dose cytarabine will be discontinued in patients with severe cerebellar&#xD;
                ataxia, confusion, or other central nervous system signs thought to be unrelated to&#xD;
                antiemetic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT .During induction and consolidation chemotherapy: CBC with&#xD;
           differentials (daily), chemical battery with electrolyte (twice a week), coagulation&#xD;
           battery (once a week), chest x-ray (once a week).&#xD;
&#xD;
           .Bone marrow examination will be repeated on day 15 of induction chemotherapy (for the&#xD;
           evaluation of hypocellular marrow) and at the time of ANC ≥ 1,000/μl and platelets ≥&#xD;
           100,000/μl in the peripheral blood (for the evaluation of complete remission).&#xD;
           Chromosomal analysis will be repeated at the time of the evaluation of complete&#xD;
           remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. POST-TREATMENT FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
           .After the completion of postremission treatment (i.e. following consolidation&#xD;
           chemotherapy or HCT): CBC with differentials (monthly for the first 12 months, then&#xD;
           every 2-3 months for the next 4 years), other studies such as MRD monitoring (as&#xD;
           indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. TREATMENT EVALUATION *FFICACY EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow blasts &lt; 5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods;&#xD;
                absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mcL; platelet&#xD;
                count &gt; 100,000/mcL; independence of red cell transfusion (Döhner H et al, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All criteria need to be fulfilled; marrow evaluation should be based on a count of&#xD;
                200 nucleated cells in an aspirate with spicules; if ambiguous, consider repeat&#xD;
                exam after 5 to 7 days; flow cytometric evaluation may help to distinguish between&#xD;
                persistent leukemia and regenerating normal marrow; a marrow biopsy should be&#xD;
                performed in cases of dry tap, or if no spicules are obtained; no minimum duration&#xD;
                of response required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CR with incomplete recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia&#xD;
                (&lt; 1,000/mcL) or thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100,000/mcL).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cause of treatment failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Resistant disease (RD): Failure to achieve CR or CRi; only includes patients&#xD;
                surviving ≥ 7 days following completion of initial treatment, with evidence of&#xD;
                persistent leukemia by blood and/or bone marrow examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Death in aplasia: Deaths occurring ≥ 7 days following completion of initial&#xD;
                treatment while cytopenic; with an aplastic or hypoplastic bone marrow obtained&#xD;
                within 7 days of death, without evidence of persistent leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Death from indeterminate cause: Deaths occurring before completion of therapy, or &lt;&#xD;
                7 days following its completion; or deaths occurring ≥ 7 days following completion&#xD;
                of initial therapy with no blasts in the blood, but no bone marrow examination&#xD;
                available.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relapse: Bone marrow blasts ≥ 5%; or reappearance of blasts in the blood; or&#xD;
                development of extramedullary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In cases with low blast percentages (5-10%), a repeat marrow should be performed to&#xD;
                confirm relapse. Appearance of new dysplastic changes should be closely monitored&#xD;
                for emerging relapse. In a patient who has been recently treated, dysplasia or a&#xD;
                transient increase in blasts may reflect a chemotherapy effect and recovery of&#xD;
                hematopoiesis. Cytogenetics should be tested to distinguish true relapse from&#xD;
                therapy-related MDS/AML.&#xD;
