    <textblock>
      The prevalence of preterm birth is not decreasing in the last decades despite of improving&#xD;
      health care. Intrauterine infections are important in the etiology of preterm birth but the&#xD;
      interconnection of systemic inflammation and preterm birth is not clear. Mechanisms of&#xD;
      preterm birth should be assessed as preterm birth is the major risk factor for morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality during birth, thus being important for the individual and regarding health costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interventions will be carried out in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a common etiology between oral and vaginal inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bacterial species are similar in vagina and oral cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There are similar oral and systemic immune reactions which provoke preterm birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inflammatory markers are found in pregnant women at risk and get back to normal post&#xD;
           partum In this matched case control study of pregnant women local, systemic and oral&#xD;
           inflammation markers and bacterial load are assessed to find out interconnections&#xD;
           between these body compartments to allow for explanation of the etiology of preterm&#xD;
           birth.&#xD;

      Vaginal, oral and systemic inflammation in preterm birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
           The prevalence of preterm birth (PTB) is increasing. While intrauterine infections may&#xD;
           be the primary cause of PTB, remote infections may also be part of the aetiology and&#xD;
           risk for gestational complications. Predicting and identifying women at risk for&#xD;
           delivering preterm is difficult. Comprehensive studies are needed to study all&#xD;
           infectious and inflammatory processes that may be involved in birth complications.&#xD;
           Social, ethnic and behavioural risks are part of the factors involved. Thus,&#xD;
           case-control studies of infection in pregnancy must acknowledge and control for such&#xD;
           other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The oral cavity provides a unique study model of periodontal infection and inflammation.&#xD;
           Gingivitis and periodontitis have been associated with an elevated risk for PTB. A large&#xD;
           entity of bacteria including both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria competent to elicit a&#xD;
           systemic hyper-inflammatory host immune response can be identified in periodontal&#xD;
           infection. Inflammation of the gingival tissues increases in pregnancy. Knowledge&#xD;
           obtained through studies of clinical parameters as well as studies of bacteria and&#xD;
           cytokines in oral, vaginal and blood samples in pregnant women at risk for preterm birth&#xD;
           would establish evidence-based background for successful clinical strategies to prevent&#xD;
           or reduce the risk for PTB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objectives of the present matched case-control study of pregnant women are to&#xD;
           investigate local and remote infection (microbiological analysis by culture, and DNA-DNA&#xD;
           checkerboard) and inflammation (cytokine assays in samples from vaginal and oral&#xD;
           samples), and routine clinical data in three groups of pregnant women:&#xD;
&#xD;
           I. Women medically considered at risk for and WITH actual preterm birth delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
           II. Women medically considered at risk for preterm birth delivery but who deliver&#xD;
           WITHOUT birth complications&#xD;
&#xD;
           III. Women with a normal uneventful pregnancy (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators aim to test the following hypotheses regarding associations between&#xD;
           oral infection and PTB:&#xD;
&#xD;
           I. There is a shared infectious aetiology between oral and vaginal infections (primary&#xD;
           outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
           II. In women at risk for PTB the vaginal and oral bacterial microbiota are similar&#xD;
&#xD;
           III. There are similar systemic and/or local inflammatory responses (haematogenous&#xD;
           dissemination and bacteraemia, feto-maternal immune response) that can be induced by&#xD;
           vaginal and/or oral infection, contributing to PTB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IV. Elevated inflammatory markers are found at the onset of symptoms in pregnant women&#xD;
           at risk for PTB and normalize after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current status in this field of research&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation and a birth&#xD;
           weight of &lt; 2500 grams. PTB is the most important determinant of perinatal morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality. Among those born before 32 weeks of gestation many children will suffer from&#xD;
           lifelong sequelae of prematurity ranging from mild to severe developmental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Detailed Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Scientific objectives (Aims)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test the following hypotheses regarding associations between oral&#xD;
      infection and PTB:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. There is a shared infectious aetiology between oral and vaginal infections (primary&#xD;
      outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. In women at risk for PTB the vaginal and oral bacterial microbiota are similar&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. There are similar systemic and/or local inflammatory responses (haematogenous&#xD;
      dissemination and bacteraemia, feto-maternal immune response) that can be induced by vaginal&#xD;
      and/or oral infection, contributing to PTB&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Elevated inflammatory markers are found at the onset of symptoms in pregnant women at&#xD;
      risk for PTB and normalize after birth&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Patient grouping&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a longitudinal, non-interventional case-control study of pregnant women&#xD;
      including (I) a control group of women with uneventful pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) a group of women medically considered at risk for PTB and actually delivering preterm&#xD;
&#xD;
      (III) a group of women medically considered at risk for PTB but with uneventful pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be examined at three time points (I) within 18-34 weeks of pregnancy when they&#xD;
      get symptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) within two days after delivery and&#xD;
&#xD;
      (III) 4-6 weeks post-partum. This would allow the investigators to compare all examined&#xD;
      parameters between and within groups over the defined time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the medical inclusion criteria clinical medical/dental examinators cannot be blinded.&#xD;
      At the first examination the clinicians will not know whether subjects belong to group II or&#xD;
      group III. All laboratory processes will, however, be performed with no knowledge of group&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to enrol a total of 180 pregnant women with a clinically perceived&#xD;
      risk for PTB or at no/low risk based on routine clinical assessment criteria. Consecutive&#xD;
      consenting pregnant women seeking care at, or are being referred to the Frauenspital,&#xD;
      University of Berne will be asked to participate when admitted to the prenatal care unit&#xD;
      because of risks for PTB, e.g. shortening of the cervical length, preterm contractions or&#xD;
      prelabor premature rupture of membranes. The investigators anticipate a 10% dropout rate.&#xD;
      They intend to continuously match subjects in the control group to those in the risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting women will receive study examinations as well as obstetric standard of care during&#xD;
      pregnancy provided by medical faculty investigators. Dental faculty investigators at the&#xD;
      Department of Periodontology, University of Bern will perform dental examinations, data and&#xD;
      sample collections from the participating subjects at either the Clinics of the Dental School&#xD;
      or at the Frauenspital for bedridden pregnant women. There will be no specific dental&#xD;
      interventions as part of the study. The dentists who normally provide care for study subjects&#xD;
      will continue to do so. There are currently no known dental procedures that can reduce the&#xD;
      risk for PTB. Dental procedures during pregnancy are considered at low or no risk to the&#xD;
      pregnant women or the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect information on all medical and dental treatments performed&#xD;
      during pregnancy. They will assess obstetric and dental clinical conditions, using procedures&#xD;
      that they follow in both clinics. The investigators will also assess bacteria and fungi in&#xD;
      vaginal and oral compartments, and serum and local vaginal/oral inflammatory markers&#xD;
      (cytokines and C-reactive protein). They recognize that genetic and socio-economic factors as&#xD;
      well as ethnicity are important factors in risks for PTB. The control group will therefore be&#xD;
      paired and matched for gestational age, ethnicity, age, parity and smoking. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that some of these subjects in the assigned no risk control group may actually&#xD;
      deliver with PTB. Only women who deliver uneventfully will be included in the control group.&#xD;
