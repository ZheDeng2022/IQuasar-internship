  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise is known to produce significant health benefits and to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      heart diseases, although how this benefit occurs is not well understood. White blood cells&#xD;
      are known to be involved in triggering heart attacks, and which genes are switched on or off&#xD;
      in white blood cells determines whether they have beneficial or harmful effects. Previous&#xD;
      studies, and studies ongoing in our group, have demonstrated measurement of peripheral blood&#xD;
      gene expression (which reflects white blood cell gene expression) is able to distinguish&#xD;
      between patients with and without coronary artery disease, or patients who are able to&#xD;
      develop good compared with poor coronary collateral arteries. Therefore, the gene expression&#xD;
      signature in peripheral blood may provide novel diagnostic or prognostic information, and&#xD;
      insight into the pathogenesis of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore hypothesise that exercise alters peripheral blood gene expression in patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease and angina. This will identify possible ways that exercise&#xD;
      improves angina and reduces the risk of heart disease.&#xD;
