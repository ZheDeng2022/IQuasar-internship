      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a disorder in which nerve cells in the brain that&#xD;
      control movement degenerate. The cause of PLS is not known, but some research has suggested&#xD;
      that environmental factors that produce oxidative stress trigger PLS in people who carry&#xD;
      certain genes. Oxidative stress is caused when the body makes chemicals called &quot;free&#xD;
      radicals&quot; faster than its natural systems can break them down. Oxidative stress can be&#xD;
      triggered by exposures to chemicals related to the bodily effects of lead, smoking, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, physical activity, and psychological stress. Chemicals produced by the body&#xD;
      during oxidative stress can be measured in the blood and urine. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
      studying the physical, neurological, and chemical effects of PLS to better understand the&#xD;
      effects of oxidative stress on the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the relation of oxidative stress to the diagnosis and progression of motor neuron&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 20 years of age or older who have been diagnosed with PLS, and have had&#xD;
      symptoms of PLS for at least 5 but not more than 8 years and been previously enrolled in&#xD;
      01-N-0145 Screening: Neurologic Disorders with Muscle Stiffness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an initial study visit and three follow-up visits. Each visit&#xD;
           will require approximately 3 days of testing at the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
           Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As part of this study, participants will have the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological examination to test muscle strength, sensation, coordination, and reflexes,&#xD;
           as well as clarity of speech&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of memory, attention, concentration, and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surveys on oxidative stress, including questions on life, mood, jobs held, and habit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electromyography to record the electrical activity of muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure electrical activity translated from their&#xD;
           brain to the muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and skin biopsy samples for testing and sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the initial visit, participants will have three more visits, once each in the&#xD;
           following 3 years.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are motor neuron&#xD;
      disorders with different phenotypes that progress at very different rates. ALS is a rapidly&#xD;
      progressive disease with a median survival less than 5 years. Patients with PLS have a slowly&#xD;
      progressive course with a normal lifespan. One hypothesis is that oxidative stress affects&#xD;
      the way in which different motor neuron disorders progress. To test this hypothesis,&#xD;
      exposures to putative triggers of oxidative stress and biomarkers that may reflect oxidative&#xD;
      stress will be assessed in patients with motor neuron disorders. A multicenter effort (the&#xD;
      COSMOS study) has been initiated to accumulate sufficient numbers of ALS patients to address&#xD;
      this hypothesis. As an add-on study, PLS patients will also be assessed in the multicenter&#xD;
      effort. The objective of this protocol is to enroll PLS patients in this multicenter effort.&#xD;
      The goal is to assess environmental factors and markers of oxidative stress in patients with&#xD;
      established PLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 adult patients with PLS who have symptoms of pure upper motor neuron dysfunction for at&#xD;
      least 5 but not more than 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a standard battery of clinical, physiological, and cognitive screening&#xD;
      tests at enrollment, with scheduled follow-up evaluation visits every 12 months for 36&#xD;
      months. Blood and urine samples will be sent to collaborators at Columbia University for&#xD;
      analysis of markers of oxidative injury and genetic risk factors. Patients will complete a&#xD;
      self-administered nutritional survey and will be interviewed by phone by Columbia University&#xD;
      investigators using questionnaires to assess environmental, occupational, lifestyle and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors thought to be triggers of oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Columbia University collaborators will combine data from several centers in a regression&#xD;
      model correlating the slope of decline of the ALS-FRS score with an index of oxidative&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
