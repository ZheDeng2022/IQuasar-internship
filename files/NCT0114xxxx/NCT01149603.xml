      Purpose: The purpose of the Destination Therapy Evaluation for Failing Fontan Study (DEFINe&#xD;
      Study) is to perform a single center physician-investigator led feasibility study to initiate&#xD;
      examination of the safety and efficacy of implanting continuous flow circulatory support&#xD;
      devices in 20 patients with failing Fontan physiology, not amenable to other surgical or&#xD;
      medical therapy and who are not candidates for heart transplantation. Based upon the results&#xD;
      of the DEFINe study, consideration would be given to a larger multicenter study. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is survival without a disabling stroke at two years. Safety, functional status,&#xD;
      total days alive following hospital discharge and quality of life assessments will be&#xD;
      evaluated as secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Patients born with the congenital anomaly of a single ventricle often undergo&#xD;
      Fontan procedures to improve oxygenation and circulation. As the patient matures, the&#xD;
      benefits of the Fontan procedures become exhausted. These patients present as young adults&#xD;
      with heart failure, and should be considered for heart transplantation. &quot;Failed Fontan&quot;&#xD;
      physiology patients are now more commonly surviving into their 30s and 40s due to the&#xD;
      advancement in surgical Fontan procedures over the last several decades. Yet, many patients&#xD;
      are not appropriate transplant candidates due to progression of pulmonary failure that&#xD;
      surpasses the pulmonary vascular resistance limits, end organ failure effects to the liver,&#xD;
      and cardiac failure that does not present with left ventricular ejection fractions of less&#xD;
      than 25%. Congenital heart disease is considered a higher risk indication for&#xD;
      transplantation. Such patients present a complex anatomy, scar tissue from prior procedures,&#xD;
      unique pathological states and limited ability to assess hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with failing Fontan physiology will be evaluated for surgical intervention,&#xD;
      heart transplantation or participation in the study for long-term support, known as&#xD;
      Destination Therapy (DT). Patients who do not meet the study criteria will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in a sub-study to collect patient information. Consenting patients who meet the&#xD;
      study criteria will be implanted with a HeartMate II Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) to&#xD;
      improve cardiac output. Following VAD implantation, the patient will recover in the hospital,&#xD;
      and then discharge to home or an approved facility. Study data will be collected as long as&#xD;
      the patient receives VAD support. Placement of the VAD and continuing patient care should&#xD;
      improve cardiac output and quality of life for this population of patients born with the&#xD;
      congenital anomaly of a single ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary endpoint of the study is to examine survival without a disabling stroke&#xD;
      at two years (defined as a score of four or greater on the Modified Rankin Scale). Safety,&#xD;
      functional status, total-days-alive following hospital discharge, and quality of life&#xD;
      assessments will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center nonrandomized observational study led by the PI. However, patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from other centers to participate in this trial. The recruited patients&#xD;
      will be ineligible for cardiac transplantation at the referring institution. The study&#xD;
      institution will also evaluate the patient for cardiac transplantation. If the patient is&#xD;
      determined to be ineligible for transplantation at the study institution, the patient will&#xD;
      have met the study inclusion criteria pertaining to two institutional turn downs for&#xD;
      transplant. The protocol has been designed this way to attract the proposed 20 study&#xD;
      patients, and to allow for a second opinion as to whether the patient is a transplant&#xD;
      candidate. The patient may pursue cardiac transplantation at an institution that deems&#xD;
      him/her transplant eligible, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients who are not candidates for transplantation could then be considered for the&#xD;
      proposed research study. Patients will need to sign an informed consent to be screened for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be implanted with the HeartMate&#xD;
      II VAD and data will be collected as described below in the section &quot;data collection&quot;.&#xD;
      Patients who fail to meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in a sub-study. The sub-study will collect screening and baseline data, as&#xD;
      clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to examine survival without a disabling stroke at two years (defined&#xD;
      as a score of four or greater on the Modified Rankin Scale). Patients that reach the primary&#xD;
      endpoint of survival without a disabling stroke at two years will be considered a success in&#xD;
      this study. The percent of patients that have a successful outcome should be targeted at 80%&#xD;
      of patients that survive to 2 years without a disabling stroke in the general Destination&#xD;
      Therapy patient population at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center. The current survival&#xD;
      rate is 53% survival at 2 years. Therefore, a primary endpoint of 40% survival (8 out of 20&#xD;
      patients) to 2 years without a disabling stroke is purposed. Data related to freedom from a&#xD;
      disabling stroke is roughly based on the work published by Tsukui et al. that showed 33-75%&#xD;
      freedom from cerebrovascular accidents at 6 months in differing device groups of patients&#xD;
      waiting as bridge-to-transplant candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, functional status, total-days-alive following hospital discharge, and quality of life&#xD;
      assessments will be evaluated as secondary endpoints. Secondary endpoints will be evaluated&#xD;
      throughout the study and at one- and two- year follow-up time points after the last patient&#xD;
      has been enrolled into the study. The study is designed to improve quality of life, in&#xD;
      addition to length of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety will be evaluated for all cause mortality, incidence of serious adverse events,&#xD;
           as per the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support&#xD;
           (INTERMACS) definitions (except for modified bleeding and neurocognitive event&#xD;
           definitions), and Incidence of device replacement or device repair due to failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional status and hospitalizations will be evaluated by the cardio-pulmonary stress&#xD;
           test (V.O2 peak), New York Heart Association class, 6-minute walk test, and total number&#xD;
           of days alive out-of-hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life will be assessed through the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure and&#xD;
           Euro-QOL questionnaires.&#xD;
