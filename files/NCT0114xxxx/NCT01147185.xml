      The purpose of this study is to determine whether longer locomotor training results in a mor&#xD;
      favorable outcome in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About half of patients who experience a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) have still motor&#xD;
      and/or sensory function below the level of the lesion. A large proportion of these patients&#xD;
      become ambulatory within the first six months after the SCI. In order to optimally train the&#xD;
      walking function patients are partially unloaded from their body weight while they walk on a&#xD;
      moving treadmill. In severe cases therapists have to assist the leg movements which is an&#xD;
      exhaustive work limiting training time. In the last few years robotic devices have been&#xD;
      developed which enable longer training time. Studies evaluating the training of patients with&#xD;
      hemiparesis showed that longer training time is associated with a better outcome. The present&#xD;
      study aims at evaluating the effect of training time within the robotic device on the&#xD;
      recovery of ambulatory function. Subject with an acute incomplete SCI will be included. The&#xD;
      intervention consist of a walking training which lasts at least 50min, the training of the&#xD;
      control group last at maximum 25min. Both groups will undergo 3-5 trainings per week. Group&#xD;
      assignment will be performed at random. The study lasts for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be the self selected walking speed which will be assessed bi-weekly during the training&#xD;
      period and 4 months later.&#xD;
