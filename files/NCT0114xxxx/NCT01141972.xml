      Specific Aim 1: To compare effects of Vitamin D supplementation to usual care on symptoms in&#xD;
      women transitioning to early postmenopause and determine the associated effect size in order&#xD;
      to conduct a power analysis for a future RCT. Hypothesis: Vitamin D insufficient women in&#xD;
      early postmenopause who are randomized to supplementation, titrated to achieve sufficiency&#xD;
      for 2 months, will have fewer symptoms including hot flashes, mood, and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      complaints than women randomized to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To compare effects of Vitamin D supplementation to usual care on body&#xD;
      composition (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] and by weight, BMI, waist to hip&#xD;
      ratio) in overweight/obese women transitioning to early postmenopause and determine the&#xD;
      associated effect size for a power analysis for a future RCT. Hypothesis: Vitamin D&#xD;
      insufficient women in the menopausal transition randomized to supplementation, titrated to&#xD;
      achieve sufficiency for 9 months, will improve DXA body composition (less total body and&#xD;
      abdominal fat), compared to women in usual care, who will have increased body weight,&#xD;
      including total and abdominal fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To estimate the proportion of overweight/obese middle-aged women who achieve&#xD;
      sufficiency by 1 month versus 2 or more months and to determine if achieving sufficiency by 1&#xD;
      month varies by baseline characteristics. Hypothesis: About 80% of participants will achieve&#xD;
      sufficient Vitamin D level by 1 month. Those who need more than 1 month for sufficiency will&#xD;
      have lower baseline levels and higher initial BMI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is increasingly recognized that Vitamin D deficiency affects more than just bone health.&#xD;
      Links between Vitamin D deficiency have been established or purported for diabetes, the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We propose to explore if Vitamin D&#xD;
      replacement (safe, readily available, and inexpensive) has beneficial effects on 2 novel&#xD;
      outcomes in early postmenopausal women: menopause-related symptoms and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most women transitioning through menopause, especially those with higher percent body fat,&#xD;
      will experience hot flashes through a mean of 4 to 5 years. Many also have mood disturbances&#xD;
      and muscle aches although the link with the menopausal transition is less clear. In many,&#xD;
      these symptoms are severe enough to negatively impact their quality of life, work&#xD;
      performance, and interpersonal relationships. Current treatments for menopause-related&#xD;
      symptoms, such as menopausal hormone therapy, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants, have&#xD;
      significant side effects and serious long term adverse consequences and symptoms recur after&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation. A safe, inexpensive, well-tolerated treatment is therefore of high&#xD;
      priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both our preliminary data in early postmenopausal women and a 2010 publication of women on&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer show an association between Vitamin D deficiency and&#xD;
      menopause-related symptoms including hot flashes. It is postulated that a contributor to hot&#xD;
      flashes is a menopausal decline in serotonin, a neurotransmitter with known effects on&#xD;
      thermoregulation. As Vitamin D can protect against experimental serotonin depletion in rats,&#xD;
      one proposed mechanism for symptom alleviation is prevention of serotonin decline in&#xD;
      menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Vitamin D deficiency and the menopausal transition are associated with mood disturbances&#xD;
      and musculoskeletal aches. Because estrogen increases the activity of the enzyme responsible&#xD;
      for activating Vitamin D, the fall in estrogen that occurs during the menopausal transition&#xD;
      could uncover previously subclinical Vitamin D deficiency. Indeed, Vitamin D can improved&#xD;
      mood and muscle aches in non-menopausal populations, but its effects in menopausal women,&#xD;
      where the benefits may be magnified, have not been previously studied.&#xD;

    <description>We will administer 100,000 IU Vitamin D3 orally as an observed 1-time bolus and then prescribe 1000 IU by mouth daily. These doses have achieved sufficiency in other populations.99, 100 We will use the level of sufficiency (≥30 ng/ml [≥75 nmol/L]) that is recommended by most experts in the field.89-91, 93, 95, 96, 101-105 We will repeat the bolus at 1 month if the target level is not achieved. The control group will receive matching placebo and a similar proportion will go through a dummy titration. All women consuming less than 800 mg/day of calcium (by dietary history) will receive 500 mg of calcium to ensure sufficiency</description>
