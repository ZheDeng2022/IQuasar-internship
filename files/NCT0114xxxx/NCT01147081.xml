      At enrolment, subjects were stratified into two age strata (18 to 60 years, over 60 years).&#xD;
      Total duration of the study is three weeks. Vaccinations were to be administered on day 1.&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected at day 1 (baseline, before the vaccination) and at day 22 (three&#xD;
      weeks after the vaccination). Sera were tested by Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay.&#xD;
      Safety was assessed until 3 weeks after the vaccination.&#xD;
