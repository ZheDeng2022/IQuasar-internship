  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The annual incidence of neck pain has been reported to be 14.6%. Other studies outline a wide&#xD;
      disparity in the lifetime incidence of neck pain ranging from 22% to 70%. Numerous treatment&#xD;
      options exist for the management of neck pain however, there is limited evidence to support&#xD;
      which interventions are most effective. Exercise based interventions are commonly used in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with neck pain however; it is not clear which patients are most likely&#xD;
      to benefit from this type of treatment. The purpose of this project is to develop a clinical&#xD;
      prediction rule (CPR) to identify which patients with neck pain have a greater probability of&#xD;
      benefiting from a standardized program of education and exercise. Ninety (90) patients&#xD;
      referred to physical therapy will undergo a standardized examination to assess potential&#xD;
      predictor variables. Upon completion of the examination a standardized treatment program of&#xD;
      education and exercise will be administered regardless of examination findings. Self report&#xD;
      measures will be administered on the initial examination and on follow up visits at 2, 4, and&#xD;
      6 weeks. A questionnaire and outcome measures will be also mailed out 6 months after&#xD;
      initiation of treatment to assess long-term change. Once the treatment plan is completed,&#xD;
      patients will be classified as having either a successful or non-successful response.&#xD;
      Subjects which rated their perceived recovery on the Global Rating of Chance (GROC) as &quot;a&#xD;
      very great deal better&quot;, &quot;a great deal better&quot;, &quot;quite a bit better&quot;, or &quot;moderately better&quot;&#xD;
      (i.e., a score of +4 or greater) will be categorized as having a successful outcome. The&#xD;
      primary endpoints to determine the outcome will be analyzed at 6 weeks and 6 months. The&#xD;
      result of this study will assist physical therapists to identify sub-groups of patients&#xD;
      likely to benefit from a program of education and exercise. The categorization of patients in&#xD;
      groups based on beneficial treatments may help to provide improved outcomes.&#xD;

      The sample size will consist of 90 subjects ages 18 or above with a primary complaint of neck&#xD;
      pain. The subjects must be able to read and communicate in English in order to complete the&#xD;
      required documentation. No specific conditions are to be included which would make this a&#xD;
      protected population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in one of two ways. First, flyers will be sent to local referrals&#xD;
      announcing the study and request for subjects. Should a patient be interested in&#xD;
      participating they will call the PI at the phone number listed on the flyer. The PI will&#xD;
      inquire about patient location and coordinate a convenient location. Second, patients which&#xD;
      present to a participating clinic with primary complaint of neck pain will be handed a flyer&#xD;
      and asked by the front office if they would be interested to hear more about the study. If&#xD;
      the patient expresses interest in participating they will meet with a clinician trained in&#xD;
      the study to review inclusion and exclusion criterion. Should the patient meet all inclusion&#xD;
      and have no exclusion criterion, the informed consent form will be reviewed with the patient&#xD;
      by a trained clinician. Once the patient has agreed to participate and signed the informed&#xD;
      consent they will be formally enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information obtained in this study is strictly confidential unless disclosure is required&#xD;
      by law. Federal Privacy Regulations provide safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized&#xD;
      access. Except when required by law, the patient will not be identified by name, social&#xD;
      security number, address, telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All records pertaining to the patient's involvement in this research study will be stored in&#xD;
      a locked file cabinet. A case number will indicate the patient's identity on these records.&#xD;
      This information will only be accessible to the investigators listed on the first page of&#xD;
      this document and the research study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Procedures This study will follow a standardized examination and treatment&#xD;
      protocol. All interventions and techniques have been proven to be effective in this patient&#xD;
      population. Once the patient is deemed eligible for the study the informed consent will be&#xD;
      reviewed by an investigator. If the patient agrees to participate in the study they will sign&#xD;
      the informed consent. The patient will complete self report measures which will take&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes. Self report measures to be completed include the neck disability&#xD;
      index (NDI), fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ), global rating of change (GROC), and&#xD;
      numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). An investigator will then perform a standardized&#xD;
      examination which will take approximately 1 hour. Examination findings will be recorded on&#xD;
      the cervical examination form. The patient will then be given an opportunity to undergo a&#xD;
      second examination by a blinded examiner for reliability purposes. This second examination is&#xD;
      optional and must be performed within 48 hours and before treatment is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the examination the patient will be issued a home care guide which&#xD;
      included educational materials and the standardized exercise program. The patients will be&#xD;
      asked to review the educational information. When the patient returns for follow up visits&#xD;
      the standardized treatment program of education and exercise will be initiated and&#xD;
      progressed. Each subsequent treatment session will last approximately one hour. The patient&#xD;
      will be asked to perform the exercise program 2 times per week for 6 weeks and perform&#xD;
      stretches independently. In order to monitor progress the self report measures will be&#xD;
      completed every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When applicable, a portion of the research costs associated with the physical therapy&#xD;
      procedures will be billed to the patient's insurance provider. The patient's co-payments will&#xD;
      be the same as if they were not part of the research study. The procedures will be documented&#xD;
      in their medical/Research record. There will be no additional costs to the patient outside of&#xD;
      the normal delivery of care and no further payment will be offered to the patient for&#xD;
      participation in the study. Participants will be reimbursed a nominal amount for the time&#xD;
      necessary to complete the research documentation. Subject reimbursement is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Reliability of the examination variables will be assessed for a blinded&#xD;
      examiner on a second examination. Descriptive statistics will be calculated which include&#xD;
      frequency counts for categorical data and calculation of the mean and standard deviation (SD)&#xD;
      for continuous variables. Cohen k will be used to calculate inter-rater reliability of&#xD;
      categorical data with only 2 response options possible. A weighted k will be used to&#xD;
      calculate the reliability of categorical data with 3 response options. The weight k will be&#xD;
      calculated using a linear weighting method. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) model&#xD;
      2,1 and the 95% confidence intervals will be calculated to determine the inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability for continuous variables. The standard error of measurement (SEM) will be&#xD;
      calculated as SD√ (1-r), where SD is the standard deviation of the observed scores and r is&#xD;
      the reliability coefficient for the measurement. The minimal detectable change (MDC) for&#xD;
      continuous variables will be calculated as 1.96X SEM X √2. The total measure of error will be&#xD;
      calculated for continuous data by mean difference between raters (rater A - rater B) +/- 1.96&#xD;
      X SD. The total measure of error represents the values within which 95% of the measurements&#xD;
      between raters lie. Reliability for categorical variables will be interpreted as follows;&#xD;
      values &lt; 0.10 no agreement; 0.11 to 0.40 slight agreement; 0.41 to 0.60 fair agreement; 0.61&#xD;
      and 0.80 moderate agreement and values &gt;0.81 substantial agreement. Reliability for&#xD;
      continuous variables will be interpreted as follows: &lt; 0.10 no agreement; 0.11 to 0.40 slight&#xD;
      agreement; 0.61 and 0.80 moderate agreement; and values &gt; 0.81 substantial agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent t-tests will be used to analyze each of the primary outcome variables including&#xD;
      Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Fear Avoidance Beliefs&#xD;
      Questionnaire - Physical Activity (FABQ-PA) and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire - Work&#xD;
      (FABQ-W). The alpha level will be set at 0.05. Multiple comparisons will be conducted&#xD;
      (baseline - 2 weeks; baseline - 4 weeks; baseline - 6 weeks and baseline - 6 months) between&#xD;
      the paired time frames with a dependent t-test. Bonferroni correction will be used to&#xD;
      establish the significance level at 0.0125 (.05/4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential predictor variables will come from the outcome measures, demographics form, history&#xD;
      and physical assessment. Analysis will be implemented using independent t-tests for&#xD;
      continuous variables and X2 tests for categorical variables to determine differences between&#xD;
      successful and non-success outcomes. Variables with a significance of p&lt;.10 will be retained&#xD;
      as potential prediction variables for each group. This p value will be used to decrease the&#xD;
      likelihood that a potential predictor variable will be missed. Sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      values will be calculated for continuous variables with a significant univariate relationship&#xD;
      and plotted as a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The point on the curve which&#xD;
      is closest to the upper left corner represents the values with greatest diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
      This point will be selected as the cutoff defining a positive test. Sensitivity, specificity&#xD;
      and likelihood ratios will be calculated for retained variables in the successful and&#xD;
      non-successful groups. Potential predictor variables for each group will then be entered into&#xD;
      a separate backward stepwise logistic regression model to identify the most prudent group of&#xD;
      variables for the treatment outcome. Those variables preserved in the regression model will&#xD;
      be used to develop a multivariate CPR for classifying patients likely to have a successful&#xD;
      and non-successful outcome by completing a program of education and exercise for this sample.&#xD;
