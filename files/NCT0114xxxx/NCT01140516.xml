  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on the relationship between prophylaxis antibiotics and frequency of&#xD;
      urinary tract infection in children diagnosed with antenatal hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis&#xD;
      is the most common fetal abnormality occurring in 1-5% of all pregnancies. Currently, with&#xD;
      the widespread accessibility of antenatal ultrasound across cities in Ontario, the detection&#xD;
      of hydronephrosis has become even more common. As a result, thousands of infants with&#xD;
      hydronephrosis have been seen and managed by pediatricians, pediatric nephrologists,&#xD;
      pediatric urologists, and family physicians. The investigators need to determine if&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the number of urinary tract infections in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;

      This study focuses on the relationship between prophylaxis antibiotics and frequency of&#xD;
      urinary tract infection in children diagnosed with antenatal hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis&#xD;
      is the most common fetal abnormality occurring in 1-5% of all pregnancies. Currently, with&#xD;
      the widespread accessibility of antenatal ultrasound across cities in Ontario, the detection&#xD;
      of hydronephrosis has become even more common. As a result, thousands of infants with&#xD;
      hydronephrosis have been seen and managed by pediatricians, pediatric nephrologists,&#xD;
      pediatric urologists, and family physicians. The investigators need to determine if&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the number of urinary tract infections in&#xD;
      this population.To determine whether CAP reduces the rate of UTI in infants with prenatal HN&#xD;
      within the first 18 months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is superiority, parallel, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in infants with&#xD;
      prenatal HN testing the effect of CAP on febrile UTI rates over the first 18 months of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      For clinical and safety purposes, data will be collected on symptoms and signs of febrile&#xD;
      laboratory confirmed UTI (urinalysis, urine culture), compliance to treatment, adverse&#xD;
      effects, and resistance to prophylactic antibiotics in case of positive urine cultures. As&#xD;
      part of standard medical care, the patient and family are scheduled for renal-bladder&#xD;
      ultrasounds and outpatient pediatric urology clinic visits at the local recruitment sites&#xD;
      (i.e. McMaster Children's Hospital, The Hospital for Sick Children or, Children's Hospital of&#xD;
      Eastern Ontario) during months as mentioned above at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months . During&#xD;
      these clinic appointments, the research coordinator will follow up with patient and family&#xD;
      regarding their progress in the study. The Research Coordinator will ask about any side&#xD;
      effects from trial medication (nausea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, anaphylactic reactions) and&#xD;
      ensure their questions or concerns are addressed. Data from patient's ultrasound assessment&#xD;
      and renal scans will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to clinic follow ups, patients and their families will be contacted monthly&#xD;
      (excluding the months patient is scheduled for clinical follow up) by the Research&#xD;
      Coordinator to further monitor patient's study progress. Families will be instructed to call&#xD;
      the Research Coordinator at the first sign of febrile UTI (fever, loss of appetite, abdominal&#xD;
      pain) and advised to seek medical assistance (bring their child to the Emergency Department&#xD;
      at the local study institution). The baby will then have a dipstick taken to test for&#xD;
      positive nitrites and leukocytes. If positive, patients are to have a urine sample via&#xD;
      catheter specimen taken and if positive, be taken off study medication and be treated for&#xD;
      febrile UTI according to standard medical practice. In this case the family and healthcare&#xD;
      providers will not be unblinded to the participant's treatment allocation as this information&#xD;
      is not required in order to treat the infant. In the event that parents are unable to bring&#xD;
      their child to the local study institution, it is advised they obtain a dipstick and a&#xD;
      catheter specimen from their local walk-in-clinic, Urgent Care Centre or family physician's&#xD;
      office. If a catheter specimen is not available at these locations, a sterile bag may be used&#xD;
      to determine outcome of urine sample. To ensure there is consistency between outside&#xD;
      facilities, parents are given detailed instructions to obtain a dipstick and provide a&#xD;
      photocopy of the results to the Research Coordinator for our records and potential&#xD;
      adjudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letters will be faxed to the doctor that treated the child for the suspected UTI in order to&#xD;
      obtain the associated reports.&#xD;
