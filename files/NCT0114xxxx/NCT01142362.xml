  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DNA vaccines consist of small pieces of DNA also known as plasmids, and have several&#xD;
      potential advantages over traditional vaccines. Thus far, DNA vaccines appear to be well&#xD;
      tolerated in humans. The investigators have developed a DNA vaccine, VGX-3400X, which&#xD;
      includes plasmids targeting the proteins of the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The vaccine will&#xD;
      be delivered via electroporation (EP) which uses the CELLECTRA constant current device to&#xD;
      deliver a small electric charge following injection, since animal studies have shown that&#xD;
      this delivery method increases the immune response to vaccine. The vaccine will be given to&#xD;
      30 healthy adult subjects. It is hypothesized that VGX-3400X + EP will be well tolerated and&#xD;
      immunogenic.&#xD;

      The use of DNA plasmids containing genes that express viral antigens may be a promising way&#xD;
      to formulate a vaccine that can effectively prevent infection and disease caused by the H5N1&#xD;
      avian influenza virus. Plasmid vectors are simple to construct and are easy to manufacture at&#xD;
      a relatively low cost. Vaccination with plasmids that express influenza proteins should&#xD;
      induce the development of serum antibodies and might also induce significant quantities of&#xD;
      secretory IgA antibodies and/or CMI. The DNA sequences included in the vaccine could also&#xD;
      result in the proliferation of T lymphocytes that could broaden the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      vaccine to include variant strains of H5N1 with antigenically modified HA (i.e., drifted&#xD;
      strains).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroporation (EP) is a technology in which a transmembrane electrical field is applied to&#xD;
      increase the permeability of cell membranes to create microscopic pathways (pores) and&#xD;
      thereby enhance the uptake of drugs, vaccines, or other agents into target cells. Their&#xD;
      presence allows macromolecules, ions, and water to pass from one side of the membrane to the&#xD;
      other. The presence of a constant field influences the kinetics of directional translocation&#xD;
      of the macromolecular plasmid, such that the plasmid delivery in vivo has been sufficient to&#xD;
      achieve physiological levels of secreted proteins. IM injection of plasmid followed by EP has&#xD;
      been used very successfully to deliver therapeutic genes that encode for a variety of&#xD;
      hormones, cytokines, or enzymes in a variety of species. EP is currently being used in humans&#xD;
      to deliver cancer vaccines and therapeutics as well as in gene therapy. The expression levels&#xD;
      are increased by as much as 3 orders of magnitude over plasmid injection alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of EP via the CELLECTRA® device should increase the expression of H5N1 influenza&#xD;
      virus genes in the VGX-3400X DNA vaccine.&#xD;
