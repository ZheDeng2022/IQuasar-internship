    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to conduct an 8-week pilot study to examine the effects&#xD;
      of two different leisure-time activity prescriptions on dietary intake, leisure-time&#xD;
      activities, and weight loss in 30 adults receiving an 8-week behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adult observational studies, TV viewing has been positively related to overweight and&#xD;
      obesity. It is theorized that TV watching influences eating and activity behaviors, such that&#xD;
      with greater TV watching less physical activity and greater consumption of energy occurs,&#xD;
      producing a positive energy balance state. While no experimental research has been conducted&#xD;
      with adults examining the influence of reducing TV watching on weight status, experimental&#xD;
      research conducted with children does indicate that lower levels of TV watching can produce&#xD;
      reduced energy intake and greater levels of physical activity. Most importantly,&#xD;
      family-based, behavioral childhood obesity interventions that have targeted reducing&#xD;
      sedentary behaviors (which includes TV watching) have found that as compared to targeting&#xD;
      increasing physical activity during treatment, similar increases in activity and fitness&#xD;
      occur, but that greater weight loss and greater increases in liking for physical activity&#xD;
      occur when sedentary behaviors, as compared to physical activity, are targeted in&#xD;
      family-based behavioral childhood weight control programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the investigation will receive a standard 8-week behavioral obesity&#xD;
      intervention. The intervention will include a reduced caloric prescription (1200-1500&#xD;
      kcal/day) and fat gram prescription (30% or less kcals from fat). One condition will receive&#xD;
      an activity goal (200 minutes/week of moderate-intense physical activity [Physical&#xD;
      Activity]), while the other condition will receive a TV watching goal (10 hours/week) and a&#xD;
      physical activity goal (200 minutes/week of moderate-intense physical activity [TV + Physical&#xD;
      Activity]. Participants will be assessed at 0 and 9 weeks (pre- and post-intervention) on&#xD;
      measures of dietary intake, physical activity, TV watching, time-use, motivation, liking of&#xD;
      physical activity and TV watching, and weight.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be given a closed motion sensor (Omron HJ-720 ITC Pocket Pedometers) to wear over the course of the program to measure number of steps and time spent engaged in moderate -intensity and higher physical activity. Days in which the sensor has been worn at least 10 hours only will be counted towards the seven days. The motion sensors will be downloaded onto computers at the baseline assessments and at week 9. During weeks 0 and 9 all participants will also keep a record of the self-reported physical activity.</description>

    <description>TV monitoring devices (&quot;TV Allowances&quot;) will be hooked onto participants' home TVs by research staff. The devices will record the number of hours per week of TV the research participant is watching. Participants will also be asked to keep a record of their self-reported TV watching at 0 and 9 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Liking of physical activity and TV watching</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate the pleasantness of engaging in physical activity and TV watching using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), anchored on the left with &quot;very unpleasant&quot; and on the right by &quot;very pleasant.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Dietary Intake (calories and % calories from fat) during TV watching or computer use</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary intake will be assessed by three-day food records at weeks 0 and 9. Along with recording foods and drink consumed, participants will indicate in the record when TV is being watched as food and drinks are consumed. These food records will be reviewed to ensure that information written about consumption is complete and incomplete dairies will be reviewed with participants. Dietary data will be analyzed using NDS-R software.</description>
