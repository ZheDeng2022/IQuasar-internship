      This study aims to assess the acceptability of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) for use&#xD;
      as nutritional supplements for infants and young children in Guatemala.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in three phases. Phase 1 was a test-feeding to compare the&#xD;
      acceptability of two different flavors of LNS (peanut and cinnamon) in infants and young&#xD;
      children and their mothers or caregivers in terms of taste, smell and texture, as well as&#xD;
      amount of the test-dose consumed. In Phase 2, children in the Phase 1 trial received a 2-week&#xD;
      supply of one of the LNS products, which they consumed daily in their homes for 14 days under&#xD;
      real-life conditions. Direct observation of supplement use and in-depth interviews with&#xD;
      mothers, caregivers and health staff providing services in communities will be part of this&#xD;
      phase too. In Phase 3, focus group discussions (FGD) were held with participants (mothers and&#xD;
      caregivers) as well as with health staff providing services in communities to discuss&#xD;
      different aspects of infant and child feeding and best ways for the LNS product to be used in&#xD;
      the context of Guatemala.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that both flavors of LNS would be accepted by Guatemalan infants and young&#xD;
      children children and their mothers or caregivers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was carried out in two communities in the Suchitepéquez Department in partnership&#xD;
      with Funcafé, a NGO subcontracted by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to implement the Programa&#xD;
      de Extension de Cobertura (PEC) in Suchitepéquez. PEC provides basic medical care in remote&#xD;
      communities that have limited access to MOH's health centers. This acceptability study was&#xD;
      conducted in communities where PEC was implemented by Funcafé.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children were randomly selected from a list of beneficiaries of PEC served by Funcafé and&#xD;
      invited to participate. Eligibility for participation in the study was determined at the time&#xD;
      of recruitment in the homes of potential participants, by administration of a screening&#xD;
      questionnaire by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All caregivers who completed the home use trial were invited to participate in the FGD.&#xD;
      Funcafé staff members (i.e. Institutional facilitators, Community facilitators and Community&#xD;
      monitors) were randomly selected from the employee roster and potential participants were&#xD;
      invited to participate in FGD using a standard recruitment script.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the IRB of the University of California, Davis. Unawareness of&#xD;
      whether a child was intolerant of peanut or milk products did not prevent participation, but&#xD;
      the child was provided with a small dose of LNS (~5 g) and asked to remain under observation&#xD;
      by study staff for at least one hour. After this initial test, caregivers were also given the&#xD;
      project's mobile phone number to call in case there were any symptoms during the next few&#xD;
      hours. No allergic reactions or other adverse effects were observed or reported in any&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Test-feeding trial, the order of the versions of LNS tested was randomly&#xD;
      determined for each subject. At the first home visit after recruitment (Day 0), the primary&#xD;
      caregivers of the children were given an orientation about LNS. During the orientation,&#xD;
      background data (e.g., socioeconomic and demographic information) were collected using a&#xD;
      structured questionnaire and the experimental procedures were practiced, including initial&#xD;
      tasting of the LNS mixed with food and completion of the tasting questionnaire, but no data&#xD;
      on amount consumed or organoleptic preferences were recorded. The second home visit was Test&#xD;
      Day 1, during which the actual tasting was recorded. All children were apparently healthy and&#xD;
      had not eaten any food (including breast milk) during the previous hour, but during that time&#xD;
      water was allowed. Caregivers were asked to provide 40 g (~3 tablespoons) of the&#xD;
      complementary food they usually give to their children that was available at home, to which&#xD;
      10 g (~2 teaspoons) of LNS were mixed. The mother/caregiver of the child was asked to consume&#xD;
      one teaspoon of the LNS + food mixture (~ 5 g), and then to feed the rest (~ 45 g) to the&#xD;
      child after the mixture was re-weighed. The mother or caretaker rated the mixture's color,&#xD;
      aroma, flavor and consistency based on her own opinion, and her perception of the infant's&#xD;
      degree of liking using a 5-point pictorial hedonic scale (i.e., dislike very much, dislike,&#xD;
      neutral, like, like very much). In order to test the different flavored LNS a third home&#xD;
      visit was conducted (Test Day 2). The same procedures described above for Test Day 1 were&#xD;
      followed on Day 2, but each child tasted the other LNS flavor. No overall or organoleptic&#xD;
      (i.e., color, odor, taste and consistency) preferences were assessed on Day 2. Thus, total&#xD;
      participation in this phase lasted 3 days, including the initial orientation day. At each&#xD;
      test-feeding day, we collected data on infant's health (i.e., nasal discharge, cough,&#xD;
      difficulty breathing, fever, diarrhea, vomit/nausea, ear infection, and any other symptom)&#xD;
      and any possible reaction to the test meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Home use trial, primary caregivers of children who participated in the test-feeding&#xD;
      trial received a two-week supply of LNS, which they were asked to add to their infants'&#xD;
      prepared food each day. The daily ration of LNS was 20 g/day, provided in two 10-g sachets.&#xD;
      In order to avoid bias, the LNS flavor to be distributed during the home-use trial was&#xD;
      randomly assigned without taking into account the child's preference (if any) as explained&#xD;
      above. To ensure that subjects consumed the entire daily ration, caregivers were instructed,&#xD;
      to mix each sachet with 2-3 tablespoons of the home-prepared food, to be fed to the child&#xD;
      before the rest of the food was offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the first week of supplementation, a field worker visited the household of&#xD;
      each participant to count the empty (used) sachets and ask questions about any child illness.&#xD;
      At the end of two weeks, a field worker visited each participant in his/her home to repeat&#xD;
      the morbidity questionnaire and conduct an exit interview with the mother/caregiver to assess&#xD;
      their perceptions, use and possible intra-household distribution of the product,&#xD;
      ease/difficulty of providing the supplement 2 times/day, and foods used to mix with the&#xD;
      supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, open ended questions were asked at the exit interview to explore the caregivers'&#xD;
      views about important characteristics of foods appropriate for infants and young children,&#xD;
      opportunities and barriers to using a nutrient supplement &quot;just for children of a certain&#xD;
      age&quot; in the family, perceptions of the use of LNS for children, and recognition of the&#xD;
      problem of malnutrition in their communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FGD were led by an experienced focus group facilitator, assisted by a note-taker who&#xD;
      audio-recorded the discussions and took notes on group dynamics and non-verbal interactions&#xD;
      between participants. Each focus group included 8-10 participants, and lasted for&#xD;
      approximately 60-90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four FGD (two per community) were conducted with primary caregivers of the children who had&#xD;
      consumed LNS during the test-feeding and the home-use trial. The main purpose of the FGD was&#xD;
      to get input on appropriate supplement names and packaging designs for the LNS product in&#xD;
      Guatemala, flavors appropriate for infants and young children, and appropriate messages for&#xD;
      promotion of LNS for children. A brainstorming approach was used to explore possible names&#xD;
      for the supplement, followed by secret vote to short list the names based on participants'&#xD;
      preferences. Exploration of ideas about packaging designs started with drawings which were&#xD;
      then organized by theme. A discussion to generate consensus on the key elements that the&#xD;
      label should include was facilitated. A group design for the packaging was the final product&#xD;
      of FGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the FGD with Funcafé personnel was to elicit their opinion on how the&#xD;
      LNS could be incorporated into Funcafé's program operation.&#xD;
