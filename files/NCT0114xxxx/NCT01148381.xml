  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The influence of genes on addictive and neuropsychiatric disorders is complex, especially&#xD;
      given that multiple genes likely influence certain behaviors that are correlated with&#xD;
      addiction. Researchers are interested in looking at the genetic information of individuals&#xD;
      who are enrolled on National Institute for Drug Abuse studies to investigate specific genetic&#xD;
      variants that may be related to substance abuse. Researchers will study the effects of genes&#xD;
      on several aspects of thinking such as attention, memory, decision making, problem solving,&#xD;
      learning, and emotional feelings, and investigate the ways in which genetic information&#xD;
      affects addictive behaviors and substance abuse. In addition, researchers will study how&#xD;
      genes may explain differences in imaging data in substance users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect genetic information for research on genetic aspects of addiction and substance&#xD;
      abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults age 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (1) healthy, non-drug-using nonsmokers,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (2) healthy smokers,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (3) healthy individuals dependent on other commonly abused drugs, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (4) individuals with other psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be right-handed, and must be enrolled in another National Institute on&#xD;
           Drug Abuse, Intramural Research Program imaging protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves one to two visits to National Institute on Drug Abuse, Intramural&#xD;
           Research Program that may be separate from the participant's current research protocol&#xD;
           study visits or on the same day as those visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample and complete questionnaires about mood, memory,&#xD;
           and learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may also be asked to do a few tasks, such as playing computer games&#xD;
           involving coin tosses and money management, or responding to questions on a computer&#xD;
           screen.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine genetic variants as well as behavioral measures across different&#xD;
      study group populations. Results of these will be used as regressors to help explain&#xD;
      inter-individual differences in data collected across IRP protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study population will include 1) healthy non-smoking, participants with&#xD;
      no substance use disorders 2) healthy individuals with nicotine use disorder 3) healthy&#xD;
      individuals with other substance use disorders 4) individuals with other psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders and 5) treatment-seeking individuals with substance use disorders. Participants&#xD;
      must be under evaluation for another NIDA-IRP protocol, generally healthy, and age 18 or&#xD;
      older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The main study will require approximately 5-8 hours. Main study procedures may be&#xD;
      done in 1 visit or multiple visits, and may be done in conjunction with another NIDA-IRP&#xD;
      study. After being consented into the main study, the participant will be asked to submit a&#xD;
      blood sample, an MRI scan, complete various questionnaires, characterization instruments and&#xD;
      several behavioral tasks. Blood will only be drawn once, provided there are no technical&#xD;
      problems (such as sample damage during collection, preparation, shipping or assay) requiring&#xD;
      a repeat draw. If participants enroll in other NIDA-IRP imaging protocols, they will be asked&#xD;
      to repeat a few of the time- sensitive questionnaires in this protocol during the MRI visits&#xD;
      of the other protocols. Data acquired in this protocol will be compared to data acquired in&#xD;
      other NIDA-IRP protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An arm of this protocol will be used to pilot test a phenotyping battery developed by the&#xD;
      NIDA CTN. This battery overlaps with several of the assessments in the main protocol.&#xD;
      Participants in the NIDA CTN pilot study who also meet criteria for the main study may&#xD;
      participate in the main study as well. The CTN Pilot procedures require approximately 4-6&#xD;
      hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures in this study are the genetic, behavioral and&#xD;
      phenotypic factors that are related to addiction. Secondary outcome measures are to compare&#xD;
      the genetic, behavioral and phenotypic factors to imaging and behavioral data acquired across&#xD;
      other IRP protocols.&#xD;

        For the main study, subjects will be recruited from the pool of subjects who are being&#xD;
        considered for other NIDA-IRP protocols. Therefore, participant distribution in the main&#xD;
        study will reflect that specified in other NIDA-IRP protocols. No preferences in&#xD;
        participant recruitment will be made on the basis of gender, race, or ethnic background. In&#xD;
        both the main study and the CTN pilot, efforts will be made to include ethnic minorities in&#xD;
        proportion to their presence in the Baltimore City area, which is where the majority of our&#xD;
        subjects reside.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA: Main Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. under evaluation for another NIDA-IRP study or the NIDA CTN pilot portion of this&#xD;
             study. Justification: data acquired under other studies will be compared to data&#xD;
             collected in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Justification: Some NIDA-IRP studies have&#xD;
             includeed teens, aged 13 - 17, but no current studies include them so we will only&#xD;
             include adults in this study for now.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Main Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of neurological illnesses including but not limited to CVA, CNS tumor, head&#xD;
             trauma, MS or other demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, movement disorders, or migraine&#xD;
             in treatment. Assessment tool: phone screen and history and physical (H&amp;P). Rationale:&#xD;
             Neurological illnesses may impair ability to tolerate the procedures and alter&#xD;
             neuronal activity, adding noise to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cognitive impairment (unless this population of subjects is included in another IRP&#xD;
             protocol in which the subject is also participating). Assessment tool: self-report&#xD;
             during H&amp;P, of special education classes, history of specific learning disability or&#xD;
             mental retardation, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). A WASI score&#xD;
             below 70 will be exclusionary, however, the MAI reserves the right to exclude&#xD;
             participants with higher WASI scores based on evaluation of their educational&#xD;
             history.. Rationale: Cognitive impairment may impair ability to tolerate the&#xD;
             procedures and alter neuronal activity, adding noise to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current major mood, anxiety or psychotic disorder (unless this population of subjects&#xD;
             is included in another IRP protocol in which the subject is also participating).&#xD;
             Assessment tool: self-report, H&amp;P computerized SCID with follow up clinical interview&#xD;
             and/or the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I). Rationale: Current&#xD;
             major mood or psychotic disorders may impair ability to tolerate&#xD;
&#xD;
             the procedures and alter neuronal activity, adding noise to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnancy. Assessment tool: Urine pregnancy test. Rationale: fMRI is not accepted as a&#xD;
             safe procedure purely for research purposes during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. HIV positive individuals. Assessment tool: oral HIV test with serum confirmation of&#xD;
             positive results. Rationale: potential liver/metabolic/vascular disease can interfere&#xD;
             with the physiological transduction mechanisms for fMRI (i.e. making the measurement&#xD;
             unreliable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unable to undergo MRI scanning due to possible pregnancy, metallic devices in the&#xD;
             body, claustrophobia or body morphometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently using respiratory, cardiovascular or anticonvulsant medications that may&#xD;
             interfere with the BOLD MRI signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Left-handed. Assessment tool: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (under screening&#xD;
             protocol). Rationale: Differences in hemispheric dominance will be a confound in&#xD;
             structural and functional scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Non-English speaking. Assessment tool(s): self-report. Rationale: To include&#xD;
             non-English speakers, we would have to translate the consent and other study documents&#xD;
             and hire and train bilingual staff, which would require resources that we do not have&#xD;
             and could not justify given the small sample size for each experiment. Additionally,&#xD;
             the data integrity of some of the cognitive tasks and standardized questionnaires used&#xD;
             in this study would be compromised as they have only been validated in English. Most&#xD;
             importantly, ongoing communication regarding safety procedures is necessary when&#xD;
             participants are undergoing study procedures. The inability to effectively communicate&#xD;
             safety procedures in a language other than English could compromise the safety of&#xD;
             non-English speaking participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Suspected or confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment tool: 2019 Novel&#xD;
             Coronavirus (COVID-19) patient screening tool administered by phone prior to&#xD;
             participant arrival. The current version of the screening tool to be used is available&#xD;
             at http://intranet.cc.nih.gov/hospitalepidemiology/emerging_infectious_diseases.html).&#xD;
             Viral testing looking for SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen deemed appropriate by NIH such as&#xD;
             nasopharyngeal or mid- turbinate swab. We reserve the right to change the specimen&#xD;
             type as NIH approves new test procedures. This test may be carried out in-house at&#xD;
             NIDA, NIH, at a community testing site or through a commercial vendor. Anyone with a&#xD;
             positive symptom screen without a clear alternative explanation or a positive viral&#xD;
             test will be excluded until they recover or (for asymptomatic cases) are no longer&#xD;
             infectious. MAI will also retain the ability to exclude for a suspicious symptom&#xD;
             screen without positive viral test. Rationale: Covid-19 is extremely infectious and&#xD;
             can have serious consequences. Allowing participants with active infection would alter&#xD;
             the risk:benefit ratio for non-treatment studies without a primary focus on SARS-&#xD;
             CoV-2 to an unacceptable level of risk. In addition, Covid-19 can have cognitive&#xD;
             consequences which would add unnecessary noise to the study data. Testing will&#xD;
             continue as long as public health officials and/or NIDA medical personnel deem it&#xD;
             appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria: NIDA CTN Pilot Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Either have a current DMS-5 nicotine, cocaine, marijuana or opiate use disorder,&#xD;
             possibly in combination, or have no current DSM-5 substance use disorder (control&#xD;
             participants). Justification: These criteria are consistent with the scope of this&#xD;
             study to pilot this battery of tests for future use in similar populations enrolled in&#xD;
             the NIDA CTN studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Justification: The NIDA CTN will use this&#xD;
             battery in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria: NIDA CTN Pilot Study&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A DSM-5 major psychiatric diagnoses unrelated to a substance use disorder including&#xD;
             but not limited to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Diagnoses secondary to&#xD;
             substance use disorder will be allowable providing the participant s symptoms do not&#xD;
             interfere with the ability to complete assessments. Assessment tool: self-report, H&amp;P,&#xD;
             Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Rationale: Current major mood or psychotic disorders may impair ability to complete&#xD;
             the assessments and would add unnecessary noise to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cognitive impairment. Assessment tool: self-report during H&amp;P of special education&#xD;
             classes, history of specific learning disability or mental retardation, WASI.&#xD;
             Rationale: Cognitive impairment may impair ability to complete the assessments and&#xD;
             would add unnecessary noise to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-English speaking. Assessment tool(s): self-report. Rationale: To include&#xD;
             non-English speakers, we would have to translate the consent and other study documents&#xD;
             and hire and train bilingual staff, which would require resources that we do not have&#xD;
             and could not justify given the small sample size for each experiment. Additionally,&#xD;
             the data integrity of some of the cognitive tasks and standardized questionnaires used&#xD;
             in this study would be compromised as they have only been validated in English. Most&#xD;
             importantly, ongoing communication regarding safety procedures is necessary when&#xD;
             participants are undergoing study procedures. The inability to effectively communicate&#xD;
             safety procedures in a language other than English could compromise the safety of&#xD;
             non-English speaking participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Suspected or confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment tool: 2019 Novel&#xD;
             Coronavirus (COVID-19) patient screening tool administered by phone prior to&#xD;
             participant arrival. The current version of the screening tool to be used is available&#xD;
             at http://intranet.cc.nih.gov/hospitalepidemiology/emerging_infectious_diseases.html).&#xD;
             Viral testing looking for SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen deemed appropriate by NIH such as&#xD;
             nasopharyngeal or mid- turbinate swab. We reserve the right to change the specimen&#xD;
             type as NIH approves new test procedures. This test may be carried out in-house at&#xD;
             NIDA, NIH, at a community testing site or through a commercial vendor. Anyone with a&#xD;
