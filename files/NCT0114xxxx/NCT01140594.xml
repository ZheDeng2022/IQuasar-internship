      A prospective comparison of eyes undergoing wavefront-guided LASIK in one eye and&#xD;
      wavefront-guided PRK in their fellow eye for myopia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study comparing the outcomes of LASIK surgery to PRK surgery for&#xD;
      nearsightedness when using the two different procedures. You will have one eye treated with&#xD;
      LASIK using the Intralase FS laser and your other eye treated with PRK. You will be one of&#xD;
      100 sighted patients at Stanford to undergo treatment in this clinical research trial. This&#xD;
      will be a prospective, randomized, research study in which up to 200 consecutive eyes&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo excimer laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in one eye and&#xD;
      photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in the fellow eye for the correction of myopia&#xD;
      (nearsightedness) with or without astigmatism will be enrolled. The choice of which eye&#xD;
      receives LASIK and which eye receives PRK will be randomized prior to enrollment.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done according to a randomization schedule. You will know which eye is&#xD;
      being treated with which procedure. The randomization will determine only whether your right&#xD;
      or left eye is treated with the LASIK procedure. The other eye will be treated with PRK. You&#xD;
      have a fifty percent chance of having your left eye treated with LASIK as your right eye.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo either bilateral (both eyes at once) wavefront (a more precise custom&#xD;
      laser system) guided LASIK and PRK treatments using the VISX Star S4 excimer laser. All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed for one year after the vision correction procedure. Subjects&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo LASIK and PRK for the correction of myopia (nearsightedness) with or&#xD;
      without astigmatism will be screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will be examined&#xD;
      preoperatively to establish a baseline for ocular condition (the general health and glasses&#xD;
      prescription of the eyes). Postoperatively, subjects will undergo an ophthalmic evaluation&#xD;
      (complete eye examination) at regular intervals as specified in this protocol. Retreatments&#xD;
      (a second operation on the same eye for residual nearsightedness) will not be allowed during&#xD;
      the first six months of this study. If you elect to undergo a retreatment of your LASIK or&#xD;
      PRK surgery prior to the 6-month post-operative visit, the retreated eye will be exited from&#xD;
      the study as of the retreatment date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any significant new finding developed during the course of the research which may relate to&#xD;
      the subject's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject or&#xD;
      subject's representative in a timely manner.&#xD;
