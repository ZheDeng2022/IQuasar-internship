  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that makes the&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. A specific type of&#xD;
      mutation called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of CF in&#xD;
      approximately 10% of patients with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered&#xD;
      investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation.&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 3 extension trial that will evaluate the long-term safety of ataluren&#xD;
      in adult and pediatric participants with nonsense mutation CF (nmCF), as determined by&#xD;
      adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. The study will also assess changes in pulmonary&#xD;
      function, CF pulmonary exacerbations, health-related quality of life, antibiotic use for&#xD;
      CF-related infections, CF-related disruptions to daily living, body weight, and CF&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Funding source for this study is the FDA OOPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, open-label, safety and efficacy study will be performed at sites in North&#xD;
      America, Europe, and Israel. The study will enroll up to approximately 208 participants with&#xD;
      nmCF who participated in a previous Phase 3 study of ataluren (PTC124-GD-009-CF [Study 009],&#xD;
      NCT00803205). Participants will receive study drug 3 times per day (TID) (at breakfast,&#xD;
      lunch, and dinner) for approximately 48 weeks (approximately 1 year). Study assessments will&#xD;
      be performed at clinic visits every 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>A TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship that occurred or worsened in the period extending from the first dose of study drug to 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an adverse event (AE) resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. AE severity was graded as follows: Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe; Grade 4: life-threatening; Grade 5: fatal. A TEAE was considered related if in the opinion of the Investigator it was possibly or probably caused by the study drug. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline for the Respiratory Domain Score of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) at Weeks 48 and 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1 [Total Study Week 48]), Week 48 (Total Study Week 96), EOT (Week 96 [Total Study Week 144])</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R consists of 44 items, including generic scales of physical functioning, role functioning, vitality, health perceptions, emotional functioning, and social functioning, and CF-specific scales of respiratory and digestive symptoms, body image, eating disturbances, and treatment burden. Questions are scored on a scale from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating better quality of life (QOL). For some questions, the scale was reversed, so that 1 indicated better QOL. Domain scores were linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better QOL. Domain scores were calculated by using the following formula: 100 * (sum of responses - minimum possible sum)/ (maximum possible sum - minimum possible sum). The minimum possible sum = number of questions * 1; the maximum possible = the number of questions * 4. Baseline was Week 1. A negative change from Baseline indicates that health has worsened. Participants may have switched age groups during the study.</description>

    <measure>Rate of Study Drug Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1 [Total Study Week 48]) up to EOT (Week 96 [Total Study Week 144])</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of compliance was defined as the number of actual doses taken divided by the number of planned doses * 100. Participant-reported data were obtained from the participant's compliance log, which was completed by the participant or the caregiver. The participant or caregiver reported how many doses were taken. Compliance by drug accountability was determined by counting used and unused study drug sachets. All calculations were based on the records of the first dose date to the last dose date.</description>

    <description>During treatment, participants reported when they missed school or work because of pulmonary symptoms. If Event Date was before Day 1 (Baseline) Date, Study Day = Event Date - First Dose Date. If Event Date was on or after Day 1 Date, Study Day = Event Date - First Dose Date + 1. The Duration = Return to Stable Date - Onset Date. Participants with a respiratory event that was ongoing when the participant was discontinued from the study were considered as not evaluable. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the Adverse Events module.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 48 (Total Study Week 96) and EOT (Week 96 [Total Study Week 144])</time_frame>
    <description>Lungs were imaged by using non-contrast, spiral CT. The administration of CT scans was discontinued for this study via a memorandum sent to all Investigators, based on the results of Study 009, which showed that this exploratory endpoint failed to discriminate active treatment from placebo over the 48-week study period. Therefore, this Outcome Measure was removed from the study as a Secondary Outcome Measure and the CT scans that were administered for this study were not reviewed or analyzed for this Outcome Measure.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Concentration of Sweat Chloride at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1 [Total Study Week 48]), Week 48 (Total Study Week 96)</time_frame>
    <description>Sweat was collected, from each arm, by using pilocarpine iontophoresis. The chloride concentration in the sweat was quantified for each arm by using standard laboratory methods. Tests were considered valid if the sweat collection time was ≤35 minutes; tests with longer collection times were also considered valid if extra time was needed to obtain sufficient volume (≥15uL) for analysis. For analysis purposes, the average of the values from each arm were computed. If the assessment was valid and/or available in only 1 arm, this value was used as if it were the average of both arms. The method used was consistent with the guidelines of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics - Therapeutic Development Network. Baseline was the most recent value of sweat chloride prior to treatment in Study 009e. A positive change from Baseline indicates that sweat chloride concentration increased.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a multicenter, open-label extension study of the safety and efficacy of ataluren in male and female participants with nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis (nmCF) aged ≥6 years who successfully completed Study PTC124-GD-009-CF (NCT00803205 [Study 009]).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants began the open-label extension study immediately after completing end-of-study visit (Week 48) in Study 009 to avoid interruption in treatment. Most assessments performed at Study 009's final visit were used as Baseline assessments in Study PTC124-GD-009e-CF (009e). Investigators and participants remained blinded to Study 009 dosing.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>A TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship that occurred or worsened in the period extending from the first dose of study drug to 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an adverse event (AE) resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. AE severity was graded as follows: Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe; Grade 4: life-threatening; Grade 5: fatal. A TEAE was considered related if in the opinion of the Investigator it was possibly or probably caused by the study drug. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Predicted Function (Percent-Predicted) of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Baseline</title>
        <description>Spirometry was used to assess pulmonary function by measuring the percent-predicted, which was determined on the basis of the height value obtained at the same study visit, for FEV1 (the amount of air that can be exhaled in 1 second). Spirometry was validated by using current guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS). Baseline was defined as Week 1 or the most recent value of percent-predicted FEV1 prior to the first dose of open-label treatment in Study 009e.</description>

          <title>Percent-Predicted of FEV1 in the 144-Week Completer Population at Baseline</title>
          <description>Spirometry was used to assess pulmonary function by measuring the percent-predicted, which was determined on the basis of the height value obtained at the same study visit, for FEV1 (the amount of air that can be exhaled in 1 second). Spirometry was validated by using current guidelines of the ATS and ERS. Analyses with the Completer populations were performed to complement the analyses of the Study 009e As-Treated population. Baseline was defined as Week 1 or the most recent value of percent-predicted FEV1 prior to the first dose of open-label treatment in Study 009e.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Percent-Predicted of FEV1 in the 144-Week Completer Population Over a Total of 144 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>Spirometry was used to assess pulmonary function by measuring the percent-predicted, which was determined on the basis of the height value obtained at the same study visit, for FEV1 (the amount of air that can be exhaled in 1 second). Spirometry was validated by using current guidelines of the ATS and ERS. The percentage of change in percent-predicted of FEV1 was calculated as follows: ((percent-predicted FEV1-Baseline percent-predicted FEV1)/Baseline percent-predicted FEV1)*100. Analyses with the Completer populations were performed to complement the analyses of the Study 009e As-Treated population. Baseline was defined as Week 1 or the most recent value of percent-predicted FEV1 prior to the first dose of open-label treatment in Study 009e.

A positive change from Baseline indicates that FEF25-75 improved.</description>

          <description>Spirometry was used to assess pulmonary function by measuring the percent-predicted, which was determined on the basis of the height value obtained at the same study visit, for FEF25-75 (the rate of air flow during the middle part of an exhalation). Spirometry was validated by using current guidelines of the ATS and ERS. The percentage of change in percent-predicted of FEF25-75 was calculated as follows: ((percent-predicted FEF25-75-Baseline percent-predicted FEF25-75)/Baseline percent-predicted FEF25-75)*100. Baseline was defined as Week 1 or the most recent value of percent-predicted FEF25-75 prior to the first dose of open-label treatment in Study 009e.

        <title>Number of Participants With Severe Pulmonary Exacerbations as Defined by Modified Fuch's Criteria</title>
        <description>A REF, which collected data on various signs, symptoms, and effects for each event, was completed by the Investigator when informed by the participant of a respiratory event. Pulmonary function was assessed by using the modified Fuchs' criteria, which defines an exacerbation as a respiratory event requiring treatment with parenteral antibiotics for any 4 of the following 12 symptoms with or without treatment with IV antibiotics: change in sputum; new or increased hemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnea; fatigue; temperature &gt;38°C; anorexia; sinus pain; change in sinus discharge; change in physical examination of the chest; decrease in pulmonary function by 10% or more from a previously recorded value; or radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary function. Severity of pulmonary exacerbations over a 5-week interval is presented. The severity of pulmonary exacerbations were graded as mild, moderate, or severe.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline for the Respiratory Domain Score of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) at Weeks 48 and 96</title>
        <description>The CFQ-R consists of 44 items, including generic scales of physical functioning, role functioning, vitality, health perceptions, emotional functioning, and social functioning, and CF-specific scales of respiratory and digestive symptoms, body image, eating disturbances, and treatment burden. Questions are scored on a scale from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating better quality of life (QOL). For some questions, the scale was reversed, so that 1 indicated better QOL. Domain scores were linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better QOL. Domain scores were calculated by using the following formula: 100 * (sum of responses - minimum possible sum)/ (maximum possible sum - minimum possible sum). The minimum possible sum = number of questions * 1; the maximum possible = the number of questions * 4. Baseline was Week 1. A negative change from Baseline indicates that health has worsened. Participants may have switched age groups during the study.</description>

        <description>The rate of compliance was defined as the number of actual doses taken divided by the number of planned doses * 100. Participant-reported data were obtained from the participant's compliance log, which was completed by the participant or the caregiver. The participant or caregiver reported how many doses were taken. Compliance by drug accountability was determined by counting used and unused study drug sachets. All calculations were based on the records of the first dose date to the last dose date.</description>

        <description>Sweat was collected, from each arm, by using pilocarpine iontophoresis. The chloride concentration in the sweat was quantified for each arm by using standard laboratory methods. Tests were considered valid if the sweat collection time was ≤35 minutes; tests with longer collection times were also considered valid if extra time was needed to obtain sufficient volume (≥15uL) for analysis. For analysis purposes, the average of the values from each arm were computed. If the assessment was valid and/or available in only 1 arm, this value was used as if it were the average of both arms. The method used was consistent with the guidelines of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics - Therapeutic Development Network. Baseline was the most recent value of sweat chloride prior to treatment in Study 009e. A positive change from Baseline indicates that sweat chloride concentration increased.</description>
