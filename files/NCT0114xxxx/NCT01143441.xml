      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to investigate the mechanism of action (MOA) of&#xD;
      CD25-blocking therapies in high inflammatory multiple sclerosis (HI-MS). The secondary goal&#xD;
      of this study is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of CD25-blocking therapies in HI-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term daclizumab therapy cohort: Up to 15 daclizumab-treated patients with&#xD;
           relapsing-remitting (RR-MS) or secondary-progressive MS (SP-MS) previously classified as&#xD;
           HI-MS based on MRI/clinical criteria, who have been treated with IV daclizumab for a&#xD;
           minimum of 1 year and responded to this therapy with significant (&gt;70%) decrease in&#xD;
           contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL) or stabilization/improvement of disease activity (&gt;60%&#xD;
           decrease in MS relapses and stable or improved EDSS disability score).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New treatment cohort: Up to 15 HI-MS patients (RR- or SP-MS) with inadequate therapeutic&#xD;
           response to first-line, FDA-approved immunomodulatory therapies for MS or who cannot,&#xD;
           for any reason, be treated with first-line, FDA-approved immunomodulatory therapies for&#xD;
           MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, Phase I trial of 150 mg of daclizumab high yield process (DAC HYP)&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks for a total of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the main goal of this study is to investigate the MOA of CD25-blocking therapies in&#xD;
      MS, the primary outcomes are mechanistic immunological studies performed on clinical samples&#xD;
      (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and skin&#xD;
      biopsies) derived from DAC HYP-treated patients. The secondary outcome measure is long-term&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of subcutaneous DAC HYP in HI-MS patients.&#xD;

      of this study is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of CD25-blocking therapies in HI-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll up to 70 patients. We expect to screen up to 40 HI-MS participants to yield 31&#xD;
      patients that will receive study drug. Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled for the&#xD;
      treatment part of the protocol: A. Long-term daclizumab therapy cohort: 16 daclizumab-treated&#xD;
      patients with relapsing-remitting (RR-MS) or secondary-progressive MS (SP-MS) previously&#xD;
      classified as HI-MS based on MRI/clinical criteria, who have been treated with IV daclizumab&#xD;
      for a minimum of 1 year and responded to this therapy with significant (&gt;70%) decrease in&#xD;
      contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL) or stabilization/improvement of disease activity (&gt;60%&#xD;
      decrease in MS relapses and stable or improved EDSS disability score). B. New treatment&#xD;
      cohort: 15 HI-MS patients (RR- or SP-MS) with inadequate therapeutic response to first-line,&#xD;
      FDA-approved immunomodulatory therapies for MS or who choose not to, for any reason, be&#xD;
      treated with first-line, FDAapproved immunomodulatory therapies for MS. Up to 30 subjects&#xD;
      with inflammatory MS will be screened to yield 20 controls for immunization and skin biopsy&#xD;
      studies (Cohort C: MS controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, Phase I trial of 150 mg of daclizumab high yield process (DAC HYP)&#xD;
