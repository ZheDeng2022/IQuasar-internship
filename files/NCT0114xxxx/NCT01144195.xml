  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First line chemotherapy treatment regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) present&#xD;
      disease-free survival of more than 10 months, and as much as 12 and 15 months for many&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is evident that there are 2 groups of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC):&#xD;
      those who progress during first line treatment or in the 6 months following the last&#xD;
      chemotherapy infusion and those who progress after this first 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no studies evaluating the efficacy of second line chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      according to the duration of response to first line treatment. It seems logical that patients&#xD;
      with less aggressive tumours will benefit more from treatments targeting specific proteins,&#xD;
      such as panitumumab, due to the shorter duration of these tumours cell cycle, which makes&#xD;
      them less sensitive to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is therefore justified to determine an increase in activity and control of the&#xD;
      disease in patients who progressed after 6 months of the last first line chemotherapy&#xD;
      infusion for metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) in subjects expressing wild-type KRAS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single-arm, multi-centre study. Patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer expressing wild type KRAS will be screened for this trial. KRAS mutation status will&#xD;
      be assessed before inclusion and only WILD-TYPE-KRAS subjects will be included. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled and treated with combination therapy consisting of Panitumumab and&#xD;
      FOLFIRI as second line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients must not have progressed on or within 6 months after receiving first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy based on fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin (prior adjuvant chemotherapy based on&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine is permitted). Only one previous chemotherapy regimen is permitted.&#xD;
      Progression after 6 months receiving first line chemotherapy regimen, should be&#xD;
      imaging-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response assessment will be performed by the investigator per the modified Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (m-RECIST). Subjects will be evaluated for tumor response&#xD;
      every 6 weeks ± 1 week the first 24 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter (per the&#xD;
      modified-RECIST criteria) until progression disease (PD) or withdrawal from the trial.&#xD;
      Responding disease will be confirmed no less than 28 days after the criteria for response are&#xD;
      first met. Subjects with symptoms suggestive of progression disease(PD) should be evaluated&#xD;
      for tumor progression at the time the symptoms occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who permanently discontinue the treatment for any reason, will undergo a safety&#xD;
      follow-up assessment 30 days ± 7 days after the last treatment dose Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for disease status and subsequent cancer therapy. All subjects who discontinue all the&#xD;
      treatment before disease progression (eg, due to unacceptable toxicities) are followed for&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) (eg, radiographic tumor assessments) every 12 weeks ± 14 days&#xD;
      until disease progression or the end of study (unless the reason for study discontinuation is&#xD;
      fully withdrawn consent). After disease progression, all subjects are followed every 12 weeks&#xD;
      ± 14 days from the safety follow-up visit until the end of study (approximately 52 weeks&#xD;
      after the last subject is enrolled).&#xD;
