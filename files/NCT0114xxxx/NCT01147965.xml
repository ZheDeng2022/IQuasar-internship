  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) that a cancer vaccine&#xD;
      has on you and your cancer. The cancer vaccine is called Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-CEA(6D)or ETBX-011&#xD;
      and is made by Etubics. This vaccine is based on a virus called an adenovirus but it has been&#xD;
      changed to express the protein CEA that is found on some cancer cells. Therefore, the vaccine&#xD;
      can tell the immune system to attack cancer cells which make CEA. The investigators are&#xD;
      trying to determine whether giving this virus is safe and whether this causes a strong immune&#xD;
      system attack on the cancer. ETBX-011 is an investigational drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study with the primary purpose to determine the safety of immunization&#xD;
      with Ad5 [E1-, E2B-]-CEA(6D), in patients with advanced or metastatic CEA-expressing&#xD;
      malignancies. The secondary objectives are to evaluate CEA-specific immune responses to the&#xD;
      immunizations and to obtain preliminary data on clinical response rate. The study population&#xD;
      consists of patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic malignancy that&#xD;
      is CEA positive who were previously treated with standard therapy known to have a possible&#xD;
      survival benefit or refused such therapy. The study will determine the safety of three dosage&#xD;
      levels of Ad5 [E1-, E2B-]-CEA(6D) vaccine (phase I component), and the maximally tolerated&#xD;
      dose of Ad5 [E1-, E2B-]-CEA(6D) vaccine (phase II component). The study drug is Ad5 [E1-,&#xD;
      E2B-]-CEA(6D) given by subcutaneous (SQ) injection every 3 weeks for 3 immunizations. We will&#xD;
      evaluate safety in each cohort at least 3 weeks after the last patient in the previous cohort&#xD;
      has received their first injection. A dosing scheme will be considered safe if &lt;33% of&#xD;
      patients treated at a dosage level experience DLT (e.g., 0 of 3, ≤1 of 6, ≤3 of 12 or ≤5 of&#xD;
      18 patients).&#xD;

        Criteria for Patient Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy expressing CEA. Because this is a&#xD;
             safety and immunogenicity study, patients are NOT required to have measurable or&#xD;
             evaluable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For all tumor types other than colorectal, the tumor must express CEA as defined by&#xD;
             immunohistochemical staining (at least 50% of the tumor with at least moderate&#xD;
             intensity of staining) or a tumor known to be universally CEA positive (i.e. colon and&#xD;
             rectal cancer). If colorectal cancer then, pathologic or clinical confirmation of&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have received treatment with standard therapy known to have a possible&#xD;
             overall survival benefit.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Patients with tumors that over express HER2 (IHC 3+ or FISH+) must have&#xD;
                       received and progressed through at least one line of palliative therapy that&#xD;
                       combines trastuzumab with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Breast cancer patients currently receiving palliative endocrine therapy or&#xD;
                       single-agent trastuzumab will be eligible for this trial and may continue&#xD;

                  metastatic disease consisting of one of the following regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Palliative platinum-based (cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy if the&#xD;
                       patient has not received chemotherapy previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Palliative taxane-based (docetaxel or paclitaxel) or vinorelbine&#xD;
                       chemotherapy if the patient has received chemotherapy previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Lung cancer patients currently receiving palliative single-agent erlotinib&#xD;
                       or gefitinib will be eligible for this trial and may continue these&#xD;
                       therapies concomitant with study treatment (if they have been on these&#xD;
                       single agent therapies for at least 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;

                  for at least 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For other malignancies, if a first line therapy with survival or palliative&#xD;
                  benefit exists, it should have been administered and there should have been&#xD;
                  progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received and progressed through first-line palliative&#xD;
                  chemotherapy must be advised regarding second-line therapy before being enrolled&#xD;
                  on this investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Karnofsky performance score of 70% or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 months&#xD;

             and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who have received prior CEA-targeted immunotherapy are eligible for this&#xD;
             trial, if this treatment was discontinued at least 3 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who are taking medications that do not have a known history of&#xD;
             immunosuppression are eligible for this trial.&#xD;

             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for Patient Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be&#xD;
             excluded. There are no exclusions based on the number of prior chemotherapy, biologic,&#xD;
             hormonal, or experimental regimens. Except for the permitted concomitant therapies&#xD;
             (bevacizumab, cetuximab, trastuzumab, erlotinib, gefitinib, or hormonal therapy which&#xD;
             patients must have been on for at least 3 months at the time of enrollment if they&#xD;
             intend to continue them with the vaccine), there must be at least 3 months between any&#xD;
             prior CEA-targeted immunotherapy and study treatment and at least 4 weeks between any&#xD;
             other prior therapy (including radiotherapy) and study treatment. Patients must have&#xD;
             recovered to grade 1 acute toxicities from prior treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a history of or current brain metastases will not be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease, such as but not restricted to,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,&#xD;
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis. Autoimmune related thyroid disease and vitiligo&#xD;
             are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease&#xD;
             (NYHA class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator as unwarranted high risk for investigational drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the&#xD;
             protocol should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Concurrent (or within the last 5 years) second malignancy other than non melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, controlled superficial bladder cancer, or other&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ that has been treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of an active acute or chronic infection including: a urinary tract infection,&#xD;
             HIV (as determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot). Patients with HIV are&#xD;
             excluded based on immunosuppression, which may render them unable to respond to the&#xD;
             vaccine; patients with chronic hepatitis are excluded because of concern that&#xD;
             hepatitis could be exacerbated by the injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients on steroid therapy (or other immunosuppressives, such as azathioprine or&#xD;
             cyclosporin A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune suppression. Patients&#xD;
             must have had 6 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy (except that used as&#xD;
             pre-medication for chemotherapy or contrast-enhanced studies) prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant and nursing women should be excluded from the protocol since this research&#xD;
             may have unknown and harmful effects on an unborn child or on young children. If the&#xD;
             patient is sexually active, the patient must agree to use a medically acceptable form&#xD;
             of birth control while receiving treatment and for a period of 4 months following the&#xD;
             last vaccination therapy. It is not known whether the treatment used in this study&#xD;
             could affect the sperm and could potentially harm a child that may be fathered while&#xD;
             on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with acute or chronic skin disorders that will interfere with injection into&#xD;
             the skin of the extremities or subsequent assessment of potential skin reactions will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients will be allowed warfarin 1mg po qd other than for port prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with metastatic disease which is determined to be resectable will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
