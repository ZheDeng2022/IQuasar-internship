  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Certain types of lung, esophageal, or thymic cancers and mesotheliomas have specific&#xD;
      antigens (protein molecules) on their surfaces. Research studies have shown that giving a&#xD;
      vaccine that contains antigens similar to these may cause an immune response, which may keep&#xD;
      tumors from growing. Researchers are also interested in determining whether the chemotherapy&#xD;
      drug cyclophosphamide and the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib may help the vaccine work&#xD;
      better, particularly in patients with lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell vaccines in combination with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and celecoxib in patients with cancers involving the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have had surgery for small cell or non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer, esophageal cancer, thymoma or thymic carcinoma, and malignant pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following recovery from surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, participants will have&#xD;
           leukapheresis to collect lymphocytes (white blood cells) for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive celecoxib and cyclophosphamide to take twice a day at home, 7&#xD;
           days before the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the vaccine in the clinical center (one or two shots per month&#xD;
           for 6 months), and will stay in the clinic for about 4 hours after the vaccine.&#xD;
           Participants will keep a diary at home of any side effects from the vaccine, and will&#xD;
           continue to take cyclophosphamide and celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One month after the sixth vaccine, participants will provide another blood sample for&#xD;
           testing, and if the tests are satisfactory will return to the clinic every 3 months for&#xD;
           2 additional vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return to clinic for follow-up physical examinations, lab tests, and&#xD;
           scans every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recent years, the cancer-testis (CT) antigens have emerged as attractive targets for&#xD;
      cancer immunotherapy. Whereas lung and esophageal cancers, as well as malignant pleural&#xD;
      mesotheliomas express a variety of CT antigens, immune responses to these antigens appear&#xD;
      uncommon in patients with these malignancies, possibly due to low-level, heterogeneous&#xD;
      antigen expression, as well as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. Our published studies&#xD;
      indicate that numerous CT antigens can be induced in tumor cells by DNA demethylating agents&#xD;
      and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Conceivably, vaccination of cancer patients with&#xD;
      allogeneic tumor cells expressing high levels of multiple CT antigens in combination with&#xD;
      depletion of T regulatory cells will induce broad immunity to these antigens. In order to&#xD;
      examine this issue, patients with lung and esophageal cancers, thymic neoplasms, primary&#xD;
      thoracic sarcomas, and malignant pleural mesotheliomas will be vaccinated with irradiated&#xD;
      K562 erythroleukemia cells expressing GM-CSF (K562-GM) following completion of appropriate&#xD;
      combined modality therapy. Vaccines will be administered in conjunction with metronomic oral&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (50 mg PO BID x 7dq 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO BID). Serologic responses&#xD;
      to a variety of recombinant CT antigens as well as cell-mediated recognition of autologous&#xD;
      tumor cells and EBVtransformed B cells will be assessed before and after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the safety of K562-GM allogeneic tumor cell vaccines in combination with oral&#xD;
      metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib in thoracic oncology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically proven small cell or non-small cell lung&#xD;
           cancer, esophageal cancer, thymoma or thymic carcinoma, primary thoracic sarcomas, and&#xD;
           malignant pleural mesothelioma with no evidence of disease (NED) or minimal residual&#xD;
           disease (MRD) in the primary site following standard multimodality therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 - 2, without&#xD;
           evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate&#xD;
           pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted;&#xD;
           pCO2 less than 50 mm Hg and pO2 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG; and be on no&#xD;
           immunosuppressive medications except inhaled corticosteroids at the time vaccination&#xD;
           commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100,000, an ANC equal to or greater&#xD;
           than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic&#xD;
           function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of &lt;1.5 x upper limits of normal. Serum&#xD;
           creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater&#xD;
           than 70 ml/min/1.73m(2) at the time vaccination commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following recovery from standard combined modality therapy, patients with no evidence of&#xD;
           disease or minimal residual disease will be vaccinated via subcutaneous intradermal&#xD;
           injection with 1x10(8) irradiated K562-GM-tumor cells periodically over 6 months.&#xD;
           Sterility, potency and identity of the vaccines preps will be confirmed before&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccines will be administered in conjunction with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
           celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic toxicities, and immunologic response to therapy will be recorded. Pre and post&#xD;
           vaccination serologic responses to a standard panel of CT antigens as well as cell&#xD;
           mediated responses to epigenetically-modified autologous EBV-transformed B and&#xD;
           autologous tumor cells (if available) will be assessed before and after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numbers/percentages and function of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood will be&#xD;
           assessed before, during, and after vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed in the clinic with routine staging scans until disease&#xD;
           recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined&#xD;
           following completion of the trial, and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the&#xD;
           analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than&#xD;
           definitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 25 patients will be accrued to this trial.&#xD;

    <description>If 25 patients are enrolled and the true probability of a grade 3 or worse toxicity (of any sort) were 20%, then the probability of having 4 or more patients with this occurring is 76.6%. On the other hand, if the combination was very safe and the true probability of a grade 3 or worse toxicity was 5%, then the probability of having 4 or more patients with this occurring would be 3.4%. Thus, if 25 patients were treated, the combination may be considered to have potentially lower safety than tolerable if 4 or more patients experience grade 3 or worse toxicity.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Patients must be evaluated within 52 weeks following completion of standard therapy&#xD;
             and have shown no evidence of disease during that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with intracranial metastases, which have been treated by surgery or radiation&#xD;
             therapy may be eligible for study provided there is no evidence of active disease and&#xD;
             no requirement for anticonvulsant therapy or steroids following treatment.&#xD;
