  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose finding, open-label, uncontrolled, dose-escalation trial to determine the&#xD;
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended Dose (RD) of the combination RAD001&#xD;
      (escalating daily dose) and CaelyxTM (fixed dose) to patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other purposes of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. define the safety profile of the combination after repeated administrations&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. define hints of antitumor activity, to be confirmed in subsequent disease-oriented&#xD;
           expansion phases at the RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. define the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      mTOR inhibitors are a new class of targeted antitumor agents which showed interesting&#xD;
      antitumor activity in a variety of solid tumors, including prostate, soft tissue sarcomas ,&#xD;
      ovarian, endometrial, kidney, and breast cancer. They also exert an antiangiogenic effect and&#xD;
      are almost devoid of bone marrow toxicity as single agents which makes them suitable for&#xD;
      combination with cytotoxic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracyclines are among the most used and effective cytotoxic agents, and in solid tumors&#xD;
      their indications include, among others, breast, ovary, endometrial, prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Liposomal Doxorubicin (CaelyxTM) could be an adequate replacement of doxorubicin to avoid&#xD;
      potential side effects such as cardiotoxicity, alopecia, GI toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing a combination regimen including mTOR inhibitors and anthracyclines in those tumors&#xD;
      which are known to be sensitive to both compounds is of high clinical interest and&#xD;
      worthwhile.&#xD;
