      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized&#xD;
      radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing&#xD;
      substances to them. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy given together with radiation&#xD;
      therapy is more effective with or without panitumumab in treating patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer of the hypopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, or oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chemotherapy given together with&#xD;
      radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with chemotherapy and radiation therapy&#xD;
      given together with panitumumab in treating patients who have undergone surgery for advanced&#xD;
      hypopharyngeal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, or oral cavity cancer at high&#xD;
      risk of recurrence.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the addition of concurrently administered panitumumab to standard&#xD;
           adjuvant chemoradiation, with 1 of 2 cisplatin-based regimens, significantly prolongs&#xD;
           disease-free survival of patients with macroscopically completely resected, advanced&#xD;
           squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, or oral cavity at high&#xD;
           risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the pre-surgery dose of panitumumab will alter the RNA expression of&#xD;
           several genes and that these changes will provide additional prognostic information that&#xD;
           can be used in future patient management. (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the differences in RNA expression by RNA microarray and the results analyzed to&#xD;
           create a gene expression classifier that will be checked for outcome prediction by&#xD;
           association with disease free survival and down regulation of the glucose metabolism as&#xD;
           measured by FDG-PET. (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create a European biobank of biological samples which can be used for future research&#xD;
           projects in this disease. (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To predict radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity based on in vitro lymphocyte&#xD;
           apoptosis test and SNPs analysis. (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of radiation-induced side effects (swallowing dysfunction and&#xD;
           xerostomia) on patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by treatment center,&#xD;
      radiotherapy technique (3D-CRT vs IMRT), chemotherapy regimen (European Organization for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC]) vs Arbeitsgemeinschaft Radiology Oncology [ARO]&#xD;
      schedule), tumor location (larynx vs oropharynx vs hypopharynx vs oral cavity), pN-stage&#xD;
      (pN0-2 vs pN3), pT-stage (pT1-2 vs pT3-4), margin/extracapsular extension (ECE) status (ECE+&#xD;
      and margin &lt; 5 mm vs ECE- and margin &lt; 5 mm vs ECE+ and margin &gt; 5 mm), biological pre-study&#xD;
      participation (yes vs no), p16 status (positive vs negative vs indeterminable). Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (chemoradiotherapy): Within 4-8 weeks of surgery, patients undergo 3D-conformal or&#xD;
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week in weeks 1-7. Patients also&#xD;
           receive concurrent chemotherapy comprising either cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days 1,&#xD;
           22, and 43 (EORTC schedule) OR cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 24&#xD;
           hours on days 1-5 and 29-33 (ARO schedule), in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (chemoradiotherapy plus panitumumab): Within 4-8 weeks of surgery, patients&#xD;
           undergo 3D-conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy and receive concurrent&#xD;
           chemotherapy (EORTC schedule or ARO schedule) as in arm I. Patients also receive&#xD;
           panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for biomarker correlative studies and translational&#xD;
      research. Patients complete quality-of-life EORTC questionnaires QLQ-C30, QLQ-HN35, and&#xD;
      PSS-HN periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
