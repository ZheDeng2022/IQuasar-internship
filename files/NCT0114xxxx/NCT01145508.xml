      This randomized phase II trial studies how well docetaxel and prednisone with or without&#xD;
      vaccine therapy works in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and&#xD;
      prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Vaccines made from&#xD;
      an antigen may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is&#xD;
      not yet known whether docetaxel and prednisone are more effective with or without vaccine&#xD;
      therapy in treating prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall survival in patients treated with PSA-TRICOM (fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM&#xD;
      vaccine and rilimogene-galvacirepvec) and docetaxel chemotherapy versus docetaxel&#xD;
      chemotherapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the time to radiographic progression after beginning docetaxel chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients previously treated with PSA-TRICOM vaccine versus those not treated with this&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare objective responses (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      [RECIST]) between the two treatment groups in those patients with measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates (decline &gt;= 50%) in patients&#xD;
      treated with PSA-TRICOM and docetaxel chemotherapy versus docetaxel chemotherapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate immune responses elicited in patients treated before and after docetaxel&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the association between development of prostate antigen-specific immune&#xD;
      responses and time to progression and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the association of predicted survival (by Halabi nomogram) with actual&#xD;
      survival in patients treated with PSA-TRICOM vaccine versus those not treated with this&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (vaccine and chemotherapy): Patients receive rilimogene-galvacirepvec subcutaneously&#xD;
      (SC) on day 1 of course 1 and fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine SC on days 15, 29, 43, and 57 of&#xD;
      course 1. Beginning on day 85 (day 1 of course 2), patients receive docetaxel intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21.&#xD;
      Treatment with docetaxel and prednisone repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (chemotherapy): Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and prednisone PO&#xD;
      BID on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
