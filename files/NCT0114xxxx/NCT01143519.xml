      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Research has shown that certain proteins in cells may be linked to higher risks of&#xD;
      developing inflammations, tumors, and other medical problems. By examining how the blood&#xD;
      cells of healthy volunteers respond to environmental exposures, researchers hope to better&#xD;
      understand the relationship of genes, environmental factors, and human diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine how specific genes and proteins in blood cells respond to environmental&#xD;
      exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve one visit of 45 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a brief physical examination and finger stick to&#xD;
           determine if they are eligible to donate blood for the study, and will complete a&#xD;
           questionnaire about any medications or other drugs (e.g., cigarettes) they may be&#xD;
           taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample for research purposes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will investigate the role of SNPs in p53 and p53 response elements on the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to DNA damage. A total of 200 participants aged 18 years and older&#xD;
      carrying one of the five SNPs of interest and wild-type controls will be identified and&#xD;
      recruited from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR). In addition, participants will&#xD;
      be recruited based on their health outcomes and SNP associations from the EPR registry to&#xD;
      study genotype-phenotype effects on lymphocytes. The EPR is a long-term project to collect&#xD;
      and store up to 15,000 DNA samples for use in research studies from individuals in the&#xD;
      greater North Carolina Triangle Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational gene association study will recruit participants on the basis of genotype&#xD;
      or phenotype and then observe the lymphocyte response to chemotherapeutic agents and relevant&#xD;
      environmental pathogens. The SNPs of interest are p53, as well as four of its downstream&#xD;
      target genes including FLT1, MDM2, TLR8 and RRM1. A maximum of 320 mLs of blood will be&#xD;
      obtained from each participant during one visit lasting approximately one hour. Cells from&#xD;
      the donated blood samples will be examined for their response to exposed environmental stress&#xD;
      ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the association between five SNPs and p53 target gene&#xD;
      expression after exposure to Nutlin or doxorubicin (chemotherapeutic agents) with outcome&#xD;
      measured by RT-PCR. The five SNPs are p53 rs1042522, MDM2 rs2279744, FLT1 C-677T, TLR8&#xD;
      rs3761624 and RMM1 rs1465952. The secondary objectives are to: (1) to determine the p53&#xD;
      promoter occupancy measured by ChIP analysis for the following SNPs: FLT1 C-677T, TLR8&#xD;
      rs3761624 and RMM1 rs1465952; (2) to measure apoptosis by Annexin V-PI assay for p53&#xD;
      rs1042522 SNPs; (3) to examine the cell cycle profile analysis (FACS) by cytofluorometry for&#xD;
      p53 rs1042522SNPs; and (4) to determine DNA repair using Pulse Field Electrophoresis Gel&#xD;
      (TAFE gels) for the following p53 rs1042522SNPs. Furthermore, the association between the&#xD;
      SNPs of interest and phenotypic characteristics will be explored using the EPR health and&#xD;
      exposure survey to identify significant genotype-phenotype associations in the EPR&#xD;
      population. The effect of the associations will be tested on lymphocyte function after&#xD;
      exposure to Nutlin or doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have established that p53 can greatly alter expression of many immune genes including most&#xD;
      of the toll-like receptor (TLR) innate immunity genes which are considered important&#xD;
      components of antiviral immunity against HIV infection. Given the unique roles of TLR&#xD;
      signaling during acute HIV-1 infection and their potential role in chronic inflammation, it&#xD;
      is important to elucidate whether TLR polymorphisms contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis and&#xD;
      variability in disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we confirmed that p53 can target the TLR8 ssRNA responsive receptor in a single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-dependent manner (rs3761624). We have shown in a human study&#xD;
      that a SNP within a p53 response element of the TLR8 promoter can strongly influence&#xD;
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated disease in infants. In addition, there are SNPs&#xD;
      in the coding region of p53 that alter the amplitude of signaling attributed to this protein.&#xD;
      Projecting these findings to HIV and AIDS, we hypothesize that p53 is a downstream effector&#xD;
      that initiates anti-proliferative innate immune responses to viruses and other pathogens,&#xD;
      establishing a new role for p53. These novel investigations will provide critical&#xD;
      understanding of the role of innate restriction factors in resistance to HIV-1 and disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, we hope the results of this study lead to discovery of important information&#xD;
      regarding the role of SNPs located in p53 and p53 response elements in human disease,&#xD;
      potentially identifying new targets for future studies.&#xD;

                       only to the study team, with the few caveats that follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All positive HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C results that are unexpected (i.e.&#xD;
        participant is not currently enrolled in the EPR as an HIV-1 seropositive under medicament&#xD;
        treatment) will be promptly communicated to the donor by the study doctor/PI or the CRU&#xD;
        Director. The participant will be referred to their physician and/or to the N.C. Department&#xD;
        of Health for confirmatory testing and counseling. As explained in detail in the attached&#xD;
        Supplement describing N.C. State Department of Health code will be followed. The state code&#xD;
        mandates reporting of positive results along with the participant s name and identifying&#xD;
        information to the N.C. Department of Public Health. Upon contracting with the testing&#xD;
        laboratory, clarification will be obtained and documented as to whether the contracted&#xD;
        laboratory or the study MD will be responsible for reporting positive results to the state&#xD;
        to avoid duplication of reporting. Upon receipt of the test results, the N.C. Department of&#xD;
        Health will contact the participant to inform them of the positive result, how to find&#xD;
        care, how to avoid infecting others, how the newly diagnosed HIV and/or hepatitis infection&#xD;
        is reported, and the importance of informing their partners at possible risk because of&#xD;
        their HIV and/or hepatitis infection. If the HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C results are&#xD;
        negative, the participant will be not be notified. However, the participant may contact the&#xD;
        research study nurse for their results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV and hepatitis B/C test results, non-reactive and reactive, will be documented&#xD;
        confidentially by the PI or study coordinator in the subject s file, and kept in a locked&#xD;
        file cabinet in the CRU Medical Records Room. In order to document the reporting procedure&#xD;
        and the time associated with the reporting process, a document has been created and placed&#xD;
        in the study specific manual (Hepatitis B/C and HIV Notification Process for Reactive&#xD;
        Results Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Healthy control participants carrying SNPs TLR8 and FLT1 who are currently taking hormonal&#xD;
        contraception (e.g. oral contraceptives, IUDs with hormones, contraceptive patches) or&#xD;
        hormone replacement therapy will be excluded from the study unless the participant has been&#xD;
        off of the hormone treatment for 1 month or longer.&#xD;
