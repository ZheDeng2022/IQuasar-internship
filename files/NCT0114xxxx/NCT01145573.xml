    <textblock>
      Women between the ages of 18 and 45 are needed for a study that looks at the effect of&#xD;
      calcium supplementation on bone health during pregnancy in black and white women. Study&#xD;
      subjects will be divided into two groups. Each group will take 2 study supplements each day,&#xD;
      the supplement will be calcium or placebo (a pill without calcium). The study involves five&#xD;
      visits to the Children's Hospital of Oakland Research Institute; each visit will be 1-2 hours&#xD;
      in length. There are 3 study visits during pregnancy and 2 in the first year after delivery.&#xD;
      At each visit you will have your blood drawn and be asked questions about what you eat and&#xD;
      what type of activities you do. At visit 16 and 36 weeks and 4 and 12 months postpartum you&#xD;
      will have your bone density measured. You will be paid $240 for completing the study.&#xD;
