  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a quality improvement intervention to improve the&#xD;
      ability of health care providers to deliver an important preventive health service (CT&#xD;
      screening) in order to meet the goal of universal CT screening for young women age 25 or&#xD;
      younger as recommended by the CDC and virtually all major health organizations. This novel&#xD;
      approach utilizes a bilingual (English-Spanish) computer kiosk module to deliver education&#xD;
      about CT and allow patients to request a CT screening test. This module should significantly&#xD;
      increase CT screening among at risk women (18-25yo) attending urgent care clinics and&#xD;
      emergency departments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) remains epidemic among sexually young adult and adolescent females&#xD;
      especially ethnic minority women. Despite recommendations for at least annual screening of&#xD;
      all sexually active women up to age 25, CT screening rates remain low. Most young women do&#xD;
      not regularly attend primary care clinics where preventive care such as CT screening should&#xD;
      be done; and clinicians lack time and comfort to address CT screening during the context of&#xD;
      an urgent care or emergency department visit. This proposed study takes advantage of a&#xD;
      &quot;missed opportunity&quot; for screening these at-risk young women for CT when they come in contact&#xD;
      with the health care system during an urgent care or emergency department visit. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to conduct a quality improvement intervention, to improve the ability of&#xD;
      health care providers to deliver an important preventive health service (CT screening) in&#xD;
      order to meet the goal of universal CT screening recommended by virtually all major health&#xD;
      organizations. CT screening should be done as a routine part of health care but currently is&#xD;
      not. In this study, we will help providers do what they should already be doing using this&#xD;
      novel health care delivery approach. In this study, we created and are evaluating a bilingual&#xD;
      (English-Spanish) computer kiosk module to increase CT screening among at risk English and&#xD;
      Spanish speaking women (18-25 yo) attending urgent care clinics and emergency departments&#xD;
      (ED). This computer technology will be able to conduct many of the steps necessary for CT&#xD;
      screening including assessing clients' CT risk and prompting the client and health care&#xD;
      professionals for CT urine specimen collection. This study will also examine the extent to&#xD;
      which this computer kiosk module intervention use is acceptable and feasible among both&#xD;
      English and Spanish speaking young women, and health care professionals who care for them in&#xD;
      urgent care and ED settings. This type of intervention to improve CT screening is potentially&#xD;
      translatable to a wide variety of health delivery settings as it is not dependent on staff&#xD;
      time, motivation or skill to assess sexual history in the busy urgent care setting. This&#xD;
      project also supports current recommendations of Healthy People 2010, the U.S. Preventive&#xD;
      Services Task Force and other professional organizations to screen all sexually active young&#xD;
      adult females at least annually for CT to address this important public health problem&#xD;
      especially among our young ethnic minority women who carry the largest STI disease burden.&#xD;
      Early detection through routine CT screening coupled with appropriate treatment of CT&#xD;
      infections can eliminate widespread infection and prevent such major reproductive morbidity.&#xD;
