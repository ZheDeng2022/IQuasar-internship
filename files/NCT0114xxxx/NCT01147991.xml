      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective&#xD;
      immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with Epstein-Barr virus and cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine safety and to characterize the toxicity profile of EBNA1 C-terminal/LMP2&#xD;
           chimeric protein-expressing recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine in patients in&#xD;
           remission having been treated conventionally for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and&#xD;
           malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe changes in the frequency of functional T-cell responses to major&#xD;
           histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II-restricted epitopes within EBNA1 and&#xD;
           LMP2 in peripheral blood at sequential time-points before, during, and up to nine months&#xD;
           after the vaccination course in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in levels of EBV genome in plasma in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive EBNA1 C-terminal/LMP2 chimeric protein-expressing recombinant modified&#xD;
      vaccinia Ankara vaccine intradermally on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for immune function, biomarker, and pharmacological&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 11 and 14, and at 6&#xD;
      months and 1 year.&#xD;
