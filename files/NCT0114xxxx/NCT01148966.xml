    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of aminolevulinic acid during&#xD;
      surgery in treating patients with malignant brain tumors. Aminolevulinic acid becomes active&#xD;
      when it is exposed to a certain kind of light and may help doctors find and remove tumor&#xD;
      cells during surgery&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. Establish a safe dose for oral ALA administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Determine which of 3 ALA (aminolevulinic acid) doses (10, 20 or 30&#xD;
      mg/kg) provide optimal discrimination between normal and malignant tissue intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether or not the use of ALA (compared to comparable cases performed without&#xD;
      the aid of ALA) leads to a higher rate of gross total resection, as determined by&#xD;
      postoperative MRI scanning within 48 hour of surgery completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare time-to-progression and survival to that in comparable cases performed without&#xD;
      the aid of ALA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive aminolevulinic acid orally (PO) 4 hours before undergoing surgery. After&#xD;
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 5 and then every 8-12 weeks&#xD;
      for 27 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have clinically documented primary malignant glioma for which&#xD;
             re-resection is clinically indicated; in this instance, previous pathology slides will&#xD;
             be reviewed by University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) Neuropathology prior to&#xD;
             surgery; alternatively, patients may have imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
             [MRI] and /or computed tomography [CT] scans), which are highly indicative of a new&#xD;
             malignant glioma, for which surgical resection is clinically warranted; the&#xD;
             anticipated histology at resection should include: glioblastoma, gliosarcoma,&#xD;
             anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma&#xD;
             (mixed glioma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy is not a consideration in protocol entry; patients with recurrence of&#xD;
             known malignant gliomas are eligible following UWMC neuropathology slide review&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy is not a consideration for protocol entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt;&#xD;
             2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ALA on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy is not an exclusion criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ALA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Personal or family history of porphyrias&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ALA is of unknown teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ALA, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ALA&#xD;
