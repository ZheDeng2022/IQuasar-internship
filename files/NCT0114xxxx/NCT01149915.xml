    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity, safety and tolerability of TH-302 in patients with acute leukemias, advanced phase&#xD;
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), high risk myelodysplastic syndromes, advanced&#xD;
      myelofibrosis or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor hypoxia has been associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Brown et&#xD;
      al, 2004; Boyle 2006). TH-302, a hypoxia activated prodrug (HAP), exploits the hypoxic nature&#xD;
      of tumors while having little or no effect on normal tissue. TH-302 belongs to a class of&#xD;
      alkylating agents called oxazaphosphorines which have major experimental and clinical&#xD;
      activity (Brock 1989). Since TH-302 is selectively targeted to the hypoxic microenvironment,&#xD;
      this agent may represent an improvement over other agents in this class. Preclinical data&#xD;
      support the hypothesis that TH-302 targets hypoxic regions of tumors and also is able to kill&#xD;
      other tumor cells in normoxic regions as a result of cytotoxin diffusion, leading to&#xD;
      significant effects on tumor growth. Preclinical data has shown that TH-302 has anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity in multiple myeloma cells in vivo and in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional preclinical data demonstrated the marked expansion of the hypoxic bone marrow&#xD;
      areas in diseased mice with ALL. These results suggest that this agent may be useful in&#xD;
      treating advanced leukemias. The drug is stable in plasma and liver, does not appear to be at&#xD;
      risk for drug-drug interactions, and has mild, reversible toxicities. In this dose-escalation&#xD;
      study, patients with advanced leukemias will receive infusions of TH-302 to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;

    <description>TH-302 will be administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion daily for 5 days every 21 days. Patients who successfully complete a 3-week treatment cycle without evidence of significant treatment-related toxicity or clinically significant progressive disease will continue to receive treatment for up to six cycles.</description>
