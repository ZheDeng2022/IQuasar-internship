  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute leukemias are commonly seen in elderly and have no effective therapy. In recent years,&#xD;
      small molecule inhibitors have shown a tremendous promise in cancer treatment such as chronic&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia and lung cancer. Thus, in this proposal, we intend to use our novel patented&#xD;
      &quot;indole&quot; compound to conjugated with hydroxamic acid in histone deacetylases inhibitor,&#xD;
      suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and further modify its structure to generate novel&#xD;
      small-molecule anticancer compounds. By screening acute leukemic cell lines, we will look for&#xD;
      compounds that have shown potential for future drug development. In our preliminary studies,&#xD;
      we have identified a novel compound, MPT0E001, to have marked growth inhibitory activity,&#xD;
      induce apoptosis and downregulate c-Myc protein level. We intend to use MPT0E001 as a basis&#xD;
      to develop novel compounds and test them in multiple leukemic cell lines and primary leukemia&#xD;
      samples (Specific aim 1) and identify the mechanisms for downregulation of c-Myc and other&#xD;
      pathways such as NF-kappaB and Akt (Specific aim 2). Once we have identified the lead&#xD;
      compounds, we will use murine model to assess the acute toxicity profiles in different dose&#xD;
      ranges and examine the effects of blood counts and vital organs. After toxicity study, we&#xD;
      will test the lead compounds using in vivo xenogenic murine model using both cell lines and&#xD;
      primary leukemia. Using this approach, we hope to develop novel compounds that are able to be&#xD;
      used in future leukemic therapy.&#xD;
