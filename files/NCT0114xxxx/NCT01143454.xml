      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are interested in studying individuals who have known or suspected metabolic or&#xD;
      genetic diseases that put them at a high risk for heart diseases or diseases of their blood&#xD;
      vessels. To improve the results of the study, both affected and nonaffected individuals will&#xD;
      be asked to provide blood and other samples and will undergo tests to evaluate heart and lung&#xD;
      function. Nonaffected individuals will include relatives of affected individuals and healthy&#xD;
      nonrelated volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study individuals who have or are at risk for cardiovascular diseases, as well as their&#xD;
      unaffected relatives and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 1 and 100 years of age. Participants may be healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      individuals with cardiovascular diseases, or unaffected relatives of individuals with&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have some or all of the following tests, as directed by the study&#xD;
           researchers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photography of the face and full body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiography, including chest or limb x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic stress testing to study heart and muscle function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography to study heart function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, including cardiovascular MRI, angiography, and&#xD;
           contrast MRI, to study heart function and performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography (CT) angiogram to obtain images of the heart and lungs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to study possible fat infiltration of the&#xD;
           heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six-minute walk test to study heart, lung, and muscle function and performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular ultrasound to study blood vessel walls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, tissue, and other specimens will be collected for research and testing, and will&#xD;
           be taken either as part of the clinical study or during surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up studies may be performed under separate research protocols.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to characterize the etiology and natural history of rare and uncommon diseases,&#xD;
      both known and unknown that present with symptoms and signs associated with the risk of overt&#xD;
      or potential cardiovascular dysfunction. We will also study rare genetic modifiers and&#xD;
      identify novel disease mechanisms contributing to common cardiovascular diseases. In so&#xD;
      doing, we will expand our knowledge about these disorders and provide access to subjects of&#xD;
      interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Individual subjects seen under this&#xD;
      protocol may initiate the establishment of specific disease-related protocols involving&#xD;
      intensive natural history studies, disease discovery and potential innovative therapeutic&#xD;
      studies. In addition to its role in investigating individuals who are of interest to the&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Branch (CB) of the NHLBI, this protocol can provide a possible avenue for&#xD;
      admitting subjects from other NIH programs such as the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the&#xD;
      Center for Human Immunology Trans-institute program or other NIH protocols where subjects&#xD;
      exhibit cardiovascular features.&#xD;
