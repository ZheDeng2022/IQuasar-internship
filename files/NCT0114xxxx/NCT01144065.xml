      The purpose of this study is to determine whether hair levels of cortisol and testosterone&#xD;
      are elevated in patients with acute MI compared to controls.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently there has been a growing interest in measuring hair cortisol and testosterone&#xD;
      levels. Hair grows approximately 1 centimeter per month, and hair analysis accurately&#xD;
      reflects long-term endogenous production of these hormones. The association of elevated hair&#xD;
      cortisol levels with chronic stress has been reported in several studies. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      have recently demonstrated higher hair cortisol levels in patients admitted with acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction compared with patients admitted for other indications (the manuscript&#xD;
      has recently been submitted for publication). Nevertheless it is still not clear whether hair&#xD;
      cortisol levels are a risk factor for acute coronary event or for chronic cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. In order to address this issue, further comparison of hair cortisol levels between&#xD;
      patients with acute MI and a control group of patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studied have reported that endogenous testosterone concentrations are inversely&#xD;
      associated with cardiovascular mortality and progression of atherosclerosis both in the&#xD;
      coronary and the peripheral arteries. However these studies used a single serum testosterone&#xD;
      level and therefore may not accurately represent the chronic endogenous production of this&#xD;
      hormone. It may be that the association of testosterone levels and cardiovascular disease may&#xD;
      be better evaluated using the hair technique. Nevertheless this association has not been&#xD;
      studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare hair cortisol and testosterone levels in patients admitted with acute MI to stable&#xD;
      patients with prior cardiovascular diseases or diabetes and patients with no history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the association between hair cortisol and testosterone with the burden of&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerosis. The latter will be quantified only in the AMI patients undergoing&#xD;
      coronary angiography by assessing the non culprit coronary arteries.&#xD;
