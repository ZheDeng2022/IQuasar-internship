      Many patients with intestinal failure require intestinal transplantation for survival.&#xD;
      Currently, the gold standard for diagnosing acute cellular rejection (ACR) is histological&#xD;
      examination of endoscopic biopsies, which are taken invasively and lack sensitivity. A&#xD;
      non-invasive method of monitoring for ACR is needed.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal transplantation (ITx) offers a potential means of survival for patients with&#xD;
      intestinal failure who have developed life threatening complications. Approximately 200 ITx&#xD;
      procedures are performed worldwide per year, with 2200 such procedures having been performed&#xD;
      in total, two thirds of which have been in children. Overall, patient and graft survival&#xD;
      rates have improved significantly over the past several years due to innovations in surgical&#xD;
      techniques, immunosuppression and post-transplant management. One year patient survival rates&#xD;
      approach 80-90% at experienced centers. Nonetheless, acute cellular rejection (ACR) continues&#xD;
      to pose major challenges in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the gold standard for diagnosing ACR is histological examination of biopsy samples&#xD;
      obtained at the time of endoscopy. Limitations include the fact that endoscopy is by&#xD;
      definition invasive, costly, associated with risks of bleeding, infection, or perforation,&#xD;
      and potentially inaccurate. ACR can present as a patchy process which may be missed by&#xD;
      endoscopic surveillance up to 30% of the time. It also presents in a similar fashion to&#xD;
      infection, leading to a diagnostic dilemma as to the optimal management of the patient. Such&#xD;
      delays and inaccuracies in the diagnosis and management of ITx recipients have the potential&#xD;
      to lead to patient and graft loss. New noninvasive techniques to monitor for ACR are clearly&#xD;
      needed to continue to drive the field of ITx forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteomics allows the identification of proteins as possible biomarkers. Protein profiles can&#xD;
      be easily detected in body fluids, making these protein combinations potentially innovative&#xD;
      biomarkers useful in diagnosis or disease monitoring. Following protein and metabolite levels&#xD;
      may prove to be an accurate screening tool for patients suspected of having ACR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we use high-throughput proteomic analysis and candidate immunoassay protein&#xD;
      detection of ostomy effluents to search in a non-invasive manner for molecular profiles of&#xD;
      epithelial stress and innate immunity during ACR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are managed with tacrolimus-based triple immunosuppression. Our standard&#xD;
      immunosuppression regimen includes induction with an interleukin-2 receptor antagonist such&#xD;
      as daclizumab or basiliximab, versus rabbit antithymocyte globulin. Maintenance therapy&#xD;
      consists of tacrolimus, corticosteroids, and mycophenolate mofetil. Target tacrolimus trough&#xD;
      levels are 10-15 ng/mL. Sirolimus is used as a rescue agent and as part of a renal sparing&#xD;
      regimen. ACR is diagnosed by histopathology and treated with high dose steroids. In patients&#xD;
      with severe ACR, ATG is used as a rescue agent. In highly sensitized patients or patients&#xD;
      suspected of antibody mediated rejection, a combination of plasmapheresis, Rituximab and IVIG&#xD;
      is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTESTINAL SURVEILLANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol biopsies of the transplanted intestine are obtained once weekly beginning&#xD;
      postoperative day 7-14 for the first 3-4 weeks, then once every 2 weeks until 8 weeks after&#xD;
      ITx. Endoscopy and biopsies are also obtained for clinical symptoms indicating abnormal&#xD;
      allograft function. Multiple targeted biopsies are obtained, and paraffin-embedded sections&#xD;
      stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) are graded for ACR using standard rejection criteria&#xD;
      by one of three UCLA gastrointestinal pathologists. Abnormal results prompt further&#xD;
      endoscopic surveillance as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSTOMY EFFLUENT COLLECTION AND PROTEOMIC EVALUATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ostomy effluents are collected, immediately placed on ice, and batch processed at the UCLA&#xD;
      High Throughput Clinical Proteomics mass spectrometry core laboratory. All samples are&#xD;
      processed and analyzed in triplicate using MALDI mass spectrometry. MALDI-MS spectra are&#xD;
      converted to text files, and preprocessed using an established protocol. The preprocessed&#xD;
      MALDI data are then exported from SpecAlign and further analyzed in R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENZYME LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human HNP 1-3 is quantified in duplicate processed protein samples by an ELISA kit following&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA), using an HNP1-3 standard curve&#xD;
      constructed for each plate. Protein concentrations are also determined for each test sample&#xD;
      (BCA, Pierce Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), and HNP1-3 levels normalized to total protein&#xD;
      (pg/mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For IHC, biopsy sections are deparaffinized, blocked for background peroxidase activity and&#xD;
      goat antibody binding by standard methods, and stained with human anti-HNP 1-3 antibody&#xD;
      (rabbit, 1:2000) or pre-immuned serum (rabbit, 1:2000) as negative control. The sections are&#xD;
      further incubated with an anti-Rabbit IgG biotinylated secondary antibody and&#xD;
      streptavidin-peroxidase conjugated tertiary antibody from the Vectastain Elite ABC kit&#xD;
      (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and developed by&#xD;
      diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) substrate solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For IHC&#xD;
      quantitation, 10 crypts in three different fields on the biopsy slide are evaluated for&#xD;
      evidence of significant defensin staining. The number of defensin positive crypts are counted&#xD;
      and averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LUMINEX:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An aliquot of processed ostomy effluent is used for Luminex evaluation, with the Bio-Rad&#xD;
      human cytokine 17-plex assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules,&#xD;
      CA). Data is acquired on a Bio-Plex 200 system and analyzed with associated software&#xD;
      (Bio-Rad), and cytokine concentrations are normalized to protein concentration and log&#xD;
      transformed.&#xD;
