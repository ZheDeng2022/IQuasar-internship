  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide new and important information regarding parental knowledge and&#xD;
      attitudes of confidential STI and related health care services (prevention, diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment) for teens that may be needed to address the STI epidemic. Using both qualitative&#xD;
      and quantitative methods, this study will gather information necessary to develop effective&#xD;
      interventions aimed at the often neglected parent component of the teen-parent-health care&#xD;
      provider partnership by giving parents knowledge and skills to help them facilitate their&#xD;
      adolescent's access to confidential STI services as needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Teens' access to confidential services for sexually transmitted infections (STI's) has been&#xD;
      assured over time by privacy protections established through statutory and policy routes.&#xD;
      Yet, the STI epidemic among youth persists, in part , because many STI's are largely&#xD;
      asymptomatic, remain undetected and continue to be transmitted unknowingly. Also, many teens&#xD;
      are reluctant to obtain STI services due to embarrassment, fear of disclosure, lack of&#xD;
      knowledge about STI diagnosis/treatment, and confidential STI services. How do we bridge the&#xD;
      gap between availability and apparent lack of utilization by teens in need of confidential&#xD;
      services to prevent STI's and their long term sequelae? One strategy that has been overlooked&#xD;
      is the engagement of parents in a partnership with the teen and the provider to effectively&#xD;
      guide the developing adolescent towards becoming a responsible and confident adult consumer&#xD;
      of health services, especially regarding STI prevention and care including confidential&#xD;
      services. Before developing the parental component to a broad-based effort aimed at&#xD;
      decreasing the STI rate, especially C. trachomatis, it is important to examine parental&#xD;
      knowledge and attitudes towards confidential STI health services for teens and how these&#xD;
      might influence parental intention to facilitate their adolescent's accessing appropriate&#xD;
      preventive care for STIs. We propose a multi-method research design in 2 phases. Phase 1&#xD;
      comprises a qualitative format (focus groups and 1:1 semi-structured interviews) designed to&#xD;
      yield data on parental knowledge and attitudes about confidential STI related health care&#xD;
      services for teens. Findings from Phase 1 will then inform Phase 2, a quantitative&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey of a random sample of ethnically diverse parents of 12-17 yo teens&#xD;
      designed to examine the following questions. First, how does parental knowledge and attitudes&#xD;
      about STI confidential care for teens vary according: (a) the adolescent's age and gender;&#xD;
      and (b) the specific parental characteristics, e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, insurance&#xD;
      status, education, religiosity. Secondly, how does parental knowledge and attitudes about&#xD;
      confidential care for teens affect parental behavioral intentions to facilitate their teen's&#xD;
      gaining knowledge and skills to be able to access STI preventive confidential services. This&#xD;
      research would inform investigations how to strengthen the role of parents and encourage&#xD;
      partnerships between health care providers and parents to ultimately improve the health&#xD;
      outcomes for teens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parental knowledge of confidential care for adolescents will increase parental intention&#xD;
           to facilitate confidential care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parental knowledge of STI's will be positively associated with their perceptions of&#xD;
           their teen's susceptibility to/ severity of STI&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parental knowledge or suspicion that their adolescent is having sex will be associated&#xD;
           with perceptions that their teen is susceptibility to STIs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parental knowledge of STI's and/or knowledge/ suspicion adolescent is having sex will be&#xD;
           associated with parental intention to facilitate confidential care&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Perceived susceptibility/severity of their teen to STI will be associated with a greater&#xD;
           intention to facilitate confidential care&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Perceived benefits of confidential care will be associated with an greater intention to&#xD;
           facilitate confidential care&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Perceived risks/barriers to confidential care (e.g., logistical/billing; busy practice,&#xD;
           no policy/time for provider to see teen alone; perceived increase risky teen behavior&#xD;
           due to such sexual health discussions) will be negatively associated with intention to&#xD;
           facilitate confidential care&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Perceived self-efficacy will be associated with an greater intention to facilitate&#xD;
           confidential care&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Past behavior/experiences regarding confidential care for parent and/or adolescent will&#xD;
           be associated with intention to facilitate confidential care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To examine parental knowledge and attitudes of confidential health services related to STI&#xD;
      care for adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine how parental knowledge and attitudes of confidentiality regarding STI and&#xD;
           related health care services vary according to parent characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine how parental knowledge and attitudes of confidentiality regarding STI and&#xD;
           related health care services vary according to child characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. To examine how parental knowledge and attitudes toward confidential STI care affects the&#xD;
      parent's behavioral intentions to support their adolescent's access to confidential care&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. To identify key mechanisms that will form the basis of an intervention to improve&#xD;
      parent-health care provider partnerships by giving parents knowledge and skills to help them&#xD;
      facilitate their adolescent's access to confidential STI services as needed&#xD;
