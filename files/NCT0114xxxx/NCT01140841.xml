      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Fipamezole&#xD;
      in adult patients with Parkinson's disease who are receiving levodopa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. While&#xD;
      treatment with dopaminergic agents like levodopa, the mainstay of treatment, is effective in&#xD;
      the early phases of the disease, their benefits decrease with disease progression, and&#xD;
      problems such as dyskinesia and on-off phenomenon begin to manifest. In this study,&#xD;
      fipamezole, a new antagonist of an adrenergic receptor, is being investigated to better&#xD;
      understand the safety and side-effect profile in patients with Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling method used was simple random sampling.&#xD;

          3. Subject has been receiving a stable regimen of at least three daily administrations of&#xD;
             levodopa (with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor), with no dose changes for at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to Randomization (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is rated at stage 2 to 4 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If currently taking other medications (other than levodopa), subject must be on a&#xD;
             stable regimen, defined as no dose changes for at least 1 month prior to Randomization&#xD;
             (Visit 2).&#xD;
