      The purpose of this research study is to determine in heartburn patients with nonerosive&#xD;
      disease if detecting the presence of a fragment of the protein e-cadherin in esophageal&#xD;
      epithelium or the amount of fragments of e-cadherin in blood can be used to monitor healing&#xD;
      of esophagitis treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      presence of fragments of e-cadherin in esophageal epithelium or the amount of fragments of&#xD;
      e-cadherin in blood can you useful as a biomarker for the healing of esophagitis in patients&#xD;
      successfully treated with a PPI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The symptom of heartburn was once a reliable indicator of gastroesophageal reflux disease&#xD;
      (GERD) and as such patients would predictably respond to acid inhibition. In the post-proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor (PPI) world, neither of these statements is true since many patients&#xD;
      presenting with heartburn have symptoms mediated by mechanisms unrelated to esophageal&#xD;
      luminal acidity, e.g. functional disease, visceral hypersensitivity or activation of&#xD;
      esophageal stretch receptors. Consequently these subjects fail to respond to PPIs[1-3]. Since&#xD;
      PPI-responsive and PPI-refractory patients with heartburn are indistinguishable by history,&#xD;
      it is difficult to determine which PPI-unresponsive subjects may respond to higher doses of a&#xD;
      PPI. Additionally, when subjects do respond to PPI therapy, symptom response may not&#xD;
      correlate with lesion healing, making a systemic marker of healing highly desirable. Lesion&#xD;
      healing is particularly problematic since the histopathologic lesion that correlates best&#xD;
      with heartburn is the presence of dilated intercellular spaces (DIS) within esophageal&#xD;
      epithelium, which cannot be detected by with standard endoscopy, and is most reliably&#xD;
      demonstrable by performing transmission electron microscopy[4-7]. Consequently, it would be&#xD;
      desirable to have an objective marker of acid-mediated injury to esophageal epithelium that&#xD;
      could identify those with PPI-responsive heartburn and determine healing of acid-damaged&#xD;
      epithelium non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIS in esophageal epithelium has been established as an early histopathologic feature of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This electron microscopic lesion is present in both&#xD;
      erosive and nonerosive forms of GERD and results from acid damage to the intercellular&#xD;
      junctional complex that controls paracellular permeability within esophageal epithelium[8].&#xD;
      Further, it is known that treatment with PPIs results in resolution of DIS along with that of&#xD;
      heartburn in patients with both erosive and nonerosive types of GERD[9]. E-cadherin is a&#xD;
      protein which forms the intercellular adhesive bridge of the zonula adherens (ZA)[10]; and&#xD;
      the ZA plays an integral role in maintaining the integrity of the tight junction between&#xD;
      cells such that loss of adhesion between bridging molecules of e-cadherin results in loss of&#xD;
      barrier function and increased paracellular permeability[11,12]. Therefore, under conditions&#xD;
      where an acidic refluxate is present within the esophageal lumen, a 'leaky' junctional&#xD;
      barrier promotes excessive entry of hydrogen ions into and so acidification of the&#xD;
      intercellular space, which in turn triggers heartburn by activation of acid-sensitive neurons&#xD;
      within the mucosa[13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, my lab has found that DIS in non-erosive acid-damage to (rabbit) esophageal&#xD;
      epithelium is associated on Western blots with cleavage of the intercellular portion of&#xD;
      e-cadherin and that this cleavage occurs by acid activation of an endogenous proteolytic&#xD;
      process (unpublished observations). Moreover, this same phenomenon on Western blots is&#xD;
      replicated in human esophagus of patients with GERD, i.e. endoscopic biopsies of esophageal&#xD;
      epithelium reveal cleavage of e-cadherin in those with both erosive and non-erosive forms of&#xD;
      GERD but is not present within the esophageal epithelium of healthy subjects or subjects&#xD;
      without signs or symptoms of esophageal disease[14] - see Fig 4 of attached poster&#xD;
      presentation. Specifically, cleavage of e-cadherin in GERD patients leaves behind within the&#xD;
      esophageal epithelium a cytoplasmic 'C-terminal fragment (CTF)' of the molecule and this CTF&#xD;
      is readily detected on Western blot. Interestingly, the size of the CTF is consistent, as in&#xD;
      the rabbit model, with cleavage of e-cadherin by an endogenous matrix metalloprotease. Also&#xD;
      noteworthy is that the other cleaved extracellular component of e-cadherin is an 'N-terminal&#xD;
      fragment (NTF)' and this fragment is absorbed into the blood stream resulting in higher serum&#xD;
      levels of NTFs of e-cadherin than healthy subjects as detectable using a commercial ELISA&#xD;
      assay[14] - see Fig. 6 of attached poster presentation. Since CTFs on Western blot of&#xD;
      endoscopic biopsies and elevated NTFs of e-cadherin by ELISA in serum are a reflection of&#xD;
      acid-injured esophageal epithelium, this suggests the tantalizing possibility of a sensitive,&#xD;
      minimally invasive (serum) test for esophageal mucosal damage in the GERD subject. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that determination of either of the cleaved fragments of e-cadherin (serum or&#xD;
      tissue-based) can discriminate between patients with acid-mediated heartburn who are likely&#xD;
      to be PPI-responsive and those whose heartburn symptoms are not mediated by acid and so are&#xD;
      PPI-refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis will be tested by determining the presence or absence of CTFs of e-cadherin on&#xD;
      esophageal biopsy and by measuring the level of NTFs of e-cadherin in serum of&#xD;
      endoscopy-negative patients with heartburn and correlating the findings with the patient's&#xD;
      (heartburn) response to Kapidex 30 mg for 4 weeks. Based on effective heartburn control on&#xD;
      Kapidex or lack thereof, patients will be classified as having PPI-responsive or&#xD;
      PPI-refractory disease, respectively, and these classifications correlated with presence or&#xD;
      absence of CTFs on pretreatment biopsy and pretreatment serum level of NTFs of e-cadherin.&#xD;
      Also, after 4 weeks of Kapidex, repeat serum specimens for NTFs are obtained from all treated&#xD;
      patients to determine, as a marker of healing, whether the serum level of NTFs post-treatment&#xD;
      are significantly lower than pretreatment serum level of NTFs in those that have&#xD;
      PPI-responsive heartburn but not in those that have PPI-refractory heartburn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study are expected to show that patients with PPI-responsive heartburn&#xD;
      have CTFs of e-cadherin in tissue and higher levels of NTFs of e-cadherin in serum at&#xD;
      baseline, and that these levels decrease after successful PPI therapy. In contrast, because&#xD;
      symptoms in PPI-refractory subjects are not acid-mediated, these subjects are expected to&#xD;
      lack CTFs in tissue and to have lower levels of NTFs in serum at baseline compared to&#xD;
      PPI-responsive patients, and these levels will remain unchanged after PPI therapy.&#xD;
      Consequently, such findings would establish detection of cleaved fragments of e-cadherin in&#xD;
      tissue and blood as useful biomarkers of disease that can identify those with heartburn that&#xD;
      are responsive to standard doses of Kapidex. The results are also expected to show that&#xD;
      patients with PPI-responsive heartburn, but not those with PPI-refractory heartburn, have a&#xD;
      significant decline in the level of NTFs in serum post-treatment and that this lower level of&#xD;
      NTFs is expected to fall within the range of controls. Consequently, such findings would&#xD;
      establish that detection of serum NTFs before and after treatment can be useful as a&#xD;
      biomarker of (microscopic) lesion healing in those with PPI-responsive heartburn. Such&#xD;
      findings might help select sub-groups appropriate for more intensive (higher dose) or long&#xD;
      term PPI therapy.&#xD;
