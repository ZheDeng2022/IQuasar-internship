  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gamma-secretase inhibitor&#xD;
      RO4929097 when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. Gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving gamma-secretase inhibitor&#xD;
      RO4929097 together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile and establish the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 in combination with gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 when given&#xD;
      in combination with gemcitabine hydrochloride and to correlate the pharmacokinetic profile&#xD;
      with toxicity and biological activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the antitumor activity of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate the expression of biomarkers of Notch signaling in archival tumor tissue&#xD;
      with antitumor activity of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10,&#xD;
      15-17, and 22-24 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma and blood samples may be collected periodically for pharmacokinetic studies and&#xD;
      biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 1 month for up to 1 year.&#xD;
