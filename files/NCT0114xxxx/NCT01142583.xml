    <textblock>
      The Canadian Multiple Sclerosis Working Group (CMSWG) has developed practical recommendations&#xD;
      on how neurologists can assess the status of subjects on disease modifying drugs (DMDs) and&#xD;
      decide when it may be necessary to modify treatment in order to optimize outcomes. These&#xD;
      recommendations are based on relapses, disease progression as measured by the Expanded&#xD;
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS) or EDSS progression, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      outcomes. The CMSWG agreed to compare post-treatment relapse rates and severity to baseline&#xD;
      rates and severity in each individual subject. The recommended minimum baseline reference&#xD;
      time frame needed to assess relapse rate was 2 years prior to treatment initiation. The&#xD;
      objective and prospective relapse data should be ideally collected during this reference&#xD;
      period. The CMSWG recommended that the following should be taken into consideration when&#xD;
      assessing relapse severity: the effect of the relapse on activities of daily living (ADL),&#xD;
      the type and number of systems involved (i.e., relapses that are polysymptomatic or that&#xD;
      affect the cerebellar/motor systems tend to be more severe), and whether or not a course of&#xD;
      corticosteroids was required. The CMSWG also recommended that, prior to considering treatment&#xD;
      modification on the basis of progression in disability, progression should be confirmed at 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CMSWG's Treatment Optimization Recommendations (TORs) have been retrospectively applied&#xD;
      to the 4 year data set from the PRISMS study. Applying the model to subjects after their&#xD;
      first year on therapy allowed for accurate prediction of continued disease activity in the&#xD;
      form of relapses in the majority of subjects who actually experienced ongoing attacks. The&#xD;
      model was less effective in predicting disability progression, but this may well have been&#xD;
      due to the low numbers of subjects on treatment progressing over the study period. This&#xD;
      observational study used the TOR model to identify subjects as either candidates for therapy&#xD;
      optimization or as candidates to maintain current therapy. All subjects were then followed&#xD;
      prospectively until re- assessment will be done with this model.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) and is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young&#xD;
      adults. The neuropathology of the disease is marked by accumulation of leukocytes in the CNS,&#xD;
      oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal atrophy, and neuronal loss. Clinically it is&#xD;
      characterized by multi-focal recurrent attacks of neurological symptoms and signs with&#xD;
      variable recovery and eventually, the majority of subjects develop a progressive clinical&#xD;
      course of MS. The exact cause of MS is unknown, although an autoimmune process has been&#xD;
      implicated. Genetic susceptibility plays a role in disease initiation but unidentified&#xD;
      environmental factors may also be involved. Three clinical forms of MS are recognized:&#xD;
      primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), secondary progressive multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (SPMS) and RRMS. Primary progressive subjects are characterized by slow and steady&#xD;
      accumulation of neurological deficits from onset without superimposed attacks. Subjects with&#xD;
      RRMS have exacerbations or relapses with subsequent variable recovery (remission). Secondary&#xD;
      progressive multiple sclerosis is characterized by the steady accumulation of significant and&#xD;
      persistent neurological deficit with or without superimposed relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In approximately 90% of subjects, the first presentation of MS is an acute, usually&#xD;
      reversible episode of CNS dysfunction, referred to as Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS).&#xD;
      With the advent of MRI, it has become possible to reasonably predict the clinical course of&#xD;
      CIS subjects presenting with abnormal MRI findings. The first 5 year follow up study of CIS&#xD;
      subjects presenting with abnormal MRI demonstrated a trend for those with more lesions to&#xD;
      develop clinically definite MS (CDMS) more frequently, with 92% of those with 4-10 T2 lesions&#xD;
      developing CDMS compared to 67% of those with 2-3 T2 lesions. It is also well established&#xD;
      that the vast majority of CIS subjects continue to experience ongoing demyelinating disease&#xD;
      activity, as evidenced by MRI, even in the absence of a clinical conversion to CDMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of the disease modifying drugs (DMDs) for MS has had a significant impact on&#xD;
      the management of those living with this disease. These DMDs are the first agents that have&#xD;
      been shown to alter the natural course of relapsing MS. Although there is evidence that the&#xD;
      DMDs significantly reduce disease activity, these agents are not &quot;cures&quot; for MS. Thus, many&#xD;
      subjects with MS continue to experience disease activity, in spite of treatment with DMDs,&#xD;
      including continued relapses, progressive impairment, and ongoing accumulation of MRI disease&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if application of the TOR influences clinicians' decisions regarding DMD&#xD;
           treatment in the Canadian clinic setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the perceived utility of the TOR in the DMD treatment decision making&#xD;
           process in the Canadian clinic setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the proportion of subjects meeting a medium or high level of concern&#xD;
           according to the TOR in the Canadian Clinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a non-interventional, open-label, observational, multicentric, phase IV study.&#xD;
      Subjects were assessed according to the TOR on two occasions over a prospective 12 month&#xD;
      observation period. All subjects were assessed according to the TOR at baseline. Subjects&#xD;
      were subsequently assessed according to the TOR either at a time-point within the 12-month&#xD;
      period when treatment modification is being considered for reasons other than intolerance or&#xD;
      at the end of the 12-month observational period. Treatment decisions after each TOR&#xD;
      assessment was noted, and perceptions on the utility of the TOR in the decision making&#xD;
      process was captured. Additional feedback on the TOR was collected at the end of the&#xD;
      observational period through a separate evaluation questionnaire. The assessments that were&#xD;
      carried out at baseline and subsequent visits included EDSS history/current status, relapse&#xD;
      history/current status, MRI history/current status, cognitive history/current status (if&#xD;
      done) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) history/current status (if done).&#xD;
