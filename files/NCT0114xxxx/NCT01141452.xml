  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and direct&#xD;
      healthcare costs of managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary care&#xD;
      patients with evidence of COPD who either initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, or&#xD;
      have an increase in their ICS dose, as hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) beclometasone dipropionate&#xD;
      (BDP) (hereafter Qvar®), CFC-BDP (hereafter BDP) and fluticasone propionate (FP) via&#xD;
      pressurised metered-dose inhalers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current asthma guidelines in the UK are underpinned by evidence derived from randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs). Although RCT data are considered the gold standard, patients&#xD;
      recruited to asthma RCTs are estimated to represent less than 10% of the UK's asthma&#xD;
      population. The poor representation of the asthma population is due to a number of factors,&#xD;
      such as tightly-controlled inclusion criteria for RCTs. There is, therefore, a need for more&#xD;
      representative RCTs and real-life observational studies to inform existing guidelines and&#xD;
      help optimise asthma outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short randomised trials have shown that Qvar is at least as effective as FP pMDI and as BDP&#xD;
      pMDI at half the prescribed dose in patients with asthma. There is also evidence to suggest&#xD;
      that, in adults, HFA formulation as used by Qvar (featuring BDP in solution rather than&#xD;
      suspension) may achieve 10-fold higher deposition compared with CFC-BDP.4 Furthermore,&#xD;
      deposition in the peripheral regions is higher compared with CFC-BDP and the fine-particle&#xD;
      formulation also offers greater tolerance of poor co-ordination of breathing and inhaler&#xD;
      actuation, resulting in lower oro-pharyngeal deposition compared with CFC-BDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of the efficacy of ICS monotherapy in COPD remains mixed at this time. While Qvar&#xD;
      and ICS monotherapy use in the treatment of COPD is currently off-label, it occurs in&#xD;
      clinical practice in two common scenarios:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. before a diagnosis of COPD is made&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. unlicensed use as monotherapy, or in combination with long-acting bronchodilators&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis, therefore, is that Qvar treatment in COPD may be associated with&#xD;
      improved disease management and control (as assessed by effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      direct healthcare costs of managing COPD) compared with other commonly used ICS therapies,&#xD;
      namely BPD and FP, by virtue of its improved deposition throughout the lungs and the small&#xD;
      airways.&#xD;
