  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects this new drug foretinib has on this&#xD;
      type of breast cancer, called &quot;triple negative&quot; breast cancer because the cancer tissue is&#xD;
      estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptor negative.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because there is no treatment that will cure this type of cancer.&#xD;
      Although some types of chemotherapy can cause this cancer to shrink for a time, better&#xD;
      options are needed.&#xD;
