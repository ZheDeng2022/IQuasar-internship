  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of&#xD;
      RO4929097 when given together with exemestane and to see how well it works compared to&#xD;
      exemestane alone in treating premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone&#xD;
      therapy using exemestane may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body&#xD;
      makes. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Giving exemestane together with RO4929097 may kill more breast cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum-tolerated dose of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) in&#xD;
      combination with exemestane in pre- and postmenopausal patients with estrogen&#xD;
      receptor-positive (ER+) advanced or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine&#xD;
      the progression-free survival of patients treated with exemestane with vs without RO4929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the overall tumor response rate in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. III. Determine&#xD;
      the safety of these regimens in these patients. IV. Determine the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      treated with these regimens. V. Identify biomarkers of response to treatment or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor&#xD;
      RO4929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral exemestane once daily on days 1-21 and oral gamma-secretase inhibitor&#xD;
      RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to menopausal status (pre- vs postmenopausal) and visceral&#xD;
      disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive exemestane as in phase I and oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097&#xD;
      at the MTD determined in phase I. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive exemestane as in arm I. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to exemestane, pre-menopausal patients receive goserelin subcutaneously every 28&#xD;
      days. Patients may undergo blood and tissue sample collection for correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may complete quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and periodically during&#xD;
      study using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Breast Cancer (FACT-B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
