      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Glucocorticoids are primary stress response hormones released from the adrenal gland when&#xD;
      an individual is under stress. Chronic or ongoing elevation of these hormones due to&#xD;
      prolonged stress or medical treatments can have numerous harmful effects. Researchers are&#xD;
      interested in learning more about how these hormones affect cell growth, development, and&#xD;
      death. To study glucocorticoid hormones, researchers plan to use the medication&#xD;
      dexamethasone, which affects the parts of cells that respond to glucocorticoid hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study glucocorticoid stress hormones in healthy individuals before and after receiving&#xD;
      dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy individuals at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must not be using certain medications that may affect the dexamethasone&#xD;
           test, including hormonal contraception, steroid-based drugs, and some antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will require an initial screening visit and a second study visit. The visits&#xD;
           are estimated to require about 1 to 2 hours of participation over a period of up to 14&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened at visit 1 with a full physical examination and medical&#xD;
           history, and an initial blood sample for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For visit 2, participants will be asked to abstain from all food and drinks except for&#xD;
           water for 12 hours before the appointment, and will take one tablet of dexamethasone 9&#xD;
           hours before the appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a second blood sample taken during visit 2, and will receive a&#xD;
           snack after the blood is drawn.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This in vivo and in vitro observational gene association study will investigate the&#xD;
      functional relevance of SNPs in the NR3C1 gene in selected populations. A subgroup of the EPR&#xD;
      will be genotyped to identify novel SNPs in the NR3C1 gene. The most promising SNPs for&#xD;
      functional relevance in in vitro assays will be examined. Individuals with and without&#xD;
      functionally relevant, novel SNPs will be recruited for further study. In part 1, lymphocytes&#xD;
      from these participants will be isolated, exposed ex vivo to corticosteroids, and gene&#xD;
      expression profiles in response to this stimulus will be compared. In part 2, in vivo effect&#xD;
      of these SNPs in steroid responsiveness will be evaluated by performing a modified low dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone suppression test comparing by genotype. The study design is innovative as a&#xD;
      gene association study in the sense that participants are recruited on the basis of genotype&#xD;
      and then the phenotype of each participant is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the study will require 48 months to complete participants study&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate in vivo the role of hGR SNPs (hGR9beta A3669B, hGR N363S) in steroid&#xD;
      responsiveness by performing a modified dexamethasone suppression test and comparing&#xD;
      responses by genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the role of hGR SNPs (hGR9beta A3669B, hGR N363S) in human steroid responsiveness&#xD;
      by comparing (across genotypes) gene expression profiles of isolated macrophages and&#xD;
      lymphocytes exposed ex vivo to corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure the change in serum cortisol levels after modified dexamethasone suppression test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure gene expression fold changes by microarray analysis after ex vivo glucocorticoid&#xD;
      exposure of macrophages and lymphocytes; validation of affected RNA (elevated or decreased&#xD;
      expression) through PCR analysis.&#xD;
