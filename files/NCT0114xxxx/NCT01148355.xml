      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple social, psychological, and environmental factors contribute to adolescents' use&#xD;
           of cigarettes. Environmental smoking cues have been shown to play an important role in&#xD;
           the maintenance of nicotine addiction and in relapse to smoking. However, few studies&#xD;
           have examined craving and cue-reactivity in adolescent smokers, even though craving&#xD;
           appears to contribute to ongoing smoking and relapse in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another factor central to addiction is the rewarding effect of drugs, or the interaction&#xD;
           between the person, the drug, and the environmental setting. However, more research is&#xD;
           needed on whether environmental cues lead to increased smoking in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the effects of smoking versus neutral cues in adolescents who smoke on (1)&#xD;
      craving, mood, and autonomic responsivity and (2) the relative reinforcing efficacy of&#xD;
      tobacco cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adolescents 12 to 17 years of age who are current smokers (at least five cigarettes per day&#xD;
      for the past 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve three study visits. Participants will be allowed to smoke before&#xD;
           all study sessions and will give a breath carbon monoxide (CO) sample before all&#xD;
           sessions. Participants must not use any illicit drugs or alcohol 24 hours before&#xD;
           sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 (baseline session): Participants will provide a urine sample and will be&#xD;
           familiarized with the study room and session design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 2 and 3: Participants will be connected to physiological recording devices to&#xD;
           measure heart rate, perspiration, and other physical responses. After baseline readings,&#xD;
           participants will be exposed to smoking cues at one experimental session and to neutral&#xD;
           cues at the other experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before, during, and after cue presentation, participants will complete self-report&#xD;
           measures of mood and craving and have physiological measures taken. They will then be&#xD;
           re-exposed to smoking or neutral cues and engage in a self-administration procedure to&#xD;
           examine the effect of cues on the reinforcing efficacy of cigarettes.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of smoking versus neutral cues in adolescents who smoke on 1)&#xD;
      craving, mood, and autonomic responsivity and 2) the relative reinforcing efficacy of tobacco&#xD;
      cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 adolescents who smoke at least 5 cigarettes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison-controlled, within-subjects design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During cue trials, primary measures include craving (TCQ-SF, VAS), mood (mood form, VAS), and&#xD;
      autonomic (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance) responsivity. During&#xD;
      self-administration trials, primary measures include breakpoint (final ratio completed),&#xD;
      total number of responses, and number of cigarette puffs earned and taken. Secondary measures&#xD;
      include baseline smoking history, mood, tobacco craving, smoking expectancies, nicotine&#xD;
      dependence, and urinary cotinine and 3-hydroxycotinine.&#xD;
