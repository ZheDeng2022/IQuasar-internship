  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year in the US, there is a shortage of many thousands of kidneys needed for transplant.&#xD;
      Furthermore, kidneys that are available and are transplanted often exhibit delayed or slow&#xD;
      graft function (DGF and SGF, respectively), which lowers quality of life for patients and&#xD;
      their families and requires significant additional medical care. These needs result in&#xD;
      significant but preventable human suffering and health care spending. To address these needs,&#xD;
      the investigators' project will test the use of intensive insulin therapy (IIT) in donors&#xD;
      after neurological determination of death (DNDDs) as an intervention that will decrease acute&#xD;
      kidney injury and improve renal function at the time of organ recovery. This should translate&#xD;
      into a decreased incidence of DGF and SFG in recipients receiving organs from the IIT group.&#xD;
      The investigators also expect to find a trend toward an increase in the number of organs&#xD;
      available for transplant due to better organ protection in the DNDD. Taken together, these&#xD;
      data can provide the requisite justification for a larger study that can be powered to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of IIT on increasing the number of kidneys available for transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that brain death often leads to hyperglycemia that may negatively impacts&#xD;
      the organs of DNDDs. These observations led us to conduct a retrospective study, in which the&#xD;
      investigators found that hyperglycemia in DNDDs is indeed associated with decreased terminal&#xD;
      renal function. Because it has been reported that intensive insulin therapy (ITT) is&#xD;
      renoprotective in the ICU more than conventional insulin therapy (CIT), the investigators&#xD;
      propose to evaluate the use of IIT on DNDDs to: (1) improve organ function, (2) reduce DGF in&#xD;
      recipients, and (3) possibly increase the number of kidney available for transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective observational study to document the impact of IIT on acute&#xD;
      kidney injury in DNDDS and on allograft function in recipients. DNDDs will be divided into&#xD;
      two groups: CIT and IIT. In the first study, the investigators will evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      ITT on biochemical parameters in blood samples that predict kidney health and function in&#xD;
      DNDDs. All methods used in this proposal are well documented in the literature and&#xD;
      established in the applicant's laboratory. In the investigators' second study, they will&#xD;
      compare the effects of ITT in DNDDs on graft function in allograft recipients in terms of&#xD;
      number of patients showing either DGF or SGF. Additionally, there is currently no established&#xD;
      set of advanced biochemical criteria in DNDDs for predicting kidney function in recipients.&#xD;
      The investigators will correlate the evaluated biochemical markers of kidney function and&#xD;
      health in order to possibly develop more refined methods of predicting transplant success.&#xD;
      Such a set of criteria would be useful for designing studies to systematically test&#xD;
      additional interventions in DNDDs to further improve organ function before recovery and&#xD;
      further increase the number of available organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, the results of this study may lead to new therapies that significantly&#xD;
      improve patient outcomes while significantly reducing disease associated costs. These results&#xD;
      can also set the stage for a follow on study for increasing the number of kidneys available&#xD;
      for transplant.&#xD;
