      RATIONALE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for women with stage II-III Her negative breast cancer&#xD;
      followed by Her2Bi armed activated T cells (ATCs) may significantly improve the pathologic&#xD;
      complete response (pCR) rate at the time of surgery. Arming ex vivo expanded T cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory may help the T cells kill more tumor cells when they are put back in the body.&#xD;
      Giving combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by laboratory-treated T cells before&#xD;
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II clinical trial is studying how well giving laboratory-treated T cells&#xD;
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy works in treating women with stage II or stage III breast&#xD;
      cancer undergoing surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in women with stage II-III triple-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer without a complete pathologic response (cPR) who receive a regimen of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemoT), surgery, and/or irradiation followed by 8 infusions of&#xD;
      ~10-15 x 10^9 Her2Bi-armed activated T cells (ATC) (aATC) given twice per week for 4 weeks in&#xD;
      combination with IL-2 (aldesleukin) (300,000 IU/m^2/day) and GM-CSF (sargramostim) (250&#xD;
      μg/m^2/twice per week) beginning 3 days before the 1st infusion and ending 1 week after the&#xD;
      last infusion (defined as immunotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the change from baseline (pre immunotherapy [IT]) to post-IT in specific&#xD;
      cytotoxicity and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spots (Elispots) of&#xD;
      lymphocytes in the blood directed at breast cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate if pathologic response and the changes in numbers and proportion of&#xD;
      infiltrating cells and cancer stem cells in the tumor at the time of surgery are associated&#xD;
      with progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive dose-dense AC-T regimen comprising doxorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) and cyclophosphamide IV once every 2 weeks for 4 courses&#xD;
      followed by paclitaxel IV once every 2 weeks for 4 courses or paclitaxel IV once weekly for&#xD;
      12 weeks. Or, patients receive TAC regimen comprising docetaxel IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride&#xD;
      IV, and cyclophosphamide IV once every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Treatment continues in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 3 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy, patients receive&#xD;
      Her2Bi-armed activated T cells IV over 5-30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also&#xD;
      receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning 3 days before the first T cell&#xD;
      infusion and ending 1 week after the last infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY: Patients then undergo surgical resection of the breast 2 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients may be followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
