    <textblock>
      This pilot study has a sequential design involving three groups to ensure appropriate&#xD;
      development and evaluation of the optimal procedural steps of the D-UAO device and to confirm&#xD;
      that those steps are reproducible in the hands of multiple surgeons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Group 1 - beginning with the use of the current instructions for use (IFU) will have&#xD;
           adjustments made as necessary to the D-UAO procedural steps for uterine artery occlusion&#xD;
           confirmed by 2/3-D Power Colour Doppler ultrasound (2/3DPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2 - verify that optimal D-UAO IFU procedural steps generated in Group 1 as&#xD;
           confirmed by 2/3DPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group 3 - verify that the optimal D-UAO procedural steps are reproducible in the hands&#xD;
           of multiple surgeons in addition to the group 1 investigators, as confirmed by 2/3DPD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 25-55 years with regular menses and at least one symptom related to uterine&#xD;
             fibroids (for example heavy bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed child-bearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one uterine fibroid of 3 cm diameter or greater with a prevailing pathology&#xD;
             (e.g. as opposed to adenomyosis) of fibroids determined through abdominal/transvaginal&#xD;
             ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation of the ability to clearly visualise bilateral uterine arteries with&#xD;
             2/3DPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dominant fibroid (defined as &gt;3cm in diameter) must be well vascularised as determined&#xD;
             by CE-MRI (for Group 2 and 3 patients only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to tolerate the required prolonged supine position during treatment&#xD;
             (approximately 6 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cervix suitable for tenaculum placement as determined by pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal Pap smear within the last 36 months.&#xD;

             examiner's opinion would prevent proper clamp application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known contraindications to the contrast agent to be used for the CE-MRI as&#xD;
             determined by the study radiologist (for Group 2 and 3 patients only).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of a pedunculated fibroid determined by ultrasound, hysteroscopy, or saline&#xD;
             infused sonography or CE MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any current acute or chronic systemic infection or localized pelvic infection,&#xD;
             including an unresolved urinary tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical history of any thromboembolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of gynecologic malignancy, atypical endometrial hyperplasia, or pelvic&#xD;
             inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Using anticoagulation therapy (except OTC treatments, e.g. aspirin), or has a known&#xD;
             underlying bleeding disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the investigator's opinion, any medical condition or psychiatric illness that could&#xD;
             potentially be life threatening or affect their ability to complete the study visits&#xD;
             according to this protocol.&#xD;
