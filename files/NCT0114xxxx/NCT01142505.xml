      The clinical aim of this trial is to assess whether intermittent montelukast is an effective&#xD;
      treatment strategy in preschool wheeze. The mechanisms aim of the trial is to determine&#xD;
      whether there is a genetically highly-responsive subgroup of children. In designing this&#xD;
      trial the investigators have incorporated several novel aspects. First, parents will be able&#xD;
      to adjust the use of oral montelukast to their child's symptoms. This allows the&#xD;
      investigators to recruit both &quot;episodic&quot; and &quot;multi trigger&quot; patterns of preschool wheeze -&#xD;
      and control for any change in wheeze pattern during the trial. Second, before the&#xD;
      investigators issue the trial medication, the investigators will assess children's&#xD;
      leukotriene genes, focusing primarily on a gene called ALOX5. This ALOX5 &quot;stratification&quot;&#xD;
      step will ensure that an equal number of potentially &quot;treatment-responsive&quot; children receive&#xD;
      the active drug (montelukast) and the dummy medicine - and the equal numbers will help the&#xD;
      investigators to assess the role of ALOX5. For the trial, the investigators will first&#xD;
      recruit 1,300 children with a history of preschool wheeze, then divide them into the group&#xD;
      with &quot;responsive&quot; and &quot;less responsive&quot; genes by their ALOX5 status. The investigators will&#xD;
      then issue parents with the trial medication; 50% will be given montelukast and 50% will be&#xD;
      given dummy medication. Parents will start the trial medication whenever their child develops&#xD;
      a cold, and stop the medication when wheeze resolve. Parents will also be able to give the&#xD;
      trial medication for wheeze between colds. Over the 12 month trial period, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess the number of unscheduled attendances to a medical practitioner for wheeze for&#xD;
      each child. At the end of the trial, the investigators will determine whether montelukast is&#xD;
      effective then whether there is a difference in response to montelukast between the 2 ALOX5&#xD;
      gene groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, the investigators will measure many other genes that may influence response&#xD;
      to montelukast, as well as the amount of leukotrienes that are excreted in the urine before&#xD;
      and during attacks. Using these results, the investigators will be able to both inform&#xD;
      national treatment policy, and develop new concepts on the mechanism of preschool wheeze that&#xD;
      will inform the development of new therapies. Since children will continue to receive&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; inhaled therapy, there are no ethical issues in giving a dummy medicine to half of&#xD;
      the 1300 children to be recruited. The study will be the largest trial in wheezy preschool&#xD;
      children to date, and may open up genetic testing in preschool wheeze.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quarter of all UK children will have at least one attack of wheeze during the preschool&#xD;
      period (1 to 5 years of age). Severe attacks of wheeze in these young children are usually&#xD;
      triggered by viral-colds. The majority of affected children will only wheeze with colds,&#xD;
      although these attacks may be severe and repeated resulting in GP attendances and hospital&#xD;
      admissions. This pattern of wheeze is called &quot;episodic&quot; preschool wheeze. A minority of&#xD;
      preschool children wheeze both with and between colds - a pattern that is called&#xD;
      &quot;multi-trigger&quot; preschool wheeze. In real life this distinction is blurred, with preschool&#xD;
      children changing their pattern of wheeze over time. What is clear is that asthma therapies&#xD;
      that are effective in older children with classical &quot;allergic&quot; asthma may not necessarily be&#xD;
      effective in preschool wheeze. For example, although a short-course of oral steroids is very&#xD;
      effective in treating attacks of wheeze in school age children with &quot;allergic&quot; asthma, the&#xD;
      investigators have shown in 2 major trials that a short course of oral steroids does not&#xD;
      reduce the severity of attacks of preschool wheeze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, montelukast, an oral medicine that blocks a substance (leukotriene) that narrows&#xD;
      the breathing tubes, has shown promise in preschool wheeze. However, to date, only modest&#xD;
      benefits have been reported when large groups of children have been studied. One explanation&#xD;
      for this, is that a significant proportion of preschool children do not respond to&#xD;
      montelukast, but there is a subgroup who are genetically programmed to respond very well.&#xD;
      Recent analysis of trials of montelukast suggests that this responsive subgroup may be&#xD;
      defined by variations in leukotriene-producing genes. Thus an understanding of the role of&#xD;
      leukotriene genes and leukotriene production in preschool wheeze may better target&#xD;
      montelukast treatment in this age group, and inform the development of new therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical aim of this trial is to assess whether intermittent montelukast is an effective&#xD;
      treatment strategy in preschool wheeze. The mechanisms aim of the trial is to determine&#xD;
      whether there is a genetically highly-responsive subgroup of children. In designing this&#xD;
      trial the investigators have incorporated several novel aspects. First, parents will be able&#xD;
      to adjust the use of oral montelukast to their child's symptoms. This allows us to recruit&#xD;
      both &quot;episodic&quot; and &quot;multi trigger&quot; patterns of preschool wheeze - and control for any change&#xD;
      in wheeze pattern during the trial. Second, before the investigators issue the trial&#xD;
      medication, the investigators will assess children's leukotriene genes, focusing primarily on&#xD;
      a gene called ALOX5. This ALOX5 &quot;stratification&quot; step will ensure that an equal number of&#xD;
      potentially &quot;treatment-responsive&quot; children receive the active drug (montelukast) and the&#xD;
      dummy medicine - and the equal numbers will help us to assess the role of ALOX5. For the&#xD;
      trial, the investigators will first recruit 1,300 children with a history of preschool&#xD;
      wheeze, then divide them into the group with &quot;responsive&quot; and &quot;less responsive&quot; genes by&#xD;
      their ALOX5 status. The investigators will then issue parents with the trial medication; 50%&#xD;
      will be given montelukast and 50% will be given dummy medication. Parents will start the&#xD;
      trial medication whenever their child develops a cold, and stop the medication when wheeze&#xD;
      resolve. Parents will also be able to give the trial medication for wheeze between colds.&#xD;
      Over the 12 month trial period, the investigators will assess the number of unscheduled&#xD;
      attendances to a medical practitioner for wheeze for each child. At the end of the trial, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine whether montelukast is effective then whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in response to montelukast between the 2 ALOX5 gene groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, the investigators will measure many other genes that may influence response&#xD;
      to montelukast, as well as the amount of leukotrienes that are excreted in the urine before&#xD;
      and during attacks. Using these results, the investigators will be able to both inform&#xD;
      national treatment policy, and develop new concepts on the mechanism of preschool wheeze that&#xD;
      will inform the development of new therapies. Since children will continue to receive&#xD;

      the 1300 children to be recruited. The study will be the largest trial in wheezy preschool&#xD;
      children to date, and may open up genetic testing in preschool wheeze.&#xD;
