      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an immunodeficiency disease in which white blood&#xD;
      cells are unable to kill certain bacteria and fungi. People with CGD are more likely to&#xD;
      develop recurrent life-threatening infections. Certain changes or mutations in genes&#xD;
      contribute to the severity of CGD, and also appear to affect the success of treatment with&#xD;
      interferon-gamma, a substance that is used to improve the immune system s ability to fight&#xD;
      infection. Researchers are interested in studying changes in the immune system caused by&#xD;
      interferon-gamma treatment of CGD in individuals with different mutations that cause CGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare changes in the immune system caused by interferon-gamma treatment for CGD in&#xD;
      individuals with different mutations that cause CGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals of any age who have been diagnosed with CGD and have specific types of&#xD;
      mutations that cause CGD (to be determined after testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood&#xD;
           and urine tests. Participants must weigh more than 11 kilograms (~24 pounds) to&#xD;
           participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive injections of interferon-gamma once weekly for 4 weeks, twice&#xD;
           weekly for 4 weeks, and then three times weekly for 4 weeks (a total of 24 injections).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn periodically during treatment and for 8 weeks after the treatment,&#xD;
           for a total of 21 weeks on the study. Participants will regularly provide information on&#xD;
           their symptoms and responses to treatment to the study researchers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is caused by mutations of 1 of the 4 proteins comprising&#xD;
      the NADPH oxidase that result in decreased or absent production of superoxide by phagocytes,&#xD;
      and predisposes CGD subjects to life-threatening infection. Intensive management with&#xD;
      antibiotics and antifungal agents has dramatically increased the life expectancy of subjects&#xD;
      with CGD. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which increases superoxide production by neutrophils&#xD;
      and enhances their antimicrobial activity, is an FDA approved therapy for CGD and is now the&#xD;
      standard of care. However, there is substantial variability in the biochemical and clinical&#xD;
      response to IFN gamma treatment. Recently, the specific mutations of the genes responsible&#xD;
      for causing CGD in most of the subjects followed at the NIH have been characterized. Because&#xD;
      of this, it is now known that the severity of the disease is correlated not only with&#xD;
      inheritance pattern, but also with the specific underlying mutation. It is not known,&#xD;
      however, if the biochemical response to IFN gamma therapy correlates with the specific&#xD;
      mutation as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since treatment with IFN gamma is expensive, requires frequent injections, and in some&#xD;
      subjects results in systemic side effects, it would be useful to determine whether the&#xD;
      biochemical response and systemic side effects correlate with the underlying mutation GCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that subjects with X-linked CGD due to nonsense/frameshift/RNA&#xD;
      processing/deletion mutations of the gp91phox component of the NADPH oxidase will generate a&#xD;
      smaller biochemical response to IFN gamma therapy compared to subjects with missense gp91phox&#xD;
      mutations or the autosomal recessive form of CGD that results from mutations of the p47phox&#xD;
      or p67phox components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the predictability of IFN gamma&#xD;
      responsiveness in CGD based on mutational analysis. compare the change in function of the&#xD;
      NADPH oxidase during treatment with an escalating dose of IFN gamma in subjects with CGD&#xD;
      resulting from missense or nonsense/frameshift/RNA processing/deletion gp91phox mutations or&#xD;
      mutations of p47phox or p67phox. The secondary objectives are to assess changes in superoxide&#xD;
      production, expression of NADPH oxidase components, neutrophil bactericidal capacity for&#xD;
      Staphyloccus aureus, cytokines, cell surface markers, antibodies, lymphocyte subsets,&#xD;
      constitutional symptoms , and gene expression in leukocytes from subjects with missense&#xD;
      gp91phox mutations, nonsense/frameshift/RNA processing/deletion gp91phox mutations, p47phox&#xD;
      mutations, and p67phox mutations after treatment with IFN gamma to assess changes in the&#xD;
      expression of NADPH oxidase components, cytokines, cell surface markers, antibody production,&#xD;
      production of various lymphocyte subsets, constitutional symptoms and gene expression in&#xD;
      leukocytes from these subjects following treatment with IFN gamma. This knowledge will assist&#xD;
      physicians in determining which subjects are likely to respond to full dose and alternative&#xD;
      dose therapy with IFN gamma and provide information about biochemical responses of to these&#xD;
      regimens in subjects with specific CDG gene mutations enabling them to better counsel and&#xD;
      manage subjects with CGD.&#xD;
