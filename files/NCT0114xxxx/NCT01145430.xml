      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of veliparib when given&#xD;
      together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back after a period&#xD;
      of improvement, or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Veliparib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving veliparib together with liposomal doxorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended Phase II dose of ABT-888 (veliparib) given in combination&#xD;
      with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride) (PLD -&#xD;
      40 mg/m2 every 4 weeks) in patients with ovarian or breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the toxicity profile of the ABT-888 plus PLD combination. II. To determine&#xD;
      the effects of ABT-888 on the pharmacokinetics of PLD. III. To determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      ABT-888 plus PLD in ovarian and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and pegylated liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
