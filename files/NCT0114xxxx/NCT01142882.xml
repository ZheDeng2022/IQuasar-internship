  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a&#xD;
      customized, interactive web-based HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI) and hepatitis&#xD;
      prevention intervention as compared to a traditional, educator-delivered prevention&#xD;
      intervention. Both interventions will be offered to youth enrolled in outpatient,&#xD;
      community-based substance abuse treatment at our collaborating treatment facilities. Outcomes&#xD;
      to be measured include accurate HIV/disease prevention knowledge, intentions to engage in&#xD;
      safer sex, actual HIV risk behavior, attitudes toward safer sex and self-reported substance&#xD;
      use. The web-delivered intervention under evaluation has the potential to deliver&#xD;
      evidence-based content at low cost without increasing demands on treatment staff time or&#xD;
      training needs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will examine the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a web-based&#xD;
      HIV, hepatitis and STI prevention intervention when offered to youth in outpatient,&#xD;
      community-based substance abuse treatment as directly compared to a traditional HIV (and&#xD;
      infectious disease) prevention intervention. We will assess the comparative effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of these interventions by primarily examining changes from pre- to&#xD;
      post-intervention in accurate HIV/disease prevention knowledge, intentions to engage in safer&#xD;
      sex and HIV risk behavior. Additionally, we will examine the extent to which the&#xD;
      interventions impact relevant skills acquisition (e.g., communication skills, negotiation&#xD;
      skills and condom use skills), attitudes toward safer sex and self-reported substance use, as&#xD;
      well as the acceptability of each intervention. We also plan to evaluate youth at both 1 and&#xD;
      3 month post-intervention to examine the durability of effects (including any differential&#xD;
      durability of effects across intervention conditions). The web-delivered prevention&#xD;
      intervention to be evaluated in this study has the potential to allow for a complex&#xD;
      intervention to be delivered at a low cost, without increasing demands on staff time or&#xD;
      training needs, and may thereby expand the reach of evidence-based prevention for youth in&#xD;
      substance-abuse treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at three collaborating, community-based adolescent substance&#xD;
      abuse treatment programs all of which are housed within the Daytop Village network of&#xD;
      services and are located in New York City: (1) Daytop Village's Brooklyn Outreach Center; (2)&#xD;
      Daytop Village's Bronx Outreach Center; and (3) Daytop Village's Queens Outreach Center. We&#xD;
      expect to recruit approximately one third of the total number of participants from each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 160 (no fewer than 120) adolescent participants will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two study conditions in an&#xD;
      intent-to-treat design (n=60-80 per group): (1) computer-delivered intervention or (2)&#xD;
      traditional (person-delivered intervention). Participants in the traditional prevention&#xD;
      intervention condition will complete two sessions (of approx. one hour in duration) across&#xD;
      the course of a week, conducted by a trained HIV (and infectious disease) prevention&#xD;
      educator; these sessions will typically be conducted in small groups of 2-4 participants but&#xD;
      may be offered individually. Participants in the computer-delivered intervention condition&#xD;
      will complete an interactive, web-based HIV, hepatitis and STI prevention program instead of&#xD;
      the traditional, person-delivered prevention intervention. Youth will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      customized plan of approximately 2-4 hours in length using the web-based tool; participants&#xD;
      will complete two 60-minute sessions per week until they complete their customized plan.&#xD;
      Participants will access this intervention using dedicated computer stations set up at their&#xD;
      substance abuse treatment program.&#xD;
