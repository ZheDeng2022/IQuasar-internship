    <textblock>
      The care of critically ill patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) is an important part of&#xD;
      modern health care systems. However, ICU care suffers from similar problems as the rest of&#xD;
      the health care system. Powerful arguments support the concept that most of problems in&#xD;
      complex systems, such as ICUs, relates to flaws in institutional systems and processes that&#xD;
      hinder the ability of individuals to perform their jobs well. To fix these problems, the&#xD;
      defective systems and processes must be redesigned in ways that make it easy for people to do&#xD;
      their job well, and hard to make mistakes. Altering the structure of ICU care for the purpose&#xD;
      of improving ICU performance is an example of Organizational Systems Engineering,&#xD;
      alternatively called Total Quality Management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another serious problem in ICU care is that after 2007 there will be a increasing shortage of&#xD;
      physicians specializing in the care of the critically ill (Intensivists), with a 35%&#xD;
      shortfall by 2030. One contributor to this shortage is that Intensivists retire at a younger&#xD;
      age than do physicians in general, and often curtail their care of critically ill patients&#xD;
      even before they retire. It is likely that the emotional and physical demands of this career&#xD;
      choice leads Intensivists to &quot;burn out&quot; and leave the field prematurely. For these reasons it&#xD;
      is important to find ways to make working as an Intensivist more sustainable so that the most&#xD;
      experienced practitioners will continue in the field up to a normal retirement age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The way in which groups of Intensivists organize themselves to provide care in an ICU is&#xD;
      highly variable. One potentially important way in which Intensivist staffing differs is in&#xD;
      the degree of continuity of care. The more days in a row that the same physician cares for a&#xD;
      patient the greater the continuity of care. While it is generally held that a higher&#xD;
      continuity of care results in better care and better outcomes for patients, in fact there are&#xD;
      no studies addressing this issue. On the other side of the coin however, it seems likely that&#xD;
      working many days in a row increases the physical and emotional burdens on the Intensivist,&#xD;
      increasing job distress and job burnout over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common pattern of Intensivist staffing, in which continuity of care is reduced, is when the&#xD;
      Intensivist who is caring for ICU patients during the weekdays has the weekend off, during&#xD;
      which one of his/her partners provides &quot;cross-coverage&quot;. While it is reasonable to&#xD;
      hypothesize that cross-coverage would lead to inefficient patient care, at the same time it&#xD;
      may reduce the burdens on the Intensivists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of weekend cross-coverage on both&#xD;
      ICU patients and on Intensivists. This will be a multicenter study performed in 4 member&#xD;
      institutions of the Midwest Critical Care Consortium: The University of Toledo, MetroHealth&#xD;
      Medical Center, Ohio State University, and Indiana University. Five adult medical ICUs from&#xD;
      the six institutions will participate in this study, with two ICUs from the Ohio State&#xD;
      University site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the research questions, each participating ICU will alternate between two common&#xD;
      models of Intensivist staffing. In both models an Intensivist is responsible for ICU care for&#xD;
      14 days. In the Continuous model, a single Intensivist will be responsible for all 14 days.&#xD;
      In the Discontinuous model, both weekends during the 14 days will be cross-covered by a&#xD;
      colleague. Continuity of care is higher in the Continuous model, which has 2 physician&#xD;
      transitions over a 4 week period, while the Discontinuous model has 8 transitions per 4&#xD;
      weeks. Each participating ICU will use one model for 12 weeks, then switch to the other model&#xD;
      for 12 weeks, and finally revert back to the first model for the final 12 weeks of this 36&#xD;
      week study. To address problems of historical controls, seasonal differences, and to increase&#xD;
      comparability of groups, the participating ICUs have been randomly assigned to begin the&#xD;
      study either with the Continuous or Discontinuous model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons will be made between the two scheduling models in: (1) patient outcomes,&#xD;
      specifically hospital mortality rate, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay, and&#xD;
      (2) Intensivist outcomes, specifically job distress, job burnout, and the balance between&#xD;
      work and home life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is currently nothing known about whether weekend cross-coverage influences&#xD;
      medical care, both models of care are common in ICUs. Thus the investigators expect that the&#xD;
      findings of this study will have general relevance. While the patients admitted to the&#xD;
      participating ICUs during this study would not be expected to benefit from this&#xD;
      investigation, the results derived are expected to enable policy makers to make&#xD;
      evidence-based decisions about this important aspect of ICU physician staffing and thus&#xD;
      improve the performance and/or cost-effectiveness of ICU care, benefiting future ICU&#xD;
      patients, and society.&#xD;

    <description>During the study period, each participating ICU alternated between two distinct intensivist staffing formats: (i) in the Discontinuous arm of the study, there was a weekend cross-coverage format wherein an intensivist was responsible for care for a two week or half-month block, but colleagues covered the weekends within each block, or (ii) in the Continuous arm of the study, there was an uninterrupted staffing format, wherein a single intensivist was responsible for the entire two week, or half-month, period. In each ICU the study interval was divided into three phases, so that the models alternated twice in each ICU, beginning with either the weekend cross-coverage or the uninterrupted staffing formats, the four hospitals were randomly assigned between these two patterns.</description>
