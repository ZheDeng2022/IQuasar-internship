      The study aims at determining the feasibility of using maintenance Decitabine therapy&#xD;
      following remission induction and consolidation in elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients&#xD;
      who are fit for aggressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Safety and tolerability of the decitabine regimen in the post remission state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disease-free survival - To determine the one-year disease-free survival in elderly&#xD;
           patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in complete remission treated with Decitabine&#xD;
           as post-consolidation maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Overall survival&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The median age of patients with AML at presentation is between 65 to 70 years (Peterson 1977,&#xD;
      Brincker 1985, Baudard 1994) and the incidence of AML increases with advancing age (Wingo&#xD;
      1995). Given this, increased attention should be focused on adult patients 60 years or older&#xD;
      with this disease. Treatment strategies in younger patients are well established however&#xD;
      therapy in the elderly deserves particular thought (Foon 1981, Sebban 1998, Lowenberg 1998).&#xD;
      Also progress in the treatment of AML in the elderly population is not near progress that has&#xD;
      been made in the treatment of the younger population (Stone 2002, Kantarjian 2006). Poor&#xD;
      tolerability and questionable treatment benefit have left older adult patients with AML often&#xD;
      without effective treatment options or with best supportive care. According to Medicare&#xD;
      records, only 30% of a cohort of 2657 AML patients older than 65 years were provided&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment (44% in patients 65 to 74 years, 24% in patients 75 to 84, and 6% in&#xD;
      patients 85 and above). The mortality was 86% at 1 year and 94% at 2 years following the&#xD;
      diagnosis. The overall survival in this cohort was only 2 months (Menzin 2002). The study&#xD;
      could not distinguish between intensive induction chemotherapy and palliative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite modest improvements in outcomes for younger patients with AML, adults over 55 years&#xD;
      of age (the majority of patients with AML) continue to do poorly (Tallman 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients over 60 years response rates have ranged from 40% to 55% and in patients over 70&#xD;
      years have ranged from 24% to 33% (Buchner 2009, Estey 2007, Lowenberg 1998, Rowe 2004).&#xD;
      Patient and leukemia related factors could explain the poor result of older patients with AML&#xD;
      (Harry 2007, Gupta 2005). Also in patients over 60, with adverse cytogenetics the response&#xD;
      rates range from 26% to 34%; with antecedent hematologic disorder they range between 28% and&#xD;
      46%; and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 2 it is&#xD;
      around 26%. (Grimwade 2001, Rowe 2004, Appelbaum 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the past several decades, standard induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) has consisted of the &quot;7+3&quot; regimen of cytarabine plus an anthracycline. Standard&#xD;
      consolidation chemotherapy has consisted of high dose cytarabine for 3-4 cycles. Few trials&#xD;
      have randomized older patients with AML to receive standard remission induction (i.e.,&#xD;
      anthracycline-containing) chemotherapy versus either palliative therapy or less intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The median survival of older adults with AML treated with cytarabine plus an&#xD;
      anthracycline on the &quot;7+3&quot; schedule is 8 to 12 months (Estey 2007, Rowe 2004). Less than 10%&#xD;
      of patients remain in remission for more than 3 years. (Lowenberg 1998, Godwin 2003, Roboz&#xD;
      2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) conducted a trial&#xD;
      on 60 patients and randomized them to intensive chemotherapy (daunorubicin 30 mg/m2/day&#xD;
      intravenously [IV] for 3 days, vincristine 1 mg/m2/day IV on Day 2, cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day&#xD;
      IV for 7 days with 50 mg/m2/day IV bolus every 12 hours for 7 days) or a &quot;watch and wait&quot;&#xD;
      approach (supportive care alone with hydroxyurea 3 g PO on Days 1 and 4 and LDAC&#xD;
      (subcutaneous cytarabine) 100 mg/m2 every 12 hours SC on Days 2, 3, 5, and 6 administered&#xD;
      only when leukemia-related symptoms occurred). All patients were more than 65 years old, but&#xD;
      had to have preserved organ function and performance status. The patients who received&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy had a higher complete remission (CR) rate (58% vs. 0%), lower&#xD;
      incidence of early mortality (3/31 vs. 18/29 patients), longer median survival (21 weeks vs.&#xD;
      11 weeks) and greater chance of survival at 2.5 years (17% vs. 0%). The median duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization did not statistically differ between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study performed by Tilly et al (Tilly 1990) in patients &gt;65 years old, 87 patients&#xD;
      were randomized to receive either LDAC 10 mg/m2 SC every 12 hours for 21 days or standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy induction with rubidazone (a daunorubicin-derived agent) 100 mg/m2 IV for 4 days&#xD;
      plus cytarabine 200 mg/m2 IV for 7 days. The combination chemotherapy arm was associated with&#xD;
      a 31% early death rate compared with10% in the lower dose arm. There was a higher CR rate in&#xD;
      the rubidazone/cytarabine arm (52% versus 32%), but only a trend toward improved survival&#xD;
      favoring this arm (12.8 months versus 8.8 months) was reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive cycles of high dose Cytarabine (HiDAC- 3 g/m2 ARA-C twice a day on days 1, 3, 5)&#xD;
      is an effective consolidation regimen for AML patients based on the CALGB in 1994 (Mayer&#xD;
      1994). In patients younger than 60, this protocol produced a high rate of continuous CR.&#xD;
      However in patients older than 60, a high rate of neurotoxicity was reported using this&#xD;
      regimen (Mayer 1994). A follow up study modified this protocol by using Intermediate Dose&#xD;
      Cytarabine (IDAC) (1 g/m2 ARA-C twice a day on days 1, 3, 5) and applied the regimen to a&#xD;
      group of elderly patients (â‰¥60 years) with de novo AML. This protocol (IDAC) was found to be&#xD;
      an effective and well-tolerated consolidation regimen for elderly patients (Sperr 2004).&#xD;
      Based on this study the median overall survival, disease-free survival, and continuous CR&#xD;
      were 10.6, 15.5, and 15.9 months, respectively (Sperr 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, from the data obtained in these studies, chemotherapy in some form is superior to best&#xD;
      supportive care alone or best supportive care with chemotherapy initiated after evidence of&#xD;
      disease progression. However no single treatment approach appears adequate and can be&#xD;
      considered the standard of care for elderly AML patients. Thus, improved treatment strategies&#xD;
      and more suitable chemotherapy regimens are needed (Harry 2007). Additionally, it is not&#xD;
      clear how best to administer chemotherapy with currently available drugs, taking into account&#xD;
      induction and consolidation treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several different categories of new therapies are under development, including multidrug&#xD;
      resistance (MDR) reversal agents, immunomodulatory therapies, and signal transduction&#xD;
      targeting. Table 1 shows examples of targets and agents developed and being developed. Given&#xD;
      the lack of standards in the treatment of elderly AML, of the use of these newer agents in&#xD;
      treating AML is justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Targets for New Agents for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (Medscape.com) Targets Agents&#xD;
      CD33 Gemtuzumab ozogamicin CD45 131I-anti-CD45 MDR1/Pgp Cyclosporine, PSC-833 Angiogenesis&#xD;
      and/or VEGF Thalidomide, SU-5416, bevacizumab antibodies Hypermethylated chromatin Decitabine&#xD;
      Histone deacetylase Phenylbutyrate trichostatin A, trapoxin Bcl-2 Bcl-2 antisense S-phase&#xD;
      checkpoint UCN-01 20S proteasome PS-341 Tyrosine kinase (c-kit receptor) STI-571 Flt-3 kinase&#xD;
      CEP-701 Farnesyl transferase BMS-214662, R115777&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sizeable percentage of older adults attain a complete remission with induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy, but almost all of these patients will relapse within a median of four to eight&#xD;
      months unless given additional cytotoxic therapy (Cassileth 1999). Even with post-remission&#xD;
      therapy, relapses are common. Furthermore, post-remission therapy in older adults is&#xD;
      complicated by high rates of treatment related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the problem of post-remission therapy, the Nordic MDS group performed a phase II&#xD;
      multicenter study, which studied long-term maintenance with azacitidine. They studied&#xD;
      patients with high-risk MDS and AML arising from MDS. The mean age of the group was 68 years.&#xD;
      Patients who achieved CR after induction received low dose azacitidine sq 5 out of 28 days&#xD;
      until relapse. They noted a median CR duration of 13.5 months and noted very mild side&#xD;
      effects (Grovdal 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another phase II trial Decitabine was used for untreated AML patients older than 60 who&#xD;
      were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (or who refused it). PS was ECOG &lt;3. All pts&#xD;
      received induction with Decitabine at 20mg/m2 IV on days 1-10 of a 4 week cycles. Patients&#xD;
      with persistent AML at the end of a cycle received a repeat of the 10 day course, but&#xD;
      responding patients received maintenance with shortened courses of 3-5 days depending on the&#xD;
      degree and duration of neutropenia. Forty two percent of patients achieved CR. Median OS has&#xD;
      not yet been reached; median f/u of 19 surviving patients was 8 months. The median number of&#xD;
      cycles received till the date of publication was five (Blum 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One retrospective study studied 141 elderly AML patients in first CR after 7+3 induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In patients aged 60-70 year, consolidation Â± maintenance therapy improved&#xD;
      outcomes (DFS and OS). In patients older than 70 and with WBC &lt; 30 x109/l maintenance therapy&#xD;
      without consolidation improved outcomes. In patients older than 70 and with WBC &lt; 30 x 109/l&#xD;
      consolidation therapy worsened outcomes. In patients older than 70 and with WBC &gt; 30 x 109/l,&#xD;
      both consolidation and/or maintenance therapy did not improve outcomes (Corre 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is feasible to use maintenance treatment&#xD;
      (prolonged treatment over several months) with Decitabine in elderly patients with AML after&#xD;
      they have obtained a remission with standard chemotherapy. The study also aims at obtaining&#xD;
      preliminary results on whether this approach prolongs the period of remission after standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The study group will include elderly (â‰¥60 years of age), Acute Myeloid Leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) patients who can tolerate an aggressive therapy.&#xD;
