  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of&#xD;
      sorafenib and everolimus will have on your thyroid cancer. Treatment guidelines from the&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network include sorafenib as a treatment option for thyroid&#xD;
      cancer. Sorafenib is pill that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of kidney and liver&#xD;
      cancers. Sorafenib may work in many different ways. It helps decrease the blood supply to&#xD;
      tumors. By doing so, it may limit the tumor's source of oxygen and nutrients and prevent the&#xD;
      tumor from growing. Everolimus is an oral medication that is FDA approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of kidney cancer. It inhibits a protein kinase called mTOR (&quot;mammalian Target of Rapamycin&quot;).&#xD;
      In laboratory studies, the addition of everolimus to sorafenib works better than sorafenib&#xD;
      alone. These two drugs are being used together to treat other types of cancer in other&#xD;
      clinical studies. In addition, the cancer will be evaluated to help us find factors that can&#xD;
      help predict who would benefit most from this combination of drugs.&#xD;

             mm with spiral CT scan. For malignant lymph nodes, the short axis must be &gt; 15 mm when&#xD;
