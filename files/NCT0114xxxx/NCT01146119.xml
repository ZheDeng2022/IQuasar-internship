      This is a Phase II multi-center, randomized, two stage, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study comprising 200 participants. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive one of the&#xD;
      following administrations (as two single IM injections with an interval of 21 days between&#xD;
      each injection Administration A: Prime twice with Adjuvanted Multimeric-001 500 mcg - 64&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration B: PBS (Placebo) twice - 32 subjects. Administration C: Adjuvanted PBS&#xD;
      (Placebo)twice - 32 subjects. Participants from administrations A and B will be further&#xD;
      immunized with a 15% dose of commercial seasonal trivalent vaccine for 2011 on day 81.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration D: Adjuvanted Multimeric-001 500 mcg coadministered once with 15% of TIV dose&#xD;
      - 24 subjects. Administration E: Adjuvanted Multimeric-001 500 mcg coadministered once with&#xD;
      50% of TIV dose - 24 subjects Administration group F: PBS (Placebo) co-administered once with&#xD;

    <description>The serum is tested for its ability to adhere to influenza virus and thus inhibit the Hemagglutination reaction. Adjuvanted M-001 co-administered with partial dose of TIV (Vaxigrip, 50%) was effective in enhancing immunity to influenza-related antigens, as manifested by increased HAI antibody responses toward viruses contained in the TIV as well as toward non-TIV virus strains.</description>
