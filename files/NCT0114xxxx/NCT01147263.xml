      Clinically Characterized by the presence of chronic widespread pan and tenderness,&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is one of the most common &quot;functional&quot; syndromes. FM is currently conceived&#xD;
      of as representing a prototype of central pain, i.e. a condition in which sensitization of&#xD;
      the central nervous system results in a overall increase in the processing of painful&#xD;
      stimuli, as well as an impairment of pain inhibition. This condition is responsible for&#xD;
      significant a social and economic burden and is estimated to affect up to 5% of all women.&#xD;
      The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for FM are the&#xD;
      current standard for studying FM, and require the presence of widespread pain lasting over 3&#xD;
      months, as well as documentation of tenderness in at least 11 of 18 pre-defined &quot;tender&#xD;
      points. Multiple additional symptoms, which are not part of the classification criteria,&#xD;
      include among others sleep disturbances, mood disturbances, cognitive dysfunction,&#xD;
      vulvodynia, dysmenorrhea, sexual dysfunction and weight fluctuations. In addition, FM is well&#xD;
      known to overlap both clinically and epidemiologically with an ever increasing number of&#xD;
      other &quot;functional&quot; disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Temporomandibular&#xD;
      joint disorder (TMJD), functional dyspepsia etc. In addition to the central symptom of pain,&#xD;
      FM patients frequently complain of non- specific symptoms which are potentially autonomically&#xD;
      - mediated. Thus, palpitations, fatigue and inability to stand for long periods of time are&#xD;
      all common complaints. About 80-90 percent of FM patients have one or more symptoms&#xD;
      associated with autonomic dysfunction. The most common of them is presyncope (62.5%),&#xD;
      followed by syncope (12.5%), palpitations on standing (12.5%) and dizziness (12.5%) (14).&#xD;
      Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). POTS&#xD;
      is a common dysautonomia, characterized by remarkable increased heart rate during the&#xD;
      assumption of the upright posture (&gt;30 bpm). According to our experience, FM is found, at&#xD;
      least, in 15% of POTS patients. But, no data exists about the incidence of POTS in patients&#xD;
      with FM.The role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in initiating and maintaining the&#xD;
      syndrome of FM has been studies (and debated) over the last decade. The ANS is an extremely&#xD;
      complex system, regulating involuntary body functions, including heart rate, intestinal&#xD;
      motility, urination, and sexual activity, among many other variables. Notably, the vagus has&#xD;
      an inhibitory effect on pain. Deterioration in the vagal control is &quot;associated&quot; with&#xD;
      increased pain sensation. Previous studies have indicated that FM patients may have an&#xD;
      increase in sympathetic control over the cardiovascular system with a reciprocal decrease in&#xD;
      parasympathetic control. High sympathetic tone is usually associated with a lower threshold&#xD;
      to pain. But, the contribution of the ANS to the pathogenesis of FM syndrome remains unclear.&#xD;
      Evidently, the ANS interacts with other components of the CNS in the pathogenesis of FM,&#xD;
      including pain processing centers in the thalamus and amygdala, as well as with the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.&#xD;
