  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, multicentric, prospective, post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study on&#xD;
      the extent to which subject compliance is influenced by use of a variable titration regimen&#xD;
      at the start of treatment of relapsing MS with Rebif.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interferon beta has become the treatment of choice in relapsing MS. In previous clinical&#xD;
      studies, the interferon-beta 1a (Rebif) used within the scope of this PMS study has&#xD;
      demonstrated significant efficacy in all aspects of treatment - magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) data, relapse rate, and progression of disability. The PRISMS-4 study demonstrated that&#xD;
      treatment with Rebif reduces the frequency and severity of clinical relapses over 4 years and&#xD;
      slows the progression of disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve good subject compliance, it is important that the subject be given a&#xD;
      realistic picture of the expected result of treatment and of the demands that will be made in&#xD;
      connection with the treatment. Interferon beta cannot cure MS, however treatment with Rebif&#xD;
      can reduce the number and severity of relapses and delay the progression of disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rebif therapy is a long-term therapy. For this reason, subject may not feel any positive&#xD;
      effects immediately, but instead may notice the benefits of treatment only after a&#xD;
      considerable period of time. The early period after the start of treatment is considered to&#xD;
      be crucial in terms of whether the treatment will be accepted and tolerated by the subject or&#xD;
      whether unplanned cessation of treatment will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of this PMS study was to provide subjects with the greatest possible&#xD;
      degree of safety and support by means of optimal management in the first few weeks after the&#xD;
      start of treatment or after the change from a different treatment regimen. This objective was&#xD;
      to be achieved by, among other things, a flexible dose escalation regimen that took into&#xD;
      account individual subjects' acceptance. It is precisely during this critical early phase of&#xD;
      treatment, marked as it is by uncertainty, change, and in some cases problems of&#xD;
      tolerability, that poor subject compliance occurs, leading in some cases to treatment&#xD;
      dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another question addressed in the study was related to the small number of subjects who after&#xD;
      this initial phase could not tolerate Rebif therapy at the high dosage (44 µg x3). In these&#xD;
      cases there was the option of a temporary dose reduction to the lower dosage (22 µg x3). The&#xD;
      objective of this dose reduction was to avoid an unnecessary change of treatment regimen and&#xD;
      thereby to make an important contribution to improving compliance. In the present PMS study,&#xD;
      particular attention was paid to the question of subject compliance at the start of Rebif&#xD;
      therapy. This applied both to Rebif-naive subjects and to subjects who were being switched to&#xD;
      Rebif after receiving other forms of MS therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects first received Interferon beta-1a at a dose of 22 µg x3 over a period of 4 weeks. An attempt was then made to increase the dose of interferon beta-1a to 44 µg x3 as a self-administered subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. If intolerable interferon-specific side effects or problems of acceptance occured, the treatment with Rebif 22 µg three times weekly was continued.</description>
