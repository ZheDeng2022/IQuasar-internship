    <textblock>
      Statins (such as simvastatin or Zocor) are the most effective and widely prescribed&#xD;
      medications to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the frequency of heart attacks, cardiac&#xD;
      deaths and strokes. Unfortunately, statins can cause muscle discomfort or pain called&#xD;
      &quot;myalgia&quot; in patients treated with these drugs. These symptoms often cause patients who need&#xD;
      these medications to stop taking the drug. The cause of statin muscle pain is not known, but&#xD;
      it is thought that a reduction of a vitamin-like substance called Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) during&#xD;
      statin treatment may play a role. CoQ10 is a vitamin like substance and is not a drug&#xD;
      approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study will look at the&#xD;
      effects of CoQ10 supplements on individuals who develop muscle symptoms while on simvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to test the hypothesis that CoQ10 supplementation compared to placebo&#xD;
      in patients with documented statin myalgia reduces the intensity of pain during statin&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Study Overview: We estimate, based on the calculations detailed below that 80 subjects with&#xD;
      documented statin myalgia will be required to test our hypothesis. Consequently, 135 patients&#xD;
      with statin myopathic complaints will be recruited from the Cholesterol Management Center at&#xD;
      Hartford Hospital, newspaper and radio advertisements and contact with physicians' offices.&#xD;
      Subjects will be withdrawn from all lipid lowering medications for at least 4 weeks. Subjects&#xD;
      will then have serum measured for baseline lipids, liver, kidney, and thyroid function,&#xD;
      creatine kinase (CK) and CoQ10 values and be randomized to treatment with simvastatin 20 mg&#xD;
      daily or matching placebo for up to 2 months. Subjects will be called weekly to assess&#xD;
      symptoms. Blood measurements will be repeated and treatment (simvastatin or placebo) will&#xD;
      stopped after 2 months or after subjects have experienced muscle symptoms continuously for&#xD;
      one week. After 4 weeks, subjects will cross over to the alternative placebo or simvastatin&#xD;
      treatment and the monitoring and measurement process will be repeated. Those patients&#xD;
      developing myalgia during statin treatment, but not during placebo, will enter the CoQ10&#xD;
      study, again after 4 weeks off treatment. These subjects will have serum lipids, liver, CK,&#xD;
      vitamin D and CoQ10 levels measured, 4mL of blood sample will be stored for future white&#xD;
      blood cell analysis and they will undergo tests of muscle performance and exercise capacity.&#xD;
      They will then be randomized to placebo or CoQ10 treatment arms, &quot;loaded&quot; with placebo or&#xD;
      CoQ10 to ensure adequate tissue levels for two weeks, and then retreated with simvastatin 20&#xD;
      mg daily. Subjects will be called weekly to inquire about muscle symptoms. Blood measurements&#xD;
      will be repeated, another 4mL of blood sample will be stored for future white blood cell&#xD;
      analysis and treatment (simvastatin/CoQ10 or simvastatin/placebo) will be stopped after 2&#xD;
      months or after subjects have experienced muscle symptoms continuously for one week. After 4&#xD;
      weeks subjects will cross over to the alternative simvastatin/CoQ10 or simvastatin/placebo&#xD;
      treatment and the monitoring and measurement will be repeated. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      the intensity of pain at eight weeks, or after subjects have had continuous symptoms for a&#xD;
      week (or less in the case of intolerable symptoms), whichever comes first. We will also&#xD;
      determine time in days to the onset of repeat myopathic symptoms and measure muscle&#xD;
      performance including skeletal muscle strength and endurance and maximal aerobic exercise&#xD;
      capacity using techniques used in our present NIH funded research project The Effect of&#xD;
      Statins on Skeletal Muscle Function (R01 HL081893). We will measure muscle strength,&#xD;
      endurance and aerobic capacity because weakness is a frequent, but largely unquantified,&#xD;
      complaint among patients with statin myalgia and its prevention with CoQ10 is therefore&#xD;
      important. Also, some investigators have reported changes in the rest and exercise&#xD;
      respiratory exchange ratio (RER) with statin therapy implying an alteration in cellular&#xD;
      substrate metabolism with statins that may be influenced by CoQ10 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects: Subjects will be recruited from the Cholesterol Management Center, which sees&#xD;
      approximately 20 new patients weekly, the majority of whom have statin myalgia and who are&#xD;
      referred because of Dr. Thompson's expertise in this topic, via advertisements and by&#xD;
      physician contact by mail and email informing them of the study. Subjects will be reimbursed&#xD;
      $500 for their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Definition of Statin-Related Myopathic Complaints: Statin myopathic symptoms have been&#xD;
      poorly defined in the medical literature. For the purpose of this study, subjects will be&#xD;
      considered to have had prior statin related complaints and recruited for participation in the&#xD;
      study if all of the following occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. They developed new myalgia, cramps, or muscle aching during statin treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The symptoms resolved within 4 weeks of stopping the statin. Subjects meeting these&#xD;
           criteria will be recruited into the study. To ensure that only patients with documented&#xD;
           statin myalgia are entered into the CoQ10 trial, all subjects with a history of statin&#xD;
           myalgia will be treated for up to 8 weeks with simvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo in a&#xD;
           double-blind, cross-over protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those developing statin myalgia only during simvastatin treatment will be advanced to the&#xD;
      CoQ10 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, subjects will be contacted by phone weekly to inquire about muscle&#xD;
      complaints using the Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) (BPI-SF) (18). Results will be&#xD;
      recorded on paper forms and entered into the database. During the phone contacts, subjects&#xD;
      with symptoms for statin myopathy will have a CK level determined within 72 hours and while&#xD;
      on study drug. If the CK is &gt; 10 times upper limits of normal (UNL), the standard diagnosis&#xD;
      of myositis, and is unassociated with recent exercise, the drug will be stopped and the&#xD;
      subject will undergo prompt repeat testing and be removed from the study. If the CK is &lt; 10&#xD;
      UNL, the drug will be continued until the subject has had symptoms for 1 week to document&#xD;
      that the symptoms are not transitory. After 1 week of persistent symptoms or as soon as&#xD;
      possible if the patient has intolerable symptoms, the subject will undergo final testing and&#xD;
      have completed the study. This reduces undue subject burden such that subjects do not have to&#xD;
      maintain statin treatment for multiple weeks with pain symptoms. Subjects who do not report&#xD;
      recurrent symptoms will be treated for 8 weeks, at which time they will undergo final testing&#xD;
      and have completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of Primary Endpoint: We will examine the ability of CoQ10 to reduce the&#xD;
      intensity of pain because many patients would remain on statin therapy if the discomfort were&#xD;
      tolerable. Consequently, increasing pain tolerability is a key clinical measure. We selected&#xD;
      8 weeks of therapy for the simvastatin vs placebo and CoQ10 vs placebo sections of the study&#xD;
      because in the largest clinical study, the median time to onset of myalgia in statin na√Øve&#xD;
      subjects was 1 month and statin rechallenge typically reproduces symptoms more rapidly.&#xD;
      Consequently, most subjects with true statin myalgia will have clearly developed symptoms at&#xD;
      or before 8 weeks, the point at which study procedures are completed, allowing us to&#xD;
      accurately assess the impact of CoQ10 on muscle pain intensity. Except for chronic aspirin&#xD;
      use, commonly recommended in patients at risk for heart disease, or in patients chronically&#xD;
      using pain medications even off statin therapy, over the counter pain medication use for&#xD;
      myalgic or myopathic symptoms will be prohibited during the study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will not exclude patients with diagnosed CAD, peripheral vascular disease or&#xD;
             diabetes since these patients warrant aggressive lipid treatment, and would benefit&#xD;
             from any intervention that increases their tolerance of statins. We do not consider it&#xD;
             inappropriate or unethical to place such patients on placebo during the simvastatin vs&#xD;
             placebo phase because these patients will have previously been documented to be&#xD;
             intolerant of statins. All patients will be maintained on lipid lowering diets during&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LDL Cholesterol Levels - LDL levels will not be a criterion for inclusion or exclusion&#xD;
             from this study since all patients will have previously been deemed appropriate&#xD;
             candidates for statin therapy by their physicians and because recent clinical trial&#xD;
             results suggest that statins will be used in high risk individuals regardless of their&#xD;
             pretreatment LDL-C values.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Race - We will seek to recruit Caucasians, Hispanics and African American in&#xD;
             accordance with their distributions in the study communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CoQ10 Use - Subjects previously using supplemental CoQ10 must discontinue this&#xD;
             supplementation for two months prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diet - All subjects will be instructed in a standard lipid lowering diet and asked to&#xD;
             maintain this throughout the 6 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be excluded if they have had cancer within 5 years of entry, have&#xD;
             hepatic disease (ALT &gt; 2 times normal) or renal disease (creatinine &gt; 2 mg/L) since&#xD;
             these patients may require more careful monitoring during the study and would be best&#xD;
             managed in a totally clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects presently treated with other medications known to alter statin metabolism (3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who cannot discontinue other lipid-lowering medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with hypo or hyper thyroidism defined as a TSH &gt; 5 or &lt;0.01 IU/L since these&#xD;
             conditions are known to be associated with statin intolerance and muscle weakness,&#xD;
             respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with hepatic dysfunction evidenced by a baseline alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             (ALT) level &gt; 2 UNL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with renal dysfunction defined as a baseline creatinine &gt; 2mg/dl;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with physical disabilities prohibiting the strength and exercise performance&#xD;
             measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who regularly use corticosteroids or other drugs known to affects skeletal&#xD;
             muscle metabolism or regularly have intramuscular injections that will affect CK&#xD;
             levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential who do not use an effective birth-control technique.&#xD;
