    <textblock>
      Among the components of postural control, sensorial integration is of crucial importance. The&#xD;
      most important sensorial inputs for postural maintenance are the vestibular system which&#xD;
      provides information regarding accelerations of the head in space (HORAK 1994), the&#xD;
      somatosensory system which provides proprioceptive information that are used to determine&#xD;
      changes in body position (INGLIS 1994) and the visual system which provides information for&#xD;
      self motion in the environment. The receptors and the integration channel of each sensorial&#xD;
      system have inner characteristics which lead to different performance of the different input&#xD;
      in regards to the task and the environmental context (FITZGERALD 1994). Most of time,&#xD;
      sensorial information are congruent but sometimes they are conflicted. This is the case when&#xD;
      being in a stationary train, the train beside going on, giving the illusory sensation of&#xD;
      movement even if the vestibular system is not activated. A sensory weighting process is then&#xD;
      necessary for subjects to control balance. The Central Nervous System (CNS) is thought to&#xD;
      adjust the relative contribution of sensory input to control stance depending on&#xD;
      environmental conditions (CENCIANNI 2006) and the reliability of the sensory input (OIE 2002,&#xD;
      KESHNER 2004) in order to maintain or achieve the desired orientation in space and to provide&#xD;
      postural stability. Nevertheless the interconnection of the multiple sensorial feedback&#xD;
      involved in the postural control is not yet completely understood (CHIARI 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, there is no tool available to evaluate the individual use of the sensorial information&#xD;
      to postural control. It seems interesting to have such a tool to better understand the&#xD;
      sensorial preference of subjects. It would be of particular importance for patients with&#xD;
      various pathologies in the aim to design individualized balance rehabilitation programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to test a tool built to evaluate the sensorial preference of&#xD;
      subjects by studying their postural reaction related to the 3 main sensorial perturbations.&#xD;
      Normal subjects will be first tested to assess the repeatability of the protocol and to&#xD;
      collect normal values. Then, patients with post stroke hemiplegia, vestibular disease,&#xD;
      neuropathy and fallers will be studied in order to test the feasibility of the protocol and&#xD;
      to have preliminary data of sensorial preference among these populations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects Subjects with balance disorder related to a first hemispheric stroke, or vestibular&#xD;
      trouble, or neuropathy and or aging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apparatus Balance evaluation Subjects stand barefoot on a force platform (FeeTest&#xD;
      Technoconcept®) consisting of two separate aluminium plates, distant of 12 cm, each placed on&#xD;
      2 force transducers that recorded the vertical ground reaction forces. The position of the&#xD;
      center of pression (COP) was calculated from the ground reaction force. The data are&#xD;
      collected with a sampling frequency of 40 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory disturbance Sensory information (vision, proprioception and vestibular information)&#xD;
      are successively disturbed. For each sensory information, different perturbations are tested&#xD;
      in order to induce a sway in a determined direction (anterior, posterior, right and left).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vision is disturbed by an optokinetic stimulation in a dark room, an optokinetic bowl&#xD;
      (OPTOTEST, Technconcept®) placed behind the subject projecting moving luminous dots on the&#xD;
      wall in front of the subject at the speed of 60/°s. The subjects are instructed to stare&#xD;
      straight ahead at the stimulus pattern without attempting to follow the moving dots. Four&#xD;
      trials are conducted for the visual stimulation in which the direction of the stimulus&#xD;
      pattern differs: the direction of the displacement of the luminous dots is first top to&#xD;
      bottom up, then bottom to top down, right to left and finally left to right.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proprioceptive information is disturbed by a vibratory stimulation: vibration is delivered by&#xD;
      two mechanical vibrators (VB 115, TECHNOCONCEPT ®). The vibration is of 1mm amplitude and the&#xD;
      frequency is 50 Hz. Vibratory stimulation is first applied on the muscle tendon of the&#xD;
      triceps sural, afterwards on the tendon of the tibialis anterior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then lateral stimulation is applied with a frequency of 90 Hz on the gluteus medius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular information Is disturbed by a galvanic stimulation: a binaural galvanic&#xD;
      stimulation of 2 mA is applied using a constant current stimulator (World Precision&#xD;
      Instruments®). Surface electrodes are placed over the mastoid processes. Four conditions are&#xD;
      tested: cathode placed on the right mastoid process then on the left mastoid process with the&#xD;
      head looking straight ahead ; cathode placed on the side of the cerebral lesion (or on the&#xD;
      right side for the healthy subjects), and head turned to the right then the left.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Each trial begins with a 15 second baseline period without stimulation, followed by&#xD;
      a 35 second period of stimulation and a final 20 second period of observation without&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are asked to stand as steel as possible with their arms along the body looking&#xD;
      straight ahead (except for the last two trials of the galvanic stimulation where the head is&#xD;
      tilted). A trial without stimulation is registered in order to use the subject to the&#xD;
      procedure and for each condition sensory perturbation is tested by the subject before&#xD;
      starting the recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects are tested as soon as possible after the onset of their disease and are retested&#xD;
      4 to 6 weeks later as they completed rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects are also tested. Data analyzed For each sensory perturbation, we analyze two&#xD;
      characteristics of the behavior of the subjects during the stimulation: the displacement&#xD;
      induced by the stimulation and the intensity of sway during the stimulation ·Because the&#xD;
      position of all the subjects can not be rigorously identical among all the subjects, the&#xD;
      displacement induced by the stimulation is calculated by the mean of the displacement (in&#xD;
      millimeters)(MD) of the COP (15 to 50 seconds) in the plane of the attended effect (for&#xD;
      example anterior-posterior for a triceps sural trial and lateral for an optokinetic trial&#xD;
      from the right to the left) minus the mean position of the CoP during the prestimulation&#xD;
      period (2 to 13 seconds). A sensorial score is obtained in each direction for the successive&#xD;
      sensory stimulation. From these values, and for each sensory perturbation (visual,&#xD;
      proprioceptive and vestibular) a composite score is calculated as the mean of all the trials&#xD;
      done for one sensorial stimulation. Thus, we obtain three scores: a visual composite score, a&#xD;
      proprioceptive composite score and a vestibular composite score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of falls induced by the stimulations is also registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ·The intensity of sway during the stimulation is evaluated by a fast fourier transform&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The reproducibility of our test is assessed by the intra-class&#xD;
      correlation coefficient (ICC). Reproducibility is considered as correct if the ICC is&#xD;
      superior at 0.6 and excellent if superior at 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data are reported as means with the (standard deviation) SDs. Correlation between&#xD;
      the force platform values and the subjects characteristics are evaluated by non parametric&#xD;
      statistics: Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test. P values&#xD;
      are chosen at 0.05.&#xD;
