    <textblock>
      The main goal of this research study is to determine whether treating patients with renal&#xD;
      cell cancer with hydroxychloroquine before surgery can make the cancer easier to kill.&#xD;
      Another goal is to see how the study drug affects the body's immune cells which fight cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      Autophagy is a cellular survival mechanism that protects from stress-induced programmed&#xD;
      death. Autophagy may enable renal cancer to escape from cytokine therapy, cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy or targeted agents. Hydroxychloroquine prevents autophagy by blocking&#xD;
      acidification of lysosomes, and is being studied in clinical trials as a means of enhancing&#xD;
      of cancer therapy. This phase Ib clinical trial will test the hypothesis that pre-operative&#xD;
      exposure to HC reduces biologic markers of autophagy in peripheral blood, normal kidney and&#xD;
      renal cancer specimens obtained at the time of nephrectomy. These data will be used in the&#xD;
      design and pharmacodynamic monitoring of future therapeutic trials of HC in combination with&#xD;
      high dose interleukin-2 and other systemic therapies for advanced RCC.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with suspected primary or metastatic RCC (stage 1-IV) with planned&#xD;
             nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal renal, hepatic, and hematologic function at the time of enrollment as evidenced&#xD;
             by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine level ≤1.5 the upper limits of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin level ≤1.5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  White blood cell count &gt; or = 3.5x109/ml per ml and platelet count ≥ 100x109 per ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received chemotherapy for any diagnosis within 12 months prior to&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of radiotherapy or investigational agents for RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent malignancies with evidence of active or measurable disease except&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to adhere to study and/or follow-up procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to the study drug&#xD;
             (hydroxychloroquine) or current therapy with the study drug for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other concurrent experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of HC on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test&#xD;
             or urine study within two weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. If a man impregnates a woman while participating in&#xD;
             this study, he should inform his treating physician immediately as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are not excluded from the study. However, for patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy, the potential impact of pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with HC is unknown. Therefore, HIV-positive patients actively receiving&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psoriasis are ineligible unless the disease is well controlled and they&#xD;
             are under the care of a specialist who agrees to monitor the patient for&#xD;
             exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring the use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medication that includes:&#xD;
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone or oxcarbazepine are excluded.&#xD;
             Hydroxychloroquine is known to affect the CYP2D6 metabolic pathway. A list of drugs&#xD;
             with potential interaction is included in Appendix H.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GP6D) deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EKG with QTc &gt;500 msec at baseline (average of 3 determinations at 10 minutes&#xD;
             interval). Subjects with ventricular pacemaker for whom QT interval is not measurable&#xD;
             will be eligible on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
