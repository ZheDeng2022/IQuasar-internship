  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the variability of biological signals, such as&#xD;
      heart rate and temperature, can predict weaning from mechanical ventilation in patients with&#xD;
      failure to wean.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Failure to wean is one of the most feared complications of mechanical ventilation. Prolonged&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation occurs in 5-20% of all patients requiring MV in an intensive care&#xD;
      unit. The published experience in the Cleveland Clinic in-hospital-weaning unit (ReSCU,&#xD;
      Respiratory Special Care Unit) on long-term mechanical ventilation (&gt;14 days) is that on&#xD;
      average, 60% of the patients achieve complete ventilator independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of factors that predict liberation from mechanical ventilation should&#xD;
      improve outcomes and allocation of resources. Several attempts have been done to develop&#xD;
      models to identify patients who will wean from prolonged MV; most rely on multiple&#xD;
      measurements and their predictive ability is uncertain. Given the complexity of medical&#xD;
      problems and the heterogeneity of the patients with prolonged MV, it is not unexpected that&#xD;
      in order to achieve a good prediction, multiple variables are needed to encompass the whole&#xD;
      population and relevant factors associated with the failure to wean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate variability (HRV) is obtained from the measurement of the interval between&#xD;
      successive heart beats; its analysis has been used extensively in cardiovascular disease. HRV&#xD;
      is interpreted as a manifestation of the neurohumoral and autonomic system influence over the&#xD;
      heart. Some researchers think that HRV relates to overall variability and is a manifestation&#xD;
      of health in a complex biological system. Interpretation apart, multiple studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that the loss of variability reflects a poor prognosis overall. This phenomenon&#xD;
      is seen not only in the heart, but also in breathing patterns, blood pressure, leukocyte&#xD;
      count, electroencephalogram, gait, and recently in temperature. Limitations in interpretation&#xD;
      and difficulty in acquisition (ventilator influence, respiratory rate influence, arrhythmias,&#xD;
      medication) make HRV less practical in the mechanically ventilated population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface temperature is not usually measured in clinical practice; it reflects skin&#xD;
      thermoregulatory properties (where the autonomic system has a fundamental role). Recently, a&#xD;
      novel marker to describe biological variability in body temperature has been studied. The&#xD;
      temperature curve complexity (TCC) was used to predict mortality in critically ill patients.&#xD;
      Its performance was comparable to that of scores like APACHE and SOFA, this has been&#xD;
      described with HRV, hence suggesting a relation between TCC and HRV. Although no prior study&#xD;
      has related TCC or HRV alone or to prolonged mechanical ventilation outcomes, there is reason&#xD;
      to suspect that variability is decreased in ventilator-dependent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the analysis of HRV and TCC has provided prognostic information in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. A relation between HRV and TCC is expected but has not been described. Given the&#xD;
      multiple influences of MV on HRV, TCC may be a better indicator of of variability in patients&#xD;
      on MV. Our primary hypothesis is that the analysis of HRV and TCC will predict failure to&#xD;
      wean from prolonged MV. Our secondary aims are: to identify the relationship between HRV and&#xD;
      TCC, to describe the TCC in patients with prolonged MV, and to describe the changes in HRV&#xD;
      and TCC in patients with successful and failed weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study in which measurements of HRV and TCC will be done in patients&#xD;
      admitted to the ReSCU and compared to the ability to wean from mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
