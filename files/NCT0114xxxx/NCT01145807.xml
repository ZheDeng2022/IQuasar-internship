    <description>Study treatment (TDT 067, Transfersome® vehicle, or non Transfersome® placebo) will be applied twice a day for 48 weeks to the great toenail and the other nails and areas surrounding the nails on the foot. Each application will consist of 5 sprays: 1 spray each to the dorsal, medial, anterior, and frontal part of the great toe and a final spray applied evenly to the nail area of the remaining 4 toes. Patients will be instructed not to wash the treated foot or bathe for at least 4 hours after product application.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive, of any race, and of either&#xD;
             sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female patients must be either surgically sterile, postmenopausal (no menses for the&#xD;
             previous 12 months), or must be practicing an effective method of birth control as&#xD;
             determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have at least 1 great toenail (target toenail) with clinically diagnosed&#xD;
             distal subungual onychomycosis involving between 25% and 65%, inclusive, of the nail&#xD;
             and confirmed by KOH visualization and fungal culture positive for dermatophytes.&#xD;
             (Patients with culture positive for dermatophytes alone or dermatophytes and non&#xD;
             dermatophytes are eligible to participate.) If both great toenails meet inclusion&#xD;
             criteria, the one with the greater involvement will be designated the target nail.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be able to understand the requirements of the study, abide by the&#xD;
             restrictions, and return for all of the required examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be willing to sign a statement of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have a target great toenail with the capability to grow as determined by&#xD;
             history of nail cutting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must be willing to refrain from using any nail polish products and other nail&#xD;
             cosmetic products on any of the toenails and must be willing to refrain from&#xD;
             professional pedicures for the duration of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have been treated with an investigational drug within 1 month prior to&#xD;
             study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or who are lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with hypersensitivity to terbinafine or to any other ingredients of the&#xD;
             formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are unable to spray their toenails and the surrounding tissues on the&#xD;
             affected foot without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with symptomatic tinea pedis requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients using oral terbinafine within 6 months prior to the start of study; patients&#xD;
             who have received other oral antifungals within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients using topical antifungal treatments for onychomycosis within 1 month prior to&#xD;
             the start of study; patients using topical antifungal treatments for the feet within 1&#xD;
             month prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with any nail dystrophy that will interfere with the assessment of a clear&#xD;
             nail. Patients who have toenail abnormalities or dystrophies that could prevent the&#xD;
             restoration of a normal appearing nail in spite of a mycological cure for&#xD;
             dermatophytes, including patients with psoriasis, lichen planus, malignancy or&#xD;
             pigmentation disorders involving the nail unit, chemical damage, or onychodystrophy&#xD;
             due to trauma or other structural deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with superficial white or proximal subungual onychomycosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a toenail infection involving a non dermatophyte alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with involvement of the matrix (lunula) or the proximal 2 mm of nail as&#xD;
             measured from the proximal nail fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who have a nail plate with thickness greater than 2 mm or total thickness of&#xD;
             the nail plus subungual debris measuring greater than 3 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with yellow streaks or dermatophytoma of the target toenail.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with a history of peripheral arterial disease or diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator renders the&#xD;
             patient unsuitable for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate (AST) levels greater than 2&#xD;
             times the upper limit of normal without clinical reason, unless, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, participation in this study would not place the patient at undue risk.&#xD;
