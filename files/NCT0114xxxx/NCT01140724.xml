  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States alone, each year approximately 5 million children undergo painful&#xD;
      surgery, many of them experience serious side-effects with opioids and inadequate pain&#xD;
      relief. Safe and effective analgesia is an important unmet critical medical need in children&#xD;
      and its continued existence is an important perioperative safety and economic problem.&#xD;
      Inadequate pain relief and serious side effects from perioperative opioids occur frequently&#xD;
      in up to 50% of children. Morphine, the most commonly used perioperative opioid, has a narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic index and large inter-patient variations in analgesic response and serious side&#xD;
      effects. Frequent inter-individual variations in responses to morphine have significant&#xD;
      clinical and economic impact with inadequate pain relief at one end of the spectrum of&#xD;
      responses and serious adverse effects such as respiratory depression at the other end. Much&#xD;
      of the inter-individual variability in response to a dose of morphine following surgical&#xD;
      procedures can be explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a subset of the&#xD;
      genes that encode proteins involved in pain mechanisms and opioid pathway.&#xD;

      Measures and Procedures: Participants will receive standard care, standard anesthetic and an&#xD;
      intraoperative dose of morphine per the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood draws for genotyping candidate genes and exploratory genes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standardized PACU (post anesthesia care unit) Protocol: Subjective pain assessments:&#xD;
           Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 0 to 10. Objective assessment with FLACC (facial&#xD;
           expression; leg movement; activity; cry; and consolability) scale, 0-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Significant postoperative pain will be managed in the PACU with rescue doses of morphine&#xD;
           and opioids by the clinical team. Analgesic interventions and morphine requirements are&#xD;
           collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Effects of opioids on pupil measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Respiratory response to 5% carbon dioxide preoperatively and postoperatively (first 350&#xD;
           patients only). Another measure of end tidal carbon dioxide will be implemented when the&#xD;
           device is clinically available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Serial blood draws for morphine pharmacokinetic modeling (through subject #351).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Opioid adverse effects in PACU and at home.&#xD;
