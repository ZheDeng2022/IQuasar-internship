      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy, is a synthetic&#xD;
           psychoactive drug that has shown a steep increase in recreational use and abuse by young&#xD;
           people in recent years. Research studies have reported that chronic MDMA users who also&#xD;
           consume other legal and illegal substance show memory deficits; however, because of the&#xD;
           combination of drugs often involved, it is difficult to determine MDMA s contribution to&#xD;
           these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only a few studies have examined the immediate physical and behavioral effects of MDMA&#xD;
           given at dose levels commonly used in young adults. Researchers are interested in using&#xD;
           functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine changes in brain activity and&#xD;
           function in MDMA users compared with users of other drugs and non-drug-using&#xD;
           individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effects of MDMA on thinking and brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 30 years of age who are (1) current users of MDMA (2), current&#xD;
      drug users who do not use MDMA, or (3) healthy non-drug-using volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete one training session and three scanning sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the start of the study, participants will complete questionnaires about medical&#xD;
           and psychological history, and provide information about past or current drug use.&#xD;
           Researchers will introduce the tasks to be performed during the scanning session(s), and&#xD;
           will allow participants to practice the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide urine, saliva, and hair samples for testing before the start&#xD;
           of the study, and multiple times during each scanning session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who use MDMA and participants who use other drugs will stay overnight at&#xD;
           the clinical center prior to each scanning session. Participants who do not use drugs&#xD;
           can spend the night prior to scanning or arrive at the clinical center on the morning of&#xD;
           the scanning session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who use MDMA will receive either MDMA or a placebo during the scanning&#xD;
           sessions, and will not be told which one they have received. Because of the nature of&#xD;
           MDMA, participants will be required to stay at the clinical center until the effects of&#xD;
           the drug have worn off, and will be required to return to the clinical center on the&#xD;
           following day for a follow-up examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, participants will be asked to do one or more tasks selected by the&#xD;
           researchers. The tasks will be performed on a computer in an MRI machine, and may&#xD;
           involve receiving monetary rewards for actions, memory and reaction-time tests, or other&#xD;
           tests that involve responding to instructions on the screen.&#xD;

      Background: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy, is a&#xD;
      synthetic compound that has shown a steep increase in abuse by young people in recent years.&#xD;
      In animals, when high and multiple doses of MDMA were given, serotonergic toxicity was&#xD;
      observed. Clinically, the number of severe ecstasy related acute toxicities is low in&#xD;
      relation to the extent of recreational use. Data from some retrospective studies report&#xD;
      memory deficits in abstinent chronic users who often abuse MDMA with other illicit and licit&#xD;
      substances; therefore, it is difficult to determine MDMA s contribution to observed cognitive&#xD;
      deficits. There are few prospective controlled MDMA human administration studies that&#xD;
      describe its acute physiological and behavioral effects following doses commonly used in&#xD;
      young adults. We propose a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to examine&#xD;
      specific changes in brain activity and cognitive performance and to correlate these changes&#xD;
      with plasma MDMA concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals: The primary goals are identification of MDMA effects on human brain function and&#xD;
      elucidation of the relationship of effects to plasma MDMA concentrations. We propose a&#xD;
      within-subject design of changes in memory, attention, affect, semantic processing and&#xD;
      decision-making performance following placebo and two recreational MDMA doses with&#xD;
      simultaneous fMRI monitoring and plasma collections. Secondly, pharmacokinetic data will be&#xD;
      collected on the disposition of MDMA and metabolites in plasma, urine, oral fluid, sweat,&#xD;
      breath, and hair. These data are needed to accurately interpret drug concentrations in&#xD;
      alternative biological matrices in order for drug tests to function as a deterrent to drug&#xD;
      use in drug abuse treatment, law enforcement, military, and workplace drug testing programs.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic data will also enable drug tests to serve as valid diagnostic tools in&#xD;
      emergency medicine and public safety settings, as well as useful objective outcome measures&#xD;
      in treatment research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: Eighteen current MDMA users will complete the neurocognitive and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics group. Thirty-six MDMA non-using controls will include 18 non-drug using&#xD;
      participants and 18 drug using (primarily cannabis) participants. Controls in each group will&#xD;
      be matched to MDMA users in the neurocognitive and pharmacokinetics group. All participants&#xD;
      must be between the ages of 18 and 40. The estimated target enrollment, based on ecstasy use&#xD;
      by race/ethnic group and Baltimore demographics, will be 41% female and 59% male, 83%&#xD;
      Caucasian, 14% African American, 3% Asian, and 2% Hispanic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods: A randomized, balanced, double blind, within-subject drug&#xD;
      administration study with placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg, approximately 70 mg) and high (1.6 mg/kg,&#xD;
      approximately 112 mg) doses of MDMA is proposed. The non-drug using and drug using control&#xD;
      groups will be matched to MDMA users in the neurocognitive and pharmacokinetics group for&#xD;
      sex, age, IQ, education level and intersession interval. The drug using control group will&#xD;
      control for cannabis and other drug usage in the MDMA group. The drug using control group is&#xD;
      necessary because many MDMA users also use other drugs, primarily cannabis. Control groups&#xD;
      allow for a between-subjects analysis for trait differences between the population groups, as&#xD;
      well as provide normative data for the cognitive tasks. Drug using control group participants&#xD;
      will stay on the clinical research unit overnight prior to each of the three sessions;&#xD;
      non-drug using control group participants will arrive the morning of each session.&#xD;
      Participants from the MDMA group will complete three separate stays, each lasting&#xD;
      approximately 26 hours, within one year. While under the influence of MDMA, qualified&#xD;
      participants will perform memory, attention, semantic processing, affect and decision-making&#xD;
      tasks before, during, and after fMRI scanning. Physiological, behavioral and biochemical&#xD;
      measures of all MDMA users will be monitored throughout the study to determine onset,&#xD;
      magnitude and duration of pharmacodynamic effects. Blood, urine, oral fluid, sweat, breath,&#xD;
      and hair specimens will be collected from MDMA users for analysis of MDMA and metabolite&#xD;
      concentrations by GC/MS and/or LC/MS/MS to determine the disposition and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      MDMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits: A main potential risk of this study is associated with acute&#xD;
      cardiovascular responses to MDMA administration; however, these doses have proven safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated in previous human studies conducted within the US and abroad. In addition,&#xD;
      impaired cognitive function has been reported following long-term MDMA use in some but not&#xD;
      all studies. A potential benefit of the proposed study is to understand how MDMA affects&#xD;
      human brain function at doses employed by recreational users. Additionally, advances will be&#xD;
      made in understanding MDMA pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Be between the ages of 18 and 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If MDMA group, have consumed at least five tablets of ecstasy in their lifetime&#xD;
                  with no clinically significant adverse medical or psychiatric reactions from&#xD;
                  using the drug or other stimulants and must have used at least once within the&#xD;
                  past 30 days (Drug Use Survey), with no current intention to stop MDMA use.&#xD;
                  History of ecstasy consumption is supported by a minimum of one positive urine&#xD;
                  amphetamines or hair MDMA drug test within the past 90 days. Urine drug tests at&#xD;
                  scanning visits must not be positive for drugs, other than amphetamines and&#xD;
                  cannabis. Scanning visits can be rescheduled once due to a positive urine test&#xD;
                  for other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. If control group, have no history of MDMA use (Drug Use Survey) and have negative&#xD;
                  urine test for amphetamines. If in the non-drug using group, must have a negative&#xD;
                  urine test for non-therapeutic psychoactive drugs at screening and scanning&#xD;
                  visits. Lifetime cannabis use for these participants cannot exceed ten times,&#xD;
                  with no use in the past two years (Timeline Follow-Back Method (146)). At&#xD;
                  screening, drug using controls may test positive for other drugs, other than&#xD;
                  amphetamines. At scanning, drug using controls may be positive for cannabis only.&#xD;
                  Scanning visits can be rescheduled once due to a positive urine test for other&#xD;
                  drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Be without current clinically significant medical problems that would preclude&#xD;
                  safe study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. If female, must use a reliable method of birth control or abstain from sexual&#xD;
                  intercourse. Female participants will be counseled that a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
