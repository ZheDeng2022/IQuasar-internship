  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and&#xD;
      infections have been increasing in the general population, including the pediatric&#xD;
      population. It has been reported that MRSA colonization persists for up to four years, and&#xD;
      therefore the youngest pediatric patients, specifically those who are less than 2 years of&#xD;
      age, have a high risk of prolonged colonization during a period of time when they are&#xD;
      susceptible to significant skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) attributable to MRSA. Once&#xD;
      prolonged colonization takes place, recurrent SSTIs are commonplace, resulting in substantial&#xD;
      morbidity and in some cases mortality, as well as a significant cost to the healthcare&#xD;
      system. Individuals colonized with MRSA have an increased risk of developing MRSA infections,&#xD;
      which range from mild disease, such as carbuncles, to severe infections, such as necrotizing&#xD;
      pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome. The prevalence of severe MRSA infections is also greatest&#xD;
      in neonates and infants, where increased MRSA colonization has been observed. In the early&#xD;
      infant period, the most common manifestation of MRSA disease is pustular skin lesions, which&#xD;
      affect approximately 5% of the general population, with MRSA-colonization being a major risk&#xD;
      factor for this disease. Moreover, the prevalence of pustular disease is increasing in the&#xD;
      general population, and there are numerous case reports of invasive, life-threatening MRSA&#xD;
      disease in the early infant period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corresponding to the increasing prevalence in the community, the carriage of MRSA in pregnant&#xD;
      women has also escalated, and vaginal carriage is significant in pregnant women. As an&#xD;
      analogy, maternal vaginal Group B Streptococcal (GBS) colonization is the major risk for&#xD;
      infant colonization regardless of whether early or late neonatal colonization or disease&#xD;
      occurs. It is quite feasible that vaginal MRSA carriage predisposes newborns to colonization&#xD;
      during the birthing process; however, this mechanism has not yet been well studied. There are&#xD;
      other mechanisms implicated for early infant colonization, including close contact with&#xD;
      MRSA-colonized mothers through daily care and breastfeeding. MRSA colonization in one&#xD;
      household member greatly predisposes colonization in others; therefore, early infant&#xD;
      colonization could result from contact with other MRSA-colonized individuals in a household.&#xD;
      Currently, it is not clear which factors are the most important in influencing early infant&#xD;
      MRSA colonization and subsequent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only is the prevalence of MRSA colonization and infection on the rise, but there have&#xD;
      been few if any measures that have been established to prevent colonization and subsequent&#xD;
      infection in adults and children. Eradication measures have shown limited long-term benefit.&#xD;
      If vertical transmission of MRSA can be established as a critical event in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of disease, potentially effective strategies could be tested, and possibly the spread of MRSA&#xD;
      in the community interrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify the proportion, rate and time of MRSA colonization in infants born to mothers&#xD;
           with and without MRSA colonization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare risk factors for infant MRSA colonization in these two groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the prevalence and risk factors for developing MRSA infections in the&#xD;
           MRSA-colonized infant.&#xD;

      MRSA isolates from the nose, axilla or perineum from mothers, infants and house hold contacts&#xD;

        The exposed group will include 100 MRSA-colonized mothers and their babies. The unexposed&#xD;
        group will include 100 MRSA-negative mothers and their babies. The groups will be&#xD;
        conveniently selected from all mothers and infants meeting the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
        criteria each month. Enrollment will continue until 100 babies and mothers in the&#xD;
        MRSA-positive mother group and 100 babies and mothers in MRSA-negative mother group are&#xD;
        enrolled. We estimate that enrollment will require approximately 18 months to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Household contacts of infants will be enrolled. A contact is defined as any individual who&#xD;
        had or has had the same primary residences (who has lived in the same house for at least&#xD;
        one week) as the infant since the infant's birth. We will ask the infants mother to&#xD;
        identify the infants household contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Infant care givers include any person who provides daily care to infant for at least 4&#xD;
        hours per day at least 3 days of week.&#xD;
