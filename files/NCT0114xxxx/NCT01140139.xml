      In this study, the investigators evaluated a therapeutic HIV-1 DNA vaccine administered with&#xD;
      a novel topical application method to 12 chronically HIV-infected cART treated patients. The&#xD;
      HIV DNA plasmids used in this study encode for envelope gp160 of HIV-1 subtypes A, B and C,&#xD;
      rev B, Gag A and B and reverse transcriptase (RT) B. The patients were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      three groups; group 1 (n=4) were immunized six times with 0.4 mg of HIV DNA plasmids&#xD;
      topically, group 2 (n=4) were immunized six times with 0.4 mg of HIV DNA plasmids topically&#xD;
      and treated with 500 mg of hydroxyurea daily until visit 10, group 3 (n=4) four patients&#xD;
      received placebo. The immunization was performed during three cycles of 7 weeks of cART&#xD;
      followed by four weeks of therapy interruption. After the last cycle of cART the patients&#xD;
      were maintained on a definitive treatment interruption until CD4+ T cell counts dropped below&#xD;
      350/ mm3 at two time points. Cellular and humoral immune responses, viral load and CD4+ T a&#xD;
      cell count was analysed throughout the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety and feasibility</measure>
    <description>The safety and feasibility of dermal HIV-1 DNA vaccination will be evaluated by recording all medical events. They will be graded as to their seriousness, severity and relationship to the immunization. Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and T-cell levels will be closely monitored. In addition to this the patient's individual experience and quality of life will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment effects</measure>
    <description>To evaluate whether dermal HIV-1 DNA vaccination can prolong periods without treatment in HIV-infected individuals. This will be evaluated by structured treatment interruption with close monitoring of HIV viral load and CD4+ T cell counts</description>
