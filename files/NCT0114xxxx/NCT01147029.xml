      RATIONALE: GSAO may stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of GSAO in treating&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors that have not responded to therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of angiogenesis&#xD;
           inhibitor GSAO in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and toxicity profile and dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine possible anti-tumor activity in patients treatment with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further determine the pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive angiogenesis inhibitor GSAO IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients showing clinical benefit (i.e., stable disease, partial response, or&#xD;
      complete response) may receive 6 additional courses of treatment. Patients receive&#xD;
      angiogenesis inhibitor GSAO IV over 1 hour on day -7 to obtain pharmacokinetics information&#xD;
      of a single IV dose of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic-resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) prior&#xD;
      to, during, and after study to determine blood flow parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and biomarker&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days and then once a&#xD;
      month thereafter.&#xD;
