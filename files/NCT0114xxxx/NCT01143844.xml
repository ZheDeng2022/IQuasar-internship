      Hypothesis: Girls and women exposed to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy experience&#xD;
      endocrine changes more similar to women in their late reproductive years than to same-age&#xD;
      peers. These changes will be more dramatic in women who receive high dose therapy compared to&#xD;
      women who receive low dose therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At annual visits over 3-5 years, a combination of physical exam, medical history, menstrual&#xD;
      diary keeping, pelvic ultrasound and blood hormones tests will be used to measure &quot;ovarian&#xD;
      reserve&quot; , that is the number and quality of the eggs that remain in the ovaries. The study&#xD;
      will also try to learn if those who received higher doses of certain chemotherapies are more&#xD;
      likely to have changes in these tests sooner than those women who received smaller doses of&#xD;
      these same drugs. Additionally a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sample will be collected to look&#xD;
      for gene variations that may predict susceptibility to ovarian damage from cancer treatments.&#xD;
      Information learned from this study may help researchers to develop guidelines to identify&#xD;
      problems with a female cancer survivor's ovaries before irregular menses or other symptoms of&#xD;
      ovarian failure occur.&#xD;

      Up to 400 females will participate in this study in one of three cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  150 females ages 11-35, with history of exposure to alkylating agent chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
           radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  150 Unexposed peers, ages 11-35, never exposed to chemotherapy or radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100 Unexposed females, ages 40-50 never exposed to chemotherapy or radiation therapy&#xD;

        Subjects with a history of cancer, or other conditions treated by chemotherapy, will be&#xD;
        identified through local survivorship programs or self-referral. In addition, two groups of&#xD;
        regularly menstruating unexposed subjects will be recruited through local advertising: a&#xD;
        group of similar-age subjects and another group in the late reproductive years. Exposed and&#xD;
        unexposed controls will be frequency matched with respect to age (within 2 years) at&#xD;
        enrollment. In addition,subjects will be balanced with respect to self reported&#xD;
        race/ethnicity. Enrollment is purposefully targeted and stratified for this study to&#xD;
        reflect the population in the pediatric and adult oncology practices.&#xD;
