    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single-center, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the delivery of dapivirine from matrix vaginal rings over a 56 and 57 day period and&#xD;
      to assess the safety as compared to placebo vaginal rings in 48 healthy, HIV-negative,&#xD;
      sexually active women.&#xD;

Abnormal vaginal pH and/or abnormal vaginal flora during the course of the trial.&#xD;
Positive diagnostic tests for trichomonas, gonorrhoea and/or chlamydia;&#xD;
At least one adverse event during the 12-week trial period;&#xD;
Any laboratory abnormalities on haematology, electrolytes, liver function, and renal function.</description>
