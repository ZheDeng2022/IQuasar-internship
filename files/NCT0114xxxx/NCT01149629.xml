  <brief_title>Study of the Fed-Fast Pharmocokinetics and Bioequivalance of 300mg Capsules of Droxidopa</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized, Open-Label, Three-Period, Three-Sequence, Single-Dose Crossover and Separate Three-Daily-Dose Treatment Period Study Comparing the Pharmacokinetic Profiles Following Oral Dosing of 300 mg of Droxidopa in the Fed Versus Fasted State, the Bioequivalence of Three 100 mg Capsules of Droxidopa Versus a Single 300 mg Capsule of Droxidopa, and 300 mg of Droxidopa Given Three Times at Four Hour Intervals in Healthy, Elderly Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One purpose of this study is to determine if taking droxidopa after eating will have an&#xD;
      effect on how the body processes (absorbs and eliminates) the drug in healthy elderly&#xD;
      subjects. Another purpose of this study is to see how the body processes (absorbs and&#xD;
      eliminates) one 300mg capsule compared to three 100mg capsules. This study will also evaluate&#xD;
      how well the body processes (absorbs and eliminates) and tolerates droxidopa when a 300 mg&#xD;
      capsule is given 3 times a day for a total dose of 900 mg over the course of one day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Droxidopa is used to treat low blood pressure upon standing in patients with diseases of the&#xD;
      nervous system, to prevent low blood pressure in patients with kidney disease during&#xD;
      hemodialysis (removal of waste products of the blood), and to treat frozen gait (walking,&#xD;
      stepping or running) and dizziness upon standing in patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

      This is a two-part study. Part I is a randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study in&#xD;
      24 healthy, elderly, male or female subjects. Subjects will be allocated to one of three&#xD;
      treatment sequences according to a randomization schedule prepared prior to the start of the&#xD;
      study. Each subject will receive a single, oral dose of three 100 mg capsules of droxidopa&#xD;
      with 240 mL of water either in the fasted state (Treatment A) or immediately following the&#xD;
      consumption of a standardized high-fat meal (Treatment B) and a single, oral dose of one 300&#xD;
      mg capsule of droxidopa with 240 mL of water in the fasted state (Treatment C) on Days 1, 4,&#xD;
      and 7. Subjects will be discharged from the research clinic on Day 8 after completing all&#xD;
      posttreatment follow-up assessments and will return to the research clinic approximately 1&#xD;
      week later for Part II of the study. Part II of the study is an open-label design where all&#xD;
      subjects will receive three doses of 300 mg droxidopa (three 100 mg capsules/dose) at 4 hour&#xD;
      intervals and will be followed for a concurrent 24 h period.&#xD;
