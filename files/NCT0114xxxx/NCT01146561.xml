      Tanezumab is effective in reducing the pain associated with chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On 23 Dec 2010 the FDA imposed a clinical halt for anti-NGF compounds due to safety reasons,&#xD;
      ie, a case of osteonecrosis which occurred in relation to an anti-NGF compound of another&#xD;
      company. All indications with the exception of Cancer Pain are affected resulting in&#xD;
      termination of all studies in respective indications. Recruitment of Study A4091044 was&#xD;
      stopped effective 27 Dec 2010. Two patients recruited so far did not receive further doses&#xD;
      and were followed up for safety until LSLV on 22 Mar 2011.&#xD;

    <description>BPI-sf is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions. BPI-sf are 4 questions that assess pain intensity (question 5 consists of 7 items that assess level of interference of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each item was answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 10; '0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine'. Measure were scored by item, with lower scores indicated less pain or pain interference.</description>

    <description>BPI-sf is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions. BPI-sf are 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and question 5 consisted of 7 items that assess level of interference of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each item was answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 10; '0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine'. Measure was scored by item, with lower score indicated less pain or pain interference. The 7 items in question 5 were averaged to obtain pain interference index, range: 0 to 10; higher score=greater impairment.</description>

        <description>NIS: 74-item questionnaire assesses muscle weakness, reflexes and sensation; scored separately for left, right limbs (37 items for each side). Components of muscle weakness (hip and knee flexion, hip and knee extension, ankle dorsiflexors, ankle plantar flexors, toe extensors, toe flexors) scored on scale 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score=greater weakness. Components of reflexes (quadriceps femoris, triceps surae) and sensation (touch pressure, pin-prick, vibration, joint position) scored 0 = normal, 1= decreased, or 2 = absent. Total possible NIS score range 0-244, higher score=greater impairment.</description>
