      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perform face transplants on people who have suffered severe facial trauma with tissue&#xD;
           and functional loss; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the acceptance and function of the transplanted tissue.&#xD;

      For patients with severe facial deformities or facial wounds from traumatic injuries, we&#xD;
      would like to pursue the use of a face transplant to help reconstruct a person's damaged&#xD;
      face. Our goal is to not only give the patient back a normal appearance to their face but&#xD;
      also the functioning, movement, and sensation of their face including that of the lips,&#xD;
      mouth, and eyes. For some patients with severe face deformities simple tasks such as smiling,&#xD;
      talking, eating, kissing a loved one, or even just being able to contain their saliva become&#xD;
      difficult, if not impossible. These patients often become depressed because of their facial&#xD;
      deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are some techniques in plastic and reconstructive surgery that can repair the&#xD;
      look of a patient's face, often these cannot replace the moving parts of the face. Currently,&#xD;
      patients with severe facial deformities would undergo several reconstructive surgeries with&#xD;
      their own tissues, called autologous transplant. This surgery often leaves unacceptable scars&#xD;
      and deformities of the patient's donor sites. Also, this conventional reconstruction method&#xD;
      requires many returns to the operating room to carefully form and shape the transplanted free&#xD;
      flap. Lastly, this type of reconstruction is still limited, as it does not provide a reliable&#xD;
      return in function, sensation, and appearance for the damaged parts of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead, if we use a composite tissue allograft (CTA), or face transplant from a donor who is&#xD;
      brain dead such as in heart, kidney and liver transplants, we could replace the damaged parts&#xD;
      of the face with the same missing parts that could return movement as well. However, since&#xD;
      the transplanted facial tissues are from another person, these face transplant recipients&#xD;
      need medicines that would keep their body from rejecting the new tissues. This new course of&#xD;
      medicines would be their daily responsibility. Though there are risks with taking these&#xD;
      medicines, the risks have been lowered by many prior studies that have been done with&#xD;
      patients who have had other organ transplants. However, the risks are still a consideration&#xD;
      when deciding to choose this option for correcting severe facial deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to perform a face transplant on a person who has suffered a severe facial&#xD;
      trauma with tissue and functional loss, and with limited other established surgical options&#xD;
      to repair their deformities. We will conduct the surgery and prospectively follow the patient&#xD;
      to monitor his or her clinical and functional outcomes and ensure that optimal results are&#xD;
      achieved. We will systematically document and record the entire process of the patient's&#xD;
      surgery and recovery. An important factor of this surgery's success is that the patient&#xD;
      strictly follows and takes the required course of medicines to prevent rejection of the donor&#xD;
      tissues. In order to ensure that the tissue survives and is not rejected by the patient, we&#xD;
      will continuously check various clinical values, such as blood work, tissue samples, and&#xD;
      x-ray images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to offer facial segment transplantation as a reconstructive option to patients&#xD;
      with severe facial deformities. We feel facial transplantation has now become a viable option&#xD;
      for certain patients. If successful, this will contribute to future research and development&#xD;
      in the field of tissue transplantation. Most importantly, our goal is to offer patients the&#xD;
      best option in reconstruction to restore both form and function who otherwise do not have&#xD;
      another option.&#xD;
