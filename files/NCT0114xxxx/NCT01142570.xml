  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, comparative, double-blind controlled&#xD;
      clinical study intended to establish 1) the optimal method of determining calorie&#xD;
      requirements and 2) the optimal amount of protein supply in chronically ventilated patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in a chronic ventilation department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be randomly allocated to receive calories as dictated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Harriss-Benedict formula (Group 1) or Indirect Calorimetry (Group 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one week of admission to the hospital department and study enrollment we will review&#xD;
      the first results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After seven days of hospitalization and study enrollment patients who have not been weaned&#xD;
      from the ventilator, will be divided into three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients in the first group will receive caloric support calculated by the HARRISS&#xD;
           BENEDICT equation and protein dose of 1.1 to 1.5 grams per kilogram weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients in the second group will receive caloric support as measured by indirect&#xD;
           calorimetry and will receive protein at 1.1 grams per kilogram weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients in the third group will receive caloric support as measured by indirect&#xD;
           calorimetry and will receive protein at a dose of 1.5 grams per kilogram weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome of treatment results will be performed after one ,four and eight weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Length of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Development and progression of pressure ulcers&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Infectious diseases incidence&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Amount of insulin needed for glucose control&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Length of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Readmission to Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Mortality rate&#xD;
