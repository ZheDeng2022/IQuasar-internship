      Mouthwash based on medicinal plants and propolis can be easily found in the Brazilian market&#xD;
      even if it has not been tested in reliable clinical trials on its efficacy or possible&#xD;
      unpleasant side effects like the ones which alter the hard and soft oral tissues. The aim of&#xD;
      this study was to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of an alcohol-free mouthwash&#xD;
      containing 5% green propolis (MGP 5%) on the control of plaque and gingivitis. Were chosen&#xD;
      twenty-five subjects that are UFMG employees and individuals who would begin treatment on an&#xD;
      extension project called Supportive Periodontal Therapy at the Faculty of Dentistry of&#xD;
      Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, from August to December 2009. The&#xD;
      subjects went through a dental prophylaxis before starting rinse. They were then instructed&#xD;
      to rinse twice a day for a minute, immediately after brushing (morning and night), using the&#xD;
      10 ml of the MGP 5%. After 45 and 90 days using the product the individuals returned for a&#xD;
      clinical evaluation which considered changes in the soft and hard oral tissues and involved&#xD;
      collecting plaque and gingivitis indexes. On their last appointment the subjects answered a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their level of appreciation and acceptability of the mouthwash.&#xD;
      Compliance with the treatment was also evaluated through an attendance form. For the&#xD;
      statistic analysis we used BioEstat 4.0 and Excel 2007.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The first reference to mouthrinse as a formal practice is credited to Chinese medicine, about&#xD;
      2700 B.C.E., to treatment the diseases of the gums (Fischman, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that compose oral biofilms produces many&#xD;
      metabolites that induce gingival inflammation (that is, gingivitis). Gingivitis can lead to&#xD;
      periodontitis, a condition in which gingival and bone tissues are destroyed. The majority of&#xD;
      the population may not perform mechanical plaque removal sufficiently. Thus, antimicrobial&#xD;
      mouthrinses that improve daily home care may provide an effective way of removing or&#xD;
      controlling bacterial plaque to limit gingivitis and periodontitis (Haffajee et al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main indications are either the improvement of dental health (plaque and gingivitis&#xD;
      elimination in particular) or the prevention of infections caused by bacteria of the oral&#xD;
      cavity in specific situations, such as tooth extraction, intraoral surgical procedures or&#xD;
      immune suppression due to cancer therapy or transplantation. The use of antimicrobial&#xD;
      mouthrinses has been proposed to reduce the levels of oral bacteria, specially Streptococcus&#xD;
      mutans (Kocak et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, it has been shown that chemotherapeutic mouthrinses are an effective adjunct to&#xD;
      regular brushing and flossing for patients with gingivitis, providing a clinically&#xD;
      significant benefit in the reduction of plaque and gingivitis (Haffajee et al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propolis is a resinous substance collected by honeybees from buds and exudates of certain&#xD;
      trees and plants, and stored inside their hives. It has been used in folk medicine from&#xD;
      ancient times to treat various ailments (Kunimasa et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The action against microorganisms is an essential characteristic of propolis, and humans have&#xD;
      used it for centuries for its pharmaceutical properties (Kalogeropoulos et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibacterial activity of propolis is reported due to flavonoids, aromatic acids and&#xD;
      esters present in resins. Galangin, pinocebrin and pinostrobin are known as the flavonoids&#xD;
      agents more effective against bacteria. Ferulic acid and caffeic acid also contribute to the&#xD;
      bactericidal action of propolis (Marcucci, 1995). Thus, the purpose of this study was to show&#xD;
      a preliminary evidence about the effect of an alcohol-free mouthwash containing 5% of green&#xD;
      propolis for the control of plaque and gingivitis in subjects for three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design study and Product tested&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was an interventional study of phase II for three months, follow up type, and was&#xD;
      conducted at the Faculty of Dentistry of Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from&#xD;
      August 2009 to April 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alcohol-free mouthwash containing 5% green propolis (MGP 5%) used in that study was&#xD;
      handled according to our request by PharmaNéctar ® (Belo Horizonte), within the standards&#xD;
      required by ANVISA (Brazil, 2000) and within the requirements of ISO 9001 and GMP&#xD;
      International (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty five subjects, age varying from 18 to 60 years (median age 35,92 ±9,7), with generally&#xD;
      good health, not pregnant nor breastfeeding, who met the following inclusion criteria, were&#xD;
      included into the study: a minimum of 20 sound, natural teeth; a mean plaque index (PI)&#xD;
      (Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index, 1970) of at least 1.5; a mean&#xD;
      gingival index (GI) (Talbott modification Gingival Index of the Löe-Silness, 1977) of at&#xD;
      least 1.0. Subjects with orthodontic appliances or removable prosthetics, tumors of the soft&#xD;
      or hard oral tissues, advanced periodontal disease, or that received antibiotic therapy 2&#xD;
      weeks before the start of the study or that presented hipersensibility to propolis were&#xD;
      excluded. Third molars and those teeth with cervical restorations or prosthetic crowns were&#xD;
      not included in the tooth count. The selection of participants was made by convenience, based&#xD;
      especially on the availability for the study, along the study was conducted. All subjects&#xD;
      read and signed informed consent forms before the start of the study. The protocol for the&#xD;
      study was approved by the local ethical review committee (Committee of Bioethics in Research&#xD;
      at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (COEP/UFMG - 0600/09).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing mouthwash&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination baseline consisted of a complete soft and hard tissues examination that was&#xD;
      performed to register the condition of oral mucosa, so that any changes in the course of the&#xD;
      study could be identified , making assessment to whether these changes could be related to&#xD;
      the mouthrinse. The gingivitis of the mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual,&#xD;
      midlingual, and distolingual, of all elegible teeth was scored using the Talbott modification&#xD;
      Gingival Index of the Löe-Silness - GI, 1977, in which the gum was scored on a four-point&#xD;
      scale from 0 (absence of inflammation) to 3 ( severe inflammation). The supragingival plaque&#xD;
      of the mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, and distolingual, of&#xD;
      all elegible teeth was scored using the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index&#xD;
      - PI, 1970. Previously, disclosing with erythrosine 3% solution, plaque was scored on a six&#xD;
      point scale from 0 (no plaque) to 5 (plaque covers two-thirds or more of the tooth surface).&#xD;
      Of the mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, and distolingual, of&#xD;
      all scorable teeth was scored using the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index&#xD;
      - PI, 1970. There were also evaluated Severity Plaque Index and Severity Gingival Index&#xD;
      (Palomo et al., 1989; Volpe et al.,1993). These index measured the rate of the surface that&#xD;
      had high count of plaque (count similar to 3, 4, 5 of the modification Quigley-Hein Plaque&#xD;
      Index, 1970) and high gingival index (count similar to 2,3 modification Gingival Index of the&#xD;
      Löe-Silness, 1977.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These examinations were all repeated after 45 and 90 days of use of mouthrinse. After&#xD;
      baseline examination, each subject received a complete oral prophylaxis, which included the&#xD;
      removal of all supragingival plaque and calculus deposits. Soon after, the subjects received&#xD;
      the 5% green propolis-containing mouthrinse alcohol-free (MGP 5%) and a toothbrush. They were&#xD;
      instructed to brush their teeth as usual and to rinse with the 10mL of MGP 5%, twice a day,&#xD;
      for one minute, right after their meals in the morning and at night. Participants were&#xD;
      required not to use another mouthrinse throughout the study. When new supplies were issued,&#xD;
      subjects returned their used materials, so that compliance to theproduct could be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproducibility of clinical examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      All examinations were conducted by a single examiner trained to optimize the consistency of&#xD;
      the study. Prior to the study, the adviser trained the dental examiner, as a &quot;gold standard&quot;,&#xD;
      directing him to introduce the periodontal probe, gently, into the gingival sulcus,, keeping&#xD;
      the instrument parallel to the long axis of the tooth, sliding it from the distal to the&#xD;
      mesial so delicately in the buccal and lingual surface of each evaluated tooth. For&#xD;
      calibration, there was examined nine subjects not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the plaque index it was performed a theoretical calibration. Soon after, photos were used&#xD;
      to obtain a standardization intra-examiner. The photos were exhibited by the adviser to the&#xD;
      examiner that noted the values of plaque index corresponding to each picture. After 15 days,&#xD;
      the same pictures were exposed to the examiner that noted again the values of plaque index.&#xD;
      Next, the plaque index obtained in the first and second time was compared to verify the level&#xD;
      of intra-examiner. Then, we obtained a kappa value of 0.73, considered a substantial estimate&#xD;
      of reliability (Landis &amp; Koch, 1977).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical package BioEstat version 4.0 was used for data analysis in this study. The&#xD;
      average adjusted in the baseline for both scores of the modified Plaque Index of Quigley-Hein&#xD;
      (1970) and modified Gingival Index of Löe-Silness (1977) as for the corresponding severity&#xD;
      scores, for being a non-parametric distribution, were compared through covariance analysis,&#xD;
      by Friedman test for data obtained at 45 and 90 days of the study. All statistical tests of&#xD;
      hypotheses had two strands and was considered a significance level of p&lt; 0.05 (Allen et al.&#xD;
      1998; Arweiler et al., 2001).&#xD;
