  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are interested in learning how appetite responds to pasta containing different&#xD;
      amounts of protein and fiber. In this research study, subjects will be asked to eat as much&#xD;
      as they want of pasta containing different amounts of protein and fiber mixtures, thereafter&#xD;
      subjects will describe their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat for 3 hours&#xD;
      afterwards. Subjects will be asked to do this on three separate occasions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, 3-arm, treatment-controlled, within-subjects, 3-hour postprandial&#xD;
      crossover study to evaluate the satiation effects of pasta formulations on lunch intake in&#xD;
      healthy weight women. The study design will test 3 varying pasta formulations (2 experimental&#xD;
      and 1 standard control) in a lunch setting in relatively healthy unrestrained women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will require one initial screening visit (approximately 1 hour) and three study&#xD;
      visits each lasting approximately 4 hours. All visits should be done in 1 month. We are&#xD;
      looking for healthy, non-smoking women older than 18 years of age with no significant medical&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will determine subject eligibility through height, weight and&#xD;
      waist circumference measurements, blood glucose test (finger prick) and eating, health,&#xD;
      exercise and mood surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will have 3 study visits. At each visits,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to consume as much as they would like of the pasta meal and beverage&#xD;
      in a lunch setting and thereafter will be followed for 3 hours assessing subjective feelings&#xD;
      of satiety. The lunch meal will be provided 5 hours after a standardized breakfast (usual&#xD;
      breakfast for each subject at the same time of day on each study visit day). During the&#xD;
      course of the study, subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual level of activity&#xD;
      and diet. Four day food records will be maintained throughout the course of the study.&#xD;

    <measure>To investigate the effect of pasta formulations incorporated into a lunch meal on satiation (meal termination) as determined by energy intake of the meal along with subjective responses on visual analog scales and subsequent food intake.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hour post prandial study</time_frame>
    <description>Meals will be provided 4 1/2 hours after a standardized breakfast (subject's own usual breakfast in the same quantity at the same time before each study visit) and subjects will be able to eat as much of the pasta as they would like and may request more if desired. Immediately thereafter, subjects will record satiety responses at 0 min (immediately post consumption), 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 on a visual analog scale (VAS). The subject will answer a series of questions on the VAS at each respective time point describing their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat.</description>
