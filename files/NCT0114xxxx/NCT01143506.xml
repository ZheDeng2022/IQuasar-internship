      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The experience of volition that accompanies voluntary movement can be divided into the&#xD;
      sense of will, or deciding to move, and the sense of agency, or feeling that the movement&#xD;
      just made was self-generated. Very little is known regarding the neurological origin of this&#xD;
      sense of volition. Previous research has shown that a particular part of the brain, the&#xD;
      parietal lobe, is involved in our inner sense that we control the movements we make.&#xD;
      Researchers are interested in determining if this sense relies on sensory information from&#xD;
      moving fingers reaching the parietal lobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the brain regions responsible for the sense of volition and the associated&#xD;
      sense of agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy right-handed individuals between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve a screening visit and two testing visits. The screening visit&#xD;
           will last 30 minutes to 1 hour, and the testing visits will each last 3 to 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each testing visit, participants will have a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
           scan, electroencephalography (EEG), and electromyography (EMG). The MRI scan and EEG&#xD;
           will be done during a movement task that involves the thumb, second finger, and fifth&#xD;
           finger of one hand. EMG will be used to monitor movements and muscle activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the second testing visit, participants will receive a nerve block using&#xD;
           anesthetic, followed by the MRI, EEG, EMG and movement task. The nerve block will&#xD;
           temporarily numb and prevent the movement of parts of the hand and fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the MRI scan and EEG recording, participants will be asked to rate how much&#xD;
           control they felt they had over choosing whether to move, and how much control they felt&#xD;
           they had in actually making the movements.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the brain regions responsible for the&#xD;
      sense of volition and the associated sense of agency. Nerve blocks will be used to interfere&#xD;
      with movement and/or sensory feedback from movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial studies will evaluate brain activity during the attempt to move different fingers&#xD;
      after ulnar nerve block using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) and surface electromyography (EMG). Subjects will attempt to&#xD;
      move their fifth finger, their second finger and the thumb. These fingers will also be moved&#xD;
      by the experimenter as a passive condition. The paradigm will be done once without anesthesia&#xD;
      and once after ulnar nerve block. For both fMRI, EEG and EMG, analysis will be done with&#xD;
      single event design. As our primary outcome, we hypothesize that subtracting the activation&#xD;
      associated with attempting to move a paralyzed and anesthetized 5th finger, as well as the&#xD;
      activation associated with the passive movement of the 5th finger without anesthesia, from&#xD;
      that of normal movement of the same finger (without anesthesia), will show activation&#xD;
      remaining in the inferior parietal lobule, which may be the area responsible for the feeling&#xD;
      of agency. The activation associated with the attempt to move second finger, which will be&#xD;
      paralyzed but only partially anesthetized, will be a secondary outcome of this study, as will&#xD;
      other subtractions of activation associated with the three fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI: Comparison of the BOLD signal in different brain regions with the different finger&#xD;
      movements or attempted finger movements. The primary outcome measure is the difference in&#xD;
      BOLD activation in the inferior parietal lobule between that associated with the attempt to&#xD;
      move the 5th finger after anesthesia compared to the activation associated with moving the&#xD;
      5th finger actively minus the 5th finger being moved passively (with no anesthesia).&#xD;
      Restated, from the trial with no anesthesia, the activation of active 5th finger movement&#xD;
      (which reflects will (W), motor program (P), sensory feedback (S) and agency (A)) minus&#xD;
      passive 5th finger movement (which reflects S only) will be compared to the activation from&#xD;
      the attempt to move the 5th finger after ulnar block (which reflects W and P only). By&#xD;
      comparing (W+P+S+A minus S) to (W+P) in the region of the inferior parietal lobule, we expect&#xD;
      to see the activation associated with A, agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG/EMG: Movement-related cortical potentials will be compared with the different finger&#xD;
      movements, using EMG to mark the onset of movement; these will be secondary outcomes.&#xD;
