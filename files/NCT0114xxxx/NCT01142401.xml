    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well fulvestrant works with or without bortezomib&#xD;
      in treating patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast&#xD;
      cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by lowering the&#xD;
      amount of estrogen the body makes. Bortezomib may stop the growth of breast cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
      It is not yet known whether fulvestrant is more effective with or without bortezomib in&#xD;
      treating breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the addition of bortezomib to fulvestrant improves median progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) compared with fulvestrant alone in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor&#xD;
      (ER)-positive locally advanced inoperable or metastatic breast cancer who have disease that&#xD;
      is resistant to aromatase inhibitor therapy (Arms A versus [vs.] B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the addition of bortezomib to fulvestrant improves the clinical benefit&#xD;
      rate (defined as objective response plus stable disease for at least 24 weeks from day +1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the percent of patients, treated with fulvestrant alone and fulvestrant plus&#xD;
      bortezomib, who remain progression-free 24 weeks from day +1 (Arms A vs. B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the overall survival of patients treated with fulvestrant alone and&#xD;
      fulvestrant plus bortezomib (Arms A, B, C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the adverse event profile in patients treated with fulvestrant alone and&#xD;
      fulvestrant plus bortezomib (Arms A, B, C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the clinical benefit rate at 12 and 24 weeks of fulvestrant plus bortezomib&#xD;
      in patients who have progressed on the fulvestrant alone arm and crossover to receive the&#xD;
      combination (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform an exploratory analysis of the effects of bortezomib (plus fulvestrant) in&#xD;
      intratumoral nuclear/cytoplasmic ER ratio, unfolded protein response (BiP), apoptosis&#xD;
      (cleaved caspase 3), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) phospho&#xD;
      c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in patients with tumors accessible to biopsy who consent to&#xD;
      optional post-treatment biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine with cyclin D1 expression in pretreatment tumor specimens (from metastatic&#xD;
      disease or the primary tumor if the former is not available) is predictive of clinical&#xD;
      benefit with fulvestrant-bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (Arms A or B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 (days -14, 1, and 15 of&#xD;
      course 1 only). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease may crossover to arm C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm A and bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1,&#xD;
      8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive fulvestrant IM on day 1 and bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
