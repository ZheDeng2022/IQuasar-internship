      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most studies of infectious agents have focused on specific microbes, such as human&#xD;
           papillomaviruses and cervical cancer, and the hepatitis B and C virus and liver cancer.&#xD;
           The skin and many internal areas (including the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract)&#xD;
           also contain large numbers of naturally occurring microbes, but these areas have not&#xD;
           received as much study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some of the infectious agents that naturally reside in the body may have an effect on&#xD;
           health. The study of naturally occurring microbes in the human body is a new area of&#xD;
           research, and much remains to be learned regarding the extent and pattern of their&#xD;
           appearance and appropriate techniques for testing them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in collecting human samples from areas known to contain&#xD;
           naturally occurring microbes. These samples will provide baseline information for&#xD;
           further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect a set of study samples from individuals who have applied to participate in a&#xD;
      study assessing the relationship among the bacteria H. pylori, peptic ulcer disease, and&#xD;
      gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between the ages of 21 and 65 who are participating in the clinical trial&#xD;
      entitled A Phase III Randomized Trial of Three Antibiotic Regimens to Eradicate Helicobacter&#xD;
      Pylori.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will collect oral (saliva), colonic, and skin swab samples from study&#xD;
           participants who tested positive for the presence of the H. pylori bacteria. These&#xD;
           samples will be collected at the three study visits (enrollment, 6 weeks, and 1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will also collect samples from people who applied for the clinical trial but&#xD;
           did not test positive for H. pylori. These samples will be collected at the enrollment&#xD;
           visit and 1 year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be collected at each study visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study of infectious agents and their role in disease is not new. Most efforts in this&#xD;
      area have focused on specific agents, such as human papillomaviruses and cervical cancer,&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori (HP) and gastric diseases and carcinoma, hepatitis B and C virus and&#xD;
      liver cancer, to name a few. The body s skin and mucosal surface s play host to microbial&#xD;
      communities (the microbiome) whose membership outnumbers our own somatic and germ cells by an&#xD;
      order of magnitude or more. The skin, oral, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract are all densely&#xD;
      colonized surfaces . Recent technological advances, however, have made exploration of the&#xD;
      microbiome, an understudied area, feasible. It is reasonable to hypothesize that some of the&#xD;
      infectious agents that naturally reside in the body may impact health, or that perhaps the&#xD;
      balance between the various micro-organisms has an effect on health. This new field of study&#xD;
      has much promise that could lead to important new discoveries of how infectious agents are&#xD;
      associated with disease and how environmental (e.g., diet) and host responses (e.g., immune&#xD;
      response and genetics) to these agents determine chronic patterns of colonization and&#xD;
      subsequent disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, because the study of the human microbiome is a new area of research, much remains to&#xD;
      be learned regarding: a) the extent and pattern of the microbiome at various sites, b)&#xD;
      determinants of these patterns (e.g., consistency over time), and c) optimal assay&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to launching large-scale epidemiological studies to evaluate the association between&#xD;
      microbiome and disease (including cancer), it is crucial to conduct well-designed,&#xD;
      systematic, methodological studies to address some of the issues listed above. These&#xD;
      methodological studies will begin to provide the baseline information that could be used to&#xD;
      plan for, and conduct disease association studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to initiate a study to collect oral, skin, vaginal (only women), penile (men only)&#xD;
      and colonic samples at enrollment and again 6 months later on up to 150 individuals. Our&#xD;
      objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the microbiome heterogeneity between individuals across specimen types -&#xD;
           colonic/oral/skin/vaginal/penile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the microbiome heterogeneity within individuals (over time and across&#xD;
           specimen types - colonic/oral/skin/vaginal/penile).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of self-reported antibiotic treatment on the oral, colonic, skin,&#xD;
           penile and vaginal microbiomes diversity and richness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the associations between colonic microbiome and gastrointestinal symptom&#xD;
           disorders (assessed by the Rome III questionnaire - a detailed diagnostic questionnaire&#xD;
           for adult functional gastrointestinal disorder), inflammatory markers (initially using&#xD;
           measures of C-reactive protein (CRP)), and demographic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the reproducibility of assays used to measure the microbiota and compare the&#xD;
           diversity and abundance determined by the different assays.&#xD;

        In Hojancha, region of Guanacaste, Costa Rica, where our study will be conducted, a&#xD;
        population based census was completed in March 2009 and will serve as the basis for&#xD;
        enrollment, allowing for recruitment of a representative sample of the population. Eligible&#xD;
        participants must be willing to return for one follow- up visit: 6 months after the initial&#xD;
        enrollment visit and willing to allow submission of blood for assays of serum immune&#xD;
        markers, host genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, and to provide consent for&#xD;
        use of the specimens. Those individuals with any known medical conditions that may limit&#xD;
        life expectancy in the short term (including but not @@@limited to: congestive heart&#xD;
        failure, renal failure, prior malignancy, or any other chronic disease that limits&#xD;
        functional status to the extent that the individual cannot perform light work or the usual&#xD;
        activities of daily self care) are ineligible for inclusion in the study. Female&#xD;
        participants must not be pregnant.@@@&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who meet the age criteria of 18 years and older and are interested in the study&#xD;
        will be asked to provide written informed consent. Participants must be willing to reside&#xD;
        in the study area for the study duration (6 months). Those individuals with any known&#xD;
        medical conditions that may limit life expectancy in the short term (including but not&#xD;
        limited to: congestive heart failure, renal failure, prior malignancy, or any other chronic&#xD;
        disease that limits functional status to the extent that the individual cannot perform&#xD;
        light work or the usual activities of daily self care) are ineligible for inclusion in the&#xD;
        study. Female participants must not be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who report recent antibiotic use will be deferred and enrolled after they have&#xD;
        been at least 6 weeks without antibiotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In Hojancha, region of Guanacaste, Costa Rica, where our study will be conducted, a&#xD;
        population based census was completed in March 2009 and will serve as the basis for&#xD;
        enrollment, allowing for recruitment of a representative sample of the population. The same&#xD;
        census was used to identify participants for another study in the same area. Therefore,&#xD;
        because we will use the same census, we will exclude participants that were enrolled in the&#xD;
        other study. Eligible participants must be willing to return for one follow-up visit: 6&#xD;
        months after the initial enrollment visit and willing to allow submission of blood for&#xD;
        assays of serum immune markers, host genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, and&#xD;
        to provide consent for use of the specimens.&#xD;
