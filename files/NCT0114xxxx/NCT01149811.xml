      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the safety and tolerability of two dose&#xD;
      regimens of fipamezole in adult patients with Parkinson's Disease who are receiving levodopa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. While&#xD;
      treatment with dopaminergic agents like levodopa, the mainstay of treatment, is effective in&#xD;
      the early phases of the disease, their benefits decrease with disease progression, and&#xD;
      problems such as dyskinesia and on-off phenomenon begin to manifest. This study investigates&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of fipamezole at two dose levels in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling method used was simple random sampling.&#xD;

    <measure>To compare the safety and tolerability of two dose regimens of fipamezole orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) in adult patients with Parkinson's Disease who are receiving levodopa</measure>
    <time_frame>Days -14 to 49</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated by assessing adverse events (AEs), vital signs (supine and orthostatic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, radial pulse rate), 12-lead ECG, blood and urine laboratory panels, and physical examination. Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease will be assessed using Hoehn and Yahr scale during the 'on' state.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Subject is a man or woman between 30 and 75 years of age, inclusive, with intact oral&#xD;
             mucosa at Screening (Visit 1) and Randomization (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease defined according to the UK&#xD;
             Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnosis criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has been receiving a stable regimen of at least three daily administrations of&#xD;
             levodopa (with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor), with no dose changes for at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to Randomization (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is rated at stage 2 to 4 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If currently taking other medications (other than levodopa), subject must be on a&#xD;
             stable regimen, defined as no dose changes for at least 1 month prior to Randomization&#xD;
             (Visit 2).&#xD;
