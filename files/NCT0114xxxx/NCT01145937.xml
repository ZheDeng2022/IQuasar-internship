      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keratoconus is a progressive, non-inflammatory corneal disease in which irregular refractive&#xD;
      properties of the cornea result in loss of visual acuity. Treatment is aimed at improving&#xD;
      vision, principally using (rigid) contact lenses. With progression of the disease&#xD;
      non-correctable refractive abnormalities and/or corneal scars arise. For these advanced&#xD;
      stages of keratoconus, a corneal transplant is the only treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New surgical grafting modalities have been developed to create partial thickness grafts,&#xD;
      according to the location of corneal pathology. For keratoconus, transplanting only the&#xD;
      anterior corneal lamellae lowers long-term graft rejection rates. We utilize a method to&#xD;
      enhance the safety of the grafting procedure while better visual outcomes are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the additional value of partial endothelial trepanation (PET) in an anterior&#xD;
      lamellar keratoplasty (ALKP) procedure in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with&#xD;
      keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled interventional trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 18 years old with keratoconus in whom contact lens correction is unsuccessful&#xD;
      and who are not suitable for corneal crosslinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to corneal grafting techniques; partial endothelial&#xD;
      trepanation in addition to an anterior lamellar keratoplasty (i.e. the PET group) or a&#xD;
      regular ALKP procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of per-operative perforation. Secondary, factors contributing to treatment safety and&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no extra burden or risk associated with participation in this study. All&#xD;
      measurements are part of normal clinical practice. Adequate experience is available with both&#xD;
      surgical techniques. Study participation has no effect on donor selection. If partial&#xD;
      endothelial trepanation (PET) is associated with lower complication rates and better visual&#xD;
      outcomes, this might be beneficial in terms of morbidity.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keratoconus is a progressive, non-inflammatory corneal disease in which irregular refractive&#xD;
      properties of the cornea result in loss of visual acuity. Keratoconus usually arise in&#xD;
      adolescence, is bilateral and has an estimated incidence of 1:2000. The aetiology of&#xD;
      keratoconus is largely unknown, genetic predispositions are currently under investigation.&#xD;
      Treatment is aimed at improving vision, principally using (rigid) contact lenses. With&#xD;
      progression of the disease non-correctable refractive abnormalities and/or corneal scars&#xD;
      arise. For these advanced stages of keratoconus, a corneal transplant is the only treatment&#xD;
      modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first corneal transplant for keratoconus was conducted in 1936 by Ramon Castroviejo in&#xD;
      New York's Columbia Presbyterian Medical Centre. Ever since, corneal grafting is subject to&#xD;
      many technical developments. For over 70 years, a technique is used in which a circular donor&#xD;
      disc is cut with a trephine and sutured in a concordantly prepared recipient, called a&#xD;
      perforating keratoplasty (PKP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of refractive surgery in the years 1990, equipment appeared to split a cornea&#xD;
      in horizontal lamellae. This made partial thickness grafting possible, tailoring grafts&#xD;
      according to the nature and location of corneal pathology. For keratoconus, only the anterior&#xD;
      part of the cornea needs to be transplanted. The posterior (endothelial) part is particularly&#xD;
      involved in graft rejections. The chance of graft rejection decreases significantly when the&#xD;
      patient's endothelium is left in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For keratoconus, this new treatment modality is called a deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty&#xD;
      (DALK). The transplanted anterior corneal thickness is maximized, and the patient retains its&#xD;
      own endothelium and Descemet membrane, owing to lower graft rejection rates and less&#xD;
      secondary cataract formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biggest drawback of a DALK procedure is the risk of inadvertent peroperative corneal&#xD;
      perforation; the lamellae is cut to thick necessitating a conversion to a complete thickness&#xD;
      graft similar to an regular PKP. To prevent inadvertent perforation, several techniques are&#xD;
      described to dissect the stroma from the posterior lying Descemet membrane and corneal&#xD;
      endothelium. Failure and perforation are described in 20-36% of cases though, leaving the&#xD;
      patient with an inferior end product and leading to poor surgical predictability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To circumvent this problem we utilize a method in which, in addition to a anterior lamellar&#xD;
      keratoplasty (ALKP), a partial endothelial trepanation (PET) is performed. This technique was&#xD;
      first performed by Massimo Busin, Villa Serena Hopsital, Forli, Italy. The endothelium en&#xD;
      Descemet are paracentrally and circular loosened, but some tissue bridges are left in place.&#xD;
      This 'island' is able to mould to the healthy donor curvature. By doing this, the surgeon can&#xD;
      retain a safer graft thickness margin leading to a lowered number of preoperative&#xD;
      perforations. The addition of PET is believed to make corneal grafting safer and more&#xD;
      predictable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research statement/question To investigate the additional value of partial endothelial&#xD;
      trepanation (PET) in a anterior lamellar keratoplasty (ALKP) procedure in terms of efficacy&#xD;
      and safety in patients with keratoconus, compared in a randomized clinical trial with a&#xD;
      regular ALKP procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Peroperative corneal perforation;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Best corrected visual acuity one year post op;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manifest refraction one year post op;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contact lens use (soft/rigid/scleral) or spectacle use;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-rated improvement questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft rejection rate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corneal endothelial function one year post op;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of DALK outcomes with atopic constitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of this research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PENTACON trial is designed to answer questions on new treatment modalities for ophthalmic&#xD;
      disease, especially keratoconus. Current available research describes various techniques for&#xD;
      a lamellar approach of corneal grafting. Most literature concerns retrospective case series,&#xD;
      susceptible to several forms of bias. With our prospective randomized approach we aim to&#xD;
      supply more clinical relevant information, especially regarding the risk of inadvertent&#xD;
      corneal perforation during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On theoretical grounds we presume that this new technique has even additional value for more&#xD;
      progressive keratoconus patients. In early keratoconus visualization during surgery is&#xD;
      generally not a big problem. In progressive keratoconus however, scarring occurs and the&#xD;
      Descemet membrane underlying the conus behaves differently. We suppose these factors lead to&#xD;
      the high corneal perforation rate of 20%. With partial endothelial trepanation larger safety&#xD;
      margins can be used and the biggest gain is to be expected in the progressive keratoconus&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to store the removed patient corneas in the UMCU Biobank. With the enrollment of&#xD;
      patients for our PENTACON trial we will gather a significant amount of keratoconus corneas.&#xD;
      In the future, we plan to conduct genetic/histopathologic research on these corneas to&#xD;
      achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying ophthalmic disease. Currently,&#xD;
      all our effort is projected on starting our treatment trial. These etiological questions will&#xD;
      be assessed in a later stage.&#xD;

    <description>Peroperative corneal perforation is the biggest drawback of currently utilized grafting procedures (ALKP, 20-30%). Our new technique is believed to be safer, by reducing the number of corneal perforations during surgery. Corneal perforation necessitates converting the procedure to a full-thickness graft with a less favourable long term rejection profile.</description>
