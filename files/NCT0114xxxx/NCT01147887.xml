      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of 26489112 on the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (blood levels) of a combination of 3 drugs administered to healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      26489112 is a drug that is being tested to see if it may be useful for a number of&#xD;
      indications including major depression. This study will compare the effects of 26489112&#xD;
      administered to healthy volunteers alone or in combination with a mixture of 3 drugs&#xD;
      consisting of midazolam (a drug used for reducing anxiety or producing drowsiness or&#xD;
      anesthesia before certain medical procedures or surgery), omeprazole (a drug used to treat&#xD;
      symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or other conditions caused by excess&#xD;
      stomach acid), and tolbutamide (a drug used for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients&#xD;
      when blood sugar cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone). Approximately 20 healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers will be enrolled and will be treated with study drug for 22 days. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be required to stay overnight at the study center to receive study treatment for 4&#xD;
      nights at the beginning of the study and for 4 nights towards the end of the study. On all&#xD;
      other occasions, volunteers will make daily visits to the study center to receive treatment&#xD;
      with study drug. Participants will take a combination of 3 drugs (omeprazole 20 mg capsule,&#xD;
      tolbutamide 500 mg tablet, and midazolam 2mg/mL liquid) orally (by mouth) or 2 tablets of&#xD;
      study drug (2648911) orally with 1 cup of water. Blood samples will be collected from study&#xD;
      participants at protocol-specified times during the study to determine the concentration of&#xD;
      each of the 4 drugs (26489112, midazolam, omeprazole, and tolbutamide) present in plasma (the&#xD;
      colorless fluid portion of blood). In addition, a blood sample will be obtained from all&#xD;
      enrolled patients before study drug administration for pharmacogenomics research (research to&#xD;
      help identify genetic markers of response, to explain variability in the data, or to address&#xD;
      emerging clinical issues). The primary outcome measure is the concentration of midazolam,&#xD;
      omeprazole, tolbutamide, and 26489112 in plasma measured by protocol-specified&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters at protocol-specified time points on Days 1-4 and Dasy 19-22.&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored during the study. Healthy volunteers will receive study drug&#xD;
      (26489112) orally (by mouth) in the morning from Day 4 through Day 21.&#xD;
