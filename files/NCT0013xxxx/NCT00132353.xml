      This training protocol has two objectives: 1) to train NINDS fellows in specialized&#xD;
      techniques for diagnosing neurological disorders, and 2) to gather data from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and from patients with various disorders needed for tests to diagnose disorders of&#xD;
      nerve, muscle, and the areas of the brain controlling movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with neurological disorders of nerve and muscle who require&#xD;
      specialized diagnostic testing may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be 18 years of&#xD;
      age or older. They are screened with a medical history and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after screening, participants undergo one or two of the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation: This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is&#xD;
           held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a&#xD;
           magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the subject may be&#xD;
           asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The stimulation&#xD;
           may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the subject may hear a click&#xD;
           and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. During the stimulation,&#xD;
           electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer, using electrodes (small&#xD;
           metal disks) attached to the skin with tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electromyography (EMG): This test measures the electrical activity of muscles and is&#xD;
           used to diagnose problems with the nerves or muscles. For surface EMG, electrodes are&#xD;
           filed with a conductive gel and taped to the skin. Needle EMG involves inserting a&#xD;
           needle into a muscle to record the electrical activity. Single fiber EMG uses&#xD;
           specialized needles that allow recording from single muscle fibers. The needle is&#xD;
           inserted into a muscle and the subject is asked to tense that muscle slightly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve conduction study: This test measures the speed with which nerves conduct&#xD;
           electrical impulses and the strength of the connection between the nerve and the muscle.&#xD;
           It is done by taping wires on the skin to record the impulses and placing a probe on the&#xD;
           skin to deliver a small electrical stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Near-nerve recording: This test is a nerve conduction study that is used to measure&#xD;
           responses from very small nerves. It uses a needle placed under the skin to record the&#xD;
           nerve response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative sensory testing: This test measures how well the subject feels vibration&#xD;
           and cold. A probe that can vibrate or cool down is attached to the subject's finger or&#xD;
           foot. The subject presses a button when he or she feels the stimulus. A computer adjusts&#xD;
           the intensity of the stimulus to find the lowest level the subject can feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve ultrasound: This test uses sound waves to examine the nerves. Warm gel is applied&#xD;
           to the skin and a probe is held on the skin surface.&#xD;

      Objective: This is a training protocol. The goal of this protocol is to train fellows in&#xD;
      advanced physiological techniques used for diagnosing neurological disorders. A secondary&#xD;
      objective of the protocol is to gather normative data for diagnostic neurophysiologic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients and healthy adult volunteers may be studied under this protocol.&#xD;
      Patients must have a clinical indication for the diagnostic test. Most patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in a primary NIH protocol, and this protocol will serve as a secondary protocol.&#xD;
      Occasionally, patients will be enrolled in this protocol as a primary protocol when they are&#xD;
      referred from hospitals that participate in the NINDS fellowship training program. Healthy&#xD;
      adults will be studied by fellows-in-training to practice a new testing procedure or to&#xD;
      provide normative data when required by changes in instrumentation or laboratory technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Testing will be performed during an outpatient clinic visit. One or two of the&#xD;
      following procedures may be performed as clinically indicated: single fiber EMG, macro-EMG,&#xD;
      near-nerve recording, single-pulse transcranial or peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation,&#xD;
      quantitative sensory testing, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, nerve&#xD;
      ultrasonography, or autonomic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: This is a training protocol. No research will be carried out under this&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
