  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants of &lt; 1500 grams of birth weight who require a &gt; 1 week mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      (breathing machine) or CPAP [continuous positive airway pressure] (oxygen at a high flow&#xD;
      through the nose) may have prolonged oxygen requirements. The nasal cannula (oxygen through&#xD;
      the nose at a low flow) is the most commonly used method of oxygen administration, despite a&#xD;
      lack of data regarding its safety and efficacy. Low birth weight infants are vulnerable to&#xD;
      obstruction from secretions and blood, as well as the presence of the nasal cannula.&#xD;
      Partially obstructed nostrils greatly increase the work of breathing. Additional potential&#xD;
      adverse effects include an increased need for suctioning, increased risk for systemic&#xD;
      infection, and inadvertent positive end expiratory pressure (CPAP). No study has been&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the nasal cannula compared to an oxygen hood (plastic&#xD;
      &quot;hood&quot; that is placed over the infant's head to provide oxygen) on gas exchange or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among infants who require supplemental oxygen (by either a nasal cannula or an oxygen hood)&#xD;
      for clinical indications, objectives the investigators hope to accomplish in a randomized&#xD;
      blinded (investigator) trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the short-term effect of different flows of oxygen by the nasal cannula&#xD;
      on transcutaneous PCO2 (PTCO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine, once optimal flow is established in Aim 1, the effect of prolonged (one&#xD;
      week) use of a nasal cannula compared to an oxygen hood on PTCO2.&#xD;

      Specific Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among low birth weight infants with a supplemental oxygen requirement, do modifications in&#xD;
      the flow (L/min) of nasal cannula gas alter the level of transcutaneous PCO2 in the short&#xD;
      term (30 minutes) or longer term (one week)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the short-term effect of different flows of oxygen by the nasal cannula&#xD;
      on transcutaneous PCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine, once optimal flow is established in Aim 1, the effect of prolonged (one&#xD;
      week) use of a nasal cannula compared to an oxygen hood on transcutaneous PCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, will be stratified based on weight (&lt;1250 grams and &gt;1250 grams),&#xD;
      as well as oxygen delivery requirement (NCPAP/mechanical ventilation) at time of enrollment.&#xD;
      Randomization will occur as soon as possible following eligibility criteria being met. All&#xD;
      enrolled infants will be randomized into one of two different sequences for evaluation of the&#xD;
      short-term effect of gas flow rate on transcutaneous PCO2 (Aim 1). Enrolled infants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned by numbered opaque envelopes containing a card that indicates the assigned&#xD;
      treatment order (block method using random number table by individuals not involved in care&#xD;
      of the infants) (one of two group sequences). Then, infants who meet eligibility criteria as&#xD;
      outlined above for Aim 2 will be randomized to either oxygen hood or ideal nasal cannula flow&#xD;
      for a period of one week, by numbered opaque envelopes containing a card that indicates the&#xD;
      assigned treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 1 of the study, enrolled infants will be randomly assigned to a sequence of either:&#xD;
      oxygen hood, followed by 1 L/min NC, ½ L/min NC, ¼ L/min NC, 1/8 L/min NC, and then oxygen&#xD;
      hood, OR oxygen hood followed by 1/8 L/min NC, ¼ L/min NC, ½ L/min NC, 1L/min NC, and then&#xD;
      oxygen hood. Infants will remain on each flow for a minimum of 30 minutes with 5 minute&#xD;
      interval readings of transcutaneous PCO2 , heart rate, and respiratory rate. The &quot;optimal&quot;&#xD;
      nasal cannula flow rate will be defined as the lowest flow rate that consistently maintains a&#xD;
      SaO2 &gt;85% with FiO2≤ 0.5 without increasing transcutaneous PCO2 more than 5 mm Hg above the&#xD;
      oxygen hood PCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 2 of the study, infants will be randomized to nasal cannula (at the optimal flow rate&#xD;
      as determined in Aim 1) or oxygen hood for a period of one week. At the end of one week&#xD;
      transcutaneous PCO2, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be monitored a total of 30 minutes&#xD;
      at 5 minute intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding: To control for feeding related changes in functional residual capacity, will&#xD;
      standardize all infants to receive continuous feeds for 2 hours prior to and resume bolus&#xD;
      feeds no sooner than 2 hours following outcome assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suctioning: As needed for secretions, otherwise not scheduled more frequent than 4 times&#xD;
      /day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylxanthines: At discretion of attending physician with recommendation that &lt;1000 gram&#xD;
      infants receive prophylactic methylxanthines [per Cochrane Collaboration finding RR 0.58 and&#xD;
      95 % CI (0.29,1.16)]. Also request no changes be made during study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diuretics: At discretion of attending physician, with recommendation that if on diuretics at&#xD;
      time of enrollment, they not be discontinued during study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation Guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation: Recommendations for reintubation will be: transcutaneous PCO2 &gt;70 or&#xD;
      pH&lt; 7.2; &gt;2 apnea/bradycardia necessitating bag mask ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NCPAP: Recommendations: may place on NCPAP if infant has multiple apnea/bradycardia (&gt;6/day&#xD;
      requiring moderate to vigorous stimulation) despite optimization of the airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal cannula: May increase nasal cannula flow or change from oxygen hood if saturations &lt;85&#xD;
      consistently for more than 1 hour on a FiO2 of 1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On entry into Aim 1, baseline variables that will be recorded include gender, gestational&#xD;
      age, birth weight, post-natal age, diuretic use, methylxanthine use, oxygen delivery&#xD;
      requirement (NCPAP, mechanical ventilation), and duration of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Outcome Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Aim 1 will determine the &quot;optimal&quot; nasal cannula flow rate, defined by the lowest flow&#xD;
      rate that consistently maintains a SaO2 &gt;85% on a FiO2 &lt;0.5 without increasing transcutaneous&#xD;
      PCO2 more than 5 mmHg above the oxygen hood PCO2. Also plan to analyze average heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Outcome Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Aim 2, baseline variables on entry include the same as those listed above in Aim 1. At&#xD;
      the conclusion of Aim 2, will record necessity of return to NCPAP or mechanical ventilation;&#xD;
      if the addition of methylxanthine or diuretics or steroids were necessary; and if sepsis&#xD;
      (defined as by positive blood culture/ treated with antibiotics &gt; 5 days) occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 outcome: The assessment of the association between oxygen flow and transcutaneous PCO2&#xD;
      in order to determine ideal nasal cannula flow is accomplished by graphing the average&#xD;
      transcutaneous PCO2 measurement obtained for each L/min flow. Each enrolled patient will have&#xD;
      transcutaneous PCO2 recorded every five minutes and will remain on each flow of oxygen for&#xD;
      thirty minutes. Then an average of the 6 transcutaneous PCO2 readings will be calculated for&#xD;
      each flow rate. All recorded data averages will then be plotted on a graph for each&#xD;
      individual patient. From this graph the flow at which minimal further change in PCO2 is&#xD;
      obtained is the ideal flow for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Outcome: The assessment of the change in PCO2 at the end of one week among the two&#xD;
      treatment groups will be accomplished by statistical analysis. At the conclusion of one week&#xD;
      of therapy to assigned arm of therapy transcutaneous recordings of PCO2 for a period of&#xD;
      thirty minutes at five minute intervals will be made. These recordings will then be compared&#xD;
      to baseline recordings made during Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study clinicians and bedside nurses will be difficult to blind to intervention group. The&#xD;
      individual recording the transcutaneous PCO2 will be blinded to the flow of nasal cannula,&#xD;
      during the outcome assessment for Aim 1. A second individual will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      assignment during outcome assessment recordings of Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to demonstrate a difference as large as one standard deviation, will require a&#xD;
      sample size of 44. This calculation is based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Deviation: No data is available to predict the standard deviation Alpha of 0.05,&#xD;
      Beta =1-0.9= 0.1; using the two sided t-test each group needs 22 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the small size of the study, there will not be an interim analysis. Hypoxia and&#xD;
      respiratory distress can be associated with poor outcome. Any patients developing significant&#xD;
      respiratory distress, as outlined by above reintubation and NCPAP recommendations, will be&#xD;
      taken off NC or oxygen hood and be placed back on assigned arm of treatment when attending&#xD;
      physician determines infant is clinically able. Given the small study size and low&#xD;
      expectations of severe adverse events, we do not plan a scheduled formal DSMB process.&#xD;
      Infants in the study will be monitored for serious adverse events that are study related&#xD;
      (e.g. respiratory distress necessitating escalation of care). If more than 6 such events&#xD;
      occur during the course of the study, an independent ad hoc DSMB (including at least one&#xD;
      neonatologist and one biostatistician) will be convened to make a judgment regarding&#xD;
      continuation of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following analysis plan has been designed to allow every randomized infant to be included&#xD;
      in the intention to treat analysis, regardless of whether they require reintubation, or&#xD;
      NCPAP. All infants will be assigned a rank at baseline and at outcome (1 week) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants on oxygen delivered by nasal cannula or oxygen hood will be ranked according to&#xD;
           delta (change) transcutaneous PCO2 , and this subgroup will receive the lowest ranks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants on oxygen hood who require nasal cannula or infants on nasal cannula who require&#xD;
           higher flow will be assigned a higher rank than infants who remained on oxygen hood or&#xD;
           did not require increased flow on nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants who require NCPAP or mechanical ventilation will be assigned the highest rank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rank sum test will be conducted to compare the two groups.&#xD;
