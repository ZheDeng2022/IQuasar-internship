      The FSGS Clinical Trial is a multi-center, prospective, controlled, open label randomized&#xD;
      trial designed to determine if treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in conjunction with&#xD;
      pulse steroids is superior to treatment with Cyclosporine-A (CSA) in inducing remission from&#xD;
      proteinuria over 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background/Rationale. Primary FSGS is a leading cause of end stage renal disease in both&#xD;
      children and adults, with complete loss of kidney function in 50% of patients over 10 years.&#xD;
      Evidence-based treatment guidelines for FSGS have not been developed because of the lack of&#xD;
      controlled studies and the small number of patients included in most reports. Over the past&#xD;
      decade, a number of studies have reported therapeutic efficacy for treatment with&#xD;
      Cyclosporine-A (CSA) in patients with nephrotic syndrome including patients with steroid&#xD;
      resistant FSGS. There have been two controlled trials of treatment with CSA in steroid&#xD;
      resistant FSGS, one in children and one in adult patients. Consequently, CSA is the only&#xD;
      medication that has been documented to be efficacious in a controlled trial in both children&#xD;
      and adults with steroid resistant FSGS. The experience with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with steroid resistant FSGS has been limited to uncontrolled trials&#xD;
      in adult patients and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population. The patient population consists of children and adults between the ages&#xD;
      of 2 and 40 years with steroid resistant FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. The experimental design is a multi-center, prospective, controlled, open label&#xD;
      randomized trial comparing two treatment regimens, CSA vs. MMF/Pulse Steroids. The treatment&#xD;
      regimens in both arms also include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy and&#xD;
      alternate day low dose prednisone. The CSA and MMF/Pulse steroid treatment regimens will be&#xD;
      implemented over the first 26 weeks after randomization and continued to 52 weeks if a&#xD;
      response in proteinuria occurs. The ACE inhibitor component continues for an additional 26&#xD;
      weeks after withdrawal of initial therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistical Structure. Participants are recruited at over 130 participating sites in North&#xD;
      America which are affiliated with one of five Core Coordinating Centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives. The primary objective of the trial is to determine if treatment with&#xD;
      MMF/Pulse steroids is superior to treatment with CSA in inducing remission from proteinuria&#xD;
      over 12 months. The main secondary objective is to determine if treatment with MMF/Pulse&#xD;
      steroids is superior to treatment with CSA in inducing remissions which persist for at least&#xD;
      6 months following withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy but while maintaining ACEI or&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biorepository Specimens. Collection of specimens for biological and DNA repositories will&#xD;
      serve as a national resource for ancillary studies investigating the pathogenesis of FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapeutic Regimens and Follow-up. The study treatment duration for a randomized&#xD;
      patient depends on the level of response to treatment as follows: 26 weeks if neither a&#xD;
      partial or complete remission occurs at the 26-week visit; 52 weeks if there is a partial or&#xD;
      complete remission at 26 weeks but not at 52 weeks, and 78 weeks if partial or complete&#xD;
      remissions are recorded at both the 26- and 52-week visits. For all patients low intensity&#xD;
      follow-up for long-term assessment of renal function is maintained after termination of the&#xD;
      therapeutic regimens until September, 2008.&#xD;

        -  Allergy to study medications, and 17) Inability to consent/assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic Regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSA Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSA: The initial target dose for CSA is 5 - 6 mg/kg per day divided into two daily doses.&#xD;
      Dosage is subsequently adjusted to maintain a 12-hour trough CSA blood concentration of 100 -&#xD;
      250 ng/ml. CSA is maintained for 12 months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMF/Pulse Steroid Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMF: The target dose for MMF is 25-36 mg/kg per day with a maximum dose of 2 g/day divided&#xD;
      into two daily doses, maintained for 12 months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone: The target dose for dexamethasone is 0.9 mg/kg per dose, with a maximum dose&#xD;
      of 40 mg, given as a single dose on two consecutive days at the start of weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,&#xD;
      6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46 and 50 for a total of 46&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Treatment Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACEI: A maximally tolerated dose of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril&#xD;
      will be attempted in three steps at two-week intervals. The target maintenance dose ranges&#xD;
      from 0.4 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg depending on the patient's weight. Patients who are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate treatment with ACEI or who have been previously intolerant of ACEI will receive the&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) losartan. The duration for the ACEI or ARB therapy is 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone: Target dose for prednisone is 0.3 mg/kg per dose to a maximum dose of 15 mg,&#xD;
      administered as single dose every other day for the first 6 months of the 12-month treatment&#xD;
      period after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Adjustments for Toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known toxicities associated with each of the therapeutic agents are delineated in the&#xD;
      protocol. A stepped dosage reduction protocol is implemented following confirmed toxicities&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 1: Reduce dosage to 2/3 of full target dose;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 2: If the toxicity persists following Step 1, reduce dose to 1/3 of full target&#xD;
           dose;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 3: If the toxicity persists following Step 2, discontinue medication. In certain&#xD;
           cases, the protocol stipulates that the attempts should be made to reverse the dose&#xD;
           reductions (following the stepped sequence in reverse order) following remission of&#xD;
           toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits and Measurements. Main Outcome Assessment Visits: The main visits for assessment&#xD;
      of study outcomes are conducted at baseline and at weeks 26, 52, and 78 of follow-up. These&#xD;
      visits each include 2 first-morning Up/c, a full panel of serum and urine biochemistry&#xD;
      measurements, complete blood count, a quality of life assessment (SF-36 in adults; PedsQL in&#xD;
      children), a complete physical examination, recording of medications and side effects, plus&#xD;
      additional urine, serum, plasma specimens for storage in a repository. Whole blood for DNA&#xD;
      extraction will be collected at onset of therapy and placed in a repository for consenting&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Visits: In addition to the main outcome assessment visits at baseline and weeks 26, 52,&#xD;
      and 78, first morning urine samples for determination of Up/c, basic blood chemistries (BUN,&#xD;
      creatinine, serum electrolytes and glucose) and hematology in the MMF/Pulse Steroids arm are&#xD;
      also obtained immediately after randomization, and at follow-up weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 20, 32,&#xD;
      38, 44, and 65. CSA trough level, fasting lipids, serum albumin, and other blood chemistries&#xD;
      are obtained at designated subsets of these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event monitoring. Adverse events, including all hospitalizations, and all&#xD;
      modifications to the dosages of the study medications are recorded throughout the follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of Partial and Complete Remissions. At each protocol assessment of proteinuria, a&#xD;
      partial remission is defined as a 50% or greater decline in the first morning Up/c from the&#xD;
      mean of two baseline measurements to a level between 0.2 and 1.0. A complete remission is&#xD;
      defined as a decline in Up/c to a level no greater than 0.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome. The primary outcome is a 6-level ordinal classification based on the&#xD;
      achievement of remission during the first 52 weeks after randomization. The least favorable&#xD;
      outcome, designated as level 6, is assigned if no partial or complete remission is achieved&#xD;
      between weeks 2 through 26, inclusive. Level 5 is assigned if the participant achieves at&#xD;
      least one partial or complete remission between weeks 2 and 20, but does not achieve either a&#xD;
      partial or complete remission at week 26. By this definition, the primary outcome is not&#xD;
      affected by the Up/c after 26 weeks if a partial or complete remission is not achieved at 26&#xD;
      weeks, allowing those participants to switch to alternative therapies without affecting the&#xD;
      primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants with a partial or complete remission at week 26, a score between 1 and 4 is&#xD;
      assigned depending on the remission status between week 26 and week 52. Level 4 is assigned&#xD;
      if the participant fails to achieve either a partial or complete remission at week 52 or has&#xD;
      a sustained relapse between weeks 26 and 52. Level 3 is assigned if the participant achieves&#xD;
      a partial remission at week 52. Level 2 is assigned if the participant achieves a complete&#xD;
      remission at week 52 but has had at least one Up/c &gt; 0.2 after week 26 but before week 52.&#xD;
      Level 1 is assigned if the participant achieves a complete remission at week 52 and has had&#xD;
      Up/c &lt; 0.2 since the week 26 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Secondary Outcome. The main secondary outcome is a 5-level ordinal classification which&#xD;
      evaluates the extent to which remissions from proteinuria persist during the period from week&#xD;
      52 to week 78 after immunosuppressive therapy is withdrawn but while remaining on ACEI or ARB&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Outcomes. Other outcomes include the change in quality of life, the numbers of adverse&#xD;
      events and extra-renal complications, and preservation of renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size. The target sample size is 500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analysis. The primary statistical analysis will compare the six-level primary outcome&#xD;
      variable between the randomized treatment groups. The six levels will be assigned scores&#xD;
      ranging from 1 (for the most favorable category) to 6 (for the least favorable category), and&#xD;
      the mean response score will be compared between the CSA and MMF/Pulse steroid groups within&#xD;
      each of the four randomization strata defined by baseline estimated GFR and race. The&#xD;
      analysis will be carried out by intent-to-treat. A 2-sided test will be conducted at the 5%&#xD;
      significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Power. Depending on the remission rate in the control group (classified as levels 1, 2,&#xD;
      or 3 for the primary outcome), the sample size of 500 randomized patients is sufficient to&#xD;
      obtain 80% power to detect an absolute increase in remission rate of between 10.8% and 11.5%&#xD;
      between the MMF/Pulse Steroid and the CSA groups.&#xD;

        changed so that all entry criteria are met. In particular, if blood pressure &gt; 140/95 or &gt;&#xD;
        95th percentile for age/height while the participant is on less than three antihypertensive&#xD;
        agents, the participant may be re-evaluated for eligibility after adding other&#xD;
        antihypertensive agents so long as the total number of agents does not exceed three.&#xD;
