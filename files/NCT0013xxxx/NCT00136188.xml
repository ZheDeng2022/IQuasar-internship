  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experimental data suggest that oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are key players&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In the last few years the investigators were&#xD;
      able to establish a method to assess endothelial function of the renal vasculature in humans&#xD;
      and started to systematically study a variety of cardiovascular disorders known to be&#xD;
      associated with endothelial dysfunction in other vascular beds, including hypertension,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia and type-2 diabetes. In patients with type-2 diabetes the investigators&#xD;
      could demonstrate that despite unaltered basal and stimulated NO-activity, the renal response&#xD;
      to the antioxidant vitamin C was more pronounced compared to control subjects. These data&#xD;
      suggest that oxidative stress is increased in the renal vasculature of diabetic patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, NO-activity in diabetic patients appears to be upregulated to compensate for the&#xD;
      increase in oxidative stress. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of increased&#xD;
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in kidney biopsies of diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major focus of the investigators' current research activities is to assess the role of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction in the very early stages of diabetic nephropathy. To this end,&#xD;
      patients with increased fasting glucose or metabolic syndrome will be studied in comparison&#xD;
      with an age-matched control group. Endothelial function and the role of oxidative stress will&#xD;
      be assessed in the renal vasculature in all groups. In parallel, the investigators will study&#xD;
      endothelial function in the forearm by venous occlusion plethysmography and in the retinal&#xD;
      vasculature by scanning laser doppler flowmetry to dissect regional differences in the&#xD;
      regulation of endothelial function. Further aspects include the role of microalbuminuria,&#xD;
      glomerular hyperfiltration, and endogenous inhibitors of NO synthase such as&#xD;
      NG,NG-Dimethyl-L-Arginine (ADMA). In a therapeutic approach, the investigators will determine&#xD;
      the effects of various antioxidant treatment strategies on endothelial function and their&#xD;
      potential role in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
