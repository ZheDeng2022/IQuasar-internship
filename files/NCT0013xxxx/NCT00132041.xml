      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells. CT-, MRI-, or ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation may be an effective treatment&#xD;
      for liver cancer and cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiofrequency ablation works in treating&#xD;
      patients with liver cancer and cirrhosis.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 18-month successful disease control rate, defined as no identifiable liver&#xD;
           tumor by CT scan, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis treated with&#xD;
           solitary or repetitive percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate tumor size, MELD score, and the number of RFA treatments (solitary or&#xD;
           repetitive) with the 18-month successful disease control rate in patients treated with&#xD;
           this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the local and remote intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor recurrence rates in&#xD;
           patients treated with this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate local and remote intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor recurrence rates with the&#xD;
           18-month successful disease control rate in patients treated with this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate tumor size with the local disease control rate in patients treated with this&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate solitary or repetitive RFA with or without local/regional tumor control with&#xD;
           the development of extrahepatic tumor in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the local tumor eradication rate, as determined by examination of whole liver&#xD;
           specimens or CT scan, in patients treated with this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to hepatic&#xD;
      dysfunction using the MELD score (&lt; 15 vs 15-25 vs &gt; 25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo placement of an ablation electrode percutaneously into the tumor(s) by CT&#xD;
      scan, MRI, or ultrasound guidance. Patients then undergo percutaneous radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      (RFA) directly to the tumor(s) for 12 minutes. Patients undergo CT scan of the liver within 1&#xD;
      week after RFA treatment and then every 3 months for up to 18 months. Patients with residual&#xD;
      or recurrent intrahepatic tumor(s) detectable on the 3-month or subsequent CT scan undergo&#xD;
      repeat RFA as is technically feasible and clinically indicated for up to 15 months after&#xD;
      initial RFA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and&#xD;
      then every 3 months for up to 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
