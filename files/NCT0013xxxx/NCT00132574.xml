  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether minimizing the intake of milk and dairy&#xD;
      products will reduce the recurrence of acne among people who have been successfully treated&#xD;
      for acne with isotretinoin.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne is one of the most common dermatologic diseases affecting 40 to 50 million people in the&#xD;
      United States, most of who are adolescents and young adults. In addition to the&#xD;
      well-recognized physical sequelae of this condition, several studies have linked severe acne&#xD;
      to considerable social impairments and serious psychological conditions including suicidal&#xD;
      ideation and major depression. Furthermore, severe acne has been recognized in some studies&#xD;
      as a risk factor for breast cancer, suggesting that these conditions may have common causes.&#xD;
      Little is known about the role of diet in the pathogenesis of acne. Recent analyses of the&#xD;
      Nurses' Health Study II and the Growing-Up Today Study suggest that high intake of milk&#xD;
      increases the risk of developing acne during adolescence. Despite the consistency of findings&#xD;
      between these two studies, they cannot be regarded as conclusive and further research is&#xD;
      needed in this area. Establishing the nature of the association between milk intake and acne&#xD;
      can have broad clinical and public health implications. It could enhance the currently&#xD;
      existing therapeutic options for the treatment of acne. More importantly, public health&#xD;
      recommendations regarding milk and dairy intake could be designed in order to prevent its&#xD;
      effects on the sebaceous glands and probably other hormone sensitive glands like the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that milk intake increases the risk of developing acne, we will&#xD;
      compare the effect of minimizing milk and dairy intake against not making changes in the diet&#xD;
      of subjects who usually consume at least 2 servings/day of milk and dairy products on the&#xD;
      recurrence of acne lesions among patients previously treated with isotretinoin.&#xD;
