      Employing a physician-directed case management system, utilizing a Certified Registered Nurse&#xD;
      Practitioner (CRNP) in conjunction with computer-based decision support technology (CDST)&#xD;
      will result in significantly lower total cholesterol and a lower low density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol in a group of subjects enrolled in a general medical clinic compared to subjects&#xD;
      managed by primary care providers in the usual care group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis affects 7 million patients and causes approximately 50% of all deaths in the&#xD;
      United States. A reduction in modifiable risk factors (especially smoking, hypertension and&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia) is associated with a 30% reduction in acute coronary events.&#xD;
      Clinically, fewer than 25% of patients achieve this degree of risk reduction because of&#xD;
      significant barriers to implementation of effective risk reduction programs and wide variance&#xD;
      in the management of hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition that a physician-directed case management system utilizing a certified registered&#xD;
      nurse practitioner (CRNP) and computer-based decision support technology (CDST) offers the&#xD;
      potential to implement disease management guidelines consistently and effectively is the&#xD;
      impetus for this project. This project will demonstrate that enhanced compliance with the&#xD;
      National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines can be achieved in a randomized&#xD;
      trial conducted in subjects enrolled in a general medical clinic. The way in which&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia will be managed is determined by randomization of the PCP providers to either&#xD;
      the usual care group or to the intervention group, in which the management of subjects is&#xD;
      delegated to the CRNP in conjunction with the CDST, under the supervision of the physician-&#xD;
      investigators. Approximately 220 hypercholesterolemic subjects who are eligible for risk&#xD;
      reduction according to NCEP guidelines will be recruited in equal numbers from subjects&#xD;
      enrolled in the primary care clinic, beginning in 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician-directed case management system employed in this project utilizes a management&#xD;
      algorithm for lowering LDL-C cholesterol to the goal of less than 70 mg%. Stepwise increases&#xD;
      in simvastatin dose to a maximum of 80 mg/day are used. Surveillance of symptoms and&#xD;
      laboratory data to detect adverse side effects of the intervention precedes each increase in&#xD;
      simvastatin dose. The CRNP will implement the management algorithm and concentrate on subject&#xD;
      adherence, which is judged to be an important element in promoting compliance. The CRNP will&#xD;
      initiate contact with the subject whenever a decision point is reached in the treatment&#xD;
      algorithm, a deviation from the management algorithm occurs or an adverse reaction is&#xD;
      detected. The case management model has been shown to be effective in achieving treatment&#xD;
      goals in conditions such as hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test hypothesis I, that employing a physician-directed case management&#xD;
      system, utilizing a Certified Registered Nurse Practitioner (CRNP) in conjunction with&#xD;
      computer-based decision support technology (CDST) will result in significantly lower total&#xD;
      cholesterol and a lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol in a group of subjects enrolled&#xD;
      in a general medical clinic compared to subjects managed by primary care providers in the&#xD;
      usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of the project is to establish that computer-based decision support&#xD;
      technology can be developed that will provide reliable clinical recommendations for the&#xD;
      management of type II hyperlipidemia. This proposition will be tested by hypothesis II, that&#xD;
      the computer-based decision technology provides advice for management of hyperlipidemia that&#xD;
      is comparable to that of a cardiologist in the same institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our physician-directed case-management system is expected to enhance guideline compliance by&#xD;
      CDST monitoring of the subject�s compliance and cholesterol response to the management&#xD;
      algorithm, thus contributing to improved outcomes for patients.&#xD;
