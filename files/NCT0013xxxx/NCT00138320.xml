      The purpose of this study to look at the antibodies (proteins from the body's infection&#xD;
      fighting system) in the blood of babies delivered by women who are participants in the&#xD;
      Herpevac Trial for Women, and who were vaccinated with either two or three doses of&#xD;
      (GlaxoSmithKline) GSK candidate vaccine gD2t/alum-MPL or hepatitis A vaccine. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the herpes or hepatitis A antibody levels of the newborns to those&#xD;
      of their mothers, and to see how much of the antibodies are still present in the baby at two&#xD;
      and six months after birth. Approximately 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of the mother's blood will be&#xD;
      collected at the time of delivery or within 15 days before or after delivery. Approximately 2&#xD;
      teaspoons of blood will be collected from the child's umbilical cord at the time of delivery,&#xD;
      or 1 teaspoon (3-5 ml) of the child's blood will be drawn within 15 days after birth.&#xD;
      Optional blood draws from babies may occur 2 and 6 months after birth.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to quantitate HSV-2 binding and neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      titers in the sera of newborns delivered by HSV-uninfected women vaccinated with either two&#xD;
      or three doses of GSK candidate vaccine gD2t/alum-MPL and to compare the HSV-2 binding and&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody titers of the newborns to those of their mothers. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to: 1) evaluate the durability of HSV-2 binding and neutralizing antibody titers in the&#xD;
      sera of newborns delivered by HSV-uninfected women vaccinated with either two or three doses&#xD;
      of GSK candidate vaccine gD2t/alum-MPL; and 2) quantitate hepatitis A binding antibody titers&#xD;
      in the sera of newborns delivered by women vaccinated with either two or three doses of&#xD;
      HavrixÂ® hepatitis A vaccine (the control vaccine used in the Herpevac Trial for Women),&#xD;
      compare hepatitis A binding antibody titers of the newborns to those of their mothers, and&#xD;
      evaluate the durability of hepatitis A binding antibodies in these newborns. The sample size&#xD;
      for this study cannot be determined but based on experience is not likely to be more than 50&#xD;
      women. Optional additional blood will be collected from the mother and her infant at 2 mos&#xD;
      and 6 mos after delivery.&#xD;

      Sera obtained from collected blood samples will be used. Ten mL of blood will be collected at&#xD;
      the maternal blood draw and from the umbilical vein. Three to 5 mL of blood will be collected&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Enrolled in the Herpevac Trial for Women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has received at least two doses of either the candidate or control vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Written informed consent obtained from the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to have her blood collected either at the time of delivery or within 15 days&#xD;
             before or after delivery. If blood is to be collected by the health care provider who&#xD;
             will be presiding at the delivery, the participant must be willing to give permission&#xD;
             for study personnel to contact that health care provider to arrange the collection of&#xD;
             blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to have either umbilical vein blood collected at the time of delivery or blood&#xD;
             collected from her neonate within 15 days after delivery. If blood is to be collected&#xD;
             from the umbilical vein, the participant must be willing to give permission for study&#xD;
             personnel to contact the presiding health care provider to arrange the collection of&#xD;
             blood.&#xD;
