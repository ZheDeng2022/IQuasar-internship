  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although declining in incidence, gastric/gastroesophageal cancer is still a commonly&#xD;
      diagnosed malignancy in Canada. Patients who have undergone surgical resection for early&#xD;
      disease have a high rate of local recurrence and distant spread. More than 50% of patients&#xD;
      present with either locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients with advanced disease&#xD;
      have an extremely poor prognosis, with average survival times ranging from 3 - 9 months.&#xD;
      Development of new therapeutic approaches for locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      gastric/gastroesophageal cancer, is clearly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its proven efficacy, ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin, and infusional 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      [5-FU]) has not been widely adopted in North America and is likely due to the technical&#xD;
      difficulties and inconvenience associated with infusional chemotherapy. This study will&#xD;
      substitute the oral chemotherapy drug capecitabine for infusional 5-FU in addition to&#xD;
      substituting intravenous cisplatin with carboplatin (ECC - epirubicin, carboplatin and&#xD;
      capecitabine). It is hoped that these substitutions will not only reduce the typical ECF&#xD;
      related adverse effects but also allow for a more convenient administration of outpatient&#xD;
      chemotherapy. It is also hoped that the genetic correlates of this study may also identify&#xD;
      specific populations that preferentially benefit from ECC treatment.&#xD;

      Background Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine which is&#xD;
      converted to 5-fluorouracil. Capecitabine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      and then hydrolyzed in the liver. Capecitabine has been studied in the treatment of&#xD;
      gastric/gastroesophageal cancer in addition to a wide variety of other malignancies (e.g. GI,&#xD;
      breast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine with combined fixed doses of&#xD;
           epirubicin and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid cancers. With the&#xD;
           identification of the MTD, determination of the recommended phase II dose will be made&#xD;
           and used to further evaluate the specific anti-tumor activity of ECC in unresectable&#xD;
           locally advanced and/or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety, toxicity profile, principle and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT)&#xD;
           of ECC when given on this schedule; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic behavior of capecitabine when given in combination with&#xD;
           epirubicin and carboplatin as part of the ECC regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the anti-tumor activity of ECC when given at the RPTD in patients who have&#xD;
           unresectable locally advanced and/or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer who have&#xD;
           not received prior palliative chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further characterize the toxicity profile of the ECC regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine time to progression, duration of response, and overall survival of patients&#xD;
           on this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of thymidylate synthase (TS) polymorphisms on both toxicities&#xD;
           and efficacy of ECC in prospectively genotyped patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively evaluate other potential pharmacogenetic correlates which may also play&#xD;
           a role in augmenting toxicity, including MTHFR; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess effects of uridine glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT 2B7) polymorphisms on&#xD;
           epirubicin metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I/II trial that will study the safety as well as the efficacy of the ECC&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epirubicin: will be administered as an IV push at a fixed dose of 50mg/m2 on day 1 - repeated&#xD;
      every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin: will be administered IV, at a fixed dose with an AUC of 5 (over a 1-hour&#xD;
      infusion in 500ml of 5% dextrose) on day 1 - repeated every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine: will be administered as a twice daily oral medication (variable dose for phase&#xD;
      I portion of the trial, but fixed dose for phase II portion of the trial) for 14 consecutive&#xD;
      days (days 1-14) - repeated every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the phase I portion of the study cohorts of 3 patients will be treated at each of 3&#xD;
      pre-determined dose levels of capecitabine and monitored for toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 1: 750 mg/m2 bid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 2: 850 mg/m2 bid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 3: 1000 mg/m2 bid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 4+: 25% dose escalation (rounded to the nearest twice a day dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics such as frequency and intensity of toxicity occurring at each dose level&#xD;
      will be provided. The percentage of patients developing DLT at each dose level will be&#xD;
      computed. The dose-toxicity curve can be estimated accordingly using either parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: A Simon's optimal two-stage phase II study will be conducted in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro-esophageal cancer at the RPTD&#xD;
      of the ECC regimen. A total sample size of 43 patients will be required, 13 in the first&#xD;
      stage and 30 in the second stage, if criteria for second stage accrual are met. If &lt;=3/13&#xD;
      patients respond, this is deemed to correspond with the initial rejection limit and no&#xD;
      further patients will be enrolled. If &gt;=4/13 patients respond, an additional 30 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the second stage (total sample size = 43). Further statistical details are&#xD;
      specifically outlined in Section 8 of the protocol. The response rate, standard error and its&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated under the binomial distribution model. The&#xD;
      efficacy of the regimen will then be evaluated by comparing the point estimates and 95% CI&#xD;
      with historical data. Potential covariates for response will also be identified and evaluated&#xD;
      via the logistic regression model. Kaplan-Meier estimates will be computed to estimate the&#xD;
      secondary endpoints such as time to progression and survival. Cox-regression model can be&#xD;
      applied incorporating covariates in the model. Fisher's exact test will be applied to compare&#xD;
      the response rates between the different genetic TS polymorphisms groupings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be discontinued and the patient will come off the trial therapy due to severe&#xD;
      intercurrent illness, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient request to stop,&#xD;
      and/or if the physician deems it in the best interest of patient to discontinue.&#xD;
