  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), the administration of gradually increasing quantities&#xD;
      of an allergen extract to an allergic patient, is a curative approach which directly treats&#xD;
      the underlying allergic disease. GrassMATAMPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal&#xD;
      specific immunotherapy for patients with an allergy to grass and rye pollen (hay fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tolerability and immunogenicity of GrassMATA (allergen modified with glutaraldehyde and&#xD;
      adsorbed to tyrosine) with and without MPL adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A, extracted from a&#xD;
      bacterial cell surface) was investigated in this double-blind, randomized Phase IIa study in&#xD;
      volunteers allergic to grass and rye pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study assessed residual allergenicity of the modified grass and rye pollen&#xD;
      in the product GrassMATAMPL using skin prick testing in volunteers allergic to grass and rye&#xD;
      pollen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind Phase IIa study with a single-blind component, to evaluate skin tests&#xD;
      allergenicity and to demonstrate the contribution of MPL® to tyrosine adsorbed grass/rye&#xD;
      pollen allergoid (Grass MATA) in volunteers allergic to grass and rye pollen. Volunteers&#xD;
      underwent skin prick tests with 12 different solutions and then were randomized to receive 3&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of either Grass MATA MPL or Grass MATA over approximately 14-day&#xD;
      intervals for total study duration of approximately 67 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment was planned for 40 patients, 20 in each active treatment group. Data from 41&#xD;
      patients who completed the single blind portion of the study and from 40 randomized patients&#xD;
      who took part in the double blind portion of the study were analyzed and included in the&#xD;
      study. Screening was performed at Visit 0, then subjects fulfilling all inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria underwent a series of skin prick tests to evaluate the tolerability of native&#xD;
      allergen, modified allergen and tyrosine adsorbates with and without MPL® (Visit 1,&#xD;
      single-blind portion of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2, subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either Grass MATA MPL or Grass MATA and&#xD;
      received the first injection of treatment. The dosing regimen consisted of three 0.5 mL&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of increasing strengths and was the same for both treatment groups.&#xD;
      Patients were asked to remain in the clinic for an observation period of 30 to 45 minutes&#xD;
      following study drug administration in order to record adverse reactions associated. The&#xD;
      second and third injections of treatment were administered at Visit 4 and Visit 6. Each&#xD;
      dosing visit occurred at least 14 days after the previous one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up were performed 7-8 days after each dosing, at Visit 3, 5 and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects terminated the study after completion of Visit 8 (Post-treatment visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the immunological response to Grass MATA MPL versus Grass MATA blood test were&#xD;
      performed at baseline (Visit 0), after the first administration (Visit 3) and at the end of&#xD;
      the study (Visit 8). Safety and tolerability of the different allergens used during prick&#xD;
      test and of Grass MATA MPL versus Grass MATA were also be evaluated.&#xD;
