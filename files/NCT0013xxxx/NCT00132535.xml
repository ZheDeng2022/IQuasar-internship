  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is conflicting evidence regarding the influence of HIV infection on the success of&#xD;
      malaria prevention in pregnancy and effect on pregnancy outcome. The purpose of the proposed&#xD;
      study is to assess the impact of HIV infection on the effectiveness of malaria prevention&#xD;
      during pregnancy. This will be carried out by comparing two intermittent preventive&#xD;
      treatments (IPTs) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) plus 300 mg weekly chloroquine with two&#xD;
      doses IPT plus a weekly chloroquine placebo. The emphasis will be on assessing the effect of&#xD;
      chloroquine on HIV viral load and malaria morbidity and foetal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with two arms, involving&#xD;
      pregnant women attending antenatal classes (ANCs) at health units, enrolled early in their&#xD;
      second trimester at 3 health units of the Mbarara district and Kampala. All pregnant women&#xD;
      presenting for antenatal care, irrespective of parity, who consent to participate will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Women with severe systemic disease or symptoms of AIDS will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be screened for HIV status and their HIV viral loads will be measured at&#xD;
      enrolment. Parasitaemia will be assessed at enrolment; at the beginning of the third&#xD;
      trimester; and at delivery. Haemoglobin will be measured at the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome variables to be assessed will be maternal peripheral parasitaemia; placental&#xD;
      parasitaemia; maternal clinical malaria; congenital parasitaemia; and maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      haemoglobin, birth weight and viral load at enrolment and before nevirapine administration to&#xD;
      the HIV positive mothers at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropological pre-studies to assess the quality of ANC services and healthcare seeking&#xD;
      practices of pregnant women in the study area will be carried out. Focus group discussions&#xD;
      (FGD) with pregnant women and mothers of neonates; in-depth interviews with relevant health&#xD;
      workers; and illness narratives from pregnant women will be used to collect data. The&#xD;
      anthropological study results will assist in appropriately planning for the trial to enhance&#xD;
      compliance to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection is planned to commence in August 2003 and is expected to end in October&#xD;
      2005. Twelve months will be spent on the write-up phase.&#xD;

      General Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To contribute to the improvement of quality and effectiveness of maternity care services&#xD;
           by assessing the impact of HIV infection on the effectiveness of IPT with SP and&#xD;
           comparing it with SP plus weekly chloroquine (CQ) to assess the possible anti-retroviral&#xD;
           effect of chloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of IPT with SP plus placebo CQ or SP plus prophylaxis with CQ on&#xD;
           peripheral and placental parasitaemia among HIV sero-positive as compared to HIV&#xD;
           sero-negative pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of HIV infection on maternal malaria-related morbidity among&#xD;
           pregnant HIV sero-positive women compared to pregnant HIV sero-negative women treated&#xD;
           with SP plus placebo CQ or SP plus weekly CQ prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the effect of HIV infection on birth weight and congenital parasitaemia&#xD;
           among babies born to women given IPT with SP as compared to women given SP plus CQ&#xD;
           prophylaxis during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess anti-HIV effects of CQ among HIV positive pregnant women by measuring HIV&#xD;
           viral load at enrolment and before delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsidiary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore mothers' and health care providers' perceptions of the quality of maternity&#xD;
           services in the study communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore fever prevention and management options used by pregnant women in the study&#xD;
           communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore pregnant women's perceptions of malaria prevention during pregnancy in the&#xD;
           era of HIV/AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pregnant women who present at a gestational age of 14- 24 weeks who will give verbal&#xD;
      informed consent will be enrolled in the study from the 2 health units in Mbarara District&#xD;
      and a hospital in Kampala. These areas are reported to be highly endemic for malaria. The&#xD;
      district has a high prevalence of HIV (10.6%) among antenatal attendants. The main ethnic&#xD;
      groups in the area are Banyankore with few migrant populations of Bakiga, Rwandans and&#xD;
      Baganda who mainly speak Runyankore dialect. The main economic activity is mixed farming and&#xD;
      the main food crops grown include bananas, finger millet, beans, groundnuts, cowpeas, sweet&#xD;
      potatoes, cassava, sorghum, maize, tomatoes, pineapples, passion fruits, sugar canes, mangoes&#xD;
      and papaws. The population of the district is estimated to be 1,093,388. Females aged 15-49&#xD;
      years are estimated to make up 23% of the total population. Pregnant women are estimated to&#xD;
      be 5.2% of the total population. The total fertility rate in Uganda is estimated at 6.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with two arms. The&#xD;
      researchers and the ANC staff will be blind to the HIV status of the mothers. However,&#xD;
      mothers who choose to disclose their HIV status to the antenatal care staff are free to do&#xD;
      so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difference in placental parasitaemia between HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative women was&#xD;
      used to determine sample size. Using a power of 90% and a significance level of 5%, the&#xD;
      sample size needed to detect a true difference in prevalence of maternal placental&#xD;
      parasitaemia in the two study groups will be 104 women per group. However, to compensate for&#xD;
      loss of follow-up, 30% will be added per group and this will give a total of 135 HIV&#xD;
      seropositive women in each arm, giving a total of 270 HIV sero-positive mothers in the two&#xD;
      study arms. Since HIV sero-prevalence in primigravidae attending antenatal care in the&#xD;
      district is 10%, a minimum number of 1274 women would be required in each arm (total 2548).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be enrolled in ANC clinics of three health units. All pregnant women, irrespective&#xD;
      of parity, who consent to participate in the study will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and socio-economic characteristics will be recorded. History of fever and&#xD;
      antimalarial drug use will also be recorded. Women will be randomly allocated to the SP + CQ&#xD;
      (CQ 300 mg weekly) or SP + placebo group (IPT twice during pregnancy). All women will receive&#xD;
      supplementation of 120mg elementary iron daily and 5mg folic acid weekly. IPT with SP will be&#xD;
      started in the second trimester and a second dose in the third trimester. Women will be&#xD;
      encouraged to deliver in health units and TBAs will be involved to follow-up of those who&#xD;
      deliver in the villages. Health workers will liaise with TBAs to collect information and&#xD;
      samples (birth weight and blood slides). The general health conditions of the mothers&#xD;
      (including Hb, clinical malaria, body temperature, body weight, foetal heart sound, urine&#xD;
      analysis) will be assessed throughout pregnancy. Clinical malaria cases will be treated&#xD;
      according to national guidelines with CQ and SP. In case of treatment failure quinine will be&#xD;
      given as second line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pregnant women presenting for ANC at the hospitals or health centres of study,&#xD;
      irrespective of parity and consent to participate, will be enrolled in the study. Only women&#xD;
      who consent to have an HIV test done and to be examined for viral load will be included.&#xD;
      Women with at risk pregnancy, severe systemic disease or symptoms and signs of AIDS will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Those women will be referred for further diagnosis and treatment at&#xD;
      the nearest hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maternal peripheral parasitaemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  placental parasitaemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical malaria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maternal and infant Hb;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  birth weight;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  congenital parasitaemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maternal HIV viral load at inclusion and before delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood smears for parasitaemia will be made at enrolment, antenatal follow-up and delivery.&#xD;
      Screening for HIV status will be done at enrolment and a confirmatory test done at the same&#xD;
      time. Viral load will be assessed at enrolment and 36 weeks of gestation. At enrolment 5 ml&#xD;
      of blood will be drawn for HIV screening, viral load and Hb measurement, and malaria&#xD;
      parasitaemia assessment. Malaria parasites will be counted against 200 leukocytes and&#xD;
      expressed as number of parasites/dl of blood assuming a standard leukocyte count of 8000/dl.&#xD;
      The HIV status will be assessed using the existing Rapid Test used in the district for HIV&#xD;
      screening.All women will receive pre- and post-screening counselling. Hb will be measured&#xD;
      using a Haemo-Cue® portable photometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance with the weekly CQ chemoprophylaxis will be controlled by giving the women a&#xD;
      varying excess of tablets of CQ and placebo to take home and be requested to return the&#xD;
      balance at each monthly visit. Health workers will administer the SP (DOT). The first dose of&#xD;
      SP will be given at 14 - 24 weeks of gestation and the second dose will be given 28 - 32&#xD;
      weeks of gestation. Health workers will keep records of the gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasitaemia and Hb will be assessed at inclusion, at week 28 and at delivery. During monthly&#xD;
      antenatal care visits women will be asked about illnesses that have occurred since their last&#xD;
      visit and about any treatment taken. Routine ANC examinations will be undertaken. Malaria&#xD;
      attacks will be recorded and women will be advised to come for treatment at the health units&#xD;
      in case of any illness. Records will be kept by health care workers (laboratory staff,&#xD;
      midwives, counsellors), TBAs and the PI. The District Director of Health Services (DDHS) will&#xD;
      be an independent monitor for the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women presenting for delivery will be asked about recent malaria and other symptoms. Thick&#xD;
      blood smears will be made from maternal peripheral blood, placental and umbilical cord blood.&#xD;
      The newborn babies will be weighed with digital scales. At the onset of labour, the HIV&#xD;
      sero-positive women will be treated with a single dose of 200mg Nevirapine and their newborn&#xD;
      babies will also be treated with a single dose of 2mg/kg (or 0.6ml) Nevirapine within 72&#xD;
      hours after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health workers will be trained on how to use the Haemo-Cue® portable photometer and how to&#xD;
      prepare thick blood slides. Since some women are likely to deliver in the villages, TBAs will&#xD;
      be trained to weigh babies, prepare thick blood slides from the placenta for mothers that&#xD;
      deliver in the villages. Blood samples for viral load if not taken before Nevirapine&#xD;
      administration would lead to loss of follow-up of that woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For babies delivered in the villages, health workers will be informed as soon as possible to&#xD;
      allow them to take the necessary measurements and also give the necessary assistance to the&#xD;
      mothers and immunise the babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative component of the study will involve the use of FGD with pregnant women and&#xD;
      mothers of neonates to assess their perceptions of the quality of maternity care services in&#xD;
      their communities. In-depth interviews with health care providers providing maternity care&#xD;
      services and drug sellers will be conducted to explore their perceptions on the quality of&#xD;
      maternity care services and fever care seeking patterns of pregnant women in the study area.&#xD;
      Illness narratives will be collected from pregnant women on their care seeking options and&#xD;
      fever prevention strategies and practices during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be analysed using SPSS and EPI INFO packages. Differences between&#xD;
      proportions and means will be analysed using chi-square tests, ANOVA and Student t-tests. RR&#xD;
      will be calculated. P value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.red to have significant&#xD;
      difference or show statistical significance. Qualitative data will be coded for the themes of&#xD;
      interest and emerging themes and a master sheet will be used to summarise the data from the&#xD;
      different methods used to collect data. Ethnographic summaries, use of quotes and content&#xD;
      analysis will be the methods used to analyse the qualitative data.&#xD;
