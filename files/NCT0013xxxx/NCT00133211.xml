  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart arrhythmia afflicting approximately 1% of the&#xD;
      Danish population. Medical antiarrhythmic treatment is only moderately effective and has the&#xD;
      risk of severe side effects. The present study is a prospective, randomized, multicentre&#xD;
      study comparing medical antiarrhythmic drug strategy with catheter based radiofrequency&#xD;
      strategy in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The primary end point is atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation burden (symptomatic and asymptomatic) judged by multiple 7-day Holter&#xD;
      monitorings during 2 years follow-up. Three hundred patients considered candidates for&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic drug treatment will be randomized. The study will be performed as a&#xD;
      Scandinavian/German multicentre study.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation is by far the most common heart arrhythmia and is even increasing in&#xD;
      prevalence and incidence. Approximately 10% of all cardiologic hospitalizations are due to&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. Several studies have shown older patients with paroxysmal or persistent&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation and with minor symptoms related to the arrhythmia do equally well on a&#xD;
      frequency control as compared to a rhythm control strategy. However, some of this lack of&#xD;
      difference in outcome may be because the benefits by achieving sinus rhythm are outbalanced&#xD;
      by the risk of medication with presently known antiarrhythmic drugs together with the only&#xD;
      modest efficacy of these drugs. Non-pharmacological treatment of atrial fibrillation has&#xD;
      drawn increasing interest over the last decade, and especially percutaneous catheter based&#xD;
      ablation strategies have been in focus with promising results on the symptomatic level in&#xD;
      several series of patients. Different technologies have been in use with very few comparative&#xD;
      studies. Most important, no study has been published so far on a consecutive series of&#xD;
      patients with atrial fibrillation randomized to either a pharmacological or an ablative&#xD;
      strategy. Also important is that the majority of studies have been single-centre based prone&#xD;
      to a multitude of potential selection biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary vein isolation by transvenous radiofrequency ablation is superior to present time&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy with regard to long-term suppression of atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      (symptomatic and asymptomatic) as well as to procedure/treatment related side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to test whether catheter based radiofrequency ablation is&#xD;
      superior to optimized antiarrhythmic medical therapy in suppressing long-term relapse of&#xD;
      symptomatic and/or asymptomatic atrial fibrillation in patients who are not already in&#xD;
      chronic pharmaceutical antiarrhythmic therapy. Secondary end points are: mortality,&#xD;
      thromboembolic events, hospitalization due to disturbance in heart rhythm, proarrhythmic&#xD;
      events, procedure/treatment related side effects, health economics and quality of life.&#xD;
      Comparison will be made after two years follow-up and a register follow-up will take place&#xD;
      after additional 3 years (a total of at least five years of follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be informed about the study by a&#xD;
      study-responsible electrophysiologist or his/her substitute. After informed consent the&#xD;
      patient will be randomized to either antiarrhythmic drug treatment or to catheter ablation.&#xD;
      All patients undergo transthoracic echocardiography before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A register of all patients informed about (i.e. fulfilling the inclusion criteria) but for&#xD;
      one or more reasons not included in the study will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation burden (see below), symptomatic and asymptomatic combined. Atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation burden will be calculated from one-week Holter monitoring at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
      months, respectively, after treatment (first RF-procedure or AAD-initiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications (including thromboembolic events, major bleeding episodes, pro-arrhythmic&#xD;
           events, and treatment related side effects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QOL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health economics (including number of DC-conversions, cardiovascular hospitalizations&#xD;
           (type, length and number of antiarrhythmic drugs))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic atrial fibrillation (constant atrial fibrillation during one-week Holter&#xD;
           monitoring at 24 months follow-up, together with atrial fibrillation during the&#xD;
           immediately foregoing 8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to first recurrence (after 3 months blanking period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left ventricular systolic function (transthoracic echo)&#xD;
