    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7974&#xD;
      administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle in subjects with solid malignancies that have&#xD;
      progressed following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists.&#xD;
