    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the experimental drug eculizumab for&#xD;
      treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a disorder that can cause premature&#xD;
      destruction of red blood cells. PNH may result in anemia requiring blood transfusions.&#xD;
      Patients may be at high risk of life-threatening blood clots in their veins and may have&#xD;
      urine discoloration, stomach pain, difficulty swallowing, tiredness, and poor quality of&#xD;
      life. Men may have problems getting or maintaining an erection. Eculizumab is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that may improve the survival of red blood cells in patients with PNH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with PNH for more than 6 months,&#xD;
      who have active disease, and who require blood transfusions may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Each candidate is screened with a physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, and a questionnaire for information on how PNH affects the patient physically,&#xD;
      socially, emotionally, and functionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive infusions of eculizumab through a needle in a vein once a week for five&#xD;
      doses and then every two weeks for another 24 doses. All patients are vaccinated against&#xD;
      Neisseria meningitides, a bacteria that can cause symptoms, possibly including&#xD;
      life-threatening meningitis, in susceptible people, including people who take eculizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every treatment visit, patients update their health status, transfusion record, and&#xD;
      medication use; review their laboratory results from the preceding visit; have vital signs&#xD;
      measured; and provide a blood sample for laboratory tests. At selected visits, they also&#xD;
      provide a urine sample, have a repeat electrocardiogram, and complete a questionnaire. At the&#xD;
      final treatment visit, participants have a complete physical examination, in addition to the&#xD;
      routine procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder of the hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell characterized by intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, anemia, and thrombosis.&#xD;
      The clinical features of PNH result from the lack of one or more of GPI-linked proteins that&#xD;
      serve to protect cells from autologous complement mediated attack. Two such proteins, CD55&#xD;
      (decay accelerating factor) and CD59 (reactive lysis inhibitor) have been shown to be absent&#xD;
      from PNH erythrocytes and platelets as well as other cell types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence strongly suggests that lack of the terminal complement inhibitor CD59 is responsible&#xD;
      for the sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes and platelets to the effects of autologous&#xD;
      complement. Since the pathogenesis of PNH is due to the inability of PNH red cells and&#xD;
      platelets to inhibit the activation of terminal complement, it is logical to hypothesize that&#xD;
      a terminal complement inhibitor could effectively stop the intravascular hemolysis, obviate&#xD;
      or lessen the need for transfusions, and possibly decrease the propensity of life threatening&#xD;
      thrombosis. Eculizumab (h5G1.1-mAb) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that like CD59&#xD;
      inhibits terminal complement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label, multi-center study of eculizumab, administered intravenously for&#xD;
      52 weeks to approximately 85 PNH patients. The study is designed to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      eculizumab in transfusion dependent patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)&#xD;
      and to determine if the administration of this terminal complement inhibitor could provide a&#xD;
      safe and effective substitute for CD59 function.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study population will comprise individuals who have transfusion-dependent&#xD;
             hemolytic PNH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Individuals at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with a diagnosis of PNH greater than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Presence of a GPI deficient red blood cell clone (type III cells) by flow&#xD;
                  cytometry of greater than or equal to 10%&#xD;
&#xD;
