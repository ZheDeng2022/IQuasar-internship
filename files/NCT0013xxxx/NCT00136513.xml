  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a dose of SB-743921 in adult patients with solid tumors&#xD;
      or lymphoma who have progressed on standard therapy or who have relapsed. SB-743921 is dosed&#xD;
      by 1-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. A patient may continue to receive treatment as&#xD;
      long as they are benefiting from the treatment. Blood samples will be taken at specific times&#xD;
      to measure the amount of the drug in your body at specific times after the drug is given.&#xD;
      Blood samples will also be taken for lab tests such as complete blood counts and clinical&#xD;
      chemistries. Physical exams will be performed before each treatment with SB-743921. During&#xD;
      the treatment phase, the patients will undergo regular assessments for safety and clinical&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
