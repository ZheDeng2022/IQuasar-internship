      The purpose of this study is to determine whether sulodexide is effective in slowing or&#xD;
      preventing the progression of diabetic kidney disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is now the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the U.S. and in&#xD;
      many other developed nations. Diabetic nephropathy now represents 44% of all new cases of&#xD;
      ESRD in the U.S. Despite advances in clinical care, including improvements in glycemic and&#xD;
      blood pressure control, the number of new cases of diabetes related ESRD continues to rise.&#xD;
      In particular, the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2)-related cases of ESRD is&#xD;
      rapidly increasing. From 1993 to 1997, 71% of all diabetes-related ESRD was attributable to&#xD;
      DM2 (USRDS 1999). The earliest sign of diabetic kidney disease presents as microalbuminuria,&#xD;
      the spilling of small of amounts of blood protein into the urine. Microalbuminuria correlates&#xD;
      directly with the subsequent development of more advanced kidney disease. Improved glycemic&#xD;
      control and blood pressure control with the use of inhibitors of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can reduce the level of microalbuminuria and overt&#xD;
      proteinuria. However, despite these measures, diabetic nephropathy continues to progress,&#xD;
      albeit more slowly. Sulodexide belongs to a class of drugs called glycosaminoglycans (GAG).&#xD;
      GAG therapy has been shown in animal models to prevent and or induce regression of&#xD;
      albuminuria, and the morphologic changes associated with progressive diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      such as glomerular basement thickening, loss of the anionic charge density and mesangial&#xD;
      collagen deposition. Sulodexide is approved in Europe to treat vascular indications. It has&#xD;
      been utilized in several small phase II studies to treat early diabetic nephropathy, inducing&#xD;
      an additional 40-70 % reduction in albuminuria in subjects whose albumin excretion was&#xD;
      already reduced with tight glycemic control plus the use of inhibitors of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system for blood pressure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to add to this body of evidence that Sulodexide may offer&#xD;
      additional benefit in preventing or ameliorating more advanced diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      manifested as overt proteinuria and reduced GFR. Subjects with type 2 diabetes, moderately&#xD;
      elevated serum creatinine and overt proteinuria will be treated with a standardized maximal&#xD;
      recommended/tolerated dose of irbesartan 300 mg/day or losartan 100 mg/day plus additional&#xD;
      concomitant non-ARB, non-ACEi antihypertensive drugs,for up to 2-3 months to establish&#xD;
      adequate and stable blood pressure control and urine protein excretion. After establishing&#xD;
      baseline serum creatinine and urine protein excretion they will be randomized to either&#xD;
      Sulodexide 200 mg/d or matching placebo. Subjects will be seen every 3 months to monitor&#xD;
      safety and efficacy parameters for up to 4 years. The primary outcome is a doubling of&#xD;
      baseline serum creatinine (50% loss of kidney function) or end stage kidney disease (ESRD).&#xD;
