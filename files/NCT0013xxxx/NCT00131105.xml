      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 12-month telephone-supervised,&#xD;
      home-based physical activity and dietary intervention, conducted in either a sequential or&#xD;
      simultaneous fashion, on improving physical activity and dietary patterns in a high-stress&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      This study combines elements of two previous studies--Teaching Healthy Lifestyles for&#xD;
      Caregivers (TLC2) and Counseling Advice for Lifestyle Management (CALM)--to compare exercise&#xD;
      and diet interventions in caregivers and non-caregivers. Two hundred and forty healthy men&#xD;
      and women ages 50 and older, half caregivers and half non-caregivers, will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of four conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 12-month physical activity intervention and a 12-month dietary counseling intervention&#xD;
           delivered simultaneously;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 12-month counseling intervention first focusing on physical activity followed by the&#xD;
           addition of dietary counseling;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 12-month counseling intervention first focusing on dietary counseling followed by the&#xD;
           addition of physical activity counseling; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 12-month attention-control condition focusing on stress-management skills training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on physical activity participation, saturated fat consumption, and related quality of&#xD;
      life indicators (e.g., improved physical functioning, fitness, sleep, and psychological&#xD;
      well-being) will be collected at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months post-test. The&#xD;
      primary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants assigned to the physical activity and dietary counseling conditions will&#xD;
           show greater improvements in physical activity participation and saturated fat&#xD;
           consumption at 12 months compared to the attention-control condition; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants in the sequentially-delivered counseling interventions will show greater&#xD;
           improvements in physical activity and saturated fat consumption compared to participants&#xD;
           in the simultaneously-delivered interventions.&#xD;
