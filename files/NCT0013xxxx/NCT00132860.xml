    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate, in patients with moderate to severe chronic&#xD;
      obstructive lung disease, whether intermittent antibiotic treatment leads to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A slower rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A reduction in the frequency and severity of exacerbations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fewer hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An improved quality of life as compared to a group of placebo treated patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients above 50 years of age, with a current admission for exacerbation of COLD or&#xD;
             at least one admission within the previous two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or ex-smoker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 60% in stable condition (&gt; 4 weeks after hospitalisation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &lt; 300 ml bronchodilator reversibility in FEV1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with end-stage COLD, who are not expected to survive for 3 years (typically&#xD;
             bedridden patients being dyspnoeic in rest).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known other respiratory tract infection, e.g. tuberculosis or&#xD;
             aspergillosis, in whom the intervention is known to be inefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pulmonary malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other pulmonary diseases than COLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with immunodeficiency. However, COLD patients treated with steroids can be&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hereditary disposition to lung infections such as&#xD;
             alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving longterm antibiotic treatment ( e.g. recurrent cystitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known allergy or intolerance to azithromycin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Manifest heart, liver or renal insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that, for reasons not stated above, are unlikely to be able to participate in&#xD;
             a study period of 3 years.&#xD;
