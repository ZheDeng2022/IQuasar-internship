  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether treatment with the drug eplerenone, taken&#xD;
      early after a heart attack, prevents or reduces some of the adverse changes that may&#xD;
      otherwise naturally occur within the heart muscle, that lead ultimately to weakening of the&#xD;
      heart muscle and premature death.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite advances in detection and treatment of coronary artery disease, and numerous&#xD;
      campaigns to promote healthier lifestyles, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) remains very common&#xD;
      worldwide but particularly in the West of Scotland. Following a heart attack, the main&#xD;
      pumping chamber - the left ventricle (LV) - will be significantly damaged in around 40% of&#xD;
      patients to the extent that it fails to pump as effectively as before. Despite current&#xD;
      medical treatment, this failing LV slowly but continuously deteriorates with time (this is&#xD;
      known as LV remodelling), which can lead to &quot;heart failure&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eplerenone, a hormone blocker (aldosterone antagonist), has been shown to reduce death rates&#xD;
      and improve symptoms in patients with acute heart attacks - or myocardial infarctions (MI)-&#xD;
      who additionally have impaired LV function and heart failure (or diabetes). The researchers&#xD;
      assume that eplerenone may exert some of these beneficial effects by preventing or reducing&#xD;
      this LV remodelling process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI provides very accurate assessment of LV function, such that small numbers of&#xD;
      patients only are required to detect differences in LV function over time when comparing one&#xD;
      group against another. The researchers are therefore comparing sequential cardiac MRI&#xD;
      appearances and measurements in patients with acute MI and LV impairment at baseline (within&#xD;
      2 weeks of the acute MI), 3 months and 6 months. After the first MRI scan, patients are&#xD;
      assigned to eplerenone or placebo in addition to usual secondary preventive therapy&#xD;
      (double-blinded), which continues for 6 months, after which each patient's involvement in the&#xD;
      trial is finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As eplerenone has been shown to benefit those with acute MI plus LV impairment and heart&#xD;
      failure (or diabetes), such patients cannot ethically be put into a trial in which they may&#xD;
      potentially be placed in a placebo group. For this reason, a slightly different cohort of&#xD;
      patients are being used - acute MI with LV impairment but without clinical heart failure or&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
