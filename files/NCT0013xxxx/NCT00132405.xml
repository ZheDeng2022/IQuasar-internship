  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minor needlestick procedures often cause significant pain and distress in children, yet&#xD;
      interventions to reduce pain are used infrequently. ALGRX 3268 is a novel, single-use,&#xD;
      prefilled, needle-free dispenser that immediately delivers powdered lidocaine into the&#xD;
      epidermis and provides local analgesia in 2 to 3 minutes. The purpose of this prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial is to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of ALGRX 3268 in children aged 3 to 18 years undergoing venipuncture. The trial&#xD;
      will enroll a total of 306 children aged 3 to 18 years scheduled to undergo venipuncture of&#xD;
      the back of the hand at a single study center.&#xD;

      ALGRX 3268 (previously known as PowderJect® Dermal Lidocaine) is a system for needle-free,&#xD;
      pain-free epidermal injection of lidocaine powder that provides local anesthesia within 3&#xD;
      minutes to provide painless needle or catheter insertion for blood drawing. ALGRX 3268 is a&#xD;
      single use disposable system, incorporating a drug cassette and gas cylinder into a single&#xD;
      hand held device, with a button to actuate the system. This is a single center, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo (sham) controlled, single dose, parallel group study in pediatric&#xD;
      subjects scheduled to undergo venipuncture. Three age groups are enrolled: 3-7 years, 8-12&#xD;
      years, and 13-18 years. Within each age group, subjects are randomized to receive ALGRX 3268&#xD;
      0.5 mg/20 bar or pressure matched placebo. Two to 3 minutes after administration of study&#xD;
      treatment at the back of the hand, venipuncture is performed with either a&#xD;
      needle/Vacutainer®, needle/syringe or &quot;butterfly,&quot; at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
      Subjects aged 3-7 are asked to rate the pain of venipuncture using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain&#xD;
      Rating Scale, anchored at 0 for &quot;no hurt&quot; and 5 for &quot;hurts worst.&quot; Subjects in oldest age&#xD;
      group complete a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), anchored at 0 for &quot;no pain&quot; and at 100&#xD;
      for &quot;extreme pain.&quot; Subjects in the middle group used both the Wong-Baker FACES scale and the&#xD;
      VAS to rate the pain of venipuncture. Safety ratings of skin are completed 15, 30, and 60&#xD;
      minutes after the procedure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Outpatient children of either gender who were to undergo venipuncture at the back of&#xD;
             the hand&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children must have had sufficient cognitive skills to identify faces depicting&#xD;
             extremes of pain on the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (ages 3-12) and/or the&#xD;
             extremes of pain on a 100 mm VAS (ages 8-18).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages 3 to 7 years; 8 to 12 years; and 13 to 18 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent forms must have been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board&#xD;
             (IRB). Signed informed consent must have been granted by the parent or legal guardian&#xD;
             and assent to participate should have been sought (either verbally or in writing) from&#xD;

             designee were sexually active, a negative urine pregnancy test must have been&#xD;
             documented prior to enrollment. A negative urine pregnancy test was required in all&#xD;
             teenage girls over the age of 14 years. Surgically sterile females did not require a&#xD;
             pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  Previous history of allergic reactions to any local anesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition or instability that, in the judgment of the investigator, might&#xD;
             have adversely impacted the conduct of the study and the collection of data&#xD;

             accomplished cleanly&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active local infection or other skin pathology on the dorsum of the hand&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who were pregnant or lactating; females who planned to become&#xD;
             pregnant; females with a positive serum or urine pregnancy test; females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential who were not using adequate contraception.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Venipuncture at the proposed site within the prior two weeks (longer if bruising was&#xD;
