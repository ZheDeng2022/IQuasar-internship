  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to conduct a community-based intervention and evaluate the&#xD;
      independent and combined effects of two intervention strategies on primary and secondary&#xD;
      prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) among members of rural Appalachian churches. The&#xD;
      sampling frame consists of all of the churches in a 7 county area of western West Virginia.&#xD;
      Eligible churches will have at least 180 active members, will not share a common pastor, and&#xD;
      will have no CRC control activities. Using a 2x2 experimental design, churches will be&#xD;
      divided into two separate clusters, those with and without an existing parish nurse program.&#xD;
      Then churches from each cluster will be randomized to one of two conditions, a natural helper&#xD;
      or a control condition.&#xD;

      The purpose of this project is to conduct a community-based intervention and evaluate the&#xD;
      independent and combined effects of two intervention strategies on primary and secondary&#xD;
      prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) among members of rural Appalachian churches. Many&#xD;
      regions of Appalachia have high poverty, low education, and high unemployment. Health&#xD;
      disparities are great in this region and social and behavioral factors put many individuals&#xD;
      at high risk for increased mortality from CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling frame consists of all churches in a 7 county area of western West Virginia.&#xD;
      Eligible churches will have at least 180 active members, will not share a common pastor, and&#xD;
      have no CRC control activities. Using a 2x2 experimental design, churches will be divided&#xD;
      into two separate clusters, those with and without an existing parish nurse program. Then&#xD;
      churches from each cluster will be randomized to one of two conditions, a natural helper or&#xD;
      control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible church members will be adult males and females who are identified through member&#xD;
      lists provided by the recruited churches. Because the primary outcome variable is CRC&#xD;
      screening, at least half of the recruited church members must be age 50 and older, report no&#xD;
      history of CRC, and have not recently completed CRC screening. Interested members will be&#xD;
      asked to complete an informed consent form detailing participation in either the intervention&#xD;
      or control arm of the study. The control group will be offered other health promotion&#xD;
      interventions through the church and the CRC educational materials after data collection is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected before and after the intervention activities. Study participants will&#xD;
      complete a paper and pencil survey at the church at each measurement point (baseline,&#xD;
      follow-up). The baseline survey will assess sociodemographics, psychosocial information,&#xD;
      stage of change, self-efficacy, health beliefs, barriers to change, health behavior knowledge&#xD;
      and practices involving diet, physical activity, and CRC screening. The follow-up survey will&#xD;
      assess body mass index, dietary intake, physical activity level, and CRC screening by FOBT,&#xD;
      flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis to be tested is that the combination of these two community-based&#xD;
      intervention strategies will be most effective overall. To evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention strategies, the proportions in outcome measures between each intervention, the&#xD;
      combined intervention, and control groups will be compared.&#xD;
