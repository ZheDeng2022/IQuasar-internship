  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of prostate cancer. Fatigue is a lack of energy&#xD;
      that makes it harder to do the things you normally do every day. Some symptoms of fatigue&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  feeling tired and/or weak;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  having less interest in activities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  having trouble concentrating;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  feeling &quot;down&quot;;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  feeling exhausted for no clear reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are not many drugs that are helpful in treating fatigue. However, one group of&#xD;
      medications does seem to be useful. In this study, we, the investigators at Memorial&#xD;
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, will be using a psychostimulant called Ritalin. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to see if this drug is helpful in treating fatigue in prostate cancer. We are&#xD;
      also studying the side effects of this medication.&#xD;

      This study is open to men who have prostate cancer and report feeling fatigue. We will&#xD;
      examine the impact of psychostimulant treatment on depressive symptom severity,&#xD;
      neuropsychological test performance, and overall quality of life, as well as compare the&#xD;
      frequency and severity of treatment associated adverse side effects. We will be conducting a&#xD;
      six-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial, evaluating the&#xD;
      relative benefits and risks of methylphenidate, (a psychostimulant medication). Medication&#xD;
      will be given in once or twice daily dosages (at 8 am and noon) and titrated by one capsule&#xD;
      every 2-3 days as needed to treat fatigue and as tolerated. Patients will be examined&#xD;
      regularly for safety. We will monitor vital signs and response to the medication. This study&#xD;
      will be the first of its kind to evaluate a pharmacologic intervention for fatigue in cancer&#xD;
      patients that utilizes a novel psychotropic agent (psychostimulant), and assesses outcome&#xD;
      with measures of fatigue, as well as side effects, psychological distress, depression and&#xD;
      overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To study the efficacy of methylphenidate vs. placebo in the treatment of fatigue&#xD;
      in ambulatory men with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the frequency and severity of adverse side effects associated with this&#xD;
      psychostimulant drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of psychostimulant treatment for fatigue on related domains of&#xD;
      psychosocial function and quality of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older and English speaking (patients who cannot read will be&#xD;
             offered assistance with the consent forms and surveys). There is no maximum age cut&#xD;
             off for eligibility into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving ambulatory medical care at the time of initial assessment and primary&#xD;
             treating physician is aware of and agrees to the subject's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fatigue that has been persistent (chronic-recurrent or continuous for a period of at&#xD;
             least 2 weeks), and is reported to have an intensity of moderate or severe (a score of&#xD;
             4 or greater on one question that assesses fatigue over a two week period on a 0-10&#xD;
             numeric rating scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have already received six weeks of Procrit therapy at 60,000 units for&#xD;
             anemia and still have significant fatigue will then become eligible for this stimulant&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received three weeks of thyroid supplementation therapy for&#xD;
             hypothyroidism and still have significant fatigue will then become eligible for this&#xD;
             stimulant trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental Status score of 22 or below) or&#xD;
             psychiatric disturbance sufficient, in the investigator's judgment, to preclude data&#xD;
             collection and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of severe renal or hepatic disease; serum creatinine and liver function tests&#xD;
             (LFT's) must be no higher than 2 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A white blood cell count below 2,000 cells per cubic millimeter or platelets 60,000&#xD;
             per cubic millimeter or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure [BP] of 170/100 or greater) will exclude&#xD;
             patients from the study. For those patients with histories of controlled hypertension&#xD;
             (either by diet or medication), methylphenidate may increase resting blood pressure by&#xD;
             5 mmHg. (The patients will have blood pressure, pulse and other vital signs monitored&#xD;
             weekly under the auspices of the Genitourinary Clinic, or at home under the&#xD;
             instruction of the research nurse, using a blood pressure monitor issued by the&#xD;
             study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urgent need of a primary medical therapy for fatigue that would be more appropriate&#xD;
             than the study drug (eg, severe anemia where the hemoglobin is less than 11.0 or if&#xD;
             the patient is symptomatic. Patients who have already received six weeks of Procrit&#xD;
             therapy and still have significant fatigue will then become eligible for this trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients found to have significant hypothyroidism (as defined by thyroid stimulating&#xD;
             hormone test greater than 4.42 upon blood chemistry screening), will be ineligible for&#xD;
             this study until they have completed three weeks of appropriate thyroid&#xD;
             supplementation and are still found to exhibit significant fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of substance abuse (ie, stimulant drugs, cocaine, or injection drug use) or&#xD;
             participation in a methadone maintenance program. Patients with a history of alcohol&#xD;
             abuse will not be excluded from this study if they are currently not abusing alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meeting criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive episode - current (screening for&#xD;
             major depression will be completed using the Structured Clinical Interview for&#xD;
             DSM-IIIR, Nonpatient Version [SCID-NP]). Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase (MAO)&#xD;
             inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or a psychostimulant will exclude subjects from&#xD;
             study participation. Concurrent use of other antidepressant medications (eg, selective&#xD;
             serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
             [SNRIs]) will not exclude subjects from study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to, or intolerance of, methylphenidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Patient Performance Rating score of 50 or below.&#xD;
