  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the immune system changes with aging and makes&#xD;
      influenza a more serious illness in older people. Influenza vaccination not only can protect&#xD;
      people from getting the flu but also can lessen the severity of the illness. This is&#xD;
      particularly true for people with congestive heart failure (CHF). This research may provide&#xD;
      information that could eventually lead to a new laboratory test that will predict how&#xD;
      effective vaccination is for preventing influenza illness in older people. Volunteer&#xD;
      participants in this study will include the following groups: 1) healthy young adults 20 - 40&#xD;
      years old; 2) older adults, 60 years and older, without a history of CHF; 3) older adults, 60&#xD;
      years and older, with a history of CHF. All study participants will be vaccinated with the&#xD;
      current preparation of inactivated influenza vaccine. A small amount of blood will be drawn&#xD;
      before each vaccine and at 4, 10, and 16-20 weeks afterward.&#xD;

      This study will increase the understanding of how age, congestive heart failure (CHF) or a&#xD;
      prior hospitalization for an influenza-related acute coronary event affect the immune&#xD;
      response to influenza vaccination. By elucidating the defects in the immune response to&#xD;
      influenza vaccination that are associated with the subsequent influenza illness, these&#xD;
      methods can be used to screen subsets of older adults to establish the risk profile related&#xD;
      to influenza in that population, to target these defects for future vaccine development and&#xD;
      to use these methods as surrogates of protection to screen potential vaccines prior to&#xD;
      conducting large scale clinical trials to establish clinical efficacy. The primary objective&#xD;
      is to show that granzyme B (Grz B) levels in influenza virus-stimulated peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cell cultures are lower in older adults who receive inactivated influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (IIV) and subsequently develop influenza illness compared to those who do not. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to: (1) establish a cut-off value for Grz B as a marker of increased risk for&#xD;
      influenza illness; (2) show that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels are lower and&#xD;
      interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are higher in influenza virus-stimulated peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cell cultures from vaccinated older adults who subsequently develop influenza&#xD;
      illness compared to those who do not; (3) determine the effect of macrophage migration&#xD;
      inhibitory facator (MIF) on T-cell responses to influenza vaccination; (4) determine the&#xD;
      association between CHF and ischemic heart disease (IHD) including acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      and the immune response to influenza vaccination; (5) determine the effect of functional&#xD;
      status measured by the Six-Minute Walk Test (SMWT) on immune responsiveness to influenza&#xD;
      vaccination; (6) determine the effect of medications with anti-inflammatory effects including&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) on&#xD;
      immune responsiveness to influenza vaccination; (7) evaluate the effect of the age-related&#xD;
      decline in the expression of the costimulatory molecule, CD28, on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, on&#xD;
      the Grz B response to influenza vaccination; (8) study the potential role of&#xD;
      activation-induced cell death (AICD) on the T helper type 1 (Th1: IFN-gamma) versus T helper&#xD;
      type 2 (Th2: IL-10) response to influenza vaccination; (9) determine in vitro whether or not&#xD;
      co-stimulatory molecules such as 4-1BB ligand or CD70 can be used to augment the cytokine,&#xD;
      Grz B or CTL responses to influenza vaccines in older adults; (10) determine in vitro whether&#xD;
      or not heat shock proteins (HSP) can be used to augment the cytokine and/or Grz B response to&#xD;
      influenza vaccination in older adults; (11) determine in vitro whether or not heat shock&#xD;
      proteins (HSP) can be used to augment the cytokine and/or Grz B response to influenza&#xD;
      vaccination in older adults who develop influenza illness in spite of influenza vaccination;&#xD;
      and (12) determine in vitro whether or not heat shock proteins (HSP) increase the frequency,&#xD;
      Grz B content or proportion of influenza virus-specific CTL expressing CD28 in vaccinated in&#xD;
      older adults. The study group will consist of 150 adults, age 60 years and older,&#xD;
      characterized according to age, presence of CHF or IHD, or (to be identified in the prior&#xD;
      influenza season) an admission with an acute coronary syndrome or exacerbation of CHF. All&#xD;
      subjects will be vaccinated in the fall of each year with the current preparation of&#xD;
      trivalent, split-virus influenza vaccine. Serum antibody titers, serum cytokine levels, ex&#xD;
      vivo levels of IFN-gamma and IL-10, and ex vivo and in vitro levels of Grz B in&#xD;
      influenza-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell at pre-vaccination and&#xD;
      post-vaccination (4, 10 and 16-20 weeks) time points will be compared in subjects who do and&#xD;
      do not get influenza illness. The peak as well as the duration of response to vaccination for&#xD;
      each of the immunologic measures will be determined.&#xD;
