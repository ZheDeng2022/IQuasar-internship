  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopy is an established method of treatment for painful obstructive calcified&#xD;
      pancreatitis. It involves the disintegration of calcifications using extracorporeal shock&#xD;
      wave lithotripsy (ESWL) followed by endoscopic removal of stone fragments possibly associated&#xD;
      with stent insertion. A pilot study suggests that ESWL alone relieves pain in calcified&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis (CP). The aim of this study is to compare both techniques in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

      Endoscopic drainage of the main pancreatic duct is an established method of treatment of&#xD;
      painful obstructive calcified chronic pancreatitis (CP). It involves disintegration of&#xD;
      calcifications using extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) followed by endoscopic&#xD;
      removal of stone fragments, possibly associated with stent insertion. A pilot study suggests&#xD;
      that ESWL alone in calcified CP is followed by spontaneous elimination of stone fragments and&#xD;
      pain relief, without sphincterotomy. After ESWL alone, the exocrine function was found to&#xD;
      return to normal values in some cases. Potential benefits include lower costs and morbidity&#xD;
      as well as wider availability compared to endoscopic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the relapse of pain at&#xD;
      2 years after treatment with ESWL alone or endoscopic treatment, consisting of ESWL followed&#xD;
      by endoscopic stone extraction. Secondary outcomes include a comparison of technical results&#xD;
      (as assessed by abdominal CT Scan 1 week after the last intervention and secretin-enhanced&#xD;
      magnetic resonance at 1 month), complication rates, and treatment-related costs in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible to participate in the study according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  painful chronic pancreatitis (abdominal pain attack during the preceding 12 months);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at least 1 calcified stone greater than 4 mm in one of its axes in the cephalic or&#xD;
           corporeal portion of the main pancreatic duct with upstream duct dilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  written informed consent obtained from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  history of treatment of the pancreas using ESWL, endoscopy, or surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pancreatic collection greater than 2 cm in diameter at magnetic resonance or CT Scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  alkaline phosphatase levels greater than twice the upper limit of normal values or signs&#xD;
           of cholangitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age below 18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretherapeutic work-up will include detailed medical history (including date of the first&#xD;
      episode of typical abdominal pain, date of diagnosis of CP, number of episodes of pain during&#xD;
      the last year, alcohol intake, pain continuous or intermittent during the last episode,&#xD;
      medication, intensity of the last episode of pain on a 10-point scale as previously&#xD;
      described), blood chemistry, stool sampling (for elastase measurement), triolein breath test,&#xD;
      plain abdominal film taken in four classical positions (left anterior oblique, right anterior&#xD;
      oblique, lateral, and supine), CT Scan without contrast medium injection, and&#xD;
      secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent of the referring physician has been obtained, patients will be asked&#xD;
      to participate in the study. If the patient accepts, after oral and written consent, he (or&#xD;
      she) will be randomized to the ESWL or endoscopy group by opening an opaque sealed envelope&#xD;
      numbered according to a table of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESWL will be performed in all patients using a electromagnetic lithotriptor as previously&#xD;
      described. Shock-waves will be focused on the obstructing stones (if multiple stones are&#xD;
      present, those responsible for MPD obstruction will be identified by comparing plain&#xD;
      abdominal film, CT Scan and S-MRCP). ESWL sessions will be repeated if necessary, until stone&#xD;
      fragmentation is obtained, as confirmed by abdominal plain film centered on the targeted area&#xD;
      of the pancreas. At this time, treatment will be considered terminated in the ESWL group,&#xD;
      patients in the endoscopy group will undergo endoscopy immediately, for endoscopic extraction&#xD;
      of stone fragments possibly associated to stent insertion according to previously published&#xD;
      criteria and techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over: in the ESWL group, if no elimination of the fragments is observed one week after&#xD;
      the last ESWL, endoscopic drainage of the main pancreatic duct will be carried out at this&#xD;
      time in case of continuous pain. For patients without continuous pain, delayed spontaneous&#xD;
      elimination of the fragments will be sought by CT Scan and S-MRCP 2 months after the last&#xD;
      ESWL. Endoscopic drainage of the main pancreatic duct will be proposed during follow-up only&#xD;
      to the patients presenting a painful attack of CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will consist of clinical examination 1 month after treatment and every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter. Data collected will include pain relapses, ESWL, endoscopic and surgical&#xD;
      procedures, weight change, plus any other seemingly unrelated medical treatments. In addition&#xD;
      to this, a S-MRCP will be performed 1 month after treatment. Triolein breath test will be&#xD;
      performed at 1 month and 1 year. Sampling of stools (for elastase measurement) will be&#xD;
      obtained every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs will be calculated starting on the day of first treatment as previously described.&#xD;
      Costs not directly related to the treatment of pain or of procedure-related complications&#xD;
      (e.g., diabetes) will be disregarded.&#xD;
