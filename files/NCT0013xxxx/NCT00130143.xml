  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry mouth occurs very often in patients who receive radiation treatment. Amifostine is a drug&#xD;
      approved to reduce the short and long-term occurrence of dry mouth when patients receive&#xD;
      radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. Some studies have shown that Amifostine reduces&#xD;
      the side effects of radiation treatment for lung cancer. The use of Amifostine is still being&#xD;
      investigated in lung malignancies. Amifostine is found to be a protectant from radiation side&#xD;
      effects of such normal tissues as bone marrow, skin, oral mucosal, esophagus, kidney and&#xD;
      testes. Patients that receive radiation treatments for lung cancer may experience side&#xD;
      effects involving the esophagus. It is hoped that patients will benefit from the protection&#xD;
      of their esophagus and avoid delays in radiation treatment due to side effects of the&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The protective capacity of thio-containing compounds against normal tissue damage from&#xD;
      radiation have been recognized for over 40 years..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although intravenous administration is the approved standard route, because of practical&#xD;
      advantages there has been increasing interest in the subcutaneous administration of Ethyol,&#xD;
      which presents multiple advantages when used for radioprotection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data that has been presented, as well as the personal experience of this and&#xD;
      other physicians/centers with subcutaneous administration of amifostine, the researchers are&#xD;
      proposing an open-label study evaluating the rate and severity of toxicities associated with&#xD;
      this route of administration. Toxicities to be assessed include nausea/vomiting, hypotension,&#xD;
      and skin/fever reactions.&#xD;
