      The purpose of the study is to compare one type of dressing against the current standard&#xD;
      dressing that is used to cover the unburned area of the skin where a piece of skin is removed&#xD;
      to cover another part of the body that was burned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The mean healing time for wounds treated with the Dermafill dressing will be less&#xD;
      than the mean healing time for wounds treated with Xeroform dressing.&#xD;

      At the time of the procedure, donor sites that are symmetrical in size and shape will be&#xD;
      selected. The donor sites will be harvested. Once the grafts have been harvested, the wounds&#xD;
      will be randomized for treatment using either the Dermafill dressing or Xeroform. The wound&#xD;
      dressings will then be observed at least once a day beginning post op day 2/48hours after&#xD;
      surgery until healed, which is defined as 90% or more of the wound surface is confluently&#xD;
      re-epithelized.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older; male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Burn wounds less than 30% of total body surface area (TBSA) with no systemic&#xD;
             abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Burns do not involve the harvesting area&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Burn wounds require excision and grafting of sufficient extent to justify two donor&#xD;
             sites of equal and symmetrical size on non-dependent body surface areas&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled excision and grafting procedure is the first such operation for subject&#xD;
             during this hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to participate in follow-up evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Critical illnesses requiring ventilator support, systemic infection or hemodynamic&#xD;
             instability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major acute or chronic illnesses affecting wound healing (e.g. peripheral vascular&#xD;
             disease, insulin dependent diabetes, blood clotting disorder)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject receiving medications that inhibit/compromise wound healing (e.g.&#xD;
             anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, oral steroids). The use of anticoagulants does not&#xD;
             include deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cellulitis or other infection of potential donor site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously harvested donor site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with greater than 30% TBSA burns&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
