  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate, in an Australian population of pregnant women,&#xD;
      whether the treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy prevents pre-term birth and&#xD;
      other complications of pregnancy. Dental screening and periodontal treatment protocols have&#xD;
      been based on standard techniques employed by hygienists that can be readily applied to the&#xD;
      general obstetric population.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      That treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy reduces the rate of pre-term birth&#xD;
      from 12% to 7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      That treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy reduces the rate of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fetal growth restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications of pre-term birth including respiratory distress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodontal disease measured at 36 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan Synopsis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial is being conducted with recruitment of women from the antenatal&#xD;
      clinics of Perth's major obstetric centres and associated private practices. The sample is&#xD;
      being enriched by inviting women with a history of poor oral health or pre-term birth. 5400&#xD;
      eligible women will undergo a hygienist-based screening study at 12-20 weeks gestation. 1094&#xD;
      women who meet the criteria for periodontal disease determined from our recent pilot study&#xD;
      will be allocated at random to the treatment or control groups. Those in the treatment group&#xD;
      will receive three one-hour hygienist-based periodontal treatment sessions commencing at 20&#xD;
      weeks gestation, followed by re-examination at 26 weeks. Re-treatment will be offered to the&#xD;
      5% of cases in which treatment has been ineffective, and ongoing maintenance to the&#xD;
      remainder. Women allocated to the control group will be offered similar treatment after&#xD;
      completion of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-centered single-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted within the metropolitan&#xD;
      area of Perth, Western Australia. The obstetric and newborn health care providers are blinded&#xD;
      to the periodontal treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with single pregnancies at 12 to 20 weeks gestation with periodontal disease defined as&#xD;
      periodontal pocketing at a threshold of 4mm or more at 10% or more of sites and who agree to&#xD;
      receive periodontal treatment are eligible. The definition of periodontal disease is based on&#xD;
      the published literature and our pilot study designed to determine the prevalence in our&#xD;
      local obstetric population. Periodontal pocketing is used to define the presence of&#xD;
      periodontal disease rather than clinical loss of attachment because it better represents the&#xD;
      microbial challenge and is the most frequently employed criterion. In our pilot study, 15% of&#xD;
      our general unselected population met this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are ineligible if they are: unable to attend for periodontal treatment; less than 16&#xD;
      years of age; present for antenatal care after 20 weeks gestation; are unable to understand&#xD;
      the implications of participation in the trial; have a fetus with a known abnormality that&#xD;
      would predispose the pregnancy to pre-term birth such as those that may cause polyhydramnios;&#xD;
      have a multiple pregnancy; have cardiac disease that would require antibiotic therapy for&#xD;
      dental treatment; are currently receiving periodontal treatment; or have fewer than 20 teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women planning to attend the antenatal clinics at King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEMH) in&#xD;
      Perth, Western Australia are provided with written information about the trial with their&#xD;
      appointment letter. Those attending other public antenatal clinics and a proportion of&#xD;
      private practices also receive the information and invitation. Women who do not have&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are invited by a research midwife to provide written informed consent to&#xD;
      undergo a periodontal examination. After the examination those women who meet the criteria&#xD;
      for periodontal disease are invited by a member of the research team to participate in the&#xD;
      trial and to provide written informed consent to have treatment. A questionnaire is&#xD;
      administered to obtain data on demographic and medical factors that may influence oral health&#xD;
      and details of past and present dental care. Women who are found to not have periodontal&#xD;
      disease are asked to provide consent for their obstetric outcomes to be retrieved from the&#xD;
      state-wide computerized data collection system that encompasses all births in Western&#xD;
      Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each woman is allocated to the treatment or control group by the sealed-envelope technique,&#xD;
      prepared in blocks of 20. Recruitment is stratified by history of pre-term birth, nulliparity&#xD;
      and smoking practice. Women who smoke in either arm of the study are provided with written&#xD;
      material encouraging them to cease smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of the Treatment Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women allocated to the treatment group are given appointments to attend the Oral Health&#xD;
      Centre of Western Australia (OHCWA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of the Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women allocated to the control group are provided with the findings of their periodontal&#xD;
      examination to take to their dentist and written information on oral health care. Each woman&#xD;
      is also invited to receive free dental care at OHCWA commencing 6 weeks after delivery and&#xD;
      continuing for 16 weeks, as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simple screening dental examination is a modified WHO CPITN (Gjermo,1998) conducted in a&#xD;
      well-equipped dental room within the antenatal clinic at KEMH. This examination takes&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes and is conducted by a study hygienist under supervision by the study&#xD;
      periodontists. If periodontitis is detected the woman is invited to participate in the trial&#xD;
      as described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All periodontal treatment is conducted in the Oral Health Centre of Western Australia&#xD;
      (OHCWA), located 2 km from KEMH. A full periodontal examination is first performed using a&#xD;
      constant force automated Florida probe (Florida Probe Corporation, Gainesville, Florida, USA)&#xD;
      which provides precise measurements of pocket depth to 0.2mm, and stores data directly into a&#xD;
      computer. This measurement system has been used in our pilot study and two separate probes&#xD;
      and computer systems are available for this trial. Further periodontal parameters are&#xD;
      recorded, including clinical attachment loss, full mouth bleeding after probing, and modified&#xD;
      O'Leary Plaque Index. Treatment explanation is then provided by the hygienist and consent&#xD;
      confirmed. The treatment plan for each woman is determined in consultation with a study&#xD;
      periodontist and is conducted over 3 visits each of one hour duration. These treatments&#xD;
      consist of non-surgical debridement of the sub- and supra-gingival plaque, removal of local&#xD;
      predisposing factors such as calculus, and adjustment of overhanging restorations.&#xD;
      Comprehensive oral hygiene instruction and motivation is provided at each visit as required.&#xD;
      This oral hygiene advice recommends tooth brushing and flossing after every meal and rinsing&#xD;
      with 0.12% non-alcohol based chlorhexidine mouth wash. These treatments are provided on 3&#xD;
      occasions at weekly intervals commencing at 20 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anaesthesia is employed as required (1% lignocaine with 1:80,000 adrenalin up to a&#xD;
      maximum dose of 10mls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks after the final treatment, at approximately 28 weeks gestation, a further visit is&#xD;
      made to re-evaluate periodontal status using clinical examination and the Florida probe. This&#xD;
      examination provides a quantifiable assessment of the success of treatment. Those women in&#xD;
      whom treatment has been unsuccessful are offered a further 3-visit treatment plan and we&#xD;
      estimate this will be required in 5-10% of the sample. A further two visits, each of 45&#xD;
      minutes duration is scheduled for 32 and 36 weeks gestation, at which times periodontal&#xD;
      supportive care and oral hygiene instruction and motivation are carried out as required.&#xD;
      Periodontal parameters at these visits are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full infection control barrier techniques are employed and are stringent. Procedures include&#xD;
      gowns, disposable gloves and masks, eye protection for examiner and patient, and barrier&#xD;
      methods to avoid contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic antibiotic treatment is not employed except in cases in which there is evidence of&#xD;
      multiple periodontal abscesses, impaired immune response or poorly controlled diabetes. In&#xD;
      such cases treatment involves oral metronidazole and amoxycillin in standard doses for 5 days&#xD;
      commencing with the treatment. In the pilot study we observed no cases meeting these&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women allocated to the control group are offered periodontal care after birth commencing 6&#xD;
      weeks after delivery. This care involves the same initial assessment and 3-visit treatment&#xD;
      protocol as for women in the treatment group. A further full periodontal examination is&#xD;
      conducted 4 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of their involvement in the study, women in both groups will be offered&#xD;
      ongoing maintenance care at OCHWA and this care will be free of charge if they hold a health&#xD;
      care card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women Who Deliver Pre-Term:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those women who deliver pre-term will be offered a further screening examination at OHCWA and&#xD;
      treatment as for the control group. Information in this regard will be provided at the time&#xD;
      of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstetric Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obstetric and midwifery health care providers are unaware of the treatment allocation of&#xD;
      each woman in the study. Care is provided according to the standard protocols employed within&#xD;
      each hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample is enriched by advertising in the general media and in our peripheral public&#xD;
      hospitals for women with poor oral health or a history of pre-term birth to attend KEMH for a&#xD;
      single visit between 12 and 20 weeks gestation for periodontal examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 540 women in each arm provides power to detect a reduction in the rate of&#xD;
      pre-term birth from 12% to 7% with power of 90% and an alpha level of 5%. Our pilot study of&#xD;
      272 women revealed a rate of periodontal disease of 15% in unselected women. With enrichment&#xD;
      by advertising for women at higher risk, we estimate the rate of periodontal disease will be&#xD;
      20%. Thus, for a total study size of 1080 women, 5400 need to be screened, which is rate of&#xD;
      45 each week in a 48 week working year. This sample size estimate allows two interim&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data monitoring committee will be formed and will include an independent statistician who&#xD;
      will conduct the interim analysis. The committee will cease the trial if pre-determined rates&#xD;
      of benefit or harm are achieved. Analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis&#xD;
      using tests of proportions and logistic regression that allow for multiple adjustment for&#xD;
      covariates. Secondary analyses will be conducted of dose-response of treatment and&#xD;
      appropriate comparisons made with women who received periodontal examinations but did not&#xD;
      meet eligibility criteria. All hypothesis testing will be two sided and significance will be&#xD;
      at the 5% level.&#xD;
