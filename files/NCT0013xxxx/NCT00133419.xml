    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if giving vitamin and mineral supplements helps to protect&#xD;
      infants and children from diarrhea, which vitamins and minerals help to improve a child's&#xD;
      weight and growth, and if the same results occur in infants and children with HIV. HIV is the&#xD;
      virus that causes AIDS. Study participants will include 516 infants aged 4-6 months.&#xD;
      Participants will include: (1) HIV-infected children, (2) HIV-uninfected children with&#xD;
      HIV-infected mothers, and (3) HIV-uninfected children with HIV-uninfected mothers. Subjects&#xD;
      will have an equal chance of receiving one of three different vitamin and/or mineral&#xD;
      supplements during the study. Study procedures will include up to 7 blood samples and stool&#xD;
      samples every 3 months and body composition every 6 months. Participants will be involved in&#xD;
      the study for up to 18 months.&#xD;

      A major initiative to reduce the impact of enteric infections on health and nutrition has&#xD;
      been micronutrient supplementation. Measures for routine vitamin A and zinc supplementation&#xD;
      are gaining increasing support from international agencies, including UNICEF and the WHO. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of 3 micronutrient supplements&#xD;
      (vitamin A only, vitamin A and zinc, and a micronutrient mixture containing vitamins A, B, C,&#xD;
      D, E, K, and calcium, copper, folate, iodine, iron, magnesium and zinc) on prevalent days of&#xD;
      diarrhea in 3 groups of children (HIV-infected children, HIV-uninfected children born to&#xD;
      HIV-infected women, and HIV-uninfected children born to women without HIV infection). The&#xD;
      secondary objectives of the study are: (1) to describe the pathogen-specific pattern of&#xD;
      enteric infections in both HIV-infected and uninfected children during ages 6-24 months, with&#xD;
      a focus on infection with C. parvum and other protozoan pathogens and (2) to conduct a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis of micronutrient supplementation in children aged 6-24 months.&#xD;
      The tertiary objectives of the study are: (1) to assess whether either zinc alone or a&#xD;
      micronutrient mixture containing zinc affects linear growth and body composition and (2) to&#xD;
      determine if infection with specific enteric pathogens is associated with the development of&#xD;
      persistent diarrhea lasting &gt; 14 days. The proposed study will be conducted through the&#xD;
      African Centre for Health and Population Studies located in Hlabisa Health District, in&#xD;
      northern KwaZulu Natal (KZN), South Africa. The study is a randomized, double blind, clinical&#xD;
      controlled trial with 3 arms in a study population of infants stratified by HIV status and&#xD;
      the HIV status of their mothers. Study participants will include a total of 516 infants aged&#xD;
      4-6 months. The following evaluations will be made throughout the study: (1) blood samples,&#xD;
      (2) stool sampling-routine (collected at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age), (3) stool&#xD;
      sampling-during diarrheal episodes, and (3) lean body mass and anthropometry (assessed at 6,&#xD;
      12, 18, and 24 months of age). Study participants will be involved in study related&#xD;
      procedures for up to 18 months.&#xD;
