      The study aims to determine whether multidisciplinary assessment of community-based patients,&#xD;
      who have had at least one previous fall, reduces the rate of further falls and fall-related&#xD;
      problems. The study also aims to determine whether such an intervention, if effective, is&#xD;
      best carried out in a primary or secondary care setting.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one in three people aged sixty five and over are reported to fall in the community&#xD;
      each year and in the very elderly this figure is nearer 40 % (1,2). The morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality resulting from falls in the elderly is substantial and the costs associated with&#xD;
      such falls are likely to rise with the predicted growth in the elderly population. The Health&#xD;
      of the Nation document recognises that falls are an important cause of disability and use of&#xD;
      the health service in older people (3). More than 50% of accidental deaths in those aged&#xD;
      sixty five years and over are due to falls, and survivors of falls have a tow-fold increased&#xD;
      chance of being hospitalised (4). The target of the Health of the Nation is to reduce the&#xD;
      death rate for accidents among people aged sixty five and over by at least 33% by the year&#xD;
      2005 (3). Prevention of falls and fall-related injuries will be a major factor in achieving&#xD;
      such targets. It is therefore wise that approaches which are appropriate and likely to be&#xD;
      effective are adequately researched and implemented if indicated. There have been a number of&#xD;
      approaches to studying the prevention of falls, and their sequelae, in the elderly and these&#xD;
      are explored in the accompanying literature review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether multidisciplinary assessment of community-based patients, who have had&#xD;
      at least one previous fall, reduces the rate of further falls and fall-related problems. The&#xD;
      study also aims to determine whether such an intervention, if effective, is best carried out&#xD;
      in a primary or secondary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary prevention randomised controlled trial of two different settings for the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary intervention versus &quot;usual care&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be done prior to allocation on a cluster basis. This means that the&#xD;
      principal liaising General Practitioner in each practice will sign consent to volunteering&#xD;
      their &quot;cluster&quot; involvement in the study (this will also set out their duties to their&#xD;
      patients). The reason for this type of randomisation is to avoid &quot;contamination&quot; of usual&#xD;
      care patients which would be likely if a General Practitioner were receiving regular&#xD;
      information about patients who were in an intervention arm of the trial. Assent to study&#xD;
      participation would also be sought from all individuals, without their first knowing the&#xD;
      precise nature of the intervention (5) so as to allow follow up of the control group.&#xD;
      Subjects recruited to the intervention groups would receive an information sheet outlining&#xD;
      the study and what the intervention would involve and assent would be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thought that the trial will involve approximately 516 patients in total. A recent local&#xD;
      pilot study of a smaller falls related project identified 70 patients in 9 months in a&#xD;
      practice with a list of 17,000 patients. It is expected that the total population base from&#xD;
      which patients will be identified will be 60,000. It is likely that the number required to&#xD;
      participate will be identified over a one year period. Power calculations indicate that to&#xD;
      provide a good chance of achieving a statistically significant result approximately 150&#xD;
      individuals will be needed in each of the three arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first intervention group will undergo a multidisciplinary assessment by a physician,&#xD;
      occupational therapist and physiotherapist (see enclosed assessment form) based in a falls&#xD;
      clinic at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital (RHCH). All patients will have full blood&#xD;
      count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, Vitamin D level,&#xD;
      bone profile, electrocardiogram and urinalysis. Further investigation, treatment modification&#xD;
      and onward referral will be made as appropriate and relevant to each individual. The&#xD;
      patient's General Practitioner will receive written communication regarding the visit,&#xD;
      outcome and further recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second intervention group will under go a Community-based process. All identified fallers&#xD;
      will undergo an assessment by a health worker in each participating practice. This&#xD;
      individual, identified within the practice, and trained in the assessment of fallers by staff&#xD;
      at the RHCH Falls Clinic, will administer a questionnaire, and make referrals to&#xD;
      physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and the patients own General Practitioner as deemed&#xD;
      necessary. Individuals who score particularly highly or are considered appropriate by the&#xD;
      Primary Care team may still be referred onward to the Hospital Falls Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged over 65 years of age who are identified in the community as having had at least&#xD;
      one fall in the preceding month and who live in one of the participating areas. Subject&#xD;
      identification will be opportunistic and also through the ambulance service notifying the key&#xD;
      worker in a practice when a patient has fallen at home but not been transferred elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fall is defined as &quot;inadvertently coming to rest on the ground or other lower level with or&#xD;
      without loss of consciousness and other than as a consequence of sudden onset of paralysis,&#xD;
      epileptic seizure, excess alcohol intake or overwhelming external force (as per Close et al&#xD;
      (6)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abbreviated mental test score of less than 7 out of 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not living in the participating areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planning to move from the area within the next year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not expected to survive for the follow up period of one year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-English speakers who do not have a relative/carer who could interpret&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified by a key worker in each participating General Practice Surgery. A&#xD;
      baseline assessment will then be done either in the patient's own home or the local surgery&#xD;
      by the key worker (district nurse/practice nurse/health visitor). The assessment will be&#xD;
      mostly questionnaire based and will seek information on basic demographic data, living&#xD;
      circumstances, Barthel score, abbreviated mental test score, circumstances of most recent&#xD;
      (index) fall and injuries sustained, information regarding previous falls in the last year,&#xD;
      risk factors for osteoporosis, 5 point Geriatric Depression Score, and Elderly Falls Test&#xD;
      Score score. A timed &quot;get up and go&quot; will also be done. All assessors will be trained in the&#xD;
      administration of the assessment to reduce inter-assessor variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the intervention groups will attend for assessment in the Falls Clinic or in&#xD;
      the primary care setting as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in the conventional management group will receive usual care from their primary care&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be sent a paid reply postcard monthly on which to record any falls and fall&#xD;
      injuries. If this is not returned the subject will be telephoned (when possible). If a fall&#xD;
      has been recorded the patient will be contacted by telephone for further details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one year the baseline assessment will be repeated. Data will be analysed on an&#xD;
      intention to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants in each group to have at least one further fall during follow&#xD;
           up year&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Move to institutional care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in Barthel score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in &quot;Get up and go&quot; score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fall related admissions during follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fall related fractures&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISSEMINATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended that this trial will be subject to peer review and publication will be sought.&#xD;
      Dissemination of information to local practices and interested parties via presentations.&#xD;
