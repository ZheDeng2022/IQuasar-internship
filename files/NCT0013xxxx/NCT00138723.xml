  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 trial will investigate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of fesoterodine&#xD;
      fumarate (SR) (fesoterodine; SPM 907) in adult male and female subjects with overactive&#xD;
      bladder syndrome. The trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled multicenter&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consisted of a 2 week Run-In period, 12 week double-blind Treatment period and 2&#xD;
      week Safety Follow-Up period. Subjects were randomized to one of 3 treatment arms receiving&#xD;
      either fesoterodine fumarate 4mg, fesoterodine fumarate 8mg, or placebo during the&#xD;
      double-blind Treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two primary efficacy variables will be assessed for submission in the United States: change&#xD;
      in the average number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours and the change in the average&#xD;
      number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours. For the submissions in the European Union,&#xD;
      the first primary variable will be the change in the average number of micturitions&#xD;
      (frequency) per 24 hours and the co-primary variable is the treatment response, based on a&#xD;
      treatment benefit scale. All continuous variables will be measured as changes from baseline&#xD;
      to value after 12 weeks of treatment. The following safety variables were observed and&#xD;
      assessed: adverse events, change in residual urinary volume (mL), change in laboratory&#xD;
      parameters, change in vital signs, change in electrocardiogram (ECG), change in physical&#xD;
      examination and change in urological/urogynecological examination.&#xD;
