  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to determine the changes in gene expression induced by IFNb-1a (Rebif)&#xD;
      and atorvastatin (Lipitor) combination therapy in patients with an isolated clinical syndrome&#xD;
      suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), to identify markers of therapeutic response, and to&#xD;
      predict patients' clinical response based on their in vitro response to this combination&#xD;
      therapy measured by the gene expression levels in activated peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMCs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disease, characterized pathologically by&#xD;
      focal areas of inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and degeneration in the central&#xD;
      nervous system. MS follows several different disease courses. Approximately, 90% of patients&#xD;
      have a relapsing form of the disease. We propose that atorvastatin (Lipitor) may enhance the&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects of INFb-1a (Rebif) in patients with clinically isolated neurological&#xD;
      syndrome suggestive of MS. This combination may be more effective in preventing development&#xD;
      of definitive relapsing-remitting MS if administered early in the course of the disease. The&#xD;
      study will identify markers of disease activity that are selectively affected by this&#xD;
      combination therapy. Identified markers may be used in future clinical trials to predict&#xD;
      patient's clinical response and to monitor the response to treatment as a secondary outcome&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;
