  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we, the investigators at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, intend to&#xD;
      explore whether bupropion is able to reduce smokers' responses to cigarette-related&#xD;
      environmental cues, and craving. Previous studies have indicated that bupropion may be able&#xD;
      to achieve these outcomes. Therefore, we predict that smokers treated with bupropion for&#xD;
      several weeks will show reduced reactivity to cigarette cues and craving.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current smoking cessation pharmacotherapy paradigms ignore the over-learned behaviour&#xD;
      associated with smoking, thus contributing to the relatively poor absolute efficacy of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy. Chronic nicotine use causes adaptive changes in the brain that differ from&#xD;
      the acute effects leading to craving when smoking is stopped. This is a key element of&#xD;
      relapse. Thus, the development of more effective treatments involves a better understanding&#xD;
      of craving and relapse by exploring the interaction between the psychology and neurobiology&#xD;
      of nicotine addiction. Bupropion, an amphetamine derivative, has demonstrated efficacy in&#xD;
      smoking cessation in motivated smokers. Its' mechanism of action is unclear but may be&#xD;
      mediated by extinction processes. We hypothesize that bupropion will reduce&#xD;
      cue-responsiveness and subsequent cravings in current smokers who are not consciously&#xD;
      attempting to quit or cut down on smoking. Fifty smokers (&gt;10 cigarettes/day) of either sex&#xD;
      will be recruited to take either oral placebo or bupropion 150 mg twice daily for a total of&#xD;
      42 days. Subjects will attend bi-weekly experimental sessions where cue-responsiveness will&#xD;
      be measured using physiological and subjective responses to a variety of neutral and&#xD;
      smoking-related cues. Subjective effects will be measured using the Questionnaire of Smoking&#xD;
      Urges, the Tobacco Craving Questionnaire and Visual Analog Scales. Subjects will record&#xD;
      smoking behaviour and subjective experiences daily in a smoking diary. Outcome variables&#xD;
      include cue responsiveness, daily diary ratings, exhaled end tidal CO levels, plasma cotinine&#xD;
      levels, and subjective effects. Gender effects will be assessed by using sex as a covariate&#xD;
      in the analysis. This study will provide preliminary data on pharmacotherapy-assisted&#xD;
      extinction as a novel approach to smoking cessation.&#xD;
