  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well vorinostat works in treating patients with recurrent&#xD;
      or persistent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as vorinostat, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vorinostat may also stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      persistent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer treated with vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug, in terms of the frequency and severity of adverse&#xD;
      reactions in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the clinical response rate (partial response and complete response) in patients&#xD;
      treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients&#xD;
      treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the impact of prognostic variables (e.g., platinum sensitivity, performance&#xD;
      status, and cellular histology) in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within&#xD;
      approximately 1 year.&#xD;
