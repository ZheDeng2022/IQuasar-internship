    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the effects and safety of Sensipar approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients with kidney failure who are being treated with&#xD;
      dialysis and have uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT).&#xD;

      The purposes of this study are: - To assess the effectiveness of a treatment algorithm that&#xD;
      includes Sensipar on bio-intact parathyroid hormone (biPTH), adjusted serum calcium (Ca),&#xD;
      serum phosphorus (P), and calcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P) levels in the management of&#xD;
      SHPT in CKD subjects on dialysis by determining achievement of National Kidney Foundation&#xD;
      Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) Guideline targets. - To assess the use of&#xD;
      vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders when Sensipar is incorporated in the treatment of&#xD;
      SHPT. - To assess the safety and tolerability of Sensipar.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects with chronic kidney disease who have received dialysis for&#xD;
        at least one month before the first dose of study medication and are clinically stable. -&#xD;
        Adults at least 18 years of age who have given written informed consent. - Out of target&#xD;
        PTH values, defined as the most recent historical measurement of biPTH &gt; 160 pg/mL within 3&#xD;
        months prior to informed consent signature. - Serum calcium &gt;/= 8.4 mg/dL within one month&#xD;
        prior to informed consent signature. Exclusion Criteria: - Unstable medical condition,&#xD;
        defined as having been hospitalized within 30 days before Day 1, or otherwise unstable in&#xD;
        the judgement of the investigator. Hospitalization solely for dialysis vascular access&#xD;
        revision does not qualify as an unstable medical condition. - Parathyroidectomy in the 3&#xD;
        months before Day 1. - Current gastrointestinal disorder that may be associated with&#xD;
        impaired absorption of orally administered medications or an inability to swallow tablets.&#xD;
        - Use of investigational drug or device or participation in trial of investigational drug&#xD;
        or device (except experimental dialysis machines) within 30 days of enrollment into the&#xD;
        study. Any investigational procedures. - Females of child-bearing potential who are&#xD;
        pregnant (e.g., positive serum pregnancy test) or are breast feeding. Females of child&#xD;
        bearing potential who refuse to use highly effective contraceptive measures (as determined&#xD;
        by the investigator) throughout the study. - Hypersensitivity to Sensipar or any of its&#xD;
        components. - Previously participated in this or any other Sensipar study, or received/is&#xD;
        receiving Sensipar as a commercially available product. - Disorder that would compromise&#xD;
        the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study&#xD;
        procedures.&#xD;
