    <textblock>
      This study will measure brain excitability in patients with succinic semialdehyde&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, and in their parents. SSADH is a rare inherited disease in&#xD;
      which changes in certain brain chemicals affect brain cell activity. Symptoms vary greatly&#xD;
      among patients, and may include mental retardation, impaired ability to coordinate movements,&#xD;
      and delays in language and speech development. Other symptoms may include poor muscle tone,&#xD;
      uncontrolled seizures and other neurological or behavioral abnormalities. Test findings in&#xD;
      patients and their parents will be compared with those of healthy normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following individuals may be eligible for this study: patients with SSADH who are between&#xD;
      5 and 24 years of age; parents of patients who are between 18 and 55 years of age; healthy&#xD;
      normal children who are between 10 and 17 years of age; and healthy normal adults who are&#xD;
      between 18 and 55 years of age. Candidates are screened with blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil&#xD;
           is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil,&#xD;
           creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the subject&#xD;
           may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions to help&#xD;
           position the coil properly. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face,&#xD;
           arm, or leg, and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin&#xD;
           under the coil. During the test, electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a&#xD;
           computer or other recording device, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test combines a powerful magnet with an advanced&#xD;
           computer system and radio waves to produce accurate, detailed pictures of organs and&#xD;
           tissues. During the scan, the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a&#xD;
           magnetic field, wearing ear plugs to muffle loud noises that occur with electrical&#xD;
           switching of the magnetic fields. He or she can speak with a staff member via an&#xD;
           intercom system at all times during the procedure. In addition to standard MRI, subjects&#xD;
           may have newer MRI tests, such as diffusion tensor MRI and magnetic resonance&#xD;
           spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above, patients and their parents may also undergo the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalography (EEG): This test records brain waves (electrical activity of the&#xD;
           brain). Electrodes are placed on the scalp and brain electrical activity is recorded&#xD;
           while the subject lies quietly, breathes deeply, watches flashes of light, or sleeps.&#xD;
           Some patients may also have video-EEG monitoring, which involves simultaneous clinical&#xD;
           recording using a video camera along with brain wave recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep study and multiple sleep latency onset testing (MSLT): Electrodes are placed on&#xD;
           the subject's scalp and remain there while the subject sleeps in the hospital overnight.&#xD;
           MSLT is done the next day, starting 2 hours after the subject wakes up from the night's&#xD;
           sleep. A total of five 20- to 30-minute naps are recorded, each every 2 hours, to access&#xD;
           daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve conduction studies: This test measures the speed with which nerves conduct&#xD;
           electrical impulses and the strength of the connection between the nerve and the muscle.&#xD;
           A probe is placed on the skin to deliver a small electrical stimulus, and wires taped on&#xD;
           the skin record the impulses.&#xD;

      Objective: To study cortical excitability, electroencephalography patterns, nerve conduction&#xD;
      velocity, and sleep patterns, in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, a&#xD;
      rare autosomal recessive pediatric neurotransmitter disease associated with elevated levels&#xD;
      of brain gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter. The clinical&#xD;
      phenotype includes mental retardation, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients with SSADH deficiency, parents of patients (who are obligate&#xD;
      heterozygotes), and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a natural history study in which subjects will have a series of&#xD;
      neurophysiological tests. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique&#xD;
      that allows for measures of cortical excitation and inhibition. Electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
      measures baseline brain electrical activity. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed of&#xD;
      conduction of impulses by peripheral nerves. Polysomnography records sleep cycles and&#xD;
      associated eye movements, muscle potentials, heart rate, and respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Motor cortex excitability threshold, paired pulse facilitation, and paired&#xD;
      pulse inhibition on TMS will be the main outcome measures. Values will be compared across the&#xD;
      4 groups of patients, carriers, adult and child healthy volunteers. Additional measures will&#xD;
      include nerve conduction velocity, EEG frequency, and sleep patterns.&#xD;
