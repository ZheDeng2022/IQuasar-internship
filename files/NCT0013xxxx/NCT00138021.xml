  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of combining cognitive&#xD;
      remediation and Supported Employment Program (SEP) services to improve work outcomes in&#xD;
      people with a serious mental illness who have been unable to benefit from vocational services&#xD;
      (i.e., acquire or maintain a job). Cognitive remediation involves treating and improving&#xD;
      cognitive impairments, such as memory (e.g., short-term and working memory), attention span,&#xD;
      or problem solving skills. It is hypothesized that cognitive remediation will significantly&#xD;
      improve peoples' employment outcomes in a supported employment program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ample evidence documents that supported employment is an effective strategy for improving the&#xD;
      vocational outcomes of persons with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses. However,&#xD;
      a significant amount of clients receiving supported employment services work little or not at&#xD;
      all. With respect to factors that may influence the work outcomes of persons participating in&#xD;
      supported employment programs, cognitive functioning appears to be potentially important.&#xD;
      Cognitive impairment in persons with severe mental illness (SMI) is strongly correlated with&#xD;
      functional adjustment in the community and has been shown to be correlated with work, both&#xD;
      contemporaneously and prospectively. Studies have demonstrated that clients who did not&#xD;
      receive the full benefits of supported employment had more deficits in executive functioning,&#xD;
      memory, and psychomotor speed than those clients who had better work outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will use a computerized cognitive training program that will be&#xD;
      administered by a cognitive trainer. The program consists of 24 training modules (each one&#xD;
      takes about one hour to complete). Clients in an SEP who have been unable to maintain a job&#xD;
      that they acquired while in the program can participate in the research. Clients who have&#xD;
      agreed to participate in the research project will be randomly assigned to either receive the&#xD;
      computerized training and supported employment services (CT-SES) or supported employment&#xD;
      services (SES) without the training (i.e., treatment-as-usual-condition). Both research&#xD;
      groups will receive the same baseline, three-month, and 12-month follow up interviews that&#xD;
      will consists of a brief clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, an assessment of&#xD;
      problems associated with finding or maintaining employment, and employment outcomes while&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. In addition, both groups will receive a telephonic interview at 18 and&#xD;
      24 months to assess their employment outcomes (clinical and neurological information will not&#xD;
      be collected at 18 or 24 months).&#xD;

    <description>The cognitive training model used in the McGurk et al. (2005) study is referred to as the &quot;Thinking Skills for Work&quot; program. The program is a manualized, remediative and compensatory training intervention that is integrated with SE services. The program includes a cognitive trainer, a structured training manual (McGurk &amp; Mueser, unpublished training manual) and a computer-based cognitive training program (described below).</description>
