  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is one of the most important causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide. Prevention and treatment of preterm labor is important, not as an end in itself,&#xD;
      but as a means of reducing adverse events for the neonate. A wide range of tocolytics, drugs&#xD;
      used to suppress uterine contractions, have been tried. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the most&#xD;
      widely used tocolytic at the American University of Beirut Medical Center despite the fact&#xD;
      that an effective tocolytic role of MgSO4 has never been established. Moreover, the currently&#xD;
      available data are suggestive of deleterious fetal effects of MgSO4 in the setting of preterm&#xD;
      labor to the extent that some authorities are recommending abandoning it for routine use as a&#xD;
      tocolytic therapy. Calcium channel blockers have the ability to inhibit contractility in&#xD;
      smooth muscle cells. Consequently, nifedipine has emerged as an effective and rather safe&#xD;
      alternative tocolytic agent for the management of preterm labor after several studies have&#xD;
      shown that the use of nifedipine in comparison with other tocolytics is associated with a&#xD;
      more frequent successful prolongation of pregnancy, resulting in significantly fewer&#xD;
      admissions of newborns to the neonatal intensive care unit, and is associated with a lower&#xD;
      incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. The unequivocal impact of this method of&#xD;
      tocolysis on short term postponement of delivery and the opportunity that this provides for&#xD;
      affecting in-utero transfer and steroid administration has prompted many investigators to&#xD;
      recommend focusing future trials on testing different dose regimens of nifedipine. To the&#xD;
      best of the investigators' knowledge, no study comparing two different dose regimens of&#xD;
      nifedipine has been previously published in the literature. The objective of their study is&#xD;
      to compare the effectiveness of a high versus a low dose regimen in a total of 200 patients&#xD;
      admitted with the diagnosis of preterm labor between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators' study will try to assess the safety profile of the 2 dose&#xD;
      regimens on the mother and the neonate by assessing a selected number of outcome variables.&#xD;
      The data generated will be used to change their protocol for managing patients presenting&#xD;
      with threatened preterm delivery and will fill the existing gap regarding the most effective&#xD;
      and safest dose regimen of nifedipine in such patients.&#xD;

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All pregnant women diagnosed with preterm labor defined as regular contractions&#xD;
           associated with cervical change between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preterm rupture of membranes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Congenital fetal malformations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IUGR (intra uterine growth restriction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous tocolysis this pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chorioamnionitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical dilation &gt; 4 cms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal medical conditions such as renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, or&#xD;
           myasthenia gravis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-reassuring fetal heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal hypotension, defined as a blood pressure &lt; 90/50 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization envelopes will be prepared by means of a random number table. After informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained, the next numbered opaque envelope will be opened to assign each patient&#xD;
      to receive either the low or high nifedipine dose regimen. Because of the different doses of&#xD;
      nifedipine, neither patients nor physicians will be blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine studies and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A baseline ECG will be performed before starting the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive a 500-mL intravenous bolus of isotonic sodium chloride&#xD;
           solution unless they have clinical volume overload, followed by a maintenance&#xD;
           administration of 125 mL/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded every 15 minutes as long as the&#xD;
           patient is in labor and every 4 hours thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fetal heart rate and uterine activity were monitored continuously throughout the study&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients eligible for the study will receive antibiotic prophylaxis for Group B&#xD;
           Streptococcal infection (IV Pen G or Ampicillin) for at least 48 hours, pending the&#xD;
           vaginorectal swab culture that is done routinely on every patient presenting with&#xD;
           preterm labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive one course of 12 mg betamethasone intramuscularly every 24&#xD;
           hours for 48 hours to promote fetal lung maturation and a rescue dose if they present in&#xD;
           labor again at &lt; 34 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First arm (high dose):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nifedipine (Adalat速) 20 mg sublingual crushed, repeated after 30 minutes if contractions do&#xD;
      not decrease in intensity. Maintenance of 120-160 mgs of slow-release nifedipine (Nifedicor速)&#xD;
      daily for 48 hours (30 mg Q 6 hrs up to a maximum of 40 mg Q 6 hrs). Once contractions cease,&#xD;
      nifedipine will be maintained at 80-120 mg daily in divided doses up to 36 weeks of gestation&#xD;
      on an outside basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second arm (low dose):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nifedipine (Adalat速) 10 mg sublingual crushed, then 10 mg sublingual in 15 min, followed by&#xD;
      10 mg PO Q 15 mins PRN to a maximum of 40 mg in the first hour. Maintenance of 60-80 mgs of&#xD;
      slow-release nifedipine (Nifedicor速) daily for 48 hours (20 mg Q 8 hrs or 20 mg Q 6 hrs).&#xD;
      Once contractions cease, nifedipine will be maintained at 60 mg daily in divided doses up to&#xD;
      36 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tocolysis will be considered to be achieved when uterine activity decrease to &lt;4&#xD;
           contractions/h with the absence of cervical change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patients continue to have uterine activity after 6 hours or have cervical dilatation&#xD;
           &gt;2 cm after admission examination, they could be switched to another tocolytic regimen,&#xD;
           namely intravenous MgSO4 or intravenous ritodrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The written consent will be handed to every pregnant patient eligible for this study. She&#xD;
      will be given enough time to read it and decide whether she is willing to participate in the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speed of onset of uterine quiescence&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  IVH all grades&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal nursery stay&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Neonatal death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects associated with nifedipine include a mild decrease in blood pressure and a rise&#xD;
      in pulse, headache, flushing, dizziness and nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial information in the data sheets will be filled by the resident in charge of&#xD;
      delivery suite. However, the follow up on the response of the patients to the medication and&#xD;
      data regarding the maternal side effects and neonatal outcome will be filled by a part time&#xD;
      research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS statistical package. Categoric data&#xD;
      like maternal characteristics, the rates of neonatal morbidity and mortality will be compared&#xD;
      using Chi square when sample sizes support the approximation. Otherwise, categorical data&#xD;
      will be analyzed with two-tailed Fisher exact test if the expected cell frequencies were&#xD;
      small. Continuous variables will be compared by Student t test if assumptions of normality&#xD;
      and homogeneity of variances appeared to be reasonable. Unpaired variables and differences in&#xD;
      distributions will be compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Neonatal outcomes will be&#xD;
      analyzed comparing the total number of affected neonates in each group. A p-value &lt;0.05 will&#xD;
      be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed budget:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personnel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A part time research assistant with &quot;BS&quot; background 450,000 L.L./ month x 29 months&#xD;
      =13,050,000 L.L.&#xD;
