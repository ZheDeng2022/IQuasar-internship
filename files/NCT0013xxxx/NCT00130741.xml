      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) is a disorder of motility of the entire GI tract that produces&#xD;
      cramping, abdominal pain, constipation, and/or diarrhea and sometimes passing of mucus in&#xD;
      bowel movements. In most people with IBS, the GI tract is highly sensitive to many stimuli,&#xD;
      including diet and distension from gas. Among dietary suspects are high-fat or other&#xD;
      high-calorie meals, dairy products, wheat, citrus fruits, coffee, and tea which can trigger&#xD;
      spasms of the colon muscle. During an episode, GI tract contractions become stronger and more&#xD;
      frequent, and the resulting rapid motility may lead to diarrhea. When colon motility is&#xD;
      reduced, bowel movements do not occur regularly, resulting in constipation. Cramping appears&#xD;
      to be induced by strong contractions and increased sensitivity of pain receptors in the large&#xD;
      intestine. IBS can be triggered or intensified by stress due to communications between the&#xD;
      central nervous system and the nervous system of the small and large intestines. This is&#xD;
      sometimes referred to as a brain-gut connection and is supported by inspection of&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) traces which showed significantly greater EEG abnormality in IBS&#xD;
      patients (29.2%) than in controls (4.2%) [p&lt;0.02]. The degree of abnormality was positively&#xD;
      correlated with colonic motility only in IBS patients (p&lt;0.05) allowing the authors to&#xD;
      conclude that there is an electrophysiologic brain-gut interaction in IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS can cause great physical discomfort and embarrassment to many of its sufferers, but is&#xD;
      not life threatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no current consensus as to an organic cause of this syndrome and there generally&#xD;
      appears to be no sign of disease upon physical examination except for tenderness over the&#xD;
      large intestine. The diagnosis is symptom-based, usually through identification of the ROME&#xD;
      II criteria for IBS. These criteria which have been accepted worldwide by clinicians and&#xD;
      researchers as the standard for IBS diagnosis are as follows: At least 12 weeks, which need&#xD;
      not be consecutive, in the preceding 12 months of abdominal discomfort or pain that has two&#xD;
      of three features:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relieved with defecation; and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool; and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the following symptoms cumulatively support the diagnosis of IBS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal stool frequency (for research purposes &quot;abnormal&quot; may be defined as &gt;3/day and&#xD;
           &lt;3/week);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal stool form (lumpy/hard or loose/ watery stool);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete evacuation);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passage of mucus;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bloating or feeling of abdominal distension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence rate of IBS in 1998 in the U.S. was approximately 5,700 cases per 100,000&#xD;
      persons, with a much higher rate in Caucasians than in Hispanics or Afro-Americans. The total&#xD;
      direct cost of IBS, including costs of inpatient and outpatient health services utilization&#xD;
      and prescription medication, was greater than $1.6 billion annually in 1998 in the U.S.,&#xD;
      while the indirect costs, primarily absenteeism from work, are estimated at over $20 billion.&#xD;
      (1 AGA: The burden of gastrointestinal diseases) IBS is treated primarily in the physician's&#xD;
      office, with patient education, assurance and/or dietary and lifestyle modifications being&#xD;
      the rule for mild cases, but prescription medicines being offered in more moderate cases.&#xD;
      Prescription therapy for theses patients generally falls under two categories - drugs&#xD;
      affecting gut physiology and psychological treatment. Very severe cases may be treated by&#xD;
      centrally-acting agents (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors) together with psychological methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the medications generally used to affect gut physiology or abdominal pain are&#xD;
      antispasmodics, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), loperamide, Cholestyramine (for patients&#xD;
      with cholecystectomy or who may have idiopathic bile acid malabsorption) and serotonergic&#xD;
      agents (5-HT3 receptor antagonists and 5-HT4 receptor agonists). These agents show relative&#xD;
      success in improving individual symptoms only, and are only effective in specific subgroups&#xD;
      of patients (e.g.- for diarrhea-predominant, but not constipation-predominant IBS, or visa&#xD;
      versa). Due to the heterogeneity of IBS, an effective therapy for one may often lead to&#xD;
      deterioration in another. For example, Alosetron, an extensively studied 5-HT3 antagonist&#xD;
      which has shown statistically significant improvement in women with diarrhea-predominant IBS,&#xD;
      causes constipation in 20-30% of patients, and there has been no clear evidence of a benefit&#xD;
      for men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many known side effects of anticholinergic antispasmodics and TCAs, such as:&#xD;
      headache, dry mouth, cough, blurred vision, constipation, dysuria; postural hypotension;&#xD;
      tachycardia, decreased libido; erectile failure; increased sensitivity to the sun; weight&#xD;
      gain; sedation, increased sweating. Loperamide side effects include: Stomach ache, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, bloating, constipation, dry mouth, drowsiness or dizziness, and cholestyramine has&#xD;
      been known to cause constipation, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain,&#xD;
      and has caused tumors in animal studies. These profiles suggest the need for a safer, more&#xD;
      tolerable and more comprehensive therapy for IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological treatments are initiated when symptoms are severe enough to impair&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Mental health referral may also be made for treatment of&#xD;
      associated psychiatric disorders such as major depression. These methods include&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment, dynamic (interpersonal) psychotherapy, hypnosis, and stress&#xD;
      management/relaxation. Though benefit has been seen with these therapeutic methods in the&#xD;
      relief of abdominal pain, diarrhea and anxiety, constipation has not been improved, and the&#xD;
      effect on various subgroups of patients has not been investigated. (4 AGA Med Pos Stat)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some Botanical therapies, specifically combination therapies, have been tested for treatment&#xD;
      of IBS with positive results. STW 5 (9 plant extracts) and STW 5-II (6 plant extracts) were&#xD;
      significantly better than placebo in reducing abdominal pain and IBS symptoms after 4 weeks&#xD;
      of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, various botanical therapies have been shown to be effective to different&#xD;
      degrees for relief of symptoms and for improved quality of life in non-ulcer and functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia (a condition similar to IBS). These include the following therapies tested in&#xD;
      trials which received a rating above three in the Jadad score (a validated instrument scoring&#xD;
      from 0-5 for assessment of clinical trial quality): celandine extract, turmeric, peppermint&#xD;
      and caraway oils, Iberogast (peppermint leaves, caraway fruit, with or without bitter candy&#xD;
      tuft fruit, licorice root, lemon balm leaves, angelica root, celandine herbs, milk thistle&#xD;
      fruit and chamomile flowers), peppermint &amp; caraway &amp; wormwood &amp; fennel, peppermint oil and&#xD;
      ginger extract, artichoke leaf extract and many others with lower Jadad score ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of herbs have been used successfully in IBS, as well. These include peppermint oil&#xD;
      (enteric coated), globe artichoke leaf extract, and Chinese herbal medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active ingredients of CHT has been used in folklore medicine for many centuries for&#xD;
      treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and is approved by the Israel Ministry of Health for&#xD;
      marketing and distribution through the pharmacy . A dose toxicity test conducted in rats&#xD;
      showed a no-observed-adverse-effect-level in male rats at doses much higher than the dose&#xD;
      utilized in this study (measured per Kg body mass).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the ethno-pharmacological and preclinical evidence for efficacy in a broad array&#xD;
      of conditions and safety of the principal active ingredient, we, the investigators at&#xD;
      Hadassah Medical Organization, have decided to embark upon a clinical development plan geared&#xD;
      towards the investigation of the gastrointestinal protective and other therapeutic properties&#xD;
      and safety of the principal active ingredient. The first study is the efficacy trial herein&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCT is a new combination botanical drug substance that promises to be of value in treating&#xD;
      various pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract, due to it's presumed &quot;gastroprotective&quot;&#xD;
      and/or &quot;gastrosynchronic&quot; qualities. To test this hypothesis, a once daily oral dose of HCT&#xD;
      will be self-administered to patients with IBS. The dose used is presumed to be exceptionally&#xD;
      safe and is 37 times lower than the standard daily dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety, tolerability and effectiveness, of 25 mg per day of HCT (20 mg&#xD;
      principal active ingredient) compared to placebo in subjects with ROME II IBS criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic Design Characteristics and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group study to assess&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of CHT. 100 subjects with ROME II criteria IBS will provide informed&#xD;
      consent and undergo screening procedures. Subjects fulfilling eligibility requirements will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of the two treatment arms (will receive a subject number). After a&#xD;
      two-week baseline observation period, and reconfirmed eligibility, subjects will be allotted&#xD;
      enough study drug for the self administration of a daily dose of 25 mg CHT or placebo, for 4&#xD;
      weeks. The Week 4 clinic visit will be followed by a four week follow-up period without&#xD;
      treatment. The day of randomization will be the week -2 visit and start of study treatment&#xD;
      will be at the Week 0 study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study the following tools will be utilized (and variables assessed): a subject&#xD;
      diary (for documentation of concomitant medications and concomitant medication changes and&#xD;
      adverse events) the IBS-36 Questionnaire (for assessment of treatment-induced changes in the&#xD;
      IBS-specific Quality of Life score), and a 6-point Likert Scale for IBS symptoms severity&#xD;
      scoring. This tool and has been developed specifically for this study, based, in part, on&#xD;
      similar scales in the published literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This early phase study is well-designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of HCT and&#xD;
      to gain statistically significant efficacy data. The population chosen is large enough to&#xD;
      detect a clinically significant difference in response between the active study drug and the&#xD;
      placebo arms. The rationale for this design at such an early stage of development is based&#xD;
      upon the recommendations of the FDA for phase I clinical studies of botanical drug&#xD;
      substances.&#xD;
