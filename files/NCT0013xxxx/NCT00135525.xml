      This study was a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded (placebo run-in&#xD;
      will be single-blinded), group comparison study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paroxetine 20mg/day (achieved via the starting dose of 10 mg/day for the first week) once&#xD;
      daily, or placebo was orally administered once daily for 8 weeks (fixed dose was adopted in&#xD;
      the Treatment phase) in patients with GAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who were classed as non-responders at Week 8, paroxetine at 30 to 40mg/day (once&#xD;
      daily) or placebo (once daily) was orally administered with flexible titration regimen for 4&#xD;
      weeks (fixed dose was adopted in the Treatment phase). The subjects underwent a taper phase&#xD;
      in case they received Paroxetine 40mg/day, paroxetine 30mg/day or placebo at treatment&#xD;
      completion or study withdrawal. A follow-up examination was conducted after 1 to 5 weeks from&#xD;
      the last dose of the investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study duration requiring subject participation was 10 to 20 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Fixed Dose (20 mg/day): The fixed dose of 20 mg/day was selected, because it is the recommended dose for the treatment of GAD in the US and other countries.&#xD;
Flexible Dose (20 - 40 mg/day): Overseas, the maximum dose in the treatment of GAD is 50 mg/day. However, 40 mg/day was selected as the maximum dose for this flexible dose session, because overseas clinical studies have indicated that paroxetine is sufficiently effective at doses of 20 - 40 mg/day and this is the dose range approved for depression/depressive episodes in Japan.</description>
