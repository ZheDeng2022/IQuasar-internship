      PURPOSE OF PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this randomized, controlled trial is to test whether educational&#xD;
      interventions - directed toward empowering patients and delivered via the BIDMC's secure&#xD;
      patient Internet portal PatientSite - can improve outcomes and satisfaction with care of&#xD;
      adult primary care patients with 3 common conditions: chronic pain, depression, and&#xD;
      progressive difficulty walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study outcomes include improvement among intervention patients in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. detection and treatment of the target conditions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patient-reported signs and symptoms of pain, depression, and impaired lower extremity&#xD;
           mobility;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patient-reported quality of life, patient-clinician communication, and satisfaction with&#xD;
           care; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. health care utilization. The secondary outcome is physicians' views that the&#xD;
           intervention improved the efficiency and quality of care they deliver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to improve physicians' detection and treatment of patient-reported pain, depression, and&#xD;
           impaired walking among intervention patients compared to controls;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to reduce patient-reported symptoms of chronic pain, depression, and impaired walking&#xD;
           among intervention patients compared to controls;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to improve patient-reported quality of life, patient-clinician communication, and&#xD;
           satisfaction with care among intervention patients compared to controls; and 4. to&#xD;
           improve physicians' assessments of the efficiency of office visits and quality of care&#xD;
           they provided for the 3 study conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE AND BACKGROUND FOR THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic conditions affect 99 million Americans and limit the daily lives of 41 million&#xD;
      (Institute for Health &amp; Aging 1996). Moreover, these conditions are often unrecognized.&#xD;
      Myriad reasons contribute to the under-diagnosis of chronic conditions, including problems&#xD;
      with patient-clinician communication, providers' lack of awareness of the prevalence of these&#xD;
      conditions or how to screen for them, and abbreviated office visits (e.g., Beckman 1999).&#xD;
      Many conditions are difficult to ascertain, such as depression and pain, without objective&#xD;
      and readily apparent indicators of impairment. Some persons believe that mobility&#xD;
      difficulties are an inevitable consequence of aging, and something that physicians can do&#xD;
      little to help, and primary care physicians generally have little formal training in mobility&#xD;
      assessments (Iezzoni 2003a). An accurate, timely, and inexpensive way to identify and address&#xD;
      chronic conditions could potentially transform the care of patients, enhance their quality of&#xD;
      life, improve clinicians' work life, and mitigate the social cost of these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will test whether a secure patient Internet portal is a useful conduit for&#xD;
      information that can improve patient care, by screening patients for certain conditions,&#xD;
      communicating the results directly to the patient and their physician, empowering patients to&#xD;
      address these condition with their physicians, facilitating clinicians' actions, and&#xD;
      activating patients to participate in their own care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTSITE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PatientSite is a secure, personalized messaging system serving BIDMC and affiliated sites. It&#xD;
      allows patients to communicate confidentially with their physicians and the physicians' staff&#xD;
      via the Web. Patients are eligible to enroll in PatientSite if one of their physicians has&#xD;
      agreed to use PatientSite. Data in PatientSite are encrypted and password protected. Patients&#xD;
      register online, and receive passwords from administrators at their own practice site in&#xD;
      order to confirm the patient's identity. Patients and clinicians must use a confidential&#xD;
      password to obtain access to the system. To alert PatientSite users to the presence of a&#xD;
      message, PatientSite sends users a traditional email message that they have a PatientSite&#xD;
      message, along with a link to the PatientSite Web portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are conducting a randomized, controlled trial of a PatientSite intervention&#xD;
      designed to improve pain, depression, and impaired mobility among primary care patients,&#xD;
      among other outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are recruiting physicians who currently use PatientSite from among those&#xD;
      practicing at BIDMC's academic primary care practice and at 2 community practices affiliated&#xD;
      with BIDMC. Patients of physicians who agree to participate are potentially eligible for the&#xD;
      study. Two weeks before their next scheduled primary care office visit, The researchers are&#xD;
      sending these patients an e-mail invitation via PatientSite to participate in the study. The&#xD;
      e-mail briefly describes the study (including the procedures for randomization) and links&#xD;
      patients to a complete, electronic informed consent form as well as standard HIPAA&#xD;
      disclosures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who electronically sign the informed consent, thereby agreeing to participate in the&#xD;
      study, are sent a screening questionnaire asking about signs and symptoms of chronic pain,&#xD;
      depression, and difficulty walking. Persons who screen positive for at least one of these&#xD;
      three conditions are enrolled in the study and randomized to intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the intervention electronically receive an e-mail message containing&#xD;
      additional information about ways to address the condition during their primary care visit&#xD;
      within the upcoming two weeks. The message includes condition-specific suggestions about how&#xD;
      to discuss the problem with their clinician, along with standard tips about communicating&#xD;
      with doctors. It provides a confidential link to an &quot;electronic advocate&quot; - a clinical nurse&#xD;
      &quot;e-Coach&quot; who coaches (advises) the patient online about how to address the problem with&#xD;
      their physician in the upcoming appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the control group receive an e-mail containing links to federal&#xD;
      government Web sites containing general health information unrelated to the target&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are surveying both intervention and control group subjects via PatientSite 1&#xD;
      week and 3 months after their index visit to find out about their visit and their&#xD;
      satisfaction with care, their clinical outcomes relating to the target conditions, and use of&#xD;
      additional health care services. At one week post-visit, the researchers are specifically&#xD;
      asking whether they discussed the condition with their clinician and whether the clinician&#xD;
      did anything about it. The researchers are further asking patients who did not address the&#xD;
      symptom with their physician for the reason. Three months after the index visit, the&#xD;
      researchers re-administer the screening instruments used at baseline in order to ascertain&#xD;
      change in the target conditions, quality of life, health communication, and satisfaction. The&#xD;
      researchers also review patients' medical records to abstract demographic information (age,&#xD;
      gender, race, ethnicity, primary language), administrative data (insurance type, utilization&#xD;
      of health services), and clinical characteristics (from the index visit note written by the&#xD;
      physician) to corroborate discussion and management of target conditions, and to assess&#xD;
      medical care utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are surveying participating physicians at the conclusion of the study to&#xD;
      obtain their perceptions about the impact of the intervention on their work including time&#xD;
      burdens and quality of care. In addition, the researchers are reviewing the electronic&#xD;
      medical records to ascertain provider and utilization outcome information at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
