  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the drug combination of Doxil (doxorubicin) and estramustine when used to treat prostate&#xD;
      cancer that is resistant to hormones and to a chemotherapy type called taxanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is to reduce the measurable disease or prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      level by at least 50% from baseline.&#xD;
