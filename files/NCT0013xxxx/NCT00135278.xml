      This pilot study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of a clinical trial protocol for&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage as a potential treatment for patients with acute spinal&#xD;
      cord injury. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient eligibility and recruitment for such a study and how soon CSF drainage can be&#xD;
           instituted in such patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adverse events and safety of CSF drain insertion and drainage in the setting of acute&#xD;
           spinal cord injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neurologic recovery after injury; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cytokine expression within the CSF and blood after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, patients with spinal cord injuries who agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study will have a lumbar CSF drain placed and be randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CSF drainage to maintain a constant intrathecal pressure; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no CSF drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have CSF and blood sampled at pre-defined intervals in order to evaluate CSF&#xD;
      cytokine expression after acute spinal cord injury. For comparison against the injured&#xD;
      condition, CSF and blood from a normal group of uninjured individuals will be obtained. These&#xD;
      individuals will be patients undergoing hip or knee surgery under a spinal anesthetic, where&#xD;
      a small sample of CSF can be taken when their intrathecal space is accessed for the&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes that will be measured in spinal cord injured patients include the eligibility and&#xD;
      recruitment rate of patients, the time required to institute lumbar drainage, and adverse&#xD;
      effects related to CSF drain insertion and CSF drainage. Neurologic function will be measured&#xD;
      according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standards. Patient-reported quality of&#xD;
      life and functional independence measurements will be evaluated. CSF and serum will be&#xD;
      evaluated for the expression of inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study will provide feasibility and safety information that will be&#xD;
      critical in the both the decision to pursue and in the planning of a larger prospective&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to formally assess the clinical efficacy of CSF drainage as a&#xD;
      therapy for patients with acute spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND INFORMATION/STUDY RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries - Epidemiology and Research Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few traumas to the human body are as suddenly and permanently devastating as spinal cord&#xD;
      injuries. Unfortunately, it is most often young, highly productive, otherwise healthy adults&#xD;
      who sustain such injuries, and thereafter suffer lifelong loss of movement, sensation, and&#xD;
      bowel, bladder, and sexual function. In North America, over 10,000 people sustain a spinal&#xD;
      cord injury each year, and currently there are estimated to be over 250,000 individuals&#xD;
      living with chronic spinal cord paralysis (Sekhon and Fehlings, 2001). Important advances in&#xD;
      medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments have improved the clinical care of spinal&#xD;
      cord injured patients over the past few decades. Nevertheless, there are still no&#xD;
      convincingly effective treatments currently available to improve the neurological status of&#xD;
      these patients, and as such, their paralysis is currently an incurable condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This rather dismal neurologic prognosis has stimulated significant research efforts to&#xD;
      understand the neurobiology of spinal cord injury and develop effective therapies for it.&#xD;
      This international effort has tremendously increased our understanding of the neuropathology&#xD;
      of spinal cord injury and has shed much insight into the acute and chronic pathophysiologic&#xD;
      processes that inhibit neural regeneration and functional recovery (reviewed by Kwon et al.,&#xD;
      2002). The large majority of research into spinal cord repair strategies can be conceptually&#xD;
      divided into two streams:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  research on the acute pathophysiologic processes that occur immediately or soon after&#xD;
           injury, with the aim of developing neuroprotective therapies that attenuate these&#xD;
           processes to minimize secondary spinal cord damage; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  research on the intrinsic and extrinsic impediments to axonal re-growth within the&#xD;
           central nervous system, with the aim of developing axonal regeneration therapies that&#xD;
           would promote axonal growth across the injured spinal cord and thus mediate recovery&#xD;
           after spinal cord injury (Kwon et al., 2004a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries - The Role of Ischemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of individuals who sustain spinal cord injuries do not suffer a complete&#xD;
      transection of their spinal cords, even if they have functionally complete paralysis. Rather,&#xD;
      while the initial &quot;primary&quot; mechanical impact interrupts axons at the site of injury and&#xD;
      disrupts the local neuronal and glial cytoarchitecture, a proportion of the spinal cord&#xD;
      (usually the outer rim) escapes intact. This spared tissue, however, is then subject to a&#xD;
      complex cascade of acute pathophysiologic processes that cause further &quot;secondary&quot; damage.&#xD;
      These interrelated processes include ionic homeostasis abnormalities, excitotoxicity,&#xD;
      programmed cell death, tissue ischemia, and inflammation (Kwon et al., 2004b).&#xD;
      Neuroprotective therapies aim to counteract these processes, thereby averting further&#xD;
      secondary damage and maximizing the extent of spared cord tissue. Animal studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that significant neurologic function can be mediated by small amounts of spared&#xD;
      cord tissue, and in this regard, even small neuroprotective effects might reap substantial&#xD;
      functional benefits to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular disruption and local tissue ischemia have long been recognized as important aspects&#xD;
      of secondary damage following acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Ischemia and resultant&#xD;
      cellular energy failure is thought to contribute to the propagation of many other important&#xD;
      pathophysiologic processes, and in this regard has been argued by some to be the most&#xD;
      critical component of secondary damage (Amar and Levy, 1999). Mechanical disruption of the&#xD;
      microvasculature causes petechial hemorrhage and intravascular thrombosis, which in&#xD;
      combination with vasospasm of intact vessels and edema at the injury site can lead to&#xD;
      profound local hypoperfusion and ischemia (Tator and Fehlings, 1991). This is primarily a&#xD;
      microvascular phenomenon, with the larger caliber vessels such as the anterior spinal artery&#xD;
      normally being spared (Koyanagi et al., 1993). Human post-mortem studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that vascular perfusion is substantially worse in the grey matter than in the white matter,&#xD;
      which may be related to the disruption and/or thrombosis of the sulcal arterial network that&#xD;
      centrifugally supplies much of the grey matter (Tator and Koyanagi, 1997). The high metabolic&#xD;
      requirements of neurons make the grey matter exquisitely sensitive to ischemia injury, which&#xD;
      can be compounded by the loss of autoregulatory mechanisms which normally maintain fairly&#xD;
      constant microvascular hemodynamics within the spinal cord during systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      fluctuations (Senter and Venes, 1979). The loss of autoregulation makes the cord vulnerable&#xD;
      to further ischemic insult from systemic hypotension (Kobrine et al., 1975).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Role of Ischemia in Non-Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to this point, the discussion has focused on spinal cord injuries caused by blunt trauma&#xD;
      and the role that ischemia plays in the secondary injury cascade. Ischemia alone, however,&#xD;
      can also be the primary etiologic process behind paralysis in non-traumatic circumstances.&#xD;
      Such is the case in patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. In&#xD;
      these surgeries, the aorta is clamped and segmental vessels ligated, thus depriving the&#xD;
      spinal cord of its blood supply to an extent that is influenced by the severity and location&#xD;
      of the aneurysm and the duration of the vascular occlusion. The incidence of paralysis caused&#xD;
      by this ischemic insult has been estimated between 3.8 to 17.6% (Crawford and Rubio, 1973),&#xD;
      but has been reported to be as high as 28 to 41% after the repair of particular types of&#xD;
      aneurysms (Crawford et al., 1986; Safi et al., 1996). As perioperative paraplegia is one of&#xD;
      the most devastating complications of this surgery, a number of adjunctive treatments have&#xD;
      been investigated as prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. These include generalized or&#xD;
      local hypothermia, medications such as steroids, naloxone, barbiturates, papaverine,&#xD;
      reattachment of intercostal arteries, and CSF drainage (Wan et al., 2001). In principle,&#xD;
      these interventions aim to reduce spinal cord ischemia by either improving vascular perfusion&#xD;
      (increasing cellular oxygen supply) or by reducing metabolic activity (decreasing cellular&#xD;
      oxygen demand).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF Drainage as a Method for Preventing or Treating Spinal Cord Ischemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drainage of CSF has emerged as an accepted intervention for reducing the risk of ischemic&#xD;
      paralysis in patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. An important&#xD;
      determinant of oxygen supply to the spinal cord is the spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP),&#xD;
      defined as the gradient between mean distal aortic arterial pressure (MDAP) and CSF pressure&#xD;
      (CSFP) (WADA et al., 2001). Conceptually, the drainage of CSF reduces CSF pressure and thus&#xD;
      increases the perfusion pressure and oxygen delivery to the spinal cord. When cross clamping&#xD;
      of the aorta occurs, the distal aortic pressure decreases and the gradient between arterial&#xD;
      and CSF pressure narrows. Additionally, a significant increase in CSF pressure has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to occur with aortic cross-clamping itself (WADA et al., 2001), which would&#xD;
      serve to further reduce the spinal cord perfusion pressure. The reasons for this increase in&#xD;
      CSF pressure with aortic cross-clamping are unclear, but may be related to changes in venous&#xD;
      capacitance causing sequestration of venous blood within the dura and bony neural axis (Piano&#xD;
      and Gewertz, 1990). Seminal animal experiments performed decades ago demonstrated that&#xD;
      following descending aortic occlusion, a decrease of arterial pressure to or below that of&#xD;
      CSF pressure (decreasing SCPP) almost universally resulted in paraplegia, while the drainage&#xD;
      of CSF to reduce CSF pressure (and thus increase SCPP) was effective in preventing&#xD;
      paraplegia. (MIYAMOTO et al., 1960; Oka and Miyamoto, 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, numerous clinical reports have described the use of CSF drainage in humans&#xD;
      undergoing TAAA repair (reviewed by Ling, 2000 [Ling and Arellano, 2000]). Normal CSF&#xD;
      pressure in humans has been documented to be approximately 13 to 15 mmHg (Drenger et al.,&#xD;
      1997). Increased CSF pressures of 21 to 25 mm Hg have been demonstrated with aortic cross&#xD;
      clamping (Drenger et al., 1997; WADA et al., 2001) . It has been advocated therefore to drain&#xD;
      CSF in a controlled manner to maintain CSF pressure at approximately 10 mm Hg during TAAA&#xD;
      repair (Carroccio et al., 2003). A prospective randomized controlled trial by Svensson et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated a 12% (2 of 17) incidence of neurologic deficit in patients treated with CSF&#xD;
      drainage compared to a 44% (7 of 16) incidence in the control group (p=0.0392) (Svensson et&#xD;
      al., 1998). A more recent prospective randomized controlled trial of 145 patients by Coselli&#xD;
      et al. demonstrated with an intent-to-treat analysis a significant reduction in paraplegia&#xD;
      with CSF drainage to keep the CSF pressure around 10 mmHg (Coselli et al., 2002). Neurologic&#xD;
      deficits occurred in 2 of 82 patients (2.7%) undergoing CSF drainage and 9 of 74 patients&#xD;
      (12.2%) in the control group (p=0.026), representing an 80% reduction in relative risk. Both&#xD;
      of these prospective randomized studies were terminated early at a planned interim analysis&#xD;
      due to the significant benefit demonstrated by CSF drainage. Of note, complications related&#xD;
      to the CSF drainage, such as headache, meningitis, or subdural hemorrhage were not observed&#xD;
      in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These prospective randomized studies illustrate the potential efficacy of CSF drainage in&#xD;
      preventing paraplegia when the spinal cord is subjected to ischemic insult. In addition to&#xD;
      this, CSF drainage has been reported to be effective as a treatment in cases where the&#xD;
      ischemic insult has already resulted in paraplegia. Such reports are obviously relevant to&#xD;
      traumatic spinal cord injuries in which some ischemic damage would likely already be present&#xD;
      by the time CSF drainage was instituted. Ackerman and Traynelis reported on the institution&#xD;
      of CSF drainage in 6 patients who suffered ischemic paralysis, 5 of whom were between 12 and&#xD;
      40 hours post-TAAA repair (Ackerman and Traynelis, 2002). In four patients who had their CSF&#xD;
      drainage started within 14 hours of the onset of their ischemic symptoms, significant&#xD;
      neurologic recovery was achieved. In three of these patients, the neurologic recovery&#xD;
      occurred immediately after the CSF catheter was inserted. In two patients who had their CSF&#xD;
      drainage started 32 and 27 hours after the onset of symptoms, no neurologic recovery was&#xD;
      observed. Safi et al. reported on the initiation of CSF drainage in 8 patients presenting&#xD;
      with neurologic deficits 1 to 14 days after TAAA repair (Safi et al., 1997). They observed&#xD;
      substantial neurologic recovery of at least 2 Frankel grades in all 8 patients. The&#xD;
      interpretation of these results requires acknowledgement of the fact that other treatments&#xD;
      such as steroids and vascular support were also instituted, but they do suggest that the&#xD;
      principles of modulating spinal cord perfusion pressure with CSF drainage are still&#xD;
      applicable in patients who have already suffered ischemic injury to the spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Inflammatory Reaction to Spinal Cord Injury and CSF Cytokines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated earlier, secondary damage to the spinal cord after the initial mechanical impact is&#xD;
      mediated by a number of pathophysiologic processes, including ionic homeostasis&#xD;
      abnormalities, excitotoxicity, programmed cell death, tissue ischemia, and inflammation. The&#xD;
      preceding discussion has focused on tissue ischemia and how this might be affected by CSF&#xD;
      drainage. Inflammation appears to also play an important role in the pathophysiology of acute&#xD;
      spinal cord injury, and has thus been the focus of increasing attention in recent years. The&#xD;
      inflammatory response to spinal cord injury is mediated by cytokines that influence vascular&#xD;
      permeability and regulate migration of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages&#xD;
      into the spinal cord (Kwon et al., 2004b). The list of cytokines thought to be relevant to&#xD;
      the inflammatory response after spinal cord injury is long, and includes IL-1 , IL-1 , TNF ,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-10, VEGF, and a variety of leukotrienes. (Mueller et al., 2003;Widenfalk et al.,&#xD;
      2003; Mitsuhashi et al., 1994; Xu et al., 1990; Bartholdi and Schwab, 1997; Carmel et al.,&#xD;
      2001; Hayashi et al., 2000; Pan et al., 2002; Wang et al., 1997) Recently, a study of the&#xD;
      injured spinal cords of 11 patients who died shortly after their trauma demonstrated the&#xD;
      presence of IL-1 , IL-6, and TNF positive cells within the spinal cord within 24 hours of&#xD;
      injury. (Yang et al., 2004)&#xD;
&#xD;
      While some aspects of the inflammatory and immunologic response mediated by these cytokines&#xD;
      may be beneficial after spinal cord injury, others may be detrimental. (Bethea, 2000) For&#xD;
      example, after a contusion spinal cord injury, transgenic mice lacking the TNF receptor were&#xD;
      found to have increased apoptosis, a larger area of secondary injury, and worse locomotor&#xD;
      scores than wild-type mice. (Kim et al., 2001) Conversely, the systemic administration of&#xD;
      IL-10 significantly reduced neuronal damage after an excitotoxic spinal cord injury. (Brewer&#xD;
      et al., 1999) A more sophisticated understanding of these complex responses is obviously&#xD;
      needed. Nevertheless, these animal studies demonstrate the proof of concept that the&#xD;
      manipulation of these cytokine responses has the potential to influence outcome after spinal&#xD;
      cord injury, and therefore, may represent the targets for neuroprotective intervention. The&#xD;
      levels of expression for each cytokine appear to change over time and the temporal&#xD;
      specificity of the expression likely also influences the inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are CSF Cytokine Measurements Representative of the Events in the Cord?:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without question, the most direct method of examining the cytokine response after spinal cord&#xD;
      injury would be to obtain samples of the cord itself. While this has largely been the method&#xD;
      by which such phenomena have been examined in animal models, it is obviously not possible in&#xD;
      living human patients. The recent study by Yang et al. evaluated the spinal cord tissue from&#xD;
      patients who had died, but did not sample the CSF to determine how closely the cord changes&#xD;
      were reflected in the CSF space. In a rat spinal cord contusion injury model, Wang et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated an increase in IL-1 in both the spinal cord tissue itself and in the CSF.(Wang&#xD;
      et al., 1997) While the IL-10 concentration was much lower in the CSF than in the cord, the&#xD;
      increase in IL-10 in the CSF after spinal cord injury paralleled the increase observed in the&#xD;
      cord. These animal data suggest that cytokine analysis of the CSF can provide some meaningful&#xD;
      data about what is happening within the cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is, to our knowledge, only one human study that has examined cytokine levels within the&#xD;
      CSF of patients after acute blunt spinal cord injury. This study examined levels of the&#xD;
      eicosanoids, LTC4, TXB2, and 6-keto-PGF1 between 0 and 17 days post-injury, and then again at&#xD;
      6 months post-injury.(Nishisho et al., 1996) These authors found an increase in all three&#xD;
      eicosanoids, and found that LTC4 levels correlated to some extent with injury severity. In a&#xD;
      study of patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (possibly inducing&#xD;
      ischemic insults to the spinal cord), Kunihara et al. demonstrated increased levels of IL-8&#xD;
      that were independent of serum levels, and in particular noted sustained IL-8 elevation in a&#xD;
      patient who unfortunately became paraplegic after the operation.(Kunihara et al., 2001) In a&#xD;
      study of CSF from adult patients with severe brain injury, Csuka et al demonstrated increases&#xD;
      in IL-10 that were independent of serum IL-10 levels.(Csuka et al., 1999) While direct&#xD;
      comparison with the spinal cord tissue is not possible in these human studies, they do&#xD;
      suggest that CNS injury is associated with cytokine changes that can be detected in the CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The involvement of cytokines in the inflammatory process and their presence in the CSF raises&#xD;
      the potential for an additional benefit to CSF drainage which has not yet been explored in&#xD;
      humans. Kunihara and colleagues demonstrated a significant increase in the pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) within the spinal cords of New Zealand white rabbits subjected&#xD;
      to aortic cross-clamping (Kunihara et al., 2000). They went on to show that levels of IL-8&#xD;
      (in addition to other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-6) were significantly&#xD;
      elevated in the CSF of human patients undergoing TAAA repair. Interestingly, a patient in&#xD;
      this series who suffering ischemic paraplegia after the TAAA had the most dramatically&#xD;
      increased and sustained levels of IL-8 within the CSF (Kunihara et al., 2001). It has been&#xD;
      proposed by these authors and others that the drainage of such pro-inflammatory CSF cytokines&#xD;
      away from the spinal cord may itself be neuroprotective (Kunihara et al., 2001; Tang et al.,&#xD;
      1996; Svensson et al., 1998). This hypothesis, however, has not been further evaluated in&#xD;
      traumatic or non-traumatic spinal cord injuries. As yet, it is unclear how much CSF would&#xD;
      need to be drained in order to achieve an &quot;effective&quot; reduction in local cytokine&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the drainage of CSF has been shown in human clinical studies to be&#xD;
      neuroprotective in the setting of ischemic injury to the spinal cord, both with respect to&#xD;
      prevention and treatment. Given that ischemia is also a well recognized contributor to the&#xD;
      secondary injury cascade following traumatic spinal cord injury, there is a cogent rationale&#xD;
      for the evaluation of CSF drainage in this setting, acknowledging the desperate need for the&#xD;
      development of effective treatments for such patients. To our knowledge, there have been no&#xD;
      previously reported evaluations of CSF drainage in human patients who have suffered an acute&#xD;
      traumatic spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, given the enormous current worldwide interest in the inflammatory response to spinal&#xD;
      cord injury, it is reasonable to conclude that promising experimental neuroprotective&#xD;
      interventions will be forthcoming within the near future. If such strategies are to be moved&#xD;
      from the animal models within the laboratory setting and into human patients, it would be&#xD;
      extremely useful to characterize the inflammatory response in humans and compare it to&#xD;
      available animal data. Such knowledge would not only be helpful in predicting which&#xD;
      experimental therapies would be beneficial, but also would be helpful in the definition of&#xD;
      parameters for monitoring the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. In this regard,&#xD;
      changes in cytokines/chemokines may become an additional outcome measure for the evaluation&#xD;
      of therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, insights gained here may direct laboratory (animal)&#xD;
      studies towards clinically relevant parameters.&#xD;
