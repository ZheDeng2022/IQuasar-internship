  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria in pregnancy is potentially fatal to both the mother and the foetus particularly in&#xD;
      the primigravidae. Implementation of appropriate control and preventive measures is&#xD;
      challenged by the fact that malaria infection in pregnancy is often asymptomatic and&#xD;
      parasitized red blood cells sequestrated in the placental microcirculation may not be&#xD;
      detectable in the peripheral blood. In addition, the widespread prevalence of parasites&#xD;
      resistant to chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and, the safety concerns about&#xD;
      newer antimalarials, poverty and inadequate supply have made antimalarial treatment options&#xD;
      available to pregnant women very limited. These have necessitated an urgent search for&#xD;
      alternative safe and efficacious treatment options for pregnant women. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of four antimalarial treatment&#xD;
      options in rural Ghana within a programme setting.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of AQ, SP and the AQ+SP combination compared with CQ treatment on the&#xD;
      prevalence of peripheral parasitaemia on days 14 and 28 post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the incidence of adverse events in the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effect of study drugs on maternal haemoglobin on 14 and 28 days post&#xD;
           treatment, and at delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the effect of study drugs on peripheral and placental parasite densities at&#xD;
           delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the effect of study drugs on birth weight at delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the effect modifications of gestational age, parity, gravidity, prior&#xD;
           antimalarial use, presence or absence of symptoms at enrolment, baseline parasite&#xD;
           density and baseline Hb on the parasitological and haematological responses to the test&#xD;
           drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess the accuracy of the OptiMAL antigen test for detecting peripheral parasitaemia&#xD;
           compared to microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To compare the overall incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (abortion, stillbirth,&#xD;
           congenital abnormality, prematurity and intrauterine deaths) in the study group to local&#xD;
           rates obtained from St Theresa's Hospital's records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study location and population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out at the St. Theresa's Hospital in the Nkoranza district of the Brong&#xD;
      Ahafo Region of Ghana. The St. Theresa's hospital is a general district hospital. It has a&#xD;
      bed capacity of 80 and provides all basic medical services including adult medicine,&#xD;
      paediatrics, surgery and obstetrics and gynaecology. The study enrolled pregnant women of all&#xD;
      parities attending the St. Theresa's Hospital's antenatal clinic with a gestational age of 16&#xD;
      weeks and above between March 2003 and September 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antennal screening and enrolment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pregnant women who attended antenatal clinics were screened for malaria antigens with&#xD;
      OptiMAL dipsticks. Those with a positive antigen test were considered eligible, and after&#xD;
      informed consent had been obtained from them 5mls of venous blood was drawn from an&#xD;
      antecubital vein for baseline measurements of haemoglobin, white blood cell counts (total and&#xD;
      differential), bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and&#xD;
      gamma-glutamyl transferase and for making filter paper blood spots. Women were then assessed&#xD;
      clinically and obstetrically with the view to enrolling them into the study. Pregnancy&#xD;
      viability and gestational age were confirmed with ultrasound scanning by the study clinician&#xD;
      or the principal investigator. Pregnant women with positive malaria antigen tests confirmed&#xD;
      microscopically were randomised into four treatment arms if they satisfied all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field workers visited the study women in their homes following the initial supervised drug&#xD;
      administration at the antenatal clinic on post treatment days 3, 7, 14 and 28 and performed&#xD;
      the following routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3 and Day 7: Obtained venous blood for filter paper blood spots, white cell and&#xD;
           malaria parasite counts, and recorded any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 14 and Day 28: Obtained venous blood for white cell and malaria parasite count,&#xD;
           measurement of alanine and aspartate transaminases, bilirubin and for filter paper blood&#xD;
           spots and recorded any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, pregnant women were seen at the antenatal clinic monthly and, for those with 32&#xD;
      weeks and above of gestation fortnightly. At these visits, they were actively screened for&#xD;
      peripheral parasitaemia using OptiMAL dipstick test. At any time before delivery if the test&#xD;
      was negative, the woman remained on daily haematinics. If women who were already enrolled had&#xD;
      positive antigen test confirmed by microscopy, they received another course of the treatment&#xD;
      they were initially assigned to. Women were enrolled in the study only for the first episode&#xD;
      of malaria detected during the antenatal visit. At delivery, midwives recorded birth weights&#xD;
      and any stillbirths, perinatal deaths or congenital abnormalities. They also made slides from&#xD;
      peripheral, placental and cord blood and sampled maternal blood for haemoglobin measurements.&#xD;
      Any record of a congenital deformity was verified and confirmed by a clinician. The women and&#xD;
      their babies were visited at home at six weeks post delivery to record any neonatal adverse&#xD;
      events such as deaths or severe morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Prevalence of parasitaemia on days 14 and 28 post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of adverse drug events within seven days following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proportions of pregnant women withdrawn from the study due to the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
           drug events (clinical and laboratory) by day 7 following initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in maternal haemoglobin concentrations at days 14 and 28 following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prevalence of peripheral parasitaemia at delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prevalence of placental parasitaemia at delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Proportions of abnormal biochemistry and white blood cell values on days 14 and 28 post&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios,&#xD;
           and the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the OptiMAL antigen&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Incidences of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Prevalence of postpartum parasitaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Prevalence of postpartum anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was based on the assumption of a 28-day parasitological clearance of 90% for AQ, SP and&#xD;
      the AQ+SP combination, and 78% for chloroquine (Î± = 5% power = 90%). Allowing for a 15% loss&#xD;
      to follow-up, 225 pregnant women were recruited into each of the 4 treatment arms of the&#xD;
      study giving a total study size of 900 pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and safety monitoring board:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) was constituted for the project. The board was&#xD;
      responsible for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular monitoring of the data and safety issues concerned with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reviewing the PI's reports on serious adverse events and making recommendations on&#xD;
           further progress of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reviewing the statistical analysis plan prior to breaking the study drug codes.&#xD;
