  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent study has shown that the administration of a single dose of&#xD;
      sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine plus artesunate to Senegalese children on three occasions during a&#xD;
      short malaria transmission season reduced the incidence of clinical attacks of malaria by&#xD;
      86%. However, use of this drug regimen led to the selection of parasites with molecular&#xD;
      markers of resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine. Therefore, a trial of three&#xD;
      alternative regimens has been undertaken to see if these are as effective and safe as the&#xD;
      drug combination used in the initial study but less likely to select for drug resistance.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In countries of the Sahel and sub-Sahel, malaria transmission is highly seasonal with nearly&#xD;
      all episodes of malaria occuring during a few months of the year. However, mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity from malaria may be very high during this period, especially in children who are&#xD;
      the most vulnerable group. It has been shown previously in The Gambia and elsewhere in West&#xD;
      Africa that regular administration of anti-malarial drugs throughout the period of malaria&#xD;
      transmission (chemoprophylaxis) reduces mortality and morbidity substantially but&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis is difficult to sustain. Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) differs&#xD;
      from chemoprophylaxis in that drugs are given at less frequent intervals and drug&#xD;
      concentrations fall below the inhibitory level between administrations. IPT was used first to&#xD;
      protect pregnant women from malaria and this approach has proved very effective. More&#xD;
      recently, the IPT concept has been applied to the prevention of malaria in infants, drugs&#xD;
      being given at the same time as infant vaccines are administered. However, in areas of&#xD;
      seasonal malaria, such as Senegal, only a small proportion of cases of severe malaria occur&#xD;
      during the first year of life. In such areas, older children require protection. Intermittent&#xD;
      preventive treatment in children (IPTc) is a potential way of doing this. IPTc involves the&#xD;
      administration of drugs to all children in the age group at risk on two or three occasions&#xD;
      during the period of high malaria transmission. In a recent study in Senegal it was shown&#xD;
      that the administration of a single dose of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) plus artesunate to&#xD;
      children aged 6 weeks to 59 months reduced the incidence of clinical attacks of malaria by&#xD;
      86%. However, administration of these drugs was associated with selection of parasites with&#xD;
      molecular markers of resistance to pyrimethamine and to sulfonamides. The aim of the new&#xD;
      study was to investigate alternative drug regimens which might be equally effective but less&#xD;
      likely to select for drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The object of the study was to find the most effective drug regimen for use in intermittent&#xD;
      preventive treatment in children in Senegal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in Niakhar, a rural area in central Senegal where the previous trial&#xD;
      of IPTc had been conducted. In this area, malaria transmission is very seasonal with nearly&#xD;
      all cases occuring during a three to four month period of the year. The entomological&#xD;
      inoculation rate in the area is 10 infectious bites per person per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children aged 1 - 5 years residing in the study area were eligible to join the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following village meetings, the families of all eligible children were contacted and asked if&#xD;
      they wished their child to join the study. If they wished to do so, informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained and the child randomised to one of four treatment arms. At the beginning and at the&#xD;
      end of the malaria transmission season, children were examined and a finger prick blood&#xD;
      sample was obtained for determination of haemoglobin and preparation of blood films for&#xD;
      microscopy. A drop of blood was collected on filter paper for subsequent molecular studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initial evaluation children were treated with one of four drug regimens. These were&#xD;
      SP + 1 dose of artesunate (the regimen used in the initial trial), SP + three doses of&#xD;
      artesunate, SP + 3 doses of amodiaquine and 3 doses of amodiaquine and artesunate. Initial&#xD;
      drug administration was given under observation. Treatment was repeated on two further&#xD;
      occasions at monthly intervals. The health assistants responsible for giving drugs were not&#xD;
      blinded to the study group but they played no further part in the trial. Staff who made&#xD;
      observations in the field, for example on the prevalence of side effects, and laboratory&#xD;
      staff were blind to the study code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of clinical attacks of malaria in children in each randomisation group was&#xD;
      measured during the period of the malaria transmission. Weekly home visits were made to&#xD;
      detect any children who were sick and children in the study who attended one of the clinics&#xD;
      in the study area with a febrile illness were identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood films were stained with Giemsa and examined by two microscopists. DNA was extracted&#xD;
      from filter papers obtained from parasitaemic children and examined for mutations in the dhfr&#xD;
      and dhps genes which are associated with resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfonamides&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events were noted and reported to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board&#xD;
      (DSMB). Home visits were made to the first 100 children in each arm of the trial seven days&#xD;
      after drug administration to enquire about any side effects associated with drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial End-Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of the trial was the prevalence of markers of drug resistance to&#xD;
      pyrimethamine and sulfonamides at the end of the malaria transmission season. Secondary&#xD;
      end-points were the incidence of clinical attacks of malaria and the incidence of side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated on the basis of a comparison of the three new drug regimens with&#xD;
      the one used in the previous trial (SP + 1 dose of artesunate). It was assumed that about 20%&#xD;
      of children in the SP + 1 dose of artesunate group would have Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      parasitaemia at the end of the malaria transmission season providing around 100% samples for&#xD;
      molecular studies. Assuming that the prevalence of resistance mutations at the dhfr codons&#xD;
      108, 59 and 51 was about 90%, 500 children would be needed in each study arm to give a trial&#xD;
      with 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the prevalence of resistance mutations in&#xD;
      children receiving the new drug combinations at a 5% level of significance. Allowing for a&#xD;
      loss to follow-up of about 10% a sample size of 2,200 was selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was monitored by a clinical monitor provided by the IPTi consortium. A DSMB&#xD;
      reviewed the study protocol, standard operating procedures and approved the analytical plan.&#xD;
