  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral upper respiratory infections occur frequently during childhood (6-8 per year) and are,&#xD;
      for the most part, self-limited episodes that resolve spontaneously and do not require&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy. Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis are frequent&#xD;
      complications of viral upper respiratory infections that will benefit from treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics. Acute bacterial sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses in ambulatory&#xD;
      practice and, in all age groups, accounts for an estimated 25 million physician office visits&#xD;
      annually. It is essential to distinguish between patients who are experiencing uncomplicated&#xD;
      viral upper respiratory infections and acute bacterial sinusitis to avoid the excessive use&#xD;
      of antibiotics for patients who will not benefit from them. This is especially important now&#xD;
      because of the escalation of antibiotic resistance among the bacteria that commonly cause&#xD;
      acute bacterial sinusitis, acute otitis media and pneumonia. Inappropriate use of antibiotics&#xD;
      is a major contributor to the problem of antimicrobial resistance - a problem which&#xD;
      dramatically increases both the cost and complexity of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute bacterial sinusitis and reduce&#xD;
      the inappropriate use of antibiotics, clinical guidelines have been developed by three&#xD;
      national organizations: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Sinus and Allergy Health&#xD;
      Partnership and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Traditionally, the diagnosis&#xD;
      of acute bacterial sinusitis is suspected on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms and is&#xD;
      confirmed with the performance of images (either plain radiographs, computed tomography or&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging). All three guidelines recommend that the diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      of acute bacterial sinusitis should be based on clinical criteria alone without the&#xD;
      confirmation of imaging or other laboratory data. Although the similarity between the&#xD;
      different guidelines suggests that there is widespread consensus to use clinical criteria to&#xD;
      diagnose acute bacterial sinusitis, there is virtually no evidence to support this position.&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 of this project is to evaluate the use of clinical criteria, without the&#xD;
      performance of images, as the basis for the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis. A&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled study design will be used to determine if the clinical&#xD;
      criteria proposed by the different guidelines can be used to identify children with upper&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms who will respond to antibiotic therapy. It is expected that children&#xD;
      with acute bacterial sinusitis who receive an antimicrobial will recover more quickly and&#xD;
      more often than children who receive placebo.&#xD;

      Context: Bacterial infections of the paranasal sinuses are an important cause of morbidity in&#xD;
      children. However, these infections may be difficult to distinguish from viral upper&#xD;
      respiratory infections. Consequently, children with viral upper respiratory infections are&#xD;
      frequently treated with antibiotics. The inappropriate use of antibiotics for viral upper&#xD;
      respiratory infections is costly and has been responsible, at least in part, for the&#xD;
      emergence of antibiotic resistance. To improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with&#xD;
      acute bacterial sinusitis and reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics, clinical&#xD;
      guidelines have been developed. Three national organizations have recently published&#xD;
      different guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis: the&#xD;
      American Academy of Pediatrics, the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership and the Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention. All three guidelines recommend that the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis should be based on clinical criteria without the&#xD;
      confirmation of imaging or other laboratory data. Although the similarity between the&#xD;
      different guidelines suggests that there is widespread consensus to use clinical criteria to&#xD;
      diagnose acute bacterial sinusitis, there is virtually no evidence to support this position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment of children diagnosed to have&#xD;
           acute sinusitis on clinical grounds alone without the performance of sinus images and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the response to antibiotic therapy or placebo in terms of financial cost to&#xD;
           the insurers, patient and family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and Participants: The study, employing a prospective, randomized, and double blind&#xD;
      design will be conducted in three primary care facilities serving a diverse racial and&#xD;
      socioeconomic population. Children will be eligible for the study if they are between the&#xD;
      ages of 1 and 10 years and present with one of three clinical presentations. Group 1 will be&#xD;
      comprised of subjects with persistent disease defined as nasal discharge (of any quality) or&#xD;
      daytime cough (which may be worse at night) or both persisting for more than 10 days without&#xD;
      evidence of improvement; Group 2 will be patients with non-persistent disease consisting of&#xD;
      two subsets: children with nasal discharge or daytime cough that is worsening either on or&#xD;
      after the 6th day (&gt; 120 hours) of symptoms [worsening is manifest by the new onset of&#xD;
      documented fever (temperature &gt; 100.5o F ) or substantial increase in nasal discharge or&#xD;
      cough] and children with severe disease defined as a documented temperature of at least 102o&#xD;
      F and purulent (thick, colored and opaque) nasal discharge present concurrently for at least&#xD;
      3 consecutive days (68-72 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measure: Will be a comparison of the proportion of children who have a complete&#xD;
      resolution (cure) of their respiratory symptoms in each of the treatment groups (amoxicillin&#xD;
      potassium clavulanate and placebo). Secondary outcome measures will include the proportion of&#xD;
      children in each treatment group who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. are cured after 72 hours of antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. who fail therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. who relapse between 10 and 30 days after entry into the treatment groups, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. who develop adverse events during the treatment interval of the study. Other outcome&#xD;
           measures are the total expenses incurred by the health care system, patients and&#xD;
           families during the course of the study and parental impression of whether their child&#xD;
           was receiving active drug or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses: Analysis will be done, using the Chi square statistic to determine the&#xD;
      significance of the difference in proportion of the patients in each treatment group&#xD;
      (antibiotic versus placebo) who sustain a complete resolution of their respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
      A separate analysis will be done for children with persistent and non-persistent&#xD;
      presentations. Analysis will also be done for each of the secondary outcome measures. For&#xD;
      children enrolled in the trial, direct medical costs will be calculated and compared between&#xD;
      treatment groups, including costs for antibiotic, hospitalizations, emergency room services,&#xD;
      non-study related office visits, and antibiotics (other than the study medication), other&#xD;
      medications prescribed and over-the counter medications used. Indirect medical costs will be&#xD;
      assessed by comparing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. number of sick days,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. number of days in which the parent/s could not work due to the children being sick,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. number of days in which alternative day care arrangement were necessary for a sick&#xD;
           child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confounders Included in the Study: The study design, which is prospective, randomized and&#xD;
      double blind, will on average, be the most effective way to control for potential&#xD;
      confounders. Because the investigators anticipate that age and clinical severity may impact&#xD;
      substantially on response to therapy, the groups have been stratified by these two variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biases to be Addressed: The prospective, randomized and double blind study design should&#xD;
      minimize the introduction of bias. To insure the generalizability of the results, the study&#xD;
      is conducted among three different clinical populations: rural, urban indigent and urban&#xD;
      middle class. Strict eligibility criteria and outcome measures will be employed at all three&#xD;
      clinical sites in which the study will be performed.&#xD;
