      This study aims to address the following questions on the effects of testosterone therapy in&#xD;
      men with coronary ischaemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the anti-anginal effect persist long term? Many of the published studies are acute&#xD;
           single dose trials and none of the chronic studies have assessed patients formally&#xD;
           beyond a few months. The investigators' earlier studies were limited to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does testosterone therapy in men affect the levels of measurable atheroma? There is&#xD;
           currently no in-vivo human evidence that androgen therapy inhibits or reduces levels of&#xD;
           atheroma, although there is abundant evidence in animals to suggest a potential&#xD;
           improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study addresses the two issues and would be of one-year duration but would be the&#xD;
      longest trial of testosterone therapy in men with cardiovascular disease. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the change in time to ST- segment depression of &gt; 1mm during exercise testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past 4 years the investigators' research group has completed 2 studies on the effect&#xD;
      of testosterone therapy on exercise induced coronary ischaemia (clinically manifest as angina&#xD;
      pectoris). We, the investigators at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, have shown that&#xD;
      testosterone replacement therapy improved exercise duration on the treadmill and prolonged&#xD;
      time to ischaemia (ischaemic threshold). Moreover, we demonstrated a dose response&#xD;
      relationship between the increase in exercise duration and the baseline testosterone level so&#xD;
      that men with lower baseline testosterone level derived the greatest symptomatic benefit from&#xD;
      replacement therapy. Importantly we have also demonstrated that the effects of testosterone&#xD;
      are maintained in the presence of concomitant anti-anginal drug therapy and at physiological&#xD;
      levels of testosterone therapy. (English et al. 2000; Malkin 2004)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore we have found the prevalence of men with coronary disease and low serum&#xD;
      testosterone levels to be approximately 25%. This represents a large population of men with&#xD;
      low testosterone levels that may benefit symptomatically from testosterone therapy. These men&#xD;
      qualify for androgen replacement therapy per se simply to relieve hypogonadal symptoms and&#xD;
      maintain bone mineral density and there are clinical guidelines recommending physiological&#xD;
      testosterone replacement in this cohort. (Morales and Lunenfeld 2002) The safety issues&#xD;
      relating to testosterone treatment which comprise a theoretical increased risk of prostate&#xD;
      neoplasia and increased erythropoiesis are of limited relevance in this population because&#xD;
      replacement therapy only returns the testosterone level to the physiological range. Indeed,&#xD;
      there is no evidence that appropriate testosterone therapy increases the risk of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. More importantly, prostate cancer can be identified early by screening for prostate&#xD;
      specific antigen allowing careful surveillance during replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to address the following questions on the effects of testosterone therapy in&#xD;
      men with coronary ischaemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the anti-anginal effect persist long term? Many of the published studies are acute&#xD;
           single dose trials and none of the chronic studies have assessed patients formally&#xD;
           beyond a few months. Our earlier studies were limited to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does testosterone therapy in men affect the levels of measurable atheroma? There is&#xD;
           currently no in-vivo human evidence that androgen therapy inhibits or reduces levels of&#xD;
           atheroma, although there is abundant evidence in animals to suggest a potential&#xD;

      testing.&#xD;
