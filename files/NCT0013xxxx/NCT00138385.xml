  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how young children's bodies learn to fight against&#xD;
      flu infection and to see how vaccines may help to fight against the flu. This is a Phase 4,&#xD;
      single-center, randomized study of the immune responses of 40 children, ages 5-9, given one&#xD;
      of two licensed influenza vaccines (either inactivated vaccine given in an arm muscle or&#xD;
      live, attenuated vaccine inhaled through the nose). Study procedures will include up to 3&#xD;
      blood samples. Participants will complete a diary to document any side effects experienced&#xD;
      following the vaccination. Participants will return to the clinic for a visit on Day 7-9 and&#xD;
      again 4-6 weeks following vaccination. Participants that have not been previously vaccinated&#xD;
      will receive a 2nd dose of vaccine. A follow up telephone call will occur 8-10 weeks&#xD;
      following vaccination. Total study participation will be up to 75 days.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, single-center, randomized clinical trial of the immune responses of&#xD;
      children given one of two licensed influenza vaccines (either inactivated vaccine given IM or&#xD;
      live, attenuated vaccine given intranasally). This study will enroll 40 healthy children 5-9&#xD;
      years of age. Subjects will be randomized to receive either FluMist or Fluzone. FluMist is&#xD;
      approved for children older than 5 years and Fluzone is also approved for a broader age&#xD;
      indication starting at 6 months of age. Subjects who receive FluMist will have the vaccine&#xD;
      administered intranasally by large particle aerosol, 0.25 mL per nostril. Subjects receiving&#xD;
      Fluzone will receive 0.5 mL given intramuscularly into the non-dominant deltoid muscle.&#xD;
      Children who have not previously been immunized against influenza will receive a second dose&#xD;
      of vaccine 4 weeks after the first dose. Children who receive two doses of vaccine will&#xD;
      remain on the study for 8-10 weeks. The primary objective of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      effector B cell responses at Day7-9 and the CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, memory B-cell and&#xD;
      the serology responses at Day 28 post-immunization following administration of one of two&#xD;
      different influenza vaccines. Researchers will evaluate any increases in the immune response&#xD;
      (CD4, CD8, B cell and serology responses) Day 0 to Day 7-9 for T-cells and ASCs, and from Day&#xD;
      0-28 for memory B-cell and serology responses. NK-cell and homing studies will also be&#xD;
      compared between the groups.&#xD;
