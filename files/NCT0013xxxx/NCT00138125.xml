    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using&#xD;
      fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving&#xD;
      fulvestrant together with trastuzumab is more effective than giving fulvestrant or&#xD;
      trastuzumab alone in treating breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well fulvestrant and/or trastuzumab&#xD;
      works as first-line therapy in treating postmenopausal women with stage IV breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the overall objective response rate in postmenopausal women with estrogen&#xD;
           receptor (ER)- and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, HER2/neu-overexpressing stage&#xD;
           IV breast cancer treated with first-line therapy comprising fulvestrant and/or&#xD;
           trastuzumab (Herceptin®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the duration of response in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the antitumor activity of these regimens, in terms of time to disease&#xD;
           progression, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the clinical benefit of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate HER2/neu expression and ER and/or PR expression with response in patients&#xD;
           treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are&#xD;
      stratified according to prior adjuvant endocrine therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized&#xD;
      to 1 of 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of course 1 and&#xD;
           then on day 1 only in all subsequent courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8,&#xD;
           15, and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III: Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm I in combination with trastuzumab as in&#xD;
           arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>Of the two treated patients on this trial, the records show that one patient who received Herceptin only completed 3 cycles of therapy, while the second patient who received Herceptin in combination with Faslodex completed 9 cycles of therapy. The last survival data collected from October to November 2008 showed that these two participants were alive at that time.</description>
