  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      American hemodialysis patients are frequently malnourished. This contributes to dialysis&#xD;
      patient mortality rates that are the highest in the industrialized world at 22% per year.&#xD;
      Poor nutritional status probably also contributes to high health care costs (an average of&#xD;
      two hospitalizations annually per patient and total Medicare expenditures of $11 billion per&#xD;
      year) and diminished quality of life. The researchers' prior work identified several&#xD;
      potentially modifiable nutritional barriers (e.g. poor appetite, inadequate dialysis dose,&#xD;
      poor nutritional knowledge, low fluid intake, and needing help shopping and cooking) and&#xD;
      pilot tested a promising approach to overcome these barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed community-based randomized controlled trial extends the researchers' prior work&#xD;
      by targeting specific nutritional barriers with a tailored feedback and education&#xD;
      intervention. Approximately 40 dialysis facilities in northeast Ohio will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to intervention and control groups, with approximately 100 malnourished patients&#xD;
      enrolled from 20 intervention facilities and 100 from 20 control facilities. Baseline&#xD;
      evaluation will include measures of nutritional status, specific barriers, inpatient&#xD;
      expenditures, and quality of life. On a monthly basis for 12 months, intervention patients&#xD;
      and their dietitians will receive tailored feedback and education on overcoming&#xD;
      patient-specific barriers. They will then meet monthly to jointly formulate a care plan&#xD;
      addressing these barriers. Control patients will continue to get usual care. Major analyses&#xD;
      will compare changes in nutritional parameters in intervention vs. control patients with&#xD;
      adjustment for nesting of patients within facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will test a novel intervention that targets patients and providers as&#xD;
      they together make nutrition-related decisions. Overcoming specific barriers may lead not&#xD;
      only to improved nutritional status but also to better patient survival, decreased health&#xD;
      care costs, and increased quality of life.&#xD;
