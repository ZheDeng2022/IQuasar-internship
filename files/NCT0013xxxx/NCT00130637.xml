    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody called&#xD;
      humanized anti-Tac (HAT, also called daclizumab) to treat children and adolescents with&#xD;
      uveitis (chronic inflammatory eye disease) associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis&#xD;
      (JIA). Monoclonal antibodies are genetically engineered proteins made in large quantities and&#xD;
      directed against a specific target in the body. The HAT antibody is designed to prevent a&#xD;
      specific chemical interaction needed for immune cells to produce inflammation. Current&#xD;
      treatments for uveitis include steroids and immune-suppressing drugs. These treatments do not&#xD;
      always work or they may cause significant side effects. This study will determine whether&#xD;
      daclizumab can improve uveitis in children and reduce the need for other medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 6 and 18 years of age with active non-infectious JIA-associated uveitis&#xD;
      requiring treatment with anti-inflammatory medications as often as three times a day or more&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each candidate is screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, eye&#xD;
      examination, and the following specialized tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected&#xD;
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina&#xD;
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if&#xD;
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating the presence of&#xD;
           inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness. The eyes are examined through&#xD;
           a machine that produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. These measures are&#xD;
           repeated during the study to determine changes, if any, in retinal thickening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereoscopic color fundus photography to examine the back of the eye. The pupils are&#xD;
           dilated with eye drops to examine and photograph the back of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering the study, participants receive a 90-minute infusion of daclizumab through a&#xD;
      catheter (plastic tube) placed in an arm vein. They return to the clinic after 14 days and&#xD;
      again after 28 days for repeat eye examinations, blood tests, and daclizumab infusions. Four&#xD;
      weeks after the third infusion, patients are examined for response to treatment. Those who&#xD;
      have benefited from daclizumab may continue receiving monthly infusions of the drug for up to&#xD;
      one year. A blood test and eye examination are done at the time of each infusion. Patients&#xD;
      whose disease has remained active 12 weeks after the first infusion are taken off the study&#xD;
      and treated with other medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric uveitis represents 5-10 % of all patients with uveitis. Uveitis refers to&#xD;
      intraocular inflammatory diseases. The most common type of non-infectious pediatric uveitis,&#xD;
      associated with a systemic disease, is JIA-associated chronic, anterior uveitis. Therapeutic&#xD;
      considerations for pediatric uveitis are often very challenging. Current therapeutic&#xD;
      modalities include corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. These modalities are&#xD;
      not always effective at controlling the disease. In addition they can also be associated with&#xD;
      a higher rate of ocular side effects. To further add to this challenge, pediatric uveitis has&#xD;
      a higher rate of ocular complications, even with the current therapies. Consequently, an&#xD;
      effective treatment with a safer side effect profile is highly desirable. Daclizumab is a&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the high affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2)&#xD;
      receptor CD25 or Tac subunit. The IL-2 receptor system plays a central role in mediating&#xD;
      immune responses. Blocking this system impedes immune responses and can inhibit local&#xD;
      inflammatory responses, including uveitis. Pilot studies using intravenous or subcutaneous&#xD;
      daclizumab treatments suggest that daclizumab treatments at 2 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks for&#xD;
      quiescent uveitis may effectively replace the other immunosuppressive medications in a&#xD;
      majority of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because we have little experience using daclizumab for active uveitis in a pediatric&#xD;
      population, this feasibility study will enroll seven study participants that would normally&#xD;
      be treated with systemic, high-dose corticosteroids or other cytotoxic, systemic&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications. Since daclizumab for other indications can be tolerated with&#xD;
      repeated dosing at 8-10 mg/kg, we will administer daclizumab to reach high serum levels with&#xD;
      a pair of doses at 8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg two weeks apart. The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to collect preliminary information on the utility of acute daclizumab therapy on active&#xD;
      ocular inflammation in a pediatric population. The primary outcome is resolution of active&#xD;
      disease defined as a two step reduction in the anterior chamber cell scale from baseline.&#xD;
      Safety assessment will be made at 28 days and efficacy assessment at 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      initial daclizumab injection. Secondary outcomes will include fluorescein retinal vascular&#xD;
      leakage, cystoid macular edema, vitreous haze and visual acuity. In addition all adverse&#xD;
      events will be collected regardless of possible relation to daclizumab. Participants who do&#xD;
      not meet the safety end point at day 28 will be permitted to continue IV daclizumab&#xD;
      maintenance treatments beginning at Day 28 with 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks. An efficacy assessment&#xD;
      will be made at 8 weeks, and patients who show a 2 step reduction in their intraocular&#xD;
      inflammation, and has not met the safety end point, will continue daclizumab treatment with&#xD;
      2mg/kg every 4 weeks for a total of 52 weeks in the study. At any time during the follow-up&#xD;
      period, if a participant loses greater than 3 lines of visual acuity from baseline study, or&#xD;
      meet the safety end point, treatments will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this feasibility study is to gain preliminary information regarding&#xD;
      the safety and possible efficacy of daclizumab to treat active uveitis, associated with JIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary focus of this feasibility study is a short or acute response trial to relatively&#xD;
      high-dose daclizumab infusions to observe if the anterior cell and flare associate with&#xD;
      active JIA-associated uveitis can be promptly reduced. In order to qualify for enrollment,&#xD;
      each participant must meet all of the inclusion criteria and not meet any of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. This study will enroll seven participants at the National Eye Institute (NEI) who&#xD;
      currently have active JIA-associated active uveitis. Enrollment is expected to take&#xD;
      approximately three months. The two induction treatments will be completed within 14 days,&#xD;
      with the primary safety evaluation at Day 14 and Day 28 and primary efficacy assessment at 12&#xD;
      weeks. An induction regimen of intravenous (IV) daclizumab at 8 mg/kg is given on Day 0&#xD;
      followed by another IV dose of 4 mg/kg at Day 14, provided the safety endpoint has not been&#xD;
      met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An efficacy assessment will be made at 12 weeks, and patients who show a 2-step reduction in&#xD;
      their intraocular inflammation, and has not met the safety endpoint, will continue with&#xD;
      daclizumab therapy. Meeting the safety failure criterion or having a serious adverse affect&#xD;
      attributable to the daclizumab therapy will be cause for termination from further daclizumab&#xD;
      study treatments. Continuing follow-up and standard-of-care alternative treatments with a&#xD;
      potentially reduced visit schedule will be provided through the duration of the trial if&#xD;
      daclizumab treatments are suspended. After the trial, participants may seek other&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatments from their own physician or ophthalmologist or they may be&#xD;
      eligible to enroll in other research trials if these are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who show a 2-step reduction in their ocular inflammation or a decrease to&#xD;
      inactivity, without serious adverse events, will have the option to receive extended&#xD;
      treatments of 2 mg/kg IV daclizumab treatments at 4-week intervals, beginning day 28, for up&#xD;
      to a total of 52 weeks in the study.&#xD;
