  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy as measured by objective tumor response of first-line treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma with bevacizumab monotherapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Norway, cutaneous malignant melanoma is the second most frequent and the most frequent&#xD;
      cancer type in middle-aged (30-54 years) females and males, respectively, and the incidence&#xD;
      has six-doubled during the last 30 years. Median survival for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma is 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many agents have been investigated for anti-tumor effect in melanoma, but there is no&#xD;
      accepted standard therapy. Biochemotherapy, combining cytotoxic drugs with Interleukin-2 or&#xD;
      Interferon alpha, has not been shown to be superior to single agent Dacarbazine (DTIC), which&#xD;
      is regarded to be the most active agent. Other biological approaches like vaccination are&#xD;
      currently under investigation, but still no efficient treatment for metastatic melanoma is&#xD;
      available. DTIC induces objective remission in 20% of the patients, but without significant&#xD;
      impact on survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need of a new and effective treatment for the group of melanoma patients is urgently&#xD;
      needed. This will be the first study to assess response rates of bevacizumab monotherapy in&#xD;
      first line treatment of metastatic melanoma. In addition there will be a major focus on the&#xD;
      identification of predictive biomarkers of bevacizumab efficacy.&#xD;
