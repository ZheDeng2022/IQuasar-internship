      This study uses autologous (one's own) CD4 T cells modified with a viral vector expressing a&#xD;
      genetic antisense targeting HIV, this vector is called VRX496. Study treatment is by&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of vector modified cells and infusions will be provided every other week&#xD;
      for a total of 4 or 8 doses. These modified cells, once infused, may provide immune support&#xD;
      and are not destroyed by HIV, and thus may delay or reverse HIV disease progression. The&#xD;
      study will enroll up to 40 male and female HIV-positive subjects in up to 8 centers. Subjects&#xD;
      will be 18 years of age and over who have failed or are intolerant to at least one triple&#xD;
      combination of antiretroviral drugs. Subjects must have a viral load between 5,000 and&#xD;
      200,000 copies/ml and a CD4+ count of â‰¥150, be in good health and have no evidence of active&#xD;
      opportunistic infection, heart disease, or bleeding disorders. Subjects must not be on&#xD;
      corticosteroids, immunomodulating agents or hydroxyurea. Subjects must not have received an&#xD;
      AIDS vaccine or any investigational gene therapy product at any time. Females must not be&#xD;
      pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VIRxSYS has concluded a 6-month Phase 1/2 clinical study under an IND of the vector VRX496 in&#xD;
      HIV-positive subjects who have failed at least two HAART regimens. HAART typically consists&#xD;
      of a triple &quot;cocktail&quot; of drugs. Although these cocktails have been successful in reducing&#xD;
      viral loads and restoring immune function, they do not represent a cure. There are also&#xD;
      concerns about adverse effects associated with long-term usage of HAART. Specifically, a&#xD;
      variety of metabolic disorders including HIV-associated lipodystrophy, central adiposity,&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance have been reported as&#xD;
      resulting from HAART. These reactions, combined with often complex and cumbersome dosing&#xD;
      regimens, can have an adverse effect on patient-subject adherence to therapy. Furthermore,&#xD;
      poor adherence has led to increased rates of HIV resistance, resulting in viral strains that&#xD;
      have reduced sensitivity to the drugs. Importantly, in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted&#xD;
      by VIRxSYS, there were no reported toxicities associated with the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene therapy for HIV-1 infection has been proposed as an alternative to antiretroviral drug&#xD;
      regimens. A number of different genetic vectors with antiviral payloads have been utilized to&#xD;
      combat HIV-1, including antisense RNA, transdominant proteins, ribozymes, RNA decoys, single&#xD;
      chain antibodies, and RNAi (RNA-interference. Antisense RNA targeted to wt-HIV RNA offers a&#xD;
      significant advantage over several other genetic antiviral approaches because it is not a&#xD;
      protein and thus not immunogenic and because the size of the payload prevents virus escape&#xD;
      mutants, such as occurs with the use of RNAi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Phase 2 protocol, 6 subjects will be staggered for infusion by at least 2 weeks. The&#xD;
      first group of 3 subjects will receive 4 infusions (4-dose cohort). If no dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLT) are observed, the second group of 3 subjects, (i.e. subjects 4, 5 and 6)&#xD;
      will continue with 8 infusions (8-dose cohort). Safety visits are scheduled 1 week after&#xD;
      infusion and monthly for the first 6 months and at 9 months following the last infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After safety has been evaluated, and in order to explore biological activity, additional&#xD;
      subjects (6-10 evaluable subjects) will be entered into each cohort. Follow-up visits are&#xD;
      scheduled 1 week after infusion and monthly for the first 6 months and at 9 months following&#xD;
      the last infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of a single bolus will also be examined in a third cohort. The single bolus&#xD;
      infusion will consist of the following cell doses: approximately 10 billion, 20 billion, and&#xD;
      30 billion, respectively. Subjects will be allotted to the respective cell dose groups&#xD;
      according to the order in which they are enrolled. Three to 5 subjects will be allotted to&#xD;
      the lower cell dose group and followed for safety for 4 weeks. After safety is evaluated, the&#xD;
      next group (3 to 5 subjects) will be allotted to the next higher cell dose group and followed&#xD;
      for safety for 4 weeks. If the intermediate cell dose group is determined to be safe, an&#xD;
      additional 3 to 5 subjects will be allotted to the highest cell dose group. All subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for safety at biweekly intervals for the first 4 weeks and thereafter at monthly&#xD;
      intervals up to 6 months and then at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has concluded it's 9-month active phase. Subjects are currently in a 15-year Long&#xD;
      Term Follow-up Phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In keeping with the recently released Guidance on Monitoring For Delayed Adverse Events, that&#xD;
      states that for the first 5 years all subjects should undergo monitoring of vector sequences&#xD;
      every 6 months, subjects will visit the clinic at a maximum of 6 months intervals for a blood&#xD;
      test evaluating persistence of vector sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore for the first 5 years, subjects will have 6 months visits for safety assessment.&#xD;
      For years 6 to 15, subjects will be contacted by phone or mail. At these contacts, subjects&#xD;
      will be asked about their health status.&#xD;
