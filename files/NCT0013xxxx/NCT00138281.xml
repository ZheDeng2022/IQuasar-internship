  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty adults, ages 18-49, will be randomly assigned to receive either FluMist or Fluzone.&#xD;
      Some of the subjects will have participated in previous studies for these 2 vaccines. The&#xD;
      study will last 4 months with subject participation being 28 days. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to measure immune response to the vaccinations.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 4, single-center, study of the immune responses of adults to one of two&#xD;
      licensed influenza vaccines (either inactivated vaccine given IM or live, attenuated vaccine&#xD;
      given intranasally). The study will enroll up to 60 adults, ages 18-49, some of whom were&#xD;
      immunized in the Years 1 and 2 studies. This study began Year 1 of this grant with a protocol&#xD;
      testing the two vaccine products in their age-approved populations. FluMist is approved for&#xD;
      use in healthy children and adolescents, 5-17 years of age, and healthy adults 18-49 years of&#xD;
      age. Fluzone is approved for all age groups starting at 6 months of age. To match for age and&#xD;
      to study the youngest children possible, the age cohorts of 5-9 and 18-49 years were chosen&#xD;
      for initial Year 1 study. In 2003, 70 adults and 16 children were enrolled, randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive either FluMist or Fluzone and immunized. In 2004, 44 of the original 70 adults were&#xD;
      re-immunized with the same preparation they received in 2003. In addition, studies were&#xD;
      conducted in twenty-eight 6mos to 5yo children who all received Fluzone and in thirty-nine&#xD;
      5-9 yo children who were randomized 1:1 to receive either FluMist or Fluzone. For 2005, we&#xD;
      propose to study in this protocol, adults from last year who agree to a third immunization&#xD;
      plus as many new adults to add up to a total of 60. Blood samples will also be taken at Days&#xD;
      0, 7-9 and 28 to be analyzed for CD4 and CD8 T-cell, B-cell, NK-cell and homing receptor&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
