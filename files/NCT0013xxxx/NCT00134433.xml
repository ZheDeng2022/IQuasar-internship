  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is the single most important killer of Canadians. Despite major&#xD;
      advances in therapy, there is still a significant proportion of patients identified with the&#xD;
      disease who die of it because current treatment approaches cannot effectively palliate their&#xD;
      condition. A new treatment modality called therapeutic angiogenesis has appeared on the&#xD;
      clinical research scene during the last five years; this approach recreates the natural&#xD;
      processes of new blood vessel formation that is observed during growth and development in&#xD;
      every human being. It is an extremely potent and promising modality, but so far the results&#xD;
      of clinical trials in patients have been equivocal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One reason for the limited efficacy observed thus far with therapeutic angiogenesis may rest&#xD;
      in that factors produced by the lining of the coronary arteries themselves are essential for&#xD;
      angiogenic substances to take effect in the heart muscle of patients with severe coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. These same patients, however, virtually all have, as a result of their&#xD;
      disease, marked dysfunction of their coronaries and therefore fail to produce these factors&#xD;
      in adequate quantities. This hypothesis has been verified with extensive animal data by the&#xD;
      investigators of this research, where a swine model of coronary disease was shown to severely&#xD;
      inhibit the action of angiogenic growth factors. If one wants angiogenesis to work, a means&#xD;
      of improving the function of the coronary lining of patients with severe ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease must be identified and its effects evaluated in order to allow for angiogenic&#xD;
      substances to exert their action towards successful revascularization of the heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An amino acid called L-arginine has repeatedly been shown to markedly improve function of the&#xD;
      coronary artery lining in patients with ischemic heart disease when administered regularly&#xD;
      over a period of several months. This research will therefore test, in the form of a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial, whether this concomitant approach can make angiogenesis effective&#xD;
      in patients with advanced coronary disease, by allowing for the action of growth factors to&#xD;
      take place in the heart. If this approach is successful, as is anticipated, angiogenesis will&#xD;
      constitute an effective modality for the treatment of coronary artery disease, not only in&#xD;
      patients with advanced, severe involvement unamenable to any other form of cardiac therapy&#xD;
      such as coronary artery bypass grafting, but even perhaps in all patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease in need of revascularization. The goal of this investigation towards the&#xD;
      making of a new, revolutionary, safe and efficacious modality for the treatment of the number&#xD;
      one killer disease of Canadians is in complete agreement with the primary objective of the&#xD;
      Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The EMAT trial tests the hypothesis that the concomitant treatment of chronic endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients undergoing angiogenic therapy can make angiogenesis clinically&#xD;
      effective. This is achieved with a 2x2 factorial, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized&#xD;
      trial of intramyocardial vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) angiogenesis at a dose of&#xD;
      2 mg and of adjunct endothelial modulation therapy using oral L-arginine supplementation at a&#xD;
      dose of 6 g/day in patients undergoing surgical perivascular angiogenic therapy. The study&#xD;
      involves surgical angiogenesis techniques similar to those previously used and reported to be&#xD;
      clinically safe by the principal investigator and collaborators. Patients with a diffusely&#xD;
      disease left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery have this artery grafted with an&#xD;
      internal thoracic artery in either its proximal or distal portion (according to what is felt&#xD;
      by the surgeon to be most optimal as per usual practice). The segment of the LAD that is not&#xD;
      directly bypassed (i.e. either the proximal portion if a distal bypass is performed by the&#xD;
      surgeon or the distal portion if a proximal bypass is performed) is treated by the surgeon&#xD;
      with VEGF angiogenesis or placebo injections. Other coronary arteries in need of bypass&#xD;
      grafting are grafted as per usual practice, using arterial grafts. Patients are therefore&#xD;
      randomized to one of four groups at the time of coronary artery bypass grafting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  growth factor (VEGF) angiogenesis along the diffusely diseased, non-directly bypassed&#xD;
           LAD segment + L-arginine oral supplementation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  placebo &quot;angiogenesis&quot; along the diffusely diseased, non-directly bypassed LAD segment +&#xD;
           L-arginine oral supplementation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  growth factor (VEGF) angiogenesis along the diffusely diseased, non-directly bypassed&#xD;
           LAD segment + placebo oral supplementation; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  placebo &quot;angiogenesis&quot; along the diffusely diseased, non-directly bypassed LAD segment +&#xD;
           placebo oral supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The angiogenesis treatment consists either of the injection of 2 mg (divided in 10 injections&#xD;
      of 200 Î¼g each) of plasmid DNA encoding for the VEGF165 gene or of 10 x 1 ml injections of a&#xD;
      sterile physiologic saline solution in the myocardial territory and septum along the&#xD;
      diffusely diseased, non-directly bypassed LAD segment. Other myocardial territories are&#xD;
      concomitantly revascularized with arterial coronary bypass grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMAT trial's primary end-points relate to objective myocardial perfusion indices and&#xD;
      contractility of the intervened anterior myocardial portion, respectively measured with&#xD;
      cardiac positron-emission tomography (PET) by using the investigational radioisotope 13-N&#xD;
      ammonia, and by RNA or echocardiography. Using 13-N PET, collateral-dependent blood flow and&#xD;
      ischemic zone size are measured in a double-blind fashion by a single observer at baseline&#xD;
      and at 3 months. To better delineate the actual effects of angiogenic therapy, baseline&#xD;
      perfusion scans are obtained 3 to 5 days after the operative procedure in order to account&#xD;
      for the potentially confounding effect of CABG on myocardial perfusion to the proximal and&#xD;
      distal anterior and septal territories. The functional, secondary end-points of the EMAT&#xD;
      trial consist of clinical outcomes including major adverse cardiac events (MACE), freedom&#xD;
      from angina, and angina class.&#xD;
