  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In countries of the Sahel and sub-Sahel, malaria transmission is highly seasonal with nearly&#xD;
      all infections occurring during a few months of the year. However, mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      from malaria may be high during this period, especially in young children who are the group&#xD;
      most at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent preventative treatment (IPT) is a new approach to the prevention of malaria in&#xD;
      this situation. IPT involves the administration of an anti-malarial to children at risk for&#xD;
      malaria at fixed times, even if they are not infected. To investigate how effective this&#xD;
      approach might be in Senegal, a trial has been undertaken in which 1136 children aged 6 weeks&#xD;
      to 59 months were given a single dose of sulfadoxine pyrimethamine and artesunate on three&#xD;
      occasions during a three-month rainy season and the incidence of clinical malaria in these&#xD;
      children was compared with that in a group of children who received placebo. Additional&#xD;
      observations were made on the incidence of side effects in children in the two groups and on&#xD;
      the impact of IPT in children (IPTc) on markers of drug resistance in children whose blood&#xD;
      films were positive for Plasmodium falciparum.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In countries of the Sahel and sub-Sahel, malaria transmission is highly seasonal.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, mortality and morbidity from malaria may be very high during the few months of&#xD;
      the year when malaria transmission takes place, especially in children. It has been shown&#xD;
      previously in The Gambia and elsewhere that in areas of seasonal malaria transmission,&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity from malaria in children can be reduced substantially by the regular&#xD;
      administration of anti-malarial drugs during the period of risk (chemoprophylaxis). However,&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis is difficult to sustain. Intermittent preventative treatment (IPT) is an&#xD;
      adapted form of chemoprophylaxis in which anti-malarial drugs are given at fixed but less&#xD;
      frequent intervals than with chemoprophylaxis, allowing blood concentrations of anti-malarial&#xD;
      drugs to fall below the inhibitory concentration for periods between drug administrations.&#xD;
      This approach to malaria control was used first in pregnant women among whom it is highly&#xD;
      effective. However, more recently, it has also been used in infants (IPTi) with&#xD;
      anti-malarials being given at the same time as vaccines are administered. This approach is&#xD;
      likely to be most effective in areas of high transmission where a high proportion of severe&#xD;
      cases of malaria occur in children during the first year of life. IPTi is likely to be less&#xD;
      effective in reducing the burden of malaria in areas of seasonal malaria transmission where&#xD;
      many cases of severe malaria occur in older children. Intermittent preventative treatment in&#xD;
      children (IPTc) is a possible approach to the control of malaria in areas where the main&#xD;
      burden of malaria is in older children. Thus, the investigators have undertaken a study to&#xD;
      determine how effective this approach would be in preventing malaria in Senegal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study was to determine whether the administration of one dose of&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate to Senegalese children aged 6 weeks to 59 months on&#xD;
      three occasions during the malaria transmission season would reduce significantly the&#xD;
      incidence of clinical attacks of malaria. Secondary objectives were determination of the&#xD;
      incidence of side effects in children who received IPTc; the impact of IPTc on the prevalence&#xD;
      of molecular markers of resistance to SP in samples positive for Plasmodium falciparum; and&#xD;
      the effects of IPTc on the incidence of malaria in the rainy season following the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in Niakhar, a rural area in the centre of Senegal where malaria&#xD;
      transmission is very seasonal, nearly all transmission taking place during a three to four&#xD;
      month period. The entomological inoculation rate in the area is about 10 infectious bites per&#xD;
      person per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children aged 6 weeks to 59 months residing in the study area were eligible to join the&#xD;
      study. There were few exclusion criteria (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of meetings were held with members of the communities where the trial was undertaken&#xD;
      to explain its purpose. The families of potentially eligible children were visited and asked&#xD;
      if they wished their child to join the trial. If this was the case, informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained. Children were then allocated to one of eight randomisation groups (four active&#xD;
      drugs and four placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the malaria transmission season, all study children were examined and a&#xD;
      finger-prick blood sample obtained for determination of packed cell volume and for&#xD;
      preparation of a thick blood film for microscopy. A drop of blood was collected onto filter&#xD;
      paper and stored for subsequent molecular studies. Children who were anaemic were treated. A&#xD;
      similar survey was conducted at the end of the malaria transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initial evaluation children were treated with either a single dose of&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate or with matching placebos. Treatment was repeated on&#xD;
      two further occasions separated by a period of a month. After each round of drug&#xD;
      administration a randomly selected group of children were visited and their parents or&#xD;
      guardians asked about any side effects related to the drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance for clinical attacks of malaria was undertaken through the detection of study&#xD;
      children when they presented to one of the clinics in the study area for treatment of a&#xD;
      febrile illness and through weekly home visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the year following the treatment trial, children who had been randomised previously to&#xD;
      receive active drug or placebo were followed for another rainy season and the occurrence of&#xD;
      clinical attacks malaria detected as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood films were stained with Giemsa and examined for malaria parasites by two experienced&#xD;
      microscopists. Parasite DNA was extracted from filter paper samples of children who were&#xD;
      parasitaemic and examined for mutations in the dhfr and dhps genes associated with resistance&#xD;
      to pyrimethamine and to sulphonamides respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial End-Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary trial end-point was the incidence of clinical attacks of malaria in children who&#xD;
      received IPTc or placebo. Clinical malaria was defined as an episode of fever (temperature&#xD;
      recorded to be 37.5 degrees Celsius or higher or a history of fever within the previous 24&#xD;
      hours) for which no other cause could be found and the presences of P. falciparum&#xD;
      parasitaemia at a density of 3,000 parasites per microlitre or greater. This parasite density&#xD;
      was chosen as it has been shown previously to be an appropriate fever threshold in the study&#xD;
      area. Secondary end-points included the incidence of side effects in children in each group,&#xD;
      changes in the prevalences of resistance markers and the incidence of clinical malaria in the&#xD;
      year following the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was assumed on the basis of previous information that children in the control group would&#xD;
      experience an average of 0.4 clinical attacks of malaria during the malaria transmission&#xD;
      season. On the basis of this assumption, a trial with 540 children in each arm would have 80%&#xD;
      power at the 5% level of significance to detect a 30% reduction in the incidence of clinical&#xD;
      attacks of malaria and a 90% power to detect a 40% reduction including an allowance for a 10%&#xD;
      drop-out during the surveillance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was monitored by an independent Data, Safety and Monitoring Board which reviewed&#xD;
      the study protocol, the standard operating procedures and the analytical plan.&#xD;
