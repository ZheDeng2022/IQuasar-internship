    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of administering a combination vaccine&#xD;
      (DTaP-HepB-IPV; Pediarix™) to infants at birth, 2 and 6 months compared to the administration&#xD;
      of a HepB vaccine at birth and the same combination vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.&#xD;
      Additionally, researchers will assess the body's antibody response (proteins produced by the&#xD;
      body's immune system that help fight infections) following each vaccine dose. The study will&#xD;
      enroll 5 healthy newborns, ages 0-5 days. Participants will be involved in study related&#xD;
      procedures for up to 288 days, including blood sample collection and 5 study visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine immunization at birth is standard for hepatitis B in the United States (US) and for&#xD;
      hepatitis B, polio and tuberculosis (BCG) in many countries. Other vaccines have not been&#xD;
      routinely administered at birth largely due to concerns relating to immaturity of the&#xD;
      neonatal immune system and the possibility of reduced immune response to vaccine antigens.&#xD;
      With the recent licensure in the US of a pentavalent combination vaccine (DTaP-Hep B-IPV;&#xD;
      Pediarix™) researchers propose to evaluate a new immunization schedule that includes a birth&#xD;
      dose of this vaccine, in an effort to determine adequacy of neonatal immune response to the&#xD;
      study vaccine antigens. The primary objectives of this study are: to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      administering the pentavalent combination vaccine (DTaP-HepB-IPV; Pediarix™) to infants at&#xD;
      birth, two and six months of age compared to the administration of a hepatitis B vaccine&#xD;
      (Engerix-B) at birth and the same pentavalent combination vaccine at two, four and six months&#xD;
      of age; and to assess age specific antibody response following each vaccine dose. Five&#xD;
      healthy newborns; 0 to 5 days of age, greater than or equal to 37 weeks gestation, and&#xD;
      greater than 2500 gm birth weight were recruited from two Southern California Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente medical centers. Infants were randomized to one of 2 study groups: Group A&#xD;
      received DTaP-HepB-IPV (Pediarix™) vaccine along with other required vaccines at birth, two,&#xD;
      six months of age; Group B received the monovalent hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) at birth,&#xD;
      the DTaP-HepB-IPV (Pediarix™) vaccine with other vaccines at two, four and six months.&#xD;
      Children will be evaluated for post-vaccination adverse events. Blood will be collected and&#xD;
      immunogenicity evaluated by standardized humoral immunologic assays. The main outcome&#xD;
      measures are to assess immune responses to each vaccine antigen over time, antibodies to&#xD;
      pertussis (PT, FHA, PRN), diphtheria, tetanus, haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), polio&#xD;
      (Types 1, 2, 3) and hepatitis B (HbsAg). The secondary outcome measures are to assess vaccine&#xD;
      safety, systemic and local immediate reactions.&#xD;
