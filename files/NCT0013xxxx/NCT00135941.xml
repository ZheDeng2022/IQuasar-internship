    <description>Sequence 1 (Lantus + Apidra first, then Premix): Subjects randomized to this sequence will receive ApidraTM administered three times per day 0-15 minutes before main meals using a fixed bolus regimen following titration based on preprandial blood glucose values; as well as Lantus qd for 12 weeks. After the first 12 weeks, subjects will cross over to the premix insulin for a further treatment of 12 weeks.</description>
