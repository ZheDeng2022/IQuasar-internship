  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study, is to investigate if low intensity electromagnetic radiation, can&#xD;
      influence the cognitive performances and well being of healthy adolescents and adults.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the purpose is to provide any special information about the subjects which can&#xD;
      cause the possible reactions. Finally, the investigation will try to clarify if there is&#xD;
      anything specific in the radiation signal that causes the effect&#xD;

      EMF-exposure has been related to reported symptoms of sleep-disorders, headaches,&#xD;
      nervousness, fatigue, and concentration difficulties. This study intends to focus on these&#xD;
      symptoms related to the UMTS control signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible annoyance from very low intensity&#xD;
      electromagnetic radiation, as it exists from modern antenna masts supporting mobile&#xD;
      communication. Also we try to get a better understanding of the specific parts of the signal&#xD;
      leading to symptoms. This investigation tries to clarify the risk for both adults and&#xD;
      adolescents, other susceptibility factors, and whether the radiation changes cognitive&#xD;
      functions. The above mentioned complaints have been related to psychological distress and&#xD;
      somatization, and EMF-related complaints have been reported more by individuals with higher&#xD;
      somatization tendency. In the present study, we therefore propose to control for symptoms of&#xD;
      somatization and personality traits thought to influence perception and reporting of&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study a signal level of 1 volt/meter (2.6 mW/m2) will be used. This level should&#xD;
      correspond to the level, experienced by the general public living rather near a base station&#xD;
      antenna. The antenna arrangement will produce an approximation to a plane wave, so that the&#xD;
      intensity is constant (within 2 dB) over the volume occupied by the subjects. The subjects&#xD;
      are required to sit close to a computer screen and keyboard, which will modify the&#xD;
      distribution slightly. The climatic chamber used for the study is modified with absorbing&#xD;
      lining to dampen reflections from the walls. The chamber is also modified to make it a&#xD;
      screened room to prevent external RF fields, and to some extent low frequency fields, to&#xD;
      enter the chamber. Except for cables to the keyboard and screen there will be no other&#xD;
      electromagnetic radiators in the chamber. The four different exposure types used, are Sham&#xD;
      exposure (no radiation from the antennas), a UMTS signal (typical base station signal, 2140&#xD;
      MHz), a CW (continuous wave) of 2140 MHz. and a Wideband W-CDMA signal, f=2140 MHz, modulated&#xD;
      with a random data sequence at a chip rate of 3.8 MHz, corresponding to a pure UMTS&#xD;
      modulation signal, without the control signals.&#xD;
