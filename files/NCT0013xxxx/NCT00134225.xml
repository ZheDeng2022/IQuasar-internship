  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that non able-bodied participants with reported acute,&#xD;
      sub-acute, or chronic symptoms of neck or back pain of a musculoskeletal origin will have&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray and blood parameters that do not demonstrate a&#xD;
      statistical difference between &quot;normal&quot; (able-bodied) volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle pattern recognition (MPR) testing will show statistically different results between&#xD;
      these groups. This statistically significant finding in MPR results will enhance a&#xD;
      clinician's determination of clinical normality or abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this hypothesis is demonstrated, the MPR modality will be the first quantitative tool&#xD;
      developed for assisting in the diagnosis of the presence or absence of a musculoskeletal&#xD;
      dysfunction in a patient population. The availability of such an evaluation tool to a&#xD;
      healthcare provider for patients with soft tissue, non-surgical neck or back complaints will&#xD;
      substantially improve the accuracy of diagnosis and case management decisions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aim to use data from both the able-bodied and non able-bodied samples to create&#xD;
      a normative database for this technology. The primary objective of populating a normative&#xD;
      database will be to construct a reliable and valid normative database representative of the&#xD;
      North American population for use with a discriminative analysis tool which will&#xD;
      differentiate abnormal musculoskeletal function from normal musculoskeletal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study population will be composed of 480 asymptomatic participants&#xD;
      (able-bodied individuals) and symptomatic (non able-bodied individuals: individuals with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal, non-surgical injuries of the neck and back) selected first on the basis of a&#xD;
      screening questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon signing an informed consent to participate in the study, participants will complete&#xD;
      screening questionnaires. They will be independently evaluated by two clinicians, well&#xD;
      experienced in the field of musculoskeletal medicine, who obtain a detailed medical history&#xD;
      with particular attention to the strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and perform a&#xD;
      standardized physical examination. This standardized clinical examination consists of the&#xD;
      most current &quot;Gold Standard&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients presenting with musculoskeletal complaints of the back or neck and are&#xD;
      frequently given this diagnosis solely on the basis of the &quot;first line&quot; healthcare providers'&#xD;
      history and physical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure the statistical strength of the history and physical selection process for further&#xD;
      inclusion into the study, participants will undergo two separate clinical examinations. Each&#xD;
      will be performed independently by physicians who are specialists in two different fields of&#xD;
      practice that commonly see neck and back pain patients and who must agree if a subject is&#xD;
      clinically normal or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If selected for continued participation, each participant will undergo Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (MRI) of the spine (sagittal views of the entire spine), plain X-rays of the entire&#xD;
      spine (A/P and Lateral views), blood studies (CBC, Sedimentation Rate, CPK, Calcium,&#xD;
      Phosphorous, Pregnancy test, drug screen) and MPR testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 480 clinically and lab normal able-bodied/not-able bodied individuals will be&#xD;
      selected and examined over a period of twelve months at 4 different centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Able-Bodied Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 240 able-bodied participants will be divided by gender (male,&#xD;
      female) and by age classes: specifically [18-30 years], [31-45 years], and [46-62 years].&#xD;
      This sample size was selected, in part, because Edgerton et al. reported that recruitment&#xD;
      patterns of the neck or back differ dependent upon gender and our goal is to have a&#xD;
      population of approximately 120 males and 120 females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the close of the study, investigators will segment the population into the three age&#xD;
      groups mentioned, the proposed sample sizes are thought to be appropriate for statistical&#xD;
      analysis while still capturing a variety of subject types. The overall age range was chosen&#xD;
      to represent the main working population in North America, but to not exceed an upper age&#xD;
      range where muscle recruitment patterns may vary on a natural evolutionary basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of normal/able-bodied participants will be collected from 4 independent&#xD;
      research centers in the U.S. and Canada with an expected maximum of approximately 60&#xD;
      individuals per center. A sub-group of 32 randomly assigned able-bodied volunteers will be&#xD;
      scheduled for a second MPR test approximately 7 days after their initial testing to examine&#xD;
      the reliability of the MPR evaluation tool. In the selection process, every effort will be&#xD;
      made to avoid bias toward a non-working population (i.e. testing only in the morning or&#xD;
      afternoon) and to obtain representative proportions of the age and race classes existing in&#xD;
      North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not Able-Bodied Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to construct a valid and reliable profile of clinically not normal&#xD;
      individuals diagnosed as suffering from musculoskeletal neck or back pain that will be used&#xD;
      to confirm our hypothesis and the ability of the MPR evaluation to provide valid, reliable,&#xD;
      and objective information for the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These 240 not able-bodied volunteers will be selected using the same inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and standardized medical histories and physical examinations as above. One exception&#xD;
      to the exclusion criteria is that if a not-normal participant uses ongoing medications for&#xD;
      control of discomfort, it will be left to the discretion of each investigator as to how that&#xD;
      individual's medication profile may affect their pain reporting, physical performance, or&#xD;
      compliance with the protocol steps. A 3-day medication &quot;wash-out&quot; will be allowed (and&#xD;
      encouraged) if there is any concern about a participant's performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to conduct an appropriate discriminate analysis, half of the recruited participants&#xD;
      will be an able-bodied sample of participants. Half of the participants will fall into the&#xD;
      not able-bodied participant sample. Every effort will be made in the selection process to&#xD;
      avoid bias toward a non-working population (i.e. testing only in the morning or afternoon)&#xD;
      and obtain representative proportions of the age and race classes existing in North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the data collection process, other clinical categories could be defined for additional&#xD;
      statistical analysis such as the loci of symptoms (i.e. lumbar, thoracic, cervical), the&#xD;
      level of symptoms (lower, mid, or upper back) and the laterality of symptoms (left or right).&#xD;
      Upon analysis of the laboratory and image findings (MRI, X-ray, blood tests) other anatomic&#xD;
      findings or variations such as degenerative disc disease, size of possible disc protrusions,&#xD;
      Sedimentation Rate or CPK values, Schmorld's nodes, etc. may also be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not able-bodied volunteers may have long standing back or neck pain or pain symptoms as&#xD;
      recently as several days after a date of injury. This more immediate window of pain will be&#xD;
      allowed to include acute events but not until or unless the individual is able to perform the&#xD;
      nine movements necessary for the MPR testing procedure. The outer time duration of pain was&#xD;
      chosen to include individuals with more chronic complaints, but not if other compensatory or&#xD;
      secondary gain issues appear present such as may occur with Worker's Compensation claims,&#xD;
      disability claims, or litigation. It is the desire of investigators to include appropriate&#xD;
      acute, sub-acute, and chronic neck or back pain sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that the design of this study will prove that the evaluation provided by the MPR&#xD;
      testing modality should be the tool of choice for the objective evaluation and case&#xD;
      management of patients presenting with musculoskeletal, non-surgical neck and back pain as it&#xD;
      will differentiate &quot;normal&quot; (asymptomatic, able-bodied) individuals from those individuals&#xD;
      (&quot;not normal&quot;) with underlying biomechanical dysfunctions.&#xD;
