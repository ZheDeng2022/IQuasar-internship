    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, randomized phase 2 study&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) in the treatment of&#xD;
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). One-hundred- twenty patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      trial in total. Subjects must have a diagnosis made by HRCT showing definite or probable IPF&#xD;
      and clinical symptoms consistent with IPF with onset between 3 and 36 months prior to&#xD;
      screening. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either Gleevec 600 mg orally or&#xD;
      placebo, once per day for approximately 2 years. The primary efficacy will be progression&#xD;
      defined as a greater than 10% decline in the forced vital capacity or death. Measures of&#xD;
      safety will include all randomized patients who receive at least one dose of study&#xD;
      medication. All adverse events and serious adverse events will be separately tabulated and&#xD;
      mapped to a standard classification system and grouped by body system. Any serious adverse&#xD;
      events that occur during the trial and 30 days after the end of therapy will be reported to&#xD;
      the FDA within 24 hours and followed to outcome.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical symptoms consistent with IPF with onset between 3 months and 36 months prior&#xD;
             to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Worsening as demonstrated by any one of the following within the past year:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. &gt;10% decrease in FVC % of predicted,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Worsening chest x-ray or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Worsening dyspnea at rest or on exertion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 20 -79 years of age. Subjects aged 20-50 must have diagnosis by either open or&#xD;
             video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lung biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis must be made by (HRCT) showing definite or probable IPF AND either of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Open or VATS lung biopsy showing definite or probable usual interstitial&#xD;
                  pneumonitis (UIP)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Non-diagnostic transbronchial biopsy to exclude other conditions (including&#xD;
                  granulomatous disease and malignancies) AND abnormal pulmonary function tests&#xD;
                  (reduced FVC or decreased DLCO or impaired gas exchange with rest or exercise)&#xD;
                  AND 2 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Age &gt;50 years&#xD;

          -  Any condition other than IPF, which, in the opinion of the site principal&#xD;
             investigator, is likely to result in the death of the patient within the next year&#xD;
