      Recent findings have suggested that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) substantially reduces cocaine&#xD;
      drug-seeking behavior in formerly cocaine dependent rats. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety, tolerability, and cue reactivity effects of NAC in cocaine dependent&#xD;
      individuals and non-dependent healthy controls.&#xD;

      Recent findings have suggested that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) substantially reduces&#xD;
      cocaine-primed drug-seeking behavior in formerly cocaine dependent rats. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and cue reactivity effects of NAC in cocaine&#xD;
      dependent individuals and non-dependent healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will include 20 non-treatment seeking cocaine dependent&#xD;
      individuals and 12 healthy, non-dependent controls. Participants will be recruited via&#xD;
      word-of-mouth and advertisements. Cocaine dependent participants will undergo two 3-day&#xD;
      hospital stays. Healthy controls will be followed throughout the study on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 600 mg of NAC or placebo.&#xD;
      Medication or placebo will be administered twice each day. Participants will be evaluated for&#xD;
      side effects throughout the study. After administration of the final dose of medication or&#xD;
      placebo, participants will undergo cue reactivity testing. This will include a standardized&#xD;
      protocol of slides demonstrating cocaine acquisition, use of cocaine, and cocaine-related&#xD;
      paraphernalia. Before, during, and after cue reactivity procedures, standardized behavioral&#xD;
      and cognitive scales will be used to assess cocaine craving, cocaine seeking, and subjective&#xD;
      effects of the cocaine &quot;high.&quot; The following week participants will be crossed over so that&#xD;
      they will receive the other treatment. All study procedures will be performed a second time.&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted during Week 3 in order to determine if any residual side&#xD;
      effects or adverse events occurred from the medication and treatment.&#xD;
