      The purpose of this study is to determine at which point in the dosing regime grass pollen&#xD;
      immunotherapy causes a significant reduction in the late skin response to allergen challenge.&#xD;
      A once weekly cluster regimen of 2 injections per visit was employed during the up-dosing&#xD;
      phase, followed by monthly maintenance injections of 100,000 SQ units. Symptom scores and&#xD;
      need of rescue medication were recorded by patients during the study period. The size of&#xD;
      early and late cutaneous response to allergen challenge was recorded and measured by a&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single centre, randomised, double-blind placebo controlled trial of grass pollen&#xD;
      injection immunotherapy (Alutard SQ, ALK Abello, Denmark) in adults with severe summer&#xD;
      hayfever unresponsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. The main aim was to determine&#xD;
      at which point in the dosing regime grass pollen immunotherapy causes a significant reduction&#xD;
      in the late skin response to allergen challenge. A once weekly cluster regimen of 2&#xD;
      injections per visit was employed during the up-dosing phase, followed by monthly maintenance&#xD;
      injections of 100,000 SQ units. Twelve patients received active treatment (mean age 31, 7&#xD;
      male) whilst 6 were given placebo (mean age 37, 2 male). The 24 hour skin response (size of&#xD;
      swelling, (mm)) to intradermal allergen challenge (0.1, 1, 10 BU) was determined on alternate&#xD;
      weeks during the 8 week up-dosing phase and then monthly up to 6 months and 3 monthly up to&#xD;
      11-13 months following initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the up-dosing phase (approximately 8 weeks) there was a significant reduction&#xD;
      in the size of the late phase response which was evident with all three intradermal doses&#xD;
      (p=0.02 for 0.1 &amp; 1 BU and p=0.04 for 10 BU). This reduction was sustained throughout the&#xD;
      maintenance phase (p=0.04 for 0.1 BU and 0.01 for 1&amp; 10BU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The up-dosing phase of grass pollen immunotherapy alone is sufficient to dampen the late skin&#xD;
      response to allergen challenge. Whether or not this may be predictive of the clinical&#xD;
      response to immunotherapy remains to be determined.&#xD;
