  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical study are to evaluate the extended safety, tolerance and&#xD;
      acceptability of a vaginal gel formulation when applied in 452 healthy women volunteers. This&#xD;
      vaginal formulation was shown to be well tolerated in a previous smaller clinical study. The&#xD;
      formulation is being developed as a microbicide for the prevention of sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections (STIs) including HIV.&#xD;

      Objectives: The objectives of this Phase I/II clinical trial are to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerance and acceptability of a gel formulation containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)&#xD;
      (compared to gel alone and placebo) when applied intravaginally in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In part A of the protocol, three groups: gel alone, gel plus SLS, and placebo will be&#xD;
      tested for safety, tolerance and acceptability when applied intravaginally once, twice or&#xD;
      three times daily for 14 days in 252 healthy subjects. The volunteers will be divided as&#xD;
      follow: 36 sexually abstinent healthy subjects (12 per group) will apply the gel, gel plus&#xD;
      SLS or the placebo once daily for 14 days; 72 sexually active healthy subjects (24 per group)&#xD;
      will apply the gel, gel plus SLS or the placebo once daily for 14 days; 72 sexually active&#xD;
      healthy subjects (24 per group) will apply the gel, gel plus SLS or the placebo twice daily&#xD;
      for 14 days and 72 sexually active healthy subjects (24 per group) will apply the gel, gel&#xD;
      plus SLS or the placebo three times daily for 14 days. The gel will be applied between&#xD;
      menses. For the sexually active group, the gel should be applied less than 1 hour before&#xD;
      sexual intercourse, if planned. Subjects will have vaginal intercourse a minimum of 4 times&#xD;
      in a 2-week period of gel application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part B of the protocol, the extended safety of the gel alone, gel plus SLS and placebo&#xD;
      will be studied when applied intravaginally twice daily for 8 weeks in sexually active&#xD;
      healthy subjects. In this part B (actually represents Phase II of the trial), 80 healthy&#xD;
      sexually active subjects for the gel alone group and 80 subjects for the gel + SLS group and&#xD;
      40 subjects for the placebo group, will be studied. The part B involves the participation of&#xD;
      a total of 200 subjects. Subjects will have vaginal intercourse a minimum of 4 times in a&#xD;
      2-week period of gel application. The gel will be applied between menses. The gel should be&#xD;
      applied less than 1 hour before sexual intercourse, if planned, but no more than twice a day.&#xD;
