  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are: to make sure that there are no serious side effects of an&#xD;
      experimental inactivated influenza A/H5N1 vaccine in children; and to see how the body's&#xD;
      immune system reacts to the vaccine. To look at the side effects, researchers will follow&#xD;
      children closely after vaccination. To look at immune system responses, researchers will test&#xD;
      the children's blood before and a number of times after vaccination. Participants will&#xD;
      include up to 130 healthy children ages 2-9 years. Participants will be assigned to receive&#xD;
      2, up to 3 doses of vaccine, or placebo (inactive substance). Subjects will receive at least&#xD;
      2 doses of vaccine approximately 28 days apart. If data shows an enhanced immune response&#xD;
      from a third vaccination, children will be offered a third dose of the vaccine. Participants&#xD;
      will be involved in study related procedures for up to 13 months, including up to 6 study&#xD;
      visits, plus a number of telephone calls.&#xD;

      The goals of this study are to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      45-microgram dosage level of monovalent subvirion influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine administered&#xD;
      by intramuscular (IM) route to healthy children. The primary goal of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if this dosage level of H5N1 will result in an acceptable proportion of children&#xD;
      achieving a potentially protective post vaccination antibody titer (provisionally assigned as&#xD;
      a serum neutralizing titer of 1:40, based on studies conducted in Hong Kong during the 1997&#xD;
      H5N1 outbreak). Approximately 130 healthy children, aged 2 through 9 years, will be enrolled&#xD;
      in this multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial to&#xD;
      receive at least 2 and up to 3 doses of an inactivated influenza A/H5N1 vaccine at a&#xD;
      45-microgram dose. One hundred subjects will be enrolled and randomly assigned into the&#xD;
      influenza A/H5N1 vaccine dose group and 20 subjects into the placebo group (in 5:1 ratio).&#xD;
      Subjects will be stratified into 2 age groups (2 to 5 years old and 6 to 9 years old).&#xD;
      Vaccine or placebo will be administered into the deltoid. Subjects randomized to receive&#xD;
      vaccine will receive 2 doses of the vaccine approximately 28 days apart. At approximately&#xD;
      month 5, subjects' parent(s) or guardian(s) will be called to remind them of the 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up visit. At the 6-month visit, subjects will be assessed for serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs) and the randomization assignment, ie, to vaccine or placebo, will be unmasked to the&#xD;
      subject and parent(s) or guardian(s). Should data evaluating a third dose of the influenza&#xD;
      A/H5N1 vaccine in adults show enhanced immunogenicity, parents or guardians of subjects who&#xD;
      received vaccine will be offered a third dose, with an additional blood draw immediately&#xD;
      prior to the third dose and 28 days and 6 months thereafter. The 6-month post-Dose 3 blood&#xD;
      draw is optional. For subjects assigned to placebo, the parents or guardians will be offered&#xD;
      the opportunity to enroll the subject into a separate open-label protocol if the 2 dose&#xD;
      regimen administered to the vaccine recipients is found to be safe and immunogenic. The&#xD;
      primary endpoints of the study include: adverse event (AE) and SAE information (solicited&#xD;
      in-clinic and via memory aids, concomitant medications, and periodic targeted physical&#xD;
      assessments, as indicated); proportion of subjects achieving a serum neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      titer of 1:40 against the influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 days after receipt of second dose of&#xD;
      vaccine (approximately Day 56); and geometric mean titer (GMT) and the frequency of 4-fold or&#xD;
      greater increases in hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody titers 28 days&#xD;
      after receipt of second dose of vaccine (approximately Day 56). The secondary endpoints of&#xD;
      the study include: proportion of subjects achieving a serum neutralizing antibody titer of&#xD;
      1:40 against the influenza A/H5N1 virus 1 and 6 months after receipt of first and third doses&#xD;
      (if third dose will be administered [see study design]) of vaccine; GMT and the frequency of&#xD;
      4-fold or greater increases in serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer 1 and 6&#xD;
      months after receipt of first and third (if third dose will be administered [see study&#xD;
      design]) doses of vaccine; and development of serum antibody responses against antigenically&#xD;
      drifted variants of influenza H5N1 virus. This study is linked to protocol 06-0072.&#xD;
