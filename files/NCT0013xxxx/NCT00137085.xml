  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the investigators at Queen's University, propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      feasibility trial comparing low-dose ketamine versus fentanyl as adjuncts to Emergency&#xD;
      Department procedural sedation with propofol. The outcomes of interest will be safety, with&#xD;
      respect to hemodynamic and respiratory adverse effects, as well as efficacy, with respect to&#xD;
      adequacy of sedation and analgesia, recovery profiles and patient/physician satisfaction. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis, based on a review of existing anesthesia literature, is that low-dose ketamine&#xD;
      may be a safer and more efficacious alternative to fentanyl when used as an adjunct to&#xD;
      propofol-assisted procedural sedation.&#xD;

      This initial, single-centre feasibility study will have the following specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of low-dose ketamine with fentanyl as adjunct to propofol-assisted emergency&#xD;
           department procedural sedation, with respect to safety and efficacy parameters;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pilot of a blinded emergency department sedation and analgesia protocol, including drug&#xD;
           doses, concealment techniques, and data collection tools, to determine the feasibility&#xD;
           of a subsequent larger, multi-centre trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the true incidence of the primary outcome measures in the study&#xD;
           population, using the study drug administration doses and protocol, such that an&#xD;
           accurate sample size may be estimated for a future, adequately-powered, multi-centre&#xD;
           trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validation of a newly-developed ordered, categorical rating scale for the reporting of&#xD;
           respiratory and hemodynamic adverse events occurring during emergency department&#xD;
           procedural sedation and analgesia.&#xD;
