  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe anaemia is a frequent cause of admission to hospitals in tropical Africa and about 10%&#xD;
      of such children die. In endemic countries, anaemia has multiple causes such as nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies, infections and haemoglobinopathies. However, Plasmodium falciparum infection is&#xD;
      believed to be the major contributory factor to the aetiology of severe anaemia. Severe&#xD;
      anaemia is usually treated by blood transfusion although transfusion carries the attendant&#xD;
      risk of transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Thus, there is a need to&#xD;
      explore novel strategies to reduce the incidence of severe anaemia in high-risk groups such&#xD;
      as children with suboptimal haemoglobin levels because these children are at increased risk&#xD;
      of developing severe anaemia if they develop a malaria infection before their haemoglobin&#xD;
      level has normalized. Therefore, it is proposed to study whether monthly chemoprophylaxis&#xD;
      with sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) given during malaria transmission season can protect&#xD;
      Gambian children from developing severe anaemia. After receiving treatment from the hospital,&#xD;
      1200 children admitted to the hospital with a haematocrit of less than 21% were randomised to&#xD;
      receive either monthly S/P or placebo during the rest of the malaria transmission season.&#xD;
      Morbidity was monitored throughout the rainy season. Study subjects were seen at the end of&#xD;
      the dry season to document morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effectiveness of monthly prophylaxis with S/P on haematological recovery&#xD;
           in children who have been treated for severe anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure compliance with the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether or not infection with chloroquine and S/P resistant strains&#xD;
           contributes to the pathogenesis of severe anaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was based at the 75-bed paediatric unit of The Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), which&#xD;
      is located in the capital, Banjul. This is the main referral hospital for the country. The&#xD;
      paediatric unit admits about 7000 children a year, of whom about 800 are anaemic (PCV &lt; 33%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of children:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects were recruited fom paediatric unit of RVH, MRC Hospital, and Brikama, Essau&#xD;
      and Sibanor Health Centres. Study subjects were enrolled by non-coercive methods if they&#xD;
      fulfil the inclusion criteria and had none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening process and enrolment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recruited on presentation to the ward. All children in the right age group who&#xD;
      presented to the ward had their haematocrit and blood film done by a project field worker.&#xD;
      Children with a PCV of less than 21% were offered assessment by a project doctor. If&#xD;
      assessment was permitted, and the patient fulfilled the entry criteria, then written consent&#xD;
      was sought from the parent/guardian. The study was explained in the parent's/ guardian's&#xD;
      preferred language, and written informed consent was obtained on approved forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On entry into the trial a detailed clinical history, drug history, family history and&#xD;
      information on bednet usage and impregnation was obtained. The study physician examined the&#xD;
      child, documented nutritional status and recorded the findings in a case report form. In&#xD;
      addition, a detailed address was obtained. Each study child was provided with a photo ID card&#xD;
      to facilitate identification at each contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 5-ml baseline blood sample was obtained for determination of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hb, red cell indices, white cell and platelet count (Coulter counter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reticulocyte count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of iron status (serum iron and ferritin) (first 100 children)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sickling test and, if positive, haemoglobin electrophoresis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool examination for hookworm and other parasites (first 100 children)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other investigations such as chest x-ray and urine examinations were carried out as&#xD;
      clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During admission, children with malaria were treated with IM quinine or chloroquine plus S/P&#xD;
      as clinically indicated. Children with a PCV &lt; 15% and those with signs of respiratory&#xD;
      distress and/or a 'gallop' rhythm were transfused. In addition, all patients received iron&#xD;
      for 28 days, treatment starting at the time of their discharge from hospital. Patients were&#xD;
      treated for other conditions as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment was given as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      S/P (tablets containing 500 mg sulfadoxine/ 25 mg pyrimethamine) at an approximate dose of&#xD;
      1.25 mg pyrimethamine/25 mg sulphadoxine per kg stat dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral chloroquine: 10mg daily for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S/c chloroquine: 5mg/kg 6 hourly x 7 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IM Quinine: 20 mg/kg loading dose, then 10 mg/kg 12 hourly for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron was given as syrup at a target dose of 2 mg/kg elemental iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of resistance to chloroquine and antifolates :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether or not infection with chloroquine or S/P resistant parasites&#xD;
      contributes to the pathogenesis of severe anaemia in Gambian children, filter paper blood&#xD;
      samples were collected from the first 100 children entered into the study who have&#xD;
      P.falciparum parasitaemia and an equal number of aged matched children who attended the OPD&#xD;
      clinic with uncomplicated symptomatic malaria. Nested PCR on extracted DNA was used to tested&#xD;
      for mutation in genes associated with resistance; Pfcrt and Pfmdr for chloroquine and DHRF /&#xD;
      DHPS genes for S/P using standard techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects were individually randomised into either the S/P or the placebo group in a 1:1&#xD;
      fashion at the time of discharge from hospital, although chemoprophylaxis was not be started&#xD;
      for another week as the children are likely to have received antimalarials whilst in&#xD;
      hospital. Randomisation was in blocks. Block size were selected to enhance blinding and&#xD;
      maintain balance in the treatment allocation ratio as recruitment progresses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as possible after discharge from hospital, patients were visited at home by a project&#xD;
      field worker to collect information on social economic and environmental risk factors that&#xD;
      may predisposes an individual child to develop severe anaemia. A housing survey was conducted&#xD;
      during this visit to determine possible risk factors for malaria which might act as&#xD;
      confounders in determination of the primary trial end-point. Field workers interviewed the&#xD;
      parents/guardians of study subject to record characteristics about the house that might&#xD;
      influence mosquito biting behaviour. These items included building material, an evaluation of&#xD;
      the presence of eaves, impregnation and condition of bed nets. During the visit, parents were&#xD;
      encouraged to protect the study child with a bed net.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First OPD visit after discharge from hospital One week after discharge, study subjects&#xD;
      enrolled in the study were asked to return to the OPD clinic for routine assessment. At this&#xD;
      visit a fingerprick blood sample was collected for PCV measurement and thick blood film for&#xD;
      malaria parasite. The first dose of trial medication was given during this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      S/P and matching placebo (identical shape and size) were stored in 8 boxes labelled 1 to 8 (4&#xD;
      for S/P tablets and 4 for placebo). The randomisation code were kept in sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes by the local safety monitor who alone will knew the code, which associated each&#xD;
      treatment group with either S/P or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuation of chemoprophylaxis in the health centre:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects received their monthly chemoprophylaxis at their local health centre under&#xD;
      direct supervision by staff of the health centre identified by the health centre and trained&#xD;
      to take this important role in the study. Health centre staff were provided with a list&#xD;
      containing the study number, photographs and randomisation group of each study subject. Study&#xD;
      subjects were observed for 30 minutes after dosing and if vomiting occurs within 30 minutes,&#xD;
      the dose was repeated. S/P (tablets containing 500 mg sulfadoxine/ 25 mg pyrimethamine) will&#xD;
      be given at an approximate dose of 1.25 mg pyrimethamine/25 mg sulphadoxine per kg. Enrolment&#xD;
      of patients started in July and surveillance continued until end of malaria transmission&#xD;
      season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity surveillance during the rainy season:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects were followed throughout the rainy season. Mothers/guardians were encouraged&#xD;
      to take their child to the RVH OPD clinic or the health centre identified as being closest to&#xD;
      their home at any time after discharge if the child became unwell. Project staff were based&#xD;
      at each of these health centres, initially to identify children in the trial and to ensure&#xD;
      that they were seen, properly investigated and treated promptly by health centre staff. At&#xD;
      each visit axillary temperature was recorded using a digital thermometer. A dipstick for&#xD;
      diagnosis of malaria was used to guide treatment if fever (axillary temperature of &gt; 37.5°C)&#xD;
      or history of fever within the previous 48 hours is present. In addition, a thick blood smear&#xD;
      for malaria parasites was collected for subsequent confirmation of the diagnosis. Filter&#xD;
      paper sample to test for S/P resistance were collected from all malaria cases detected during&#xD;
      morbidity surveillance. Study subjects with documented fever (axillary temperature of &gt;&#xD;
      37.5°C) or history of recent fever and malaria parasitaemia were treated with S/P and&#xD;
      chloroquine. The treatment of study subjects seen at the health centres was the carried out&#xD;
      by health centre staff in accordance with national guidelines. Study patients who needed&#xD;
      admission were referred to RVH paediatric unit or the MRC ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of malaria transmission season cross-sectional survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children enrolled in the study were seen at the OPD clinic at the end of malaria transmission&#xD;
      season for examination by a study physician and a finger-prick blood sample was obtained for&#xD;
      preparation of thick blood smear and determination of haematocrit. A standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire was administered to the parents/guardians of the study subject, to collect&#xD;
      information regarding illness that had occurred since the last visit, symptoms experienced,&#xD;
      use of healthcare facilities and use of medicines. Information on the use of bednets was&#xD;
      collected again at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry season follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the dry season study subjects visited once. During this visit, a questionnaire&#xD;
      was administered to document morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an attack rate of 0.1 episodes of clinical malaria (as defined for the primary&#xD;
      end-point) per month in children in the control group (a figure based on previous surveys&#xD;
      from The Gambia) and a drop out rate during follow up of 15%, 131 episodes was expected in&#xD;
      children in the control group followed until the end of one malaria transmission season.&#xD;
      Thus, with a total of 1200 children recruited to the trial, the study will have an 80% power&#xD;
      to detect at 5% level of significance a 32% reduction in incidence of clinical attacks of&#xD;
      malaria in children who receive chemoprophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies in The Gambia indicate that about 20% of children under 5 years of age have&#xD;
      a PCV of &lt; 20% at the end of the malaria transmission season. With 1200 children enrolled,&#xD;
      this trial will have a 80% power to detect a 34% reduction in the prevalence of anaemia of&#xD;
      this degree of severity.&#xD;
