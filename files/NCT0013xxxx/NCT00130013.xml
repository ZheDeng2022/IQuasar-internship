      The World Health Organization's (WHO) standard case management strategy for reducing acute&#xD;
      respiratory infection (ARI) related mortality recommends oral cotrimoxazole and oral&#xD;
      amoxicillin as first line drugs for the treatment of pneumonia. In 1989, the Pakistan&#xD;
      Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted this strategy to control ARI mortality and recommended&#xD;
      cotrimoxazole for treatment of outpatients pneumonia due to lower costs. A number of studies&#xD;
      subsequently performed have shown significant in vivo and in vitro resistance of H.&#xD;
      influenzae and S. pneumoniae, the commonest bacteria causing childhood pneumonia, to&#xD;
      cotrimoxazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although on a case by case basis for pneumonia, in vitro resistance does not correlate very&#xD;
      well with in vivo failures, nevertheless, clinical failure rate for pneumonia therapy has&#xD;
      increased in Pakistan over the years. One can hypothesize that if bacterial pneumonia is a&#xD;
      certain proportion of all pneumonia cases, the rise in clinical failures may be related to&#xD;
      increasing antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, it is probable that this rising clinical&#xD;
      failure rate could be a reflection of increasing resistance. There may be an increase in&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to amoxicillin over the period of&#xD;
      years and the rising treatment failure could be a reflection of the rising minimum inhibitory&#xD;
      concentrations (MIC's) (&gt; 2 mcg/ml for H. influenzae, 1993-94), thereby, resulting in this&#xD;
      increasing failure rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the current study the researchers propose a multicentre, randomized, controlled double&#xD;
      blind trial in which standard versus double dose oral amoxicillin for three days for the&#xD;
      treatment of non-severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the proportion of children 2 - 59 months of age presenting with non-severe&#xD;
      pneumonia, who achieve clinical resolution on day 5 with standard (15 mg/kg/8hrly) versus&#xD;
      double dose (30 mg/kg/8hrly) of oral amoxicillin therapy given for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow the clinical course of non-severe pneumonia with the alternative criteria of&#xD;
      treatment failure (signs of deterioration i.e. lower chest indrawing and appearance of danger&#xD;
      signs) on or before day 3 and compare them with other children who have persistent fast&#xD;
      breathing (respiratory rate above the cut off for age) on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy outcome with double dose of oral amoxicillin is not different than the standard dose&#xD;
      of amoxicillin, when used for three days for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia in 2-59&#xD;
      months old children.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization's (WHO) standard case management strategy for reducing ARI related&#xD;
      mortality recommends oral cotrimoxazole and oral amoxicillin as first line drugs for the&#xD;
      treatment of pneumonia. In 1989, the Pakistan Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted this strategy&#xD;
      to control ARI mortality and recommended cotrimoxazole for treatment of outpatients pneumonia&#xD;
      due to lower costs. A number of studies subsequently performed have shown significant in vivo&#xD;
      and in vitro resistance of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, the commonest bacteria causing&#xD;
      childhood pneumonia, to cotrimoxazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This increase in clinical failure with oral cotrimoxazole has put a lot of pressure both at&#xD;
      national and international forums on the National ARI Control Programme of Pakistan to change&#xD;
      its recommendations from cotrimoxazole to amoxicillin as the first line of therapy. Besides&#xD;
      being efficacious for non-severe pneumonia amoxicillin has shown good efficacy in children&#xD;
      with severe pneumonia and bacteremic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although on a case by case basis for pneumonia, in vitro resistance does not correlate very&#xD;
      well with in vivo failures, one can hypothesize that if bacterial pneumonia is a certain&#xD;
      proportion of all pneumonia cases, the rise in clinical failures may be related to increasing&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to amoxicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is felt that WHO criteria for treatment failure are too stringent. Improvement is defined&#xD;
      as the return of respiratory rate to below the cut off for that particular age at 48 hours.&#xD;
      Some of the children with viral pneumonia will continue to have respiratory rate above the&#xD;
      cut off on the first follow-up. These children are otherwise well and show no signs of&#xD;
      deterioration of the disease but according to WHO criteria they would be classified as&#xD;
      treatment failure. The treatment failure rates hence are influenced by the definitions used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing data shows that if the dose of amoxicillin is increased to achieve higher MICs,&#xD;
      then the eradication of causative organism tend to be much more complete. As yet, no clinical&#xD;
      trial has been conducted to address this important question in the treatment of childhood&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers propose a multicentre, randomized, controlled double blind trial in which&#xD;
      standard versus double dose oral amoxicillin for three days for the treatment of non-severe&#xD;
      pneumonia in children less than five years of age will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To compare the proportion of children 2 - 59 months of age presenting with non-severe&#xD;
      pneumonia, who achieve clinical resolution on day 5 with standard (15 mg/kg/8hrly) versus&#xD;
      double dose (30 mg/kg/8hrly) of oral amoxicillin therapy given for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow the clinical course of non-severe pneumonia with the alternative criteria of&#xD;
      treatment failure (signs of deterioration i.e. lower chest indrawing and appearance of danger&#xD;
      signs) on or before day 3 and compare them with other children who have persistent fast&#xD;
      breathing (respiratory rate above the cut off for age) on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy outcome with double dose of oral amoxicillin is not different than the standard dose&#xD;
      of amoxicillin, when used for three days for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia in 2-59&#xD;
      months old children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION AND SITE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be recruited from those coming to outpatient departments (OPD) in large tertiary&#xD;
      care hospitals in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study will be explained to parents and oral informed consent to&#xD;
      participate obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Workup:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest radiographs will be taken for all enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, double blind, multi-centre trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARI is defined according to the WHO ARI Programme guidelines 2 for children who have either a&#xD;
      cough or difficult breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical resolution is defined as return of respiratory rate to normal (no pneumonia)&#xD;
      according to WHO ARI standard case management classification 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Failure is defined as development of chest indrawing; or any other danger sign; or&#xD;
      persistence of fast breathing at day 5 follow-up or thereafter leading to therapy change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved will be defined as slower respiratory rate (either back to normal range for age, or&#xD;
      lower by more than 5 compared to previous evaluation), feeding better according to mother and&#xD;
      lower body temperature than previous assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same will be defined as still breathing fast (respiratory rate Â± 5 breaths/minute compared to&#xD;
      previous evaluation or higher than that), with no chest indrawing and or danger sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worse will be defined as development of lower chest indrawing or any danger sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relapse is defined as development of recurrence signs of pneumonia till day 14 after fast&#xD;
      breathing has disappeared initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will be followed-up on day 3, 5 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping in mind the overall treatment failure rate of 20.9% with amoxicillin from the MASCOT&#xD;
      study (1999 - 2001), it is expected that the proportion of patients who will fail to respond&#xD;
      with standard dose amoxicillin will be around 21.0%.7 In order for double dose to be more&#xD;
      efficacious there should be a difference of more than 5% in the treatment success rate as&#xD;
      compared to the standard dose. The researchers assume that the failure rate will not be more&#xD;
      than 13% with double dose amoxicillin. By using the power of 80% and the confidence interval&#xD;
      of 95%, the estimated sample size comes to 369 for each group. Assuming the loss to follow up&#xD;
      to be 15% (as it is an out patient study and having day 14 follow-up) the estimated sample&#xD;
      size will be 425 patients in each group, a total of 850 patients. Thus 900 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in one and a half ARI season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE REACTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics such as amoxicillin are generally well tolerated and are rarely associated with&#xD;
      serious or life threatening adverse reactions (possibly or probably related to drug therapy).&#xD;
      The most common side effects reported include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic - skin rash, hives, itching or wheezing Digestive - nausea, vomiting, diarrhea&#xD;
      Metabolic - moderate or transient increase in liver function tests - transaminases&#xD;
      Hematological - anemia, leucopenia and irreversible thrombocytopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rare side effects include anaphylactic shock, Stevens- Johnson syndrome and pseudomembranous&#xD;
      colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying, managing and reporting adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site investigator will carefully monitor each child for adverse events. If an adverse&#xD;
      event occurs, the site investigator will assess its duration, seriousness, intensity and&#xD;
      relationship to the duration of study medication (amoxicillin). The principal investigator&#xD;
      will use their judgement about whether to continue the child in the study or to discontinue&#xD;
      enrollment. The event and its treatment will be noted on appropriate CRFs and reported to the&#xD;
      DSMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ENTRY AND ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data forms will all be filled on auto copy forms and will be reviewed by the site&#xD;
      co-ordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered using Epi Info 6 and will be entered twice by two separate operators and&#xD;
      both data bases will be validated using Epi Info 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical resolution is defined as return of respiratory rate to normal (no pneumonia) on&#xD;
      day 5, according to WHO ARI standard case management classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical/treatment Failure is defined as development of chest indrawing; or any other danger&#xD;
      sign; or persistence of fast breathing at day 5 follow-up or thereafter leading to therapy&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be carried out on intention to treat basis. For primary outcome proportion of&#xD;
      therapy failures and their 95% CI will be calculated for both the two regimens. Then the&#xD;
      researchers will compare proportion of therapy failure using alternative criteria and WHO&#xD;
      defined conventional therapy failure criteria.&#xD;
