  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients must receive vinorelbine plus capecitabine, with or without trastuzumab,&#xD;
      until disease progression or unbearable toxicity. Cycles will be administered every 3&#xD;
      weeks.Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status must be locally assessed by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC). All 3+ patients are eligible. In 2+ patients, HER2 status must be&#xD;
      confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Principal outcome is clinical benefit (complete + partial responses + stable disease). Sample&#xD;
      size in each arm has been estimated with the Fleming method. Previous data show a clinical&#xD;
      benefit rate of vinorelbine plus capecitabine around 50%. The researchers assume trastuzumab&#xD;
      can increase it by 20%. With an alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power, 37 patients per arm are&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised phase II trial. With a minimum expected benefit rate of 50%, at least 36&#xD;
      patients are needed to choose, with a 90% of probability to be right, the best treatment arm,&#xD;
      providing it increases benefit rate at least by 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, the total number of patients needed is 82, 41 per treatment&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified as per investigational site, and presence of visceral metastatic&#xD;
      lesion (liver, lung, pleura, heart, peritoneum, suprarenal glands). All patients must receive&#xD;
      2 cycles. If no disease progression is detected, treatment must continue until progression or&#xD;
      unbearable toxicity.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical benefit rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate is defined as the rate of objective responses (complete responses and partial responses to treatment) and stabilizations, with a minimum duration of 24 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor assessments will be performed until disease progression in order to evaluate the TTP. TTP is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease. For patients not known to have objectively-determined progressive disease, TTP will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free assessment. For patients who receive subsequent systemic anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to objective disease progression, TTP will be censored at the date of last objective progression-free assessment prior to the initiation of postdiscontinuation systemic anticancer therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response will be assessed using RECIST criteria. The best response across all treatment will be recorded. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete or partial response out of the patients who had measurable disease at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Duration (RD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>RD is defined as the time from the date when the measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever status is recorded first) until the date of first observation of disease progression or death occurred. For responding patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who do not have progression, duration of response will be censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment. For responding patients who receive subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to progression, duration of response will be censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>All AE suffered by patients will be recorded and graduated by the NCI CTCAE v1.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time elapsed from first treatment until death from any cause.</description>
