      This community based participatory research study involves multicomponent educational&#xD;
      interventions. Telephone interviews and focus groups of persons who are residents of the High&#xD;
      Plains region of Colorado will be conducted. A card study will also be carried out to collect&#xD;
      limited data about colorectal cancer screening in primary care practices. The multicomponent&#xD;
      intervention approaches (e.g., small media and group education) consist of educational&#xD;
      materials about routine colorectal cancer screening.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using community-based participatory research (CBPR), incorporate an existing Community&#xD;
           Advisory Council into a project-specific Joint Planning Committee to provide community&#xD;
           voices and be experts for a project to design strategies to improve CRC screening of all&#xD;
           adults over the age of 50 in the High Plains community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work with the Joint Planning Committee to develop an acceptable and respectful message&#xD;
           and dissemination plan to change the community perception concerning colorectal cancer&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct a random digit dialing survey of rural eastern Colorado to determine rates of&#xD;
           individuals up to date on CRC screening and to determine current knowledge level of&#xD;
           individuals over 50 concerning the need for CRC screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deliver the screening message(s) through the methods suggested by the Joint Planning&#xD;
           Committee in two High Plains communities and solicit community members' reactions to the&#xD;
           message(s) and dissemination approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention Communities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nine rural counties within northeast Colorado that make up the High Plains communities&#xD;
      encompass 15,000-square-miles. The economy is largely agricultural, with a population of&#xD;
      approximately 90,000. Based on the 2000 census 22% (range 20-29%) of the population is over&#xD;
      50, which is higher than the state as a whole (20%) or the Denver Metropolitan Statistical&#xD;
      Area - MSA (18%). There is not a single MSA in the High Plains region and most of the region&#xD;
      is a frontier area and therefore considered an underserved community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Communities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also utilize the 8 county region in southeastern Colorado as our control communities&#xD;
      for the intervention evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Care Offices:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted within the community detailed above. The intervention will be at&#xD;
      the population level. Evaluation of the intervention will include surveys of providers and&#xD;
      patients within the primary care offices in the High Plains Region (these offices are part of&#xD;
      the High Plains Research Network [HPRN]) and piloting the intervention will occur in the&#xD;
      primary care practices that are part of the Colorado Research Network (CaReNet). Both CaReNet&#xD;
      and HPRN are practice based research networks (PBRNs) affiliated with the Department of&#xD;
      Family Medicine at the University of Colorado.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Aims (Overview):&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will combine three different proven research approaches to develop and study a&#xD;
      community-based intervention to improve CRC screening rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Component 1: Intervention Planning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a community-based participatory research model, the Joint Planning Committee (JPC)&#xD;
           composed of members of an established Community Advisory Council for a practice-based&#xD;
           research network and other community members, we will explore and define the messages&#xD;
           and the delivery approaches the community members feel are most likely to result in&#xD;
           actual behavioral change.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Component 2: Assessment of Intervention Effectiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a random digit dialing telephone survey, pre and post provider/patient card study&#xD;
           and a provider survey, we will assess the impact of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Component 3: Evaluation of Intervention Process and Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance)&#xD;
           framework12, we will guide our evaluation of both the community-based participatory&#xD;
           research process and the effects of the intervention developed.&#xD;
