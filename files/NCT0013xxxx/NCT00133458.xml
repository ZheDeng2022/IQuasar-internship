      This study will enroll 120 individuals diagnosed with subarachnoid cysticercosis, a disease&#xD;
      caused by the invasion of the basal part of your brain by a parasite named Taenia solium.&#xD;
      Subarachnoid cysticercosis is usually treated with albendazole for one month to kill the&#xD;
      parasite. This study will determine if two months of albendazole (ABZ) therapy is better than&#xD;
      one-month. The study will last 3 years.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double blind comparison of two lengths of albendazole thereapy for&#xD;
      subarachnoid cysticercosis. It will enroll 120 individuals, male and female age 18 to 65, and&#xD;
      diagnosed with subarachnoid cysticercosis, a disease caused by the invasion of the basal part&#xD;
      of your brain by a parasite named Taenia solium. Subarachnoid cysticercosis is usually&#xD;
      treated with albendazole for one month to kill the parasite. This study will determine if two&#xD;
      months of albendazole (ABZ) therapy is better than one-month. The study will last 3 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female individuals between 18-65 year of age with a diagnosis of basal&#xD;
             subarachnoid cysticercosis, based on MRI and confirmed by serological test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to accomplish the two weeks minimal hospitalization required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female of child-bearing potential willing to use an adequate method of contraception&#xD;
             including implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, effective intrauterine&#xD;
             devices, sexual abstinence, or vasectomized partner while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with normal laboratory values for hemoglobin, platelet counts, total white&#xD;
             blood cells, glucose, creatinine, bilirubin, ALT, AST, and electrolytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative fecal exam for Taenia eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous therapy with albendazole (does not include patients who received single-dose&#xD;
             400 mg ABZ for intestinal parasites), or praziquantel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary tuberculosis evidenced by a positive chest X-ray and positive sputum smears.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic disease other than NCC that may affect therapy or short-term prognosis,&#xD;
             including but not limited to chronic renal failure, hepatic insufficiency, cardiac&#xD;
             failure, and steroid-dependent immune diseases. Identification of systemic diseases&#xD;
             will be left to the discretion of each Site PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in unstable condition or with severe intracranial hypertension (ICH).&#xD;
             Definition of severe ICH for this study would be the presence of headaches, nausea,&#xD;
             and vomiting and papilledema at fundoscopic examination (all of them). Patients in&#xD;
             this category can be considered for entrance into the study only after treatment of&#xD;
             ICH by ventricle-peritoneal shunting. Patients with CT findings compatible with&#xD;
             intracranial hypertension will have neurosurgical evaluation (by non study personal)&#xD;
             before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to albendazole&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with praziquantel, cimetidine or teophylline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;
