  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of omalizumab in patients with&#xD;
      poorly controlled asthma (because of poor adherence) will decrease allergic airway&#xD;
      inflammation and improve asthma control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma who are poorly adherent to inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids (ICS) have persistent airway inflammation that results in excessive morbidity&#xD;
      and sometimes death. Omalizumab (OMB), an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody decreases the release&#xD;
      of mediators from mast cells, reduces the frequency of exacerbations and allows a reduction&#xD;
      in ICS dose. However, there are no data on the effects of OMB on airway inflammation.&#xD;
      Bronchoprovocation with adenosine 5' monophosphate (AMP) is a robust and sensitive&#xD;
      non-invasive measure of allergic airway inflammation, but the effect of OMB on this surrogate&#xD;
      marker has not been previously reported. Based upon the mechanisms of actions of OMB and AMP&#xD;
      and the fact that OMB will be administered at 2-4 week intervals in the clinic (i.e., direct&#xD;
      observed therapy), it is our hypothesis that treatment with this new agent will reduce airway&#xD;
      responsiveness to AMP and compensate for poor adherence to ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we will select 16 patients (6-26 yrs) with a total IgE of 30-1300&#xD;
      IU/ml, sensitivity to at least one allergen, an FEV1 ≥ 60% predicted, and documented poor&#xD;
      adherence to ICS with inadequate asthma control. Subjects will be randomized to receive OMB&#xD;
      (150-375 mg subcutaneously) or placebo every 2-4 weeks for four months each, in a&#xD;
      double-blind, crossover manner with a 3 month washout period between treatments. Spirometry&#xD;
      will be measured before each injection and at the end of each treatment period. The&#xD;
      concentration of AMP that will provoke a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20 FEV1) and a free IgE&#xD;
      serum concentration will be measured before and at the end of each treatment period. After&#xD;
      randomization, a 5-day course of oral prednisone will be administered whenever&#xD;
      bronchodilator-unresponsive symptoms persist or FEV1 is &lt; 60% predicted. ANOVA for repeated&#xD;
      measures will be used to evaluate differences between treatments in Δ PC20 (primary endpoint)&#xD;
      and Δ FEV1, while the Friedman Statistic will be used to evaluate differences in the number&#xD;
      of short courses of prednisone. The results of this study will provide new information on the&#xD;
      extent to which OMB decreases airway responsiveness to AMP (i.e. allergic airway&#xD;
      inflammation) and whether this new therapy will fill an unmet need for patients who have&#xD;
      inadequately controlled asthma because of poor adherence to inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
