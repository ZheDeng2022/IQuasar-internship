    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of and the body's response to an&#xD;
      experimental cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (called gB/MF59 vaccine). Participants will&#xD;
      include approximately 400 healthy females, ages 12-17, recruited from adolescent clinics at&#xD;
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Baylor&#xD;
      College of Medicine, University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, and the University&#xD;
      of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Participants will receive 3 doses of vaccine or placebo&#xD;
      (saltwater) on a 0, 1, and 6 month schedule. Study procedures will include blood and urine&#xD;
      samples. Participants will complete a diary recording temperatures and any side effects&#xD;
      experienced. Subjects will be involved in study related procedures for up to 31 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study to assess the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B (gB)/MF59 vaccine in preventing systemic&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) in healthy adolescent females. The study interventions&#xD;
      include: intramuscular (IM) injection of the investigational vaccine, CMV gB)/microfluidized&#xD;
      adjuvant 59 (MF59), delivered as 20 micrograms in 0.5 mL of vaccine or IM injection of 0.5 mL&#xD;
      of saline placebo. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive vaccine or saline placebo.&#xD;
      The primary efficacy objective is to assess whether injection with 3 doses of the CMV gB/MF59&#xD;
      vaccine will reduce the acquisition of a systemic CMV infection in healthy CMV-seronegative&#xD;
      adolescent females. This will be accomplished by comparing the rates of acquisition of&#xD;
      systemic CMV infection, defined as detection of CMV in the urine or blood, between the&#xD;
      placebo and CMV vaccine recipients beginning 1 month after the third dose of vaccine. The&#xD;
      primary safety objective is to assess the local and systemic effects of immunization and&#xD;
      adverse events (AE) with the CMV gB/MF59 vaccine when administered to female adolescents on a&#xD;
      0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. This will be assessed by comparing the rates of specific local&#xD;
      and systemic reactogenicity events and AEs between the vaccine and placebo groups. The&#xD;
      endpoint for this trial will be a systemic infection, which will be defined as identification&#xD;
      of CMV from the urine (chosen because it is the most common site for isolation of CMV) or&#xD;
      blood (chosen because it is the most likely route by which CMV reaches the fetus).&#xD;
      Approximately 2400 healthy females, age 12 to 17 years (at time of initial enrollment) will&#xD;
      be recruited in order to obtain approximately 400 CMV-seronegative subjects for the vaccine&#xD;
      trial. Collection of sera will occur at Screening, Study Day 0, Month 6, Month 7 and every 3&#xD;
      months after Month 7. Collection of urine will occur at Study Day 0, Month 1, Month 2, Month&#xD;
      6, Month 7 and every 3 months after Month 7. Safety/reactogenicity monitoring will consist of&#xD;
      solicited signs and symptoms self-reported by memory aid on the day of vaccination and for 6&#xD;
      follow-up days. Unsolicited symptoms will be collected for the 30-day period (± 2 days) after&#xD;
      each vaccination and followed to adequate resolution or stabilization. The study duration for&#xD;
      each subject will be 31 months: 7 months on the study with 24 months of follow-up beginning 1&#xD;
      month after the last injection. There will be 14 scheduled visits. This study is linked to&#xD;
      DMID protocol 06-0043.&#xD;
