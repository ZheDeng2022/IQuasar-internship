      ALGRX 4975 or placebo will be dripped onto the cut muscles and soft tissues before the end of&#xD;
      surgery for total replacement of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo a screening visit; a hospitalization, during which total&#xD;
      replacement of the knee will be performed; and follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery. In addition, once discharged, subjects will be contacted by telephone daily up to&#xD;
      Day 14. Subjects will complete pain and medication diaries during the first 2 weeks following&#xD;
      surgery and will return these diaries at the 2 week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on the afternoon of Day 0 (the day of surgery), pain on active range of motion (ROM)&#xD;
      of the operated knee will be measured each morning at 8 AM ± 2 hours and each afternoon at 3&#xD;
      PM ± 3 hours. In addition, if the subject ambulates, pain with ambulation will be measured&#xD;
      during the first ambulation in the morning and during the first ambulation after noon.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) preoperatively, and at&#xD;
      the 2, 6, and 12 week visits. Subjects will be questioned regarding the use of assistive&#xD;
      devices (cane, walker, wheelchair, bedside commode, or other assistive devices) at screening,&#xD;
      at discharge, and at the 2, 6, and 12 week visits. The active ROM on flexion of the knee,&#xD;
      measured using a goniometer, will be recorded at screening and at the 2 week visit. Sensory&#xD;
      mapping of the knee will be performed at screening and at the 12 week visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study conducted in&#xD;
      subjects undergoing unilateral TKA. Subjects will undergo a screening visit up to 28 days&#xD;
      prior to surgery. A sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 40&#xD;
      evaluable subjects. Upon enrollment, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio of ALGRX 4975&#xD;
      to placebo. Subjects will receive a femoral nerve block prior to induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Subjects will undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Prior to closure of the surgical wound, a single dose of ALGRX 4975 5 mg in 60 mL or placebo&#xD;
      will be instilled (dripped by syringe over approximately 1 minute) into the wound onto the&#xD;
      cut muscles and soft tissues and allowed to dwell for 5 minutes. The Investigator will then&#xD;
      inject bupivacaine 0.25% up to 40 mL into the area of the wound and cut muscles and close the&#xD;
      wound by usual surgical procedures. Postoperative pain will be managed by morphine sulfate&#xD;
      administered intravenously by patient controlled analgesia (PCA). Following discontinuation&#xD;
      of the PCA pump, subjects will be provided with hydrocodone 7.5 mg/acetaminophen 500 mg for&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo a screening visit; a hospitalization, during which TKA will be&#xD;
      performed; and follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after surgery. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      twice daily examinations while hospitalized for the TKA procedure. In addition, once&#xD;
      discharged, subjects will be contacted by telephone daily up to Day 14, to remind them to&#xD;
      complete pain and medication diaries, and then again at 4 weeks after surgery for follow-up.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete pain and medication diaries during the first 2 weeks following surgery&#xD;
      and will return these diaries at the 2 week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on the afternoon of Day 0 (the day of surgery), pain on active range of motion (ROM)&#xD;
      of the operated knee will be measured using an 11 point numerical rating scale (NRS) each&#xD;
      morning at 8 AM ± 2 hours and each afternoon at 3 PM ± 3 hours, not within one hour after&#xD;
      physical therapy. In addition, if the subject ambulates, pain with ambulation will be&#xD;
      measured during the first ambulation in the morning and during the first ambulation after&#xD;
      noon. Subjects will complete the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) preoperatively,&#xD;
      and at the 2, 6, and 12 week visits. Subjects will be questioned regarding the use of&#xD;
      assistive devices (cane, walker, wheelchair, bedside commode, or other assistive devices) at&#xD;
      screening, at discharge, and at the 2, 6, and 12 week visits. The active ROM on flexion of&#xD;
      the knee, measured using a goniometer, will be recorded at screening and at the 2 week visit.&#xD;
      Sensory mapping of the knee will be performed at screening and at the 12 week visit.&#xD;
