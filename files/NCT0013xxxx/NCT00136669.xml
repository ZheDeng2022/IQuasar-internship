  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common problem in patients with pancreatic cancer. Some patients suffer from pain&#xD;
      despite medication. We, the researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, are&#xD;
      conducting a Phase III study to determine the effects of acupuncture on pain in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. The purpose of a Phase III study is to determine whether or not a&#xD;
      treatment is helpful. This study will include about 60 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture is the insertion of very fine needles into the skin to treat symptoms. In recent&#xD;
      years, researchers have found evidence that acupuncture is useful in treating a variety of&#xD;
      conditions, including headache, nausea, and pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this pancreatic cancer pain trial is to determine the effects of a single,&#xD;
      practitioner-given acupuncture treatment followed by semi-permanent acupuncture studs. Our&#xD;
      primary endpoint is subjective; therefore, a placebo control will be applied with patients&#xD;
      blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, acupuncturists individualize treatment: two patients with a similar&#xD;
      conventional diagnosis may receive different point prescriptions depending on the acupuncture&#xD;
      differential diagnosis. Randomized trials of acupuncture can either prescribe a fixed&#xD;
      treatment formula in terms of the number of sessions and points to be used, or allow&#xD;
      practitioners to exercise clinical judgment in individualizing care. There has been&#xD;
      considerable debate in the methodological literature about the merits of each approach. The&#xD;
      use of a fixed treatment schedule increases the reproducibility of the findings but is said,&#xD;
      by practitioners, to generally reduce treatment effectiveness. In this trial, we have&#xD;
      developed an approach that allows practitioners to individualize treatments in a manner that&#xD;
      allows exact replication, by specifying particular point locations to be used depending on&#xD;
      the sites where a patient experiences pain. Point locations for this and for all of our&#xD;
      acupuncture studies are determined by our licensed, credentialled acupuncturists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following accrual of the initial 10-15 patients, we will review treatment compliance,&#xD;
      blinding and accrual. Adjustments will be made to deal with compliance issues, to facilitate&#xD;
      placebo blinding, or deal with recruitment problems for the remainder of the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First baseline current pain score of 3 or above on a 0 - 10 numerical rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the treating physician or a medically qualified investigator, the&#xD;
             patient's pain syndrome is the result of underlying cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient OR caregiver must be willing and able to apply pressure to each point using&#xD;
             small circular movements with the fingers twice per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary cause of pain is procedural (e.g. postoperative pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acupuncture treatment in the past six weeks. Patients should not receive acupuncture&#xD;
             during the one week period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neutropenia defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1000/microliter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac conditions constituting high or moderate risk of endocarditis as defined by&#xD;
             the American Heart Association criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient contraindicated for phlebotomy, as phlebotomy needles are much larger than&#xD;
             acupuncture needles.&#xD;
