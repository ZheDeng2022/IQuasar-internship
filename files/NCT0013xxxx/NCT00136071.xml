  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine) is an extremely common, distressing and&#xD;
      socially disabling condition. It is known to affect up to 14 % of the adult female population&#xD;
      in the United Kingdom. Sufferers tend to become social recluses, not wanting to socialise for&#xD;
      fear of embarrassment and ridicule. It typically takes up to 5 years from the onset of&#xD;
      symptoms for a patient to admit their problem, seek help and reach a specialist.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it is commonest in the elderly when the incidence is as high as 50% in some&#xD;
      studies. Furthermore, this group of patients are the least likely to seek help, the least&#xD;
      likely to receive help and up until recently the least likely to be cured of their problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Things are improving however, as everyone is more prepared to talk about this awful condition&#xD;
      rather than accept it as a part of growing old. Furthermore, better treatments are becoming&#xD;
      available which can help the old as well as the young.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two years ago a new operation for urinary leakage was launched in the United Kingdom (UK).&#xD;
      This is a smaller operation than those previously available and more suitable for the frail&#xD;
      and elderly. We, the researchers at South Glasgow University Hospital, have been using this&#xD;
      operation for 18 months with good success. Several versions however are now on the market,&#xD;
      some much more expensive than the original, and perhaps not as good. We need to know which&#xD;
      one is best and hence we intend to do a study to find out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to select patients with leakage to have one or the other operation and to follow the&#xD;
      patients over several years to find out which operation is best, safest, lasts longest and is&#xD;
      most acceptable to patients. Only then will we know which of the versions of this procedure&#xD;
      we should be offering our patients.&#xD;

      Randomised trial comparing TVT-O &amp; TOT in surgical management of USI (Urodynamic Stress&#xD;
      Incontinence):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To compare two transobturator tension free vaginal tape procedures; TVT-O Gynecare vs.&#xD;
      TOT mentor for management of USI. This study will compare the surgical approach &amp; tape&#xD;
      material in both procedures [In-Out (TVT-O) Vs. the Out-In (TOT)] as regards to; Complication&#xD;
      rates, Objective &amp; subjective cure rates, Patient satisfaction &amp; quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomised trial in a regional referral centre, approved by ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Transobturator tension free vaginal tape is currently the first choice&#xD;
      mid-urethral tape procedure for surgical treatment of USI in our unit. The choice of the&#xD;
      surgical approach and tape material; In-Out (TVT-O) vs. the Out-In (TOT) is currently taken&#xD;
      predominately according to the surgeon preference without any solid clinical evidence to&#xD;
      support that one approach or one tape is superior to the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: All women undergoing transobturator tension free vaginal tape procedure in our&#xD;
      department for pure USI, done as a primary anti-incontinence procedure and as the sole&#xD;
      procedure at time of surgery, will be invited to participate in the study and will receive an&#xD;
      information leaflet and will sign a consent form. All would have had failed or declined&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment. Procedures mainly take place in the surgery unit under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia; those that are done in the main surgical list are due to patients' associated&#xD;
      medical conditions or needing spinal anaesthesia or living in remote areas. Randomisation&#xD;
      will be performed using sealed opaque envelopes. TVT-O &amp; TOT will be done as originally&#xD;
      described, we do not perform cough stress test routinely. All patients will receive&#xD;
      intra-operative; prophylactic antibiotics &amp; anti- inflammatory drugs if not contraindicated.&#xD;
      Lidocaine 1% will be infiltrated into the needle pathway at the end of the procedure; 10mls.&#xD;
      on each side. Satisfactory postoperative voiding - for the purpose of this study - is defined&#xD;
      as passing at least 200mls with post-voiding residual urinary volume &lt;100mls assessed at&#xD;
      least twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment would include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed history &amp; pelvic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urodynamic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative quality of life assessment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Incontinence Bothersome Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bristol Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Questionnaire (BULTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative assessment would include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operative time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgeon assessment of procedure difficulty using visual analogue score (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-operative complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bladder/Urethral injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Haemorrhage (&gt;200 mls.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further procedures needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate postoperative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Postoperative pain assessment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patient self assessment using visual analogue score (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Unscheduled ward admission for postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative voiding dysfunction will be defined as any deviation from satisfactory&#xD;
           postoperative voiding described above. This will include assessment of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Days of catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intermittent self catheterization or permanent supra-pubic catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urethral dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical release/excision of the tape.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Urinary tract infection (UTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hospital stay (for medical reasons).&#xD;
