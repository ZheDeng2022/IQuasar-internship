  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is a major health problem with a direct link to elevated heart- and lung-related&#xD;
      problems. Nicotine is highly addictive, which makes quitting difficult and relapse after&#xD;
      quitting highly probable. Any type of sleep disturbance may make quitting even harder. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of bupropion and nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapies (NRT) on sleep disturbances. In turn, this might show how such medications affect&#xD;
      attempts at smoking cessation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of attempts to quit smoking end in failure due to unpleasant withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms. One such symptom is sleep disturbances. Bupropion, effective in assisting with&#xD;
      smoking cessation, commonly causes sleep disturbances as a medication side effect. In&#xD;
      addition, a number of NRTs also cause sleep disturbances. This study will aim to characterize&#xD;
      the effect of smoking cessation and smoking cessation treatments on sleep by measuring&#xD;
      central and autonomic nervous system arousal. The study will also evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatments on daytime sleepiness and mood as well as their effect on&#xD;
      smoking relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. Participants will receive&#xD;
      either bupropion (150 mg for 3 days and 300 mg for 60 days) or placebo, starting one week&#xD;
      prior to smoking quit day. They will then receive either active NRT (21 mg for 6 weeks, 14 mg&#xD;
      for 1 week, and 7 mg for 1 week) or placebo, starting on quit day. Participants will be&#xD;
      studied for up to 5 nights in a sleep lab. Sleep studies will include polysomnography&#xD;
      measurements, including electrooculography of both eyes, activity of mentalis muscle and both&#xD;
      anterior tibialis muscles, EEG, ECG, oxygen saturation, airflow, and respiratory efforts.&#xD;
      Sleep studies will occur on the 2 nights prior to quit day, the quit night, and the 2 nights&#xD;
      after quitting. Each sleep study will be followed by daytime measures. These will include a&#xD;
      series of self-report instruments, sleepiness and performance measures, and physiological&#xD;
      activity measures. Carbon monoxide levels will also be a daytime measurement and must fall&#xD;
      below 10 ppm on the post quit days. All participants will receive bimonthly phone counseling&#xD;
      for 12 months, starting on quit day. Participants will have follow-up evaluations at Months 3&#xD;
      and 12 in order to measure carbon monoxide levels and complete self-report instruments.&#xD;
