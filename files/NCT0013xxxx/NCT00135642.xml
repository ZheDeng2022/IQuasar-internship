  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of grass pollen immunotherapy on&#xD;
      symptoms, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and quality of life in seasonal rhinitis and asthma.&#xD;
      Hay fever symptoms and medication use, health-related quality of life, and measurements of&#xD;
      non-specific bronchial responsiveness were recorded during the study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study.&#xD;
      The main aim of this study was to assess the effects of grass pollen immunotherapy on&#xD;
      symptoms, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and quality of life in seasonal rhinitis and asthma.&#xD;
      Forty-four patients with severe summer hay fever (of whom 36 reported seasonal chest symptoms&#xD;
      and 28 had seasonal bronchial hyperresponsiveness) participated in a randomised double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study. After symptom monitoring for one summer,&#xD;
      participants matched placebo injections (n=22) in a rapid up-dosing cluster regimen for 4&#xD;
      weeks, followed by monthly injections for 2 years. Outcome measures included hay fever&#xD;
      symptoms and medication use, health-related quality of life, and measurements of non-specific&#xD;
      bronchial responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Significant reductions were observed in immunotherapy group compared with the&#xD;
      placebo group in hay fever symptoms (49%, 15%: P = 0.1), medication scores (80%, 18%;&#xD;
      P=.007), and seasonal chest symptoms (90%, 11%; P &lt; .05). Impairment of overall quality of&#xD;
      life (mean score of 7 domains) during the pollen season was less in the immunotherapy group&#xD;
      than in the placebo group (median difference [95% CI], 0.8 [0.18-1.5]; P=.05=2]. During the&#xD;
      pollen season, there was no change in airway methacholine PC20 (provocation concentration&#xD;
      producing a 20% fall in FEV1) in the immunotherapy-treated group (P=5), compared with an&#xD;
      almost 3 doubling-dose decrease in the placebo-treated group (P=.5), compared with an almost&#xD;
      3 doubling dose decrease in the placebo-treated group (P=.01, between-group difference).&#xD;
      There were no significant local or systemic side effects during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Grass pollen immunotherapy improves quality of life in seasonal allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      and reduces seasonal asthma symptoms and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A clinical history of severe rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (interfering with usual&#xD;
             daily activities or sleep), which remain troublesome despite treatment with&#xD;
