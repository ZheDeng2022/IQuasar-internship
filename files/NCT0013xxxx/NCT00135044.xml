      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the inclusion of 1g of intravenous&#xD;
      taurine as part of the nitrogen source of parenteral nutrition reduces parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      associated cholestatic liver disease, a common side effect of parenteral nutrition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis (PNAC) is one of the main causes of death during&#xD;
      long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN). In one study 65% of patients on NPN developed PNAC&#xD;
      after a median of 6 months and 41.5% developed HPN associated liver disease after a median of&#xD;
      17 months. It is thought that this condition develops due to changes in bile acid&#xD;
      conjugation. Bile acids are conjugated with either taurine or glycine before their secretion&#xD;
      in bile. Man obtains taurine mostly from the diet and hepatic taurine conjugation of bile&#xD;
      acids accounts for 30-40% of the total bile acid pool. Taurine-conjugated bile acids are more&#xD;
      water soluble and less toxic than glycine-conjugated bile acids. The ratio of glycine to&#xD;
      taurine conjugated bile acids appears to be important and studies in rats have found that the&#xD;
      bile acid sulfolithocholate, which is conjugated with glycine, was cholestatic while the&#xD;
      taurine conjugated was not. Further studies in guinea pigs have shown that dietary taurine&#xD;
      supplements prevent the cholestasis induced by sulfolithocholate by increasing the percentage&#xD;
      of taurine conjugated bile acids. Patients on intravenous nutrition with intestinal failure&#xD;
      may not re-absorb bile acids normally and may have increased losses of taurine conjugated of&#xD;
      bile acids. They have also been found to have low levels of taurine. It is thought that&#xD;
      chronic taurine deficiency, by altering the pattern of conjugation of bile acids, may&#xD;
      predispose to cholestasis and ultimately severe hepatic dysfunction. In a study of&#xD;
      hepatobiliary surgical patients given dietary taurine post operatively, there was enhanced&#xD;
      conjugation and secretion of bile acids. Bilirubin levels fell during taurine supplementation&#xD;
      compared to patients not receiving taurine although this was not significant. We are going to&#xD;
      investigate if parenteral taurine supplementation is beneficial in our patients experiencing&#xD;
      this condition.&#xD;
