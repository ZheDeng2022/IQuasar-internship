  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many years scientists and cancer researchers have been trying to find out why some people&#xD;
      benefit more from anti-cancer medications than other people who receive the same amount and&#xD;
      same kind of medications. Current studies suggest that inherited characteristics might&#xD;
      explain these differences. Height and eye color are examples of characteristics that have&#xD;
      been inherited from parents. Studies suggest that people might also inherit genetic&#xD;
      differences in how their bodies break down medications. When a person receives an anti-cancer&#xD;
      medication, it is broken down by the liver into smaller parts or by-products. To try to&#xD;
      understand more about how people's bodies break down anti-cancer medications, the researchers&#xD;
      are studying the by-products (called metabolites) of epirubicin in the blood of people who&#xD;
      are taking this medication as part of their breast cancer treatment.&#xD;

      Epirubicin is an anthracycline that is widely used in breast cancer, stomach and esophageal&#xD;
      cancer. Despite epirubicin being the 4'-epi-isomer of doxorubicin, epirubicin undergoes&#xD;
      substantially different metabolism compared to doxorubicin. The majority of epirubicin is&#xD;
      metabolized to glucuronides, 78.0% to epirubicin glucuronide and 19.3% to epirubicinol&#xD;
      glucuronide and only 0.2% epirubicin is metabolized to epirubicinol. Doxorubicin is primarily&#xD;
      metabolized to aglycones or doxorubicinol but not to glucuronides. There is substantial&#xD;
      variability in epirubicin metabolism with the mean clearance of 84.6 L/h and a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 63.5. A study by Hu et al showed epirubicin metabolism correlated with response.&#xD;
      In this study they showed patients with nasopharyngeal cancer treated with epirubicin were&#xD;
      more likely to relapse if they rapidly metabolized epirubicin. A study by Robert et al raises&#xD;
      the possibility that the differences in epirubicin metabolism are determined by genetic&#xD;
      differences. They showed a bimodal distribution in the ratio of epirubicin glucuronides to&#xD;
      epirubicin. As well this study showed that low glucuronidation were more likely to respond to&#xD;
      epirubicin than patients who had a high ratio of epirubicin glucuronides to epirubicin.&#xD;
      Innocenti et al has shown that epirubicin is metabolized to its glucuronides by uridine&#xD;
      glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7). The same study showed a strong correlation between the&#xD;
      formation of morphine-6-glucuronide and the glucuronidation of epirubicin in human liver&#xD;
      microsomes. The researchers have recently discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism in the&#xD;
      enhancer region of UGT 2B7. Patients who were homozygous for this polymorphism tended to have&#xD;
      lower ratios of morphine-6-glucuronide to morphine. The researchers suspect that this T to C&#xD;
      polymorphism decreases the transcription of UGT 2B7 and this is the basis of the decreased&#xD;
      glucuronidation. Given the strong correlation between the metabolism of morphine and&#xD;
      epirubicin in human liver microsomes the researchers suspect that this polymorphism may be&#xD;
      responsible for the variability in epirubicin metabolism. Previous work has documented an&#xD;
      overlapping bimodal distribution in the ratio of epirubicin glucuronides but they did not&#xD;
      examine whether genetic polymorphisms were responsible for this. This study will examine the&#xD;
      effect of this polymorphism on the metabolism of epirubicin. If a relationship exists between&#xD;
      this polymorphism and epirubicin metabolism this may allow more accurate dosing of this&#xD;
      important chemotherapeutic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine in patients receiving adjuvant intravenous FEC chemotherapy (5-Fluoruracil 500&#xD;
      mg/m2, epirubicin 100 mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) given every 3 weeks whether the&#xD;
      newly discovered SNP at position -161 T to C is responsible for the variability in epirubicin&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving adjuvant FEC chemotherapy. Patients can not have pre-existing liver&#xD;
      disease other than Gilbert's syndrome. In patients with a history of liver disease, liver&#xD;
      transaminases must be less than 3 times the upper limit of normal and bilirubin less than the&#xD;
      upper limit of normal. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study after written informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics including age, weight, renal function, liver function, concurrent&#xD;
      medications and ethnic origin will be obtained from the medical chart or patient. The patient&#xD;
      chart will be reviewed periodically for hematological and nonhematological toxicity. Outcome&#xD;
      data such as recurrence and time of recurrence will be obtained from the chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical oncologists consider a significant difference in drug clearance to be 15%.&#xD;
      Epirubicin's clearance is 84.6 L/h with a standard deviation of 63.5. The researchers have&#xD;
      calculated a sample size to have an 80% power to detect a 15% difference. Assuming&#xD;
      epirubicin's average clearance is comprised of three separate groups, which is the&#xD;
      hypothesis, the researchers would need 29 patients from each genotype to show a 15%&#xD;
      difference between the mean clearance of different genotypes assuming a coefficient of&#xD;
      variation of 20%. The known polymorphism at amino acid residue 268 has an allele frequency of&#xD;
      50%. This allele was in complete linkage disequilibrium with the new SNP at position -160 in&#xD;
      the previous study of morphine. Therefore the researchers would need approximately 120&#xD;
      patients to produce 30 T/T, 60 T/C and 30 C/C.&#xD;
