      Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at physical exercise after acute ischaemic stroke. It is called the&#xD;
      ExStroke Pilot Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of first-time stroke. It remains unknown if&#xD;
      physical activity also is associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke. Patients with&#xD;
      ischaemic stroke have a 30% to 40% risk of a recurrent stroke during a 5 year follow-up. The&#xD;
      risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and death from vascular disease is approximately 15%&#xD;
      each. The impact of lifestyle factors on risk for these events is insufficiently covered in&#xD;
      the international scientific literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the trial is to examine whether the level of physical activity increases in&#xD;
      patients who have had an ischemic stroke, when they are informed about physical activity and&#xD;
      instructed in a physical training program. The occurrence of new cerebro- and cardiovascular&#xD;
      events in the patients will be registered. The patients are randomised to receive oral and&#xD;
      written information by a physician and a physiotherapist about physical exercise; or to a&#xD;
      control group with no instruction regarding physical exercise. Both groups will receive the&#xD;
      best available therapy with regard to secondary stroke prevention and will be informed about&#xD;
      lifestyle factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrespective of which group the patients are randomised to, all patients will receive the&#xD;
      best possible established treatment with regard to prevention of thromboses; blood pressure&#xD;
      control; lipid lowering agents, if necessary; and information about diet, tobacco smoking,&#xD;
      and vitamin supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomised centrally within 90 days after stroke onset, and they will be&#xD;
      re-examined at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Inclusion criteria are patients with ischaemic&#xD;
      stroke, aged 40 years or older. In the pilot trial a number of 300 included patients is&#xD;
      wanted.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of first-time stroke. It is unknown if&#xD;
      physical exercise reduces risk of recurrent stroke. Clinicians treating stroke patients are&#xD;
      inevitably confronted with the question of how to reduce the risk of a second stroke. In&#xD;
      addition to the risk of recurrent stroke, a stroke survivor is also at risk of suffering&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction (MI) and other cardiovascular complications. Efforts to reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk may potentially also reduce stroke risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity as contrasted to sedentary lifestyle is associated with a reduced risk of&#xD;
      first stroke, but in one of these studies the reduction in stroke risk did not reach&#xD;
      statistical significance. In a Norwegian study the relative risk of stroke mortality was 0.56&#xD;
      (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36 - 0.88) in physically active women aged 70-79 years,&#xD;
      compared to women with lower physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the ExStroke Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of instruction in physical training on &quot;Physical Activity Scale for&#xD;
      Elderly&quot; (PASE)in patients with ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other endpoints are recurrent stroke, MI, death of all causes, and vascular death after an&#xD;
      ischaemic stroke in patients randomised to receive verbal instruction by a stroke physician/a&#xD;
      neurologist and a physiotherapist concurrently with written information on physical exercise&#xD;
      versus a control group, which is to receive standard information on the usefulness of&#xD;
      physical activity. Both groups will receive physiotherapy according to the usual standards of&#xD;
      the department to which the patients are admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exercise after discharge from hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to the physical exercise group shall have a session with a stroke&#xD;
      physician/a neurologist, and a physiotherapist in which the patient's possibilities and&#xD;
      wishes of training activity after discharge are discussed. In agreement with the patient, a&#xD;
      training program is designed for the individual patient according to the patient's resources&#xD;
      and capability. The training program on which the patient, the physician, and the&#xD;
      physiotherapist have agreed must be written down; the patient will keep a copy of the&#xD;
      training program, another copy is kept in the patient files, and a third copy is kept in&#xD;
      Clinical Record Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the follow-up visits the level of physical activity is evaluated using the &quot;Physical&#xD;
      Activity Scale in the Elderly&quot; (PASE) in both groups and the Copenhagen City Heart Study&#xD;
      questionnaire on physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recommended that patients in the active group should be contacted between the follow-up&#xD;
      sessions by the physiotherapist in order to stimulate physical exercise. Patients in the&#xD;
      control group shall receive the same high quality medical care, but without further&#xD;
      discussion of physical training, unless the patient requests such information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that a certain amount of physical activity is associated with&#xD;
      reduced risk of first-ever stroke. It is hypothesised that a certain level of physical&#xD;
      exercise in patients with ischaemic stroke, will reduce the risk of subsequent&#xD;
      cardio-vascular events. The following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of physical activity will increase when patients are instructed in a physical&#xD;
           training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of recurrent stroke, MI, or death following an ischaemic stroke will be&#xD;
           lower in patients who have received verbal and written instruction on physical exercise&#xD;
           compared with those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure: physical activity as measured by PASE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measure: time from randomisation to recurrent stroke, or to MI, or to death&#xD;
      of all causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third Outcome Measure: time from randomisation to recurrent stroke, MI and vascular death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth Outcome Measure: frequency of recurrent stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifth Outcome Measure: activities of daily living as measured by modified Rankin Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixth Outcome Measure: quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventh Outcome Measure: frequency of falls and fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients, meeting all inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      will be asked if they want to participate in the trial. Patients will be included as soon as&#xD;
      convenient and within 90 days after onset of an ischaemic stroke. There will be follow-up&#xD;
      sessions at 3,6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months. The study is a randomised, single blind, parallel&#xD;
      group, multicenter, international clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation will be performed centrally with randomisation in blocks 1:1, stratifying&#xD;
      for center, sex, age, and stroke severity. The Copenhagen Trial Unit (CTU) will perform the&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Planned Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ischaemic stroke being 40 years of age or older will be included in the study.&#xD;
      It is unknown, if level of physical activity can be increased by repeated information given&#xD;
      to patients with a stroke. Level of physical activity is evaluated according to the PASE&#xD;
      scale, which is expected to be approximately 70 as a mean value. Based on a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 50, a minimal relevant difference of 20 in PASE score, a Type I error of 5%, a&#xD;
      Type 2 error of 20%, it is estimated that 100 patients should be included in each of the two&#xD;
      study arms. To take into account withdrawals and dropouts, about 50% more patients should be&#xD;
      included in each arm, giving a total of 300 patients in the pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects aged 40 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke; symptoms lasting 24 hours or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT-scan of the brain must either show a new infarct or be normal. Patients only with&#xD;
           infarcts without clinical symptoms cannot be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion shall take place before day 90 after stroke onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent after verbal and written information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient must be able to walk either unaided or with a cane or a walker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are unable to understand the information, or who can not cooperate, are&#xD;
           excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients confined to a wheelchair or bed.&#xD;
&#xD;

           cerebral atrophy, or leucoaraiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Rankin score of 4 or 5 before the actual stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious medical disease such as AIDS, metastatic cancer, or abnormalities that the&#xD;
           investigator feels may compromise the patient's successful participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Earlier randomisation in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Registration:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Date of qualifying stroke (day, month, year)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results of CT scan, ECG, and Doppler examination of carotid arteries shall be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information on treatment with anti-thrombotic medication and on treatment with&#xD;
           anti-hypertensive medication before discharge of the index stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information on blood pressure on inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight and height&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke patients are at risk of adverse events such as the occurrence of falls, fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up examinations take place at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after the inclusion of the&#xD;
      patient in the trial. On each visit the medical history shall include information on date of&#xD;
      recurrent stroke, date of transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), date of gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      bleeding, other bleeding episodes, and date of MI, falls, and fractures, and date of any&#xD;
      serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of hospital admissions, information on diagnosis and length of stay shall be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of death, information on date of death shall be retrieved and the cause of death be&#xD;
      given as either baseline stroke, new stroke, cardiac disease, vascular causes, or other&#xD;
      causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each follow-up visit the patients randomised to &quot;physical exercise group&quot; shall have&#xD;
      repeated instruction by the physiotherapist as to the exercises suggested at baseline, or&#xD;
      adapted to the present capability of the patient. Such adapted instructions on the training&#xD;
      program must be written down. The patient shall receive a copy of it, a second copy shall be&#xD;
      inserted in the patient record, and a third copy in the case record form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each visit in all patients the physical activity scale (PASE) shall be completed. The&#xD;
      interview will be done by a co-investigator, who is blinded as to what group the patient was&#xD;
      randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three Month Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information is recorded on the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scandinavian Stroke Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Rankin Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tobacco smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antithrombotic medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antihypertensive medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PASE form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Events such as recurrent stroke, MI, or adverse events are recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life form&#xD;
&#xD;
           6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 Month Follow-Ups: Information is recorded as three months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown whether physical exercise will influence the rate of recurrent vascular events,&#xD;
      MI, and mortality after an ischaemic stroke. It is, however, assumed that physical activity&#xD;
      may favourably influence the prognosis. Therefore, all patients in the trial will be advised&#xD;
      as to a healthy lifestyle including the possible benefit of physical exercise. Those, who are&#xD;
      randomised to the active group, will in addition receive special instruction by the&#xD;
      physiotherapist and a physician. The trial shall be accepted by the local ethics committees&#xD;
      and informed, written consent is a requirement for participation in the study. Participation&#xD;
      is voluntary and the patients can choose to withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Event Adjudication Committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome event adjudication committee will blindly evaluate and adjudicate events such as&#xD;
      death, causes of death, recurrent stroke, MI and traumatic event or other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB):&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSMB will receive blinded data from the Trial Data Center. The DSMB will evaluate events such&#xD;
      as death, causes of death, recurrent stroke, MI, and adverse effects. The DSMB may advise&#xD;
      early interruption of the trial if analyses demonstrate significant difference in the&#xD;
      occurrence of secondary outcome measures with p &lt; 0.001 between group A and group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DSMB will also follow the development of serious adverse events occurring in the 2&#xD;
      intervention arms of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finance and Insurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial support for the study will be applied for in national private and public funds.&#xD;
      Insurance will follow national regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Policy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main publication will be submitted to a major peer reviewed international journal. All&#xD;
      investigators, who are not included as co-authors, will be acknowledged in an appendix.&#xD;
