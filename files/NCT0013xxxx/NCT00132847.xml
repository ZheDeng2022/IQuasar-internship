      The purpose of this study is to test and compare the allergenic effects of three commercially&#xD;
      available German cockroach allergen extracts in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: The biological potency of three commercially available German cockroach&#xD;
      allergy extracts can be compared using the ID50EAL method to standardize German cockroach&#xD;
      allergens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cockroach allergens appear to be a major cause of inner city asthma. Because of the suspected&#xD;
      relationship between domestic cockroach species and allergy and asthma symptoms, the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) wants to standardize cockroach allergen vaccines for use in the&#xD;
      U.S. Allergen standardization comprises two important components: the selection of a&#xD;
      reference preparation of allergenic extract and the selection of procedures to compare&#xD;
      manufactured products to the reference allergen extract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults in this study will be exposed to different doses of each of 3 German cockroach&#xD;
      allergen extracts via intradermal skin testing. Participants in this study will be adults who&#xD;
      have a history of allergic disease or asthma and are sensitive to the German cockroach&#xD;
      allergens being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 visits during this study: a screening session and a testing session.&#xD;
      At screening, participants will be asked to complete a screening questionnaire and will&#xD;
      undergo a targeted physical exam, vital signs measurement, and peak expiratory flow (PEF)&#xD;
      testing. Premenopausal women will also have urine collected for pregnancy testing. At the&#xD;
      screening session, a 15-minute prick/puncture test will be administered on the skin of the&#xD;
      forearm with the proposed standard allergen extract, histamine (positive control), and&#xD;
      diluent (negative control). Skin erythema (swelling) response to the injections will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may continue into the testing session on the same day as the screening&#xD;
      session; others will participate in the testing session at a second study visit within 4&#xD;
      weeks after study screening. At the start of the testing session, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a questionnaire about demographics, history of airway disease and previous skin&#xD;
      testing, and current medication use. For participants whose testing session occurs on a&#xD;
      different day than the screening session, vital signs measurement and PEF readings will occur&#xD;
      and premenopausal women will have urine collected. Blood collection will occur prior to the&#xD;
      skin test. Intradermal skin testing will consist of injections on the participant's back with&#xD;
      multiple doses of 3 different extracts of German cockroach allergen. Each of the 3 extracts&#xD;
      will require 4 to 7 injections, depending on the response to each dose. Erythema skin&#xD;
      response to the dilutions will be recorded. Participants will be observed for at least 1 hour&#xD;
      after the intradermal skin testing as a safety precaution. After the observation period,&#xD;
      participants will undergo additional PEF testing and will be assessed for adverse reactions&#xD;
      to the skin testing procedure. Participants may be given antihistamines to relieve itching.&#xD;
