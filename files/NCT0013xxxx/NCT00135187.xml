  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take part in this research study because they have multiple&#xD;
      myeloma which has relapsed after (come back), or is refractory to (unaffected by), initial&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have relapsed or are refractory to therapy, there is no agreed upon standard&#xD;
      treatment. Treatment options include chemotherapy and, for some patients, bone marrow&#xD;
      transplants. None of the available treatments are curative and investigators are continually&#xD;
      looking for more effective treatments. This study involves treatment with a new combination&#xD;
      of standard drugs: VELCADE, Doxil, and Dexamethasone. Preliminary results from a study using&#xD;
      a combination of VELCADE with Doxil showed high response rates (disease reduction). Two other&#xD;
      studies showed that an addition of Dexamethasone to VELCADE in patients not responding to&#xD;
      VELCADE alone improved response rate. The proposed combination of all three drugs may improve&#xD;
      efficacy and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VELCADE is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in multiple myeloma.&#xD;
      Doxil is not approved for use in multiple myeloma but is an approved drug for use in patients&#xD;
      with some other cancers. Several published clinical trials provide evidence that Doxil is an&#xD;
      active agent in multiple myeloma and it is used in treatment combinations for multiple&#xD;
      myeloma in general practice. Dexamethasone is approved for use in multiple myeloma. The&#xD;
      combination of all three drugs is experimental (not FDA approved).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to determine if this new combination therapy with VELCADE, Doxil&#xD;
      and Dexamethasone is an effective treatment, and also to determine the side effects that&#xD;
      occur when this combination treatment is given.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma remains a non-curable disease. Combination therapies such as VAD have been&#xD;
      effective, with partial response rates in ~40-60% range and tolerable toxicity. A recent&#xD;
      study showed that substituting Doxil for Doxorubicin in a regimen similar to VAD (DVd)&#xD;
      resulted in an improved toxicity profile and similar efficacy. The most active agents in VAD&#xD;
      (and presumably in DVd) are Doxorubicin (or Doxil) and Dexamethasone, while Vincristine adds&#xD;
      little, if at all to the efficacy of these regimen(s). One of the new active agents in&#xD;
      multiple myeloma is VELCADE (bortezomib, formerly known as VELCADE). This molecule has a&#xD;
      novel mechanism of action by specifically inhibiting the proteasome. A recently reported&#xD;
      Phase II trial showed that VELCADE as a single agent induced at least minimal responses (i.e.&#xD;
      &gt; 25% reduction in monoclonal protein) in 35% of patients and at least a stabilization of the&#xD;
      disease in 59% of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma using strict SWOG&#xD;
      criteria. An additional 18% responded when Dexamethasone was added to VELCADE. Pre-clinical&#xD;
      observations showed that the addition of VELCADE to other chemotherapeutic agents, such as&#xD;
      doxorubicin, enhances cytotoxicity of multiple myeloma cells. Preliminary results from Phase&#xD;
      I study of combination of VELCADE with Doxil showed 60% response rate (i.e. &gt; partial&#xD;
      response) with acceptable toxicity. In this study we propose to combine three active agents,&#xD;
      i.e. Doxil, Dexamethasone (two most active agents from DVd), and VELCADE. The ultimate goal&#xD;
      is to show that this combination of drugs is more efficacious than VAD or VELCADE with either&#xD;
      Dexamethasone or Doxil and without additional toxicity.&#xD;
