  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both sodium valproate and lamotrigine are currently used in the treatment of newly diagnosed&#xD;
      epilepsy. Although they appear to have similar efficacy, they have different side effects,&#xD;
      which have not been well studied. This study aims to compare one particular aspect of their&#xD;
      possible side effects, namely whether they affect certain hormonal functions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sodium valproate is an established antiepileptic drug used against a broad range of seizure&#xD;
      types. Lamotrigine, a newer antiepileptic drug available since late 1980s, has a similar&#xD;
      range of action and is approved as first-line treatment for epilepsy in the United States and&#xD;
      many European countries as well as in Hong Kong. Recently, concern has been raised over the&#xD;
      association between valproate treatment and polycystic ovarian syndrome, a condition&#xD;
      characterised by multiple cysts in the ovaries in women and a range of hormonal and metabolic&#xD;
      disturbances. Cross-sectional studies from Finland suggest that up to 40% of women treated&#xD;
      with valproate have polycystic ovaries. Lamotrigine substitution for valproate has been&#xD;
      reported to normalise these parameters in some patients. Elevated serum insulin and androgen&#xD;
      levels have also been reported in over 50% of male patients taking valproate for epilepsy.&#xD;
      However, such high incidence of hormonal abnormalities associated with valproate treatment&#xD;
      has not been reproduced in studies conducted in other western populations. No similar studies&#xD;
      in Chinese patients have been reported. In addition, these cross-sectional studies suffer&#xD;
      from many potential confounding factors, such as previous treatment with other antiepileptic&#xD;
      drugs, variation in duration of treatment, thus limiting the ability to establish a causal&#xD;
      relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase IV study aims to examine whether valproate treatment is associated with hormonal&#xD;
      abnormalities in Chinese epilepsy patients. Newly diagnosed patients will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive valproate or lamotrigine and their hormonal profiles measured prospectively for 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
