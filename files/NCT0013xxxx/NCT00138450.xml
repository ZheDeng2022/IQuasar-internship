  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine what causes some people to become sick, and others&#xD;
      not, when they are infected with the parasite Schistosoma haematobium, also known as&#xD;
      Bilharzia. This is an infection of the urinary tract blood vessels and can cause serious&#xD;
      disease. Approximately 4400 adults and children of any age will participate in this study.&#xD;
      They must be residents of the Msambweni Area, Kwale District, Coast Province, Kenya, where&#xD;
      infection with S. haematobium parasites are common. To find out if people are infected, they&#xD;
      will first provide 1 or more urine samples for a microscope examination to detect if the S.&#xD;
      haematobium parasites are present in the body. Volunteers then will be examined by ultrasound&#xD;
      to see if they have kidney or bladder disease. (Ultrasound examination is the use of a&#xD;
      non-painful machine that uses sound waves to examine the condition of the internal organs.)&#xD;
      Treatment with the drug praziquantel will be offered if S. haematobium infection is found.&#xD;

      The goal of this project is to focus both field and laboratory research on specific&#xD;
      epidemiological, genetic and immunological features that underline the greatest&#xD;
      susceptibility to S. haematobium infection and disease. This information, combined with&#xD;
      epidemiological modeling of control strategies, will allow accelerated synthesis of the next&#xD;
      generation of control programs. The studies in this initial Protocol A involve a large-scale&#xD;
      survey of study villages to determine current population demography, general health,&#xD;
      infection with S. haematobium, and, specifically, prevalence of parasite-related morbidity.&#xD;
      Once evaluated, participants in Protocol A may be subsequently enrolled in Project Protocols&#xD;
      B through F if they meet inclusion criteria. The size of the observational Protocol A study&#xD;
      cohort (~4,400) is, in part, based on one of its secondary aims: i.e., the need to identify&#xD;
      sufficient numbers of morbidity-concordant sibling pairs for genetic studies performed under&#xD;
      Protocol D, and sufficient mother-infant pairs for Protocol F. Beyond initial screening, no&#xD;
      further investigation occurs in Protocol A per se. Standard doses of praziquantel therapy&#xD;
      will be given to treat S. haematobium infection diagnosed under Protocol A. Longitudinal&#xD;
      follow-up of a subset of these treated individuals will be performed in Protocols B, C and E&#xD;
      of the project. The study will enroll approximately 1100 adults and 1100 children from each&#xD;
      of 2 types of rural S. haematobium-endemic village: a) those that have had prior&#xD;
      participation in schistosomiasis control programs (1984-1993) and b) those that have not. The&#xD;
      Msambweni area of Kwale District in southern Coast Province, Kenya will serve as the&#xD;
      'previously-treated' area. This area has participated in a long-term study of S. haematobium&#xD;
      treatment since 1983. Three additional area villages (population ~4,000) that have not&#xD;
      previously participated in treatment programs will be included as control&#xD;
      'previously-untreated' areas for comparison purposes to confirm the natural history of&#xD;
      untreated infection. Like Msambweni area villages, the comparison villages (Mbuani, Mabakoni,&#xD;
      and Gonjora) will be located in southern Kwale District, Coast Province, Kenya. In order to&#xD;
      mirror the pre-control experience of the Msambweni villages, comparison villages will be&#xD;
      selected primarily for their high S. haematobium prevalence (&gt;40%) as determined in prior&#xD;
      Ministry of Health sample surveys in schools. Secondary selection criteria will be village&#xD;
      size (1200 to 2000 per village) and a rural, mostly agrarian environment. Residents will&#xD;
      update their demography and kinship data, then receive physical examinations, urinalysis,&#xD;
      ultrasound and parasitological examinations to determine infection and morbidity status.&#xD;
      Because of its size, the population will be surveyed on a systematic, village-by village&#xD;
      basis over the first 2 years of the project. These surveys will provide an effective&#xD;
      cross-sectional evaluation of current levels of disease in treated and untreated communities&#xD;
      at-large. Subjects with suspicion for severe renal dysfunction or bladder cancer (a known&#xD;
      late complication of S. haematobium) will be referred to Msambweni or Mombasa Hospitals for&#xD;
      further care. The primary study objective is to compare rates of moderate-to-severe urinary&#xD;
      tract morbidity associated with S. haematobium infection for older children and adults&#xD;
      residing in previously-treated and previously-untreated villages in the endemic southern&#xD;
      Kwale District, Coast Province, Kenya. Secondary objectives are to: (1) compare rates of&#xD;
      heavy S. haematobium infection for individuals residing in these previously-treated and&#xD;
      -untreated villages; and (2) identify eligible subjects for participation in more detailed&#xD;
      study of late S. haematobium-related disease, hereditary predisposition to morbidity,&#xD;
      association of cytokine response to morbidity, and effects of in utero sensitization to S.&#xD;
      haematobium on disease in later life (Protocols B-F of the project).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Kenyan residents, newborn to adult, either male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Residence in areas of Kwale District endemic for Schistosoma haematobium&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy (this is a partial exclusion). Pregnant women will participate in the&#xD;
        parasitological screening phase of the study. However, because of pregnancy-related effects&#xD;
        on the urinary system, their ultrasound examinations will be excluded from the analysis of&#xD;
        hydronephrosis. Further, because of potential toxicity of praziquantel (Category B) and its&#xD;
        alternative, metrifonate (an anticholinesterase), post-protocol anti-parasitic therapy will&#xD;
        be delayed until the mother delivers and has stopped breastfeeding her infant.&#xD;
