      Patients with heart failure have a pumping action of the ventricles in which one ventricle&#xD;
      contracts before the other ventricle. This uncoordinated (unsynchronized) pumping is due to a&#xD;
      delay in the stimulation of the left ventricle because of its increased size. Pacing both the&#xD;
      right and the left side of the heart (or cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]) has been&#xD;
      proven to be effective in the treatment of heart failure (HF). Current market-approved&#xD;
      devices combine both pacing (CRT) and shocking (implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD])&#xD;
      therapy for patients who have severe heart failure and are at risk for developing&#xD;
      life-threatening heart rhythms. These devices provide an electrical pacing stimulus to both&#xD;
      ventricles and may help the heart contract in a more coordinated way and improve heart&#xD;
      failure symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational portion of this trial involves the implantation of a market-approved CRT&#xD;
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (CRT-D) system in patients who do not meet the current&#xD;
      criteria for a CRT implant. In order to receive a CRT-D implant today, patients must have&#xD;
      heart failure symptoms, have a weakened heart muscle, and have uncoordinated pumping of the&#xD;
      heart. To demonstrate this uncoordinated pumping of the heart, a test (electrocardiogram&#xD;
      [ECG]) is done. It is believed that by using a different test (echocardiogram) to measure&#xD;
      whether this uncoordinated pumping is present, more patients will be identified that will&#xD;
      benefit from CRT-D therapy. This study will look at whether patients identified by using this&#xD;
      echocardiogram test show a benefit from having this CRT-D therapy.&#xD;

      1.0 Problem of Interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with heart failure have a pumping action of the ventricles in which one ventricle&#xD;
      contracts before the other ventricle. This uncoordinated (unsynchronized) pumping is due to a&#xD;
      delay in the stimulation of the left ventricle because of its increased size. Pacing both the&#xD;
      right and the left side of the heart (or cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]) has been&#xD;
      proven to be effective in the treatment of heart failure. Current market-approved devices&#xD;
      combine both pacing (CRT) and shocking (ICD) therapy for patients who have severe heart&#xD;
      failure and are at risk for developing life-threatening heart rhythms. These devices provide&#xD;
      an electrical pacing stimulus to both ventricles at the same time and may help the heart&#xD;
      contract in a more coordinated way and improve heart failure symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational portion of this trial involves the implantation of a market-approved CRT&#xD;
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (CRT-D) system in patients who do not meet the current&#xD;
      criteria for a CRT implant. In order to receive a CRT-D implant today, patients must have&#xD;
      heart failure symptoms, have a weakened heart muscle, and have uncoordinated pumping of the&#xD;
      heart. To demonstrate this uncoordinated pumping of the heart, a test (ECG) is done. It is&#xD;
      believed that by using a different test (echocardiogram) to measure whether this&#xD;
      uncoordinated pumping is present, more patients will be identified that will benefit from&#xD;
      CRT-D therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Study Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing will be performed to determine if patients are eligible for this study. An EKG&#xD;
      (electrical tracing of the heart) will be performed. They will be asked to complete a 6-&#xD;
      minute hall walk test that will provide information regarding their ability to exercise and&#xD;
      conduct daily activities. An echocardiogram with tissue Doppler imaging (ultrasound of the&#xD;
      heart) will be performed to determine how the heart muscle contracts. Results of this&#xD;
      echocardiogram will determine if patients are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device system that will be implanted consists of a St. Jude Medical CRT-D and three&#xD;
      pacing leads (insulted wires that carry electrical energy from the device to the heart). One&#xD;
      lead is placed in the upper right chamber of the heart (atrium), a second lead is placed in&#xD;
      the lower right chamber of the heart (right ventricle) and the third lead is placed within a&#xD;
      vein that runs along the outside of the heart and is positioned at a location near the left&#xD;
      lower chamber of the heart (left ventricle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization visit will occur approximately 14 days after implant. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized (like a flip of a coin) to one of two groups. Each patient will have an equal&#xD;
      chance of being randomized to either of the two groups. One group will receive cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization treatment (CRT ON) and the other group will not receive cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization treatment (CRT OFF). Patients in the CRT OFF group can receive cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization treatment at 6 months after randomization if the doctor determines that it&#xD;
      is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization and programming of the device, the following tests will be completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life Questionnaire - contains 21 questions that provide information as to how&#xD;
           heart failure affects the patient's daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-Minute Hall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiopulmonary Exercise Stress Testing (CPX) - measures the amount of oxygen used by&#xD;
           your body while exercising on a treadmill and breathing through a special breathing tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will occur at 3 and 6 months following randomization and every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter until the end of the study. The tests performed at the randomization visit&#xD;
      (Quality of Life Questionnaire, EKG, 6 minute hall walk, CPX and echocardiogram) will be&#xD;
      repeated at the 6-month follow-up visit. Additionally, each visit will include a review of&#xD;
      the patient's condition and current medications and an evaluation of the CRT-D device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 How Will the Research Advance Scientific Knowledge and/or Human Health?&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that by pacing both lower chambers of the heart in these patients that they will&#xD;
      feel better. They may be able to do more activities with fewer symptoms. In addition, the&#xD;
      information gathered in this study will add to the understanding of treatment options for&#xD;
      patients with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 What is the Current Standard of Care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative treatments to the St. Jude Medical CRT-D system (includes the left heart lead)&#xD;
      currently available include implantation of a standard ICD system and/or treatment with&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
