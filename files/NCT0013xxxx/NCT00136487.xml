  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn the effects (both good and bad) that celecoxib has on&#xD;
      prostate cancer and patients with prostate cancer. This study is looking at what effects&#xD;
      celecoxib has on prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. PSA is a marker specific to prostate&#xD;
      cancer. An increase or decrease in this level in the blood can indicate if a patient's&#xD;
      prostate cancer is getting worse or better.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study is designed as a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study. These are all&#xD;
      scientific research methods used to protect the study from personal bias or prejudice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who participate in this study will be randomly assigned initially to take either&#xD;
      celecoxib (the study drug) or placebo (an inactive substance that looks like the study drug).&#xD;
      Placebos are used to help determine if the results of a study (good or bad) result from&#xD;
      chance or from treatment with the study drug. Patients will have a fifty-fifty chance of&#xD;
      initial treatment with the study drug. Neither the patient nor the patient's doctor will know&#xD;
      whether he/she is initially receiving the study drug or placebo. Participants who are&#xD;
      assigned to initially take placebo may have the opportunity to be treated with celecoxib&#xD;
      later in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are found to be eligible for this study and they agree to participate, they will&#xD;
      be randomized to either receive celecoxib or placebo to be taken by mouth (as a pill) twice a&#xD;
      day, every day for as long as they are in the study. Patients will be given a pill diary to&#xD;
      keep track of their medications. While in this study, they will be asked not to take any&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which includes over-the-counter ibuprofen and many&#xD;
      other available drugs. In addition, they will be asked not to take any other selective COX-2&#xD;
      inhibitors (the class of drug that celecoxib is).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in this study, patients will have evaluations (physical exam and blood) to determine&#xD;
      their response to their assigned regimen and to monitor side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a month the following will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of any side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests (PSA level, kidney function). About one tablespoon of blood will be&#xD;
           taken at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every other month starting with month 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above evaluations, on alternating months starting with month 2, additional&#xD;
      routine blood tests (liver function, complete blood count) will be done. This will require an&#xD;
      additional tablespoon of blood to be taken at these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional blood for research-related testing (about 2-3 tablespoons) will also be drawn&#xD;
      during these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will be determined by how well patients tolerate the assigned&#xD;
      regimen and by how their disease responds. Patients will continue taking their assigned&#xD;
      regimen for 6 months as long as it is felt that their disease is stable (based on their PSA&#xD;
      levels) and they are tolerating the treatment. After 6 months or earlier, if the disease&#xD;
      progresses, the treatment code will be broken. If patients were on celecoxib, they will be&#xD;
      taken off study. The patient's doctor will discuss other available treatment options with&#xD;
      him/her at that time, including continuing celecoxib &quot;off study&quot;. If patients were on&#xD;
      placebo, they will then have the option to begin taking celecoxib. If patients start&#xD;
      celecoxib treatment, they will be treated in this study with celecoxib for 6 months or until&#xD;
      their disease progresses. After 6 months on celecoxib or sooner, if their disease progresses,&#xD;
      they will be taken off study. The patient's doctor will discuss available treatment options&#xD;
      with him/her at that time, including continuing celecoxib &quot;off study&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are taken &quot;off study&quot; will be monitored monthly for patient safety reasons&#xD;
      throughout the duration of time that they are receiving celecoxib at the dose level used for&#xD;
      this study (400mg twice a day).&#xD;
