  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will have painful primary or post-operative intermetatarsal neuroma. Study drug or&#xD;
      placebo will be injected into the space containing the neuroma. Subjects will complete weekly&#xD;
      assessments for severity of foot pain, a brief pain inventory, and the amount of pain&#xD;
      medication taken. Subjects will be seen for a screening visit, a treatment visit, and two&#xD;
      follow-up visits after treatment. The last scheduled visit is one month after treatment. Some&#xD;
      subjects may be followed by monthly telephone interviews to assess their level of pain over&#xD;
      the six-month period following treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will have painful primary or post-operative intermetatarsal neuroma. Each subject&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to receive either ALGRX 4975 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Study drug&#xD;
      or placebo will be injected into the intermetatarsal space containing a painful neuroma.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete weekly assessments for the Average Foot Pain Severity, the 7&#xD;
      Interference Items of the BPI, and the number of analgesic units taken. Some subjects may be&#xD;
      followed by monthly telephone interviews to assess their level of pain over the six-month&#xD;
      period following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma concentrations will be assessed pre-dose and post dose at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45&#xD;
      min and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed at baseline and during the study with adverse events (all visits),&#xD;
      vital signs (Visit 2 pre and post-injection and Visit 3 or at early termination), and&#xD;
      laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis) and ECG (Screening and Visit 3 or&#xD;
      at early termination). The injection site will be examined and assessed by a 6-point scale&#xD;
      for erythema, edema, and hemorrhage before the injection and at 1, 2 and 4 hours after the&#xD;
      injection. A pain on injection NRS will be assessed immediately post- injection at 15, 30,&#xD;
      and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after study drug administration. A sensory&#xD;
      examination of the foot will be performed before the injection and 4 hours after the&#xD;
      injection and at the completion of the study. If a subject has injection pain, the foot may&#xD;
      be wrapped in ice for up to 20 minutes, analgesic medication may be provided.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Males or females aged &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Foot X-ray to rule out alternative pathology, and ultrasound or magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging (MRI) to confirm the presence of a neuroma within 6 months of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of either a primary or post surgical recurrence neuroma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A score of 4 or greater on the Average Foot Pain Severity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
             during the week prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failed conservative treatment such as wide shoes, orthotics, arch supports, or oral&#xD;
