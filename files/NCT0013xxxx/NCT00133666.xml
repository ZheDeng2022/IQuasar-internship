  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if teaching children with asthma how to talk to&#xD;
      their doctor about controlling their asthma including symptom frequency in an asthma diary&#xD;
      and medication use techniques, will result in less symptom and missed school days, fewer&#xD;
      emergency room visits and reduce the cost of asthma health care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Children with persistent asthma are often not receiving regular preventive asthma care&#xD;
      despite experiencing frequent asthma symptoms. When linked to timely and appropriate asthma&#xD;
      medication use, good physician-parent-child communication is associated with a decrease in&#xD;
      asthma morbidity and mortality. Removing obstacles to preventive asthma care and improving&#xD;
      communication between the parent-children and PCP are two necessary prerequisites to&#xD;
      improving asthma outcomes in low-income minority children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We, the researchers at Johns Hopkins University, hypothesize that a culturally-tailored&#xD;
      parent and child asthma communication intervention (ACI) designed to teach parent and child&#xD;
      communication skills for use with their health care provider regarding asthma symptom&#xD;
      severity, medication use, personal goal of treatment and quality of life issues will&#xD;
      significantly reduce emergency room utilization for asthma care. We propose to compare this&#xD;
      parent/child asthma communication intervention (ACI) to a developed standard asthma education&#xD;
      intervention (SAE) designed to increase basic asthma self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will advance nursing science by improving asthma self-management for school age&#xD;
      children, who may be self-administering their asthma medications, yet not participate in&#xD;
      receiving information or making their own medical decisions regarding their asthma. The&#xD;
      proposed study is targeted at low-income minority school-aged children with evidence of&#xD;
      poorly controlled, high-risk asthma. If successful, this intervention could have significant&#xD;
      practical applications as a component of asthma nurse-case management, to practice currently&#xD;
      being employed by many managed care groups across the country as an intervention for their&#xD;
      high-risk/high ED use asthma patients. Because of the high prevalence and enormous health&#xD;
      impact of asthma and the disproportionate asthma burden experienced by minority children, the&#xD;
      outcome of the proposed study will have significant pediatric nursing applicability.&#xD;
