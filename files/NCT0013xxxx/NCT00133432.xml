    <textblock>
      Undernutrition in children less than five years of age is common throughout sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa. Nutritional deficiencies may lead to less ability to fight infectious diseases. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether zinc supplements plus standard antibiotics&#xD;
      reduce the length of hospitalization in children with pneumonia. Six hundred children aged&#xD;
      6-36 months diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted to Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Dar&#xD;
      es Salaam, Tanzania, will participate in this study. Half of the children will receive daily&#xD;
      supplements of zinc, and the other half will receive placebo tablets (dummy pills containing&#xD;
      no medication). Each child will be followed for 6 weeks after hospital discharge to check for&#xD;
      recovery from the illness. All children in both groups will receive antibiotics and&#xD;
      supportive care to manage pneumonia, according to the standards of care at MNH and Amana&#xD;
      Municipal Hospital in accordance with the Recommendations of the Ministry of Health,&#xD;
      Tanzania.&#xD;

      Undernutrition in children less than five years of age is prevalent throughout sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa and is often associated with multiple micronutrient deficiencies, such as vitamin A&#xD;
      and zinc. These deficiencies are probably a reflection of the poverty and poor living&#xD;
      conditions that contribute to the lack of proper nutrition. The potential adverse effect of&#xD;
      even subclinical deficiency in various micronutrients (including zinc) on optimal&#xD;
      physiological function may lead to an exacerbation of infectious diseases in children living&#xD;
      in these parts of the world. The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study is to determine whether oral zinc supplementation plus standard&#xD;
      antibiotics significantly alters the duration of required hospitalization in children with&#xD;
      radiologically confirmed acute pneumonia. Six hundred children aged six months to 36 months&#xD;
      diagnosed with radiologically confirmed acute pneumonia and admitted in the general pediatric&#xD;
      wards of Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, will be recruited. Upon&#xD;
      enrollment, half of the subjects will receive daily oral supplements of 25 mg of elemental&#xD;
      zinc and the control group will receive placebo tablets. Children randomized to receive zinc&#xD;
      supplements will be given a daily dose of 25 mL of reconstituted solution from effervescent&#xD;
      tablets equivalent to 25 mg of elemental zinc in two divided doses (12.5 mg twice daily) by a&#xD;
      study coordinator during the hospital phase of treatment for pneumonia. Children randomized&#xD;
      to the control group will receive placebo effervescent tablets identical in taste and&#xD;
      appearance to those tablets containing zinc. Compliance to the regimen will be directly&#xD;
      observed by the study coordinator, and clinical response will be closely monitored throughout&#xD;
      hospital stay. Each child will be followed for six weeks after hospital discharge to assess&#xD;
      for recovery from the illness. All children in both groups will receive antibiotics and&#xD;
      supportive care to manage pneumonia, as deemed appropriate according to the standards of care&#xD;
      as practiced at MNH and Amana Municipal Hospital in accordance with the Recommendations of&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health, Tanzania.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Tachypnea: Respiratory rate greater than or equal to 50 breaths per minute for&#xD;
                  children aged 6 months up to 12 months and greater than or equal to 40 breaths&#xD;
                  per minute for children aged 12 months to 36 months.&#xD;
