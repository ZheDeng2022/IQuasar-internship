      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of telithromycin&#xD;
           over azithromycin and over cefuroxime axetil in the reduction of Streptococcus&#xD;
           pneumoniae (Sp) strains resistant to beta-lactams or macrolides at the Test of Cure&#xD;
           (TOC) visit in the sputum of patients with Sp detected at the start of the study (Visit&#xD;
           1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the superiority of telithromycin over azithromycin and over cefuroxime&#xD;
           axetil in achieving clinical cure and Sp eradication success at the Test of Cure visit&#xD;
           in patients with Sp detected in sputum specimen at the start of the study (Visit 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the clinical cure rates achieved by each treatment group in the penicillin or&#xD;
           erythromycin resistant Sp (PERSp) population with the cure rates in the sensitive Sp&#xD;
           (SSp) population at the End of Therapy (EOT) and Test of Cure visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of telithromycin, azithromycin and cefuroxime axetil at the End of&#xD;
           Therapy visit on the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to&#xD;
           beta-lactams or macrolides in the sputum of patients with Sp detected at the start of&#xD;
           the study (Visit 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the clinical efficacy at the End of Therapy visit and safety at the Test of&#xD;
           Cure visit of telithromycin, azithromycin and cefuroxime axetil in the &quot;global&quot;&#xD;
           randomized population.&#xD;
