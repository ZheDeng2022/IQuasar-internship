    <textblock>
      Acute ankle fractures are common in children. Most of these are stable and have a low risk of&#xD;
      problems in the future. Even though these fractures are benign, these injuries are often&#xD;
      casted for a fixed time period, which is inconvenient, expensive, and does not appear to be a&#xD;
      practice that has been proven to be scientifically correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, in healthy children with low-risk ankle fractures, we, the&#xD;
      investigators at the Hospital for Sick Children, will examine if a removable ankle brace is&#xD;
      at least as good as casting with respect to how well and how fast children return to their&#xD;
      usual activities. In addition, we will compare the costs of each method for the patient and&#xD;
      the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful management of low-risk fractures with an ankle brace will allow for several&#xD;
      advantages over the use of the cast. These advantages include the possibility of returning to&#xD;
      normal activities faster, fewer visits to specialty hospital clinics, and significant cost&#xD;
      savings.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine if a removable ankle brace is at least as effective as casting in&#xD;
      children between 5 and 18 years old with low-risk ankle fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Ankle injuries are very common among children. The Canadian Health Injury&#xD;
      Reporting and Prevention Program reports approximately 5500 ankle injuries per year in&#xD;
      children presenting to the 16 participating emergency departments, 35% of which are&#xD;
      fractures. The majority of ankle injuries in children, including ankle fractures, have an&#xD;
      excellent prognosis with a very low risk for any complications. We have recently shown that a&#xD;
      predefined structured 'low-risk' clinical exam reliably identifies these low risk injuries,&#xD;
      while simultaneously excluding 100% of high-risk fractures. This clinical rule reduces the&#xD;
      need for radiography in children with ankle injuries by 63%. However, all low-risk injuries&#xD;
      are currently not managed uniformly. Low-risk ankle fractures are often treated with a cast&#xD;
      while soft tissue injuries are treated in a brace. Due to this distinction in management,&#xD;
      many physicians still feel compelled to do radiographs in children with low risk ankle&#xD;
      injuries in order to identify the fractures. We will now expand our previous work to show&#xD;
      that all low risk ankle fractures can be safely treated in the same way as soft tissue&#xD;
      injuries of the ankle. The current treatment of low risk fractures is casting which is&#xD;
      inconvenient, necessitates orthopedic referral, and may be associated with soft tissue&#xD;
      complications. Furthermore, casting is not an evidence-based practice. Preliminary evidence&#xD;
      in adults with stable ankle fractures suggests that an ankle brace may offer a safe&#xD;
      alternative to casting, while allowing comparable resumption of usual activities and less&#xD;
      reliance on sub-specialty care. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to compare&#xD;
      the functional outcomes that result from ankle bracing with those from casting in children&#xD;
      with low-risk ankle fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In this randomized, outcomes assessor blinded, single center trial, children&#xD;
      diagnosed with low-risk ankle fractures will receive either an ankle brace or a below-knee&#xD;
      walking cast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure will be an assessment of functional daily&#xD;
      activities as measured by the modified performance Activities Scale for Kids (ASKp) at four&#xD;
      weeks post injury. Secondary outcomes will include an assessment of pain scores, ankle range&#xD;
      of motion and return to baseline function. A concurrent health economic evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted using both patient and health care sector costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Analysis: The null hypothesis for the primary analysis is that the brace is&#xD;
      less effective than casting by at least five percentage points on the ASKp scale. Assuming a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 10%, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2 and 10% dropout rate yields a sample size&#xD;
      of 112 patients. Secondary analyses will include Fisher's Exact test to compare proportions&#xD;
      of children with full range of motion of the injured ankle at four weeks and with full&#xD;
      baseline activity level at four months, and the area under the curve of a pain-time profile&#xD;
      curve will be compared using a Student's t-test. An economic analysis will assess the&#xD;
      incremental net benefit of bracing versus casting from a health care perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: If the removable brace is found to be at least as effective as the cast, this&#xD;
      study has the potential to standardize the treatment of all low risk ankle injuries. Since&#xD;
      these injuries can be reliably detected by physical examination, routine radiography of these&#xD;
      injuries can be eliminated. These injuries could therefore be safely treated by primary&#xD;
      physicians, thereby reducing the number of emergency department visits, obviating the need&#xD;
      for orthopedic referral, or a return visit for cast removal. As a result, this study will&#xD;
      provide critical information about the optimal treatment for the majority of ankle injuries&#xD;
      in children from the perspective of clinical efficacy and health economics.&#xD;
