      This study is intended to demonstrate that exposure to a high intensity, DC electromagnetic&#xD;
      field, as supplied by the investigational device known as the Molecular Magnetic Energizer&#xD;
      (MME), will create a clinically meaningful improvement in pain and nerve dysfunction in the&#xD;
      feet of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects up to 1/2 of diabetics, both type I and II. It&#xD;
      contributes to limb amputation, and can cause painful symptoms which are difficult to treat.&#xD;
      Application of a high intensity, DC electromagnetic field, as supplied by the investigational&#xD;
      device the Magnetic Molecular Energizer (MME) has shown in a pilot study with participants&#xD;
      having DPN in their feet, to have created significant improvement in painful symptoms and&#xD;
      improved measures of neurologic function in 7 of 10 participants. This study will enroll&#xD;
      participants and evaluate them at baseline with regard to pain levels, nerve function and&#xD;
      quality of life. They will then be randomized to receive 120 hr exposure to either active MME&#xD;
      procedure, or sham procedure. Following the 120 hrs the participants will then receive the&#xD;
      same evaluation for pain level, nerve function and quality of life. These evaluations will be&#xD;
      repeated a final time 6 months following. The participants will be blinded to whether they&#xD;
      receive the active or sham procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MME procedure consists of laying on a bed with the feet lying in the space between two&#xD;
      large electromagnetic coils which, when activated, produce a DC magnetic field measuring 5000&#xD;
      gauss. The participants will lay on the bed with feet in the magnetic field for 8 to 12 hours&#xD;
      a day for 10 to 16 days in succession. Breaks are allowed, and no restraints are required.&#xD;
      The procedure may be done at night so that participants may sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment will be done by self assessment using rating with the Visual Analogue Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurologic function will be assessed with Cutaneous Perception Threshold testing using the&#xD;
      Neurometer, a commercially available, FDA approved device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life assessment will be by the Neuropathy Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire.&#xD;
