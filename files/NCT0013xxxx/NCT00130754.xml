      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for a growing number of&#xD;
      malignant and non-malignant indications. Until recently, myeloablative in conjunction with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive conditioning was considered mandatory for the elimination of malignant&#xD;
      hematopoietic cells and to prevent graft rejection. The aim of allogeneic non-myeloablative&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation (NST) is to induce host-to-graft tolerance with fast and durable&#xD;
      engraftment of donor stem cells, by means of conditioning, which is well-tolerated by&#xD;
      patients. The rationale behind the NST strategy is to induce optimal graft-versus-leukemia&#xD;
      (GVL) effects for the elimination of all malignant cells by alloreactive immunocompetent&#xD;
      cells from a matched donor as an alternative to standard high-dose myeloablative chemo&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The NST protocol is therefore mainly based on immunosuppression and thus&#xD;
      contains fludarabine, low dose busulfan and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG). Thymoglobuline&#xD;
      is a polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for human T cells used in organ transplantation for&#xD;
      induction of tolerance and rejection prevention and treatment. It was also used in stem-cell&#xD;
      transplantation (SCT) for the same purposes (e.g. for generation of tolerance and rejection&#xD;
      preclusion) as well as a treatment for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Data from&#xD;
      myeloablative protocols suggest that ATG before SCT significantly reduces the risk for grade&#xD;
      III-IV acute GVHD. This does not translate to a reduction in transplant-related mortality&#xD;
      (TRM) because of the increased risk for infections and thus survival is unchanged. Extensive&#xD;
      chronic GVHD was also significantly shown to be reduced in patients receiving ATG in the&#xD;
      myeloablative setting. However, the role of ATG in the NST protocol was never evaluated in a&#xD;
      prospective randomized trial. In view of the preliminary data suggesting of an additive&#xD;
      effect of ATG in these circumstances we, the investigators at Hadassah Medical Organization,&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of ATG in NST by a prospective randomized trial.&#xD;

      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from a fully matched donor is the treatment of&#xD;
      choice for a growing number of malignant and non-malignant indications. Until recently,&#xD;
      myeloablative in conjunction with immunosuppressive conditioning was considered mandatory for&#xD;
      the elimination of malignant hematopoietic cells and to prevent graft rejection. The aim of&#xD;
      allogeneic non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) is to induce host-to-graft&#xD;
      tolerance with fast and durable engraftment of donor stem cells, by means of conditioning,&#xD;
      which is well-tolerated by patients. The rationale behind the NST strategy is to induce&#xD;
      optimal graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects for the elimination of all malignant cells by&#xD;
      alloreactive immunocompetent cells from a matched donor as an alternative to standard&#xD;
      high-dose myeloablative chemo radiotherapy. The NST protocol is therefore mainly based on&#xD;
      immunosuppression and thus contains fludarabine, low dose busulfan and anti-T-lymphocyte&#xD;

      protocol was never evaluated in a prospective randomized trial. In view of the preliminary&#xD;
      data suggesting of an additive effect of ATG in these circumstances we propose the following&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To evaluate the effect of ATG vs. no ATG on the incidence of GVHD in patients&#xD;
      undergoing NST.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Secondary end points -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to acute GVHD.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Transplant-related toxicity (TRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients with fully matched donors will be included. Patients will be randomized for two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who will get rabbit anti-human T lymphocyte globulin (thymoglobuline R,&#xD;
           SangStat) as a part of pre-transplant conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who will not get rabbit anti-human T lymphocyte globulin (thymoglobuline R,&#xD;
           SangStat) as a part of pre-transplant conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by GENZYME Israel Ltd. The center will send a randomization form&#xD;
      to GENZYME Israel by fax and the company will fax back the randomization status of the&#xD;
      patient. Randomization will be preformed up to day -10 pre-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;

           antigenemia; evidence of bone marrow disease; unable to donate bone marrow or peripheral&#xD;
           blood due to concurrent medical condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be prepared by the NST protocol (I.V.fludarabine 30mg/m2/day [on days -10&#xD;
      to -5] and oral busulfan 4mg/kg in 4 divided daily doses [on days -6 and -5] or I.V. Busulfex&#xD;
      a dose of 3.2 mg\kg on days -6 and -5,with or without I.V. ATG according to randomization&#xD;
      group [on days -4 to -1]). ATG dosing schedule: a cumulative dose of 7.5 mg/kg ATG will be&#xD;
      given with the following program - 0.5 mg/kg day -4, 2.0 mg/kg day -3, 2.5 mg/kg day -2, 2.5&#xD;
      mg/kg day -1. Each day's infusion time will be 8 hours. The last dose on day -1 should be&#xD;
      given within 24 hours pre the stem cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to NST, all patients will receive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (10 mg/kg/d&#xD;
      trimethoprim) in days -10 to -2, acyclovir (500 mg/m2 x 3/day) from days -6 until day +100,&#xD;
      and allopurinol (300 mg/day) on days -10 to -1. Administration of&#xD;
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (twice weekly) will be reinstituted after recovery from&#xD;
      neutropenia as a preventive measure against pneumocystis carinii infection. Starting on day&#xD;
      -8, patients are monitored with a pp65 antigenemia/CMV PCR on a weekly basis to detect&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV). Two consecutive positive PCR results or one antigenemia with more then&#xD;
      one cell positive for pp65 serve as an indication for replacing acyclovir with ganciclovir 10&#xD;
      mg/kg/day until minimum of two negative tests are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutropenic patients with culture-negative fever receive a combination of gentamicin,&#xD;
      cefazolin and piperacillin, as a first line antibiotic protocol. Persisting fever are treated&#xD;
      with amikacin and tazocin as a second line protocol, while meropenem and vancomycin are used&#xD;
      as the third line protocol. In cases of persistent fever not responding to antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      within 5 days, amphotericin B (0.7 mg/kg/d) is added until the neutropenia resolves. No&#xD;
      antifungal prophylaxis will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisting of single-drug low-dose, short- term&#xD;
      cyclosporine- A (CSP) 3 mg/kg i.v. daily in two divided doses starting on day -4. Once the&#xD;
      patients are mobile CSP will be administered orally. CSP dosage will be tapered during the&#xD;
      second or third month post transplant, according to chimeric status and evidence of GVHD and&#xD;
      then gradually stopped unless the patient will develop GVHD or graft failure. Immediately&#xD;
      upon the appearance of signs and symptoms of GVHD, i.v. methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg) and CSP&#xD;
      will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBSC donors will be injected subcutaneously with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      (G-Neupogen, 5 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days) and mobilized peripheral blood stem cells will&#xD;
      be collected on days 5 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engraftment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st day of PBSC infusion is designated as &quot;day 0&quot;. Engraftment is defined as&#xD;
      ANC&gt;0.5x10^9/L and peripheral WBC&gt;1x1^09/L for 3 consecutive days and unsupported&#xD;
      platelets&gt;25x10^9/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chimerism:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chimerism will be assessed by standard cytogenetic analysis in male/female donor-recipient.&#xD;
      Residual male cells in female chimera will be detected by amelogenine gene method. In&#xD;
      sex-matched donor-recipient combinations, the various number of tandem repeats (VNTR)&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a 5% sensitivity of detection will be used to assess the&#xD;
      presence of residual host or donor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft versus host disease (GVHD):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute and chronic GVHD will be graded according to the International Stem Cell&#xD;
      Transplantation Registry (ISCTR) severity index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft rejection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft rejection is defined as peripheral blood aplasia and marrow hypoplasia &gt; 21 days&#xD;
      post-transplant, with no evidence of donor markers revealed by cytogenetic and molecular&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant-related mortality (TRM):&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRM is defined as mortality occurring due to the transplant procedure, with the patient in&#xD;
      complete remission from the beginning of conditioning to day +100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant-related toxicity (TRT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All nonhematological toxicities, including multi-organ dysfunction from day 0 to +100, are&#xD;
      considered as regimen-related toxicity and graded according to the criteria of Bearman et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of follow-up: study will be ended 1-year post transplant.&#xD;
