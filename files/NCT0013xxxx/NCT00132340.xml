    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating&#xD;
      primary dystonia. Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause uncontrolled twisting&#xD;
      and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. Medical therapies are available, but not all&#xD;
      patients get adequate relief from the abnormal movements or the pain associated with them.&#xD;
      DBS is a surgical procedure that interrupts neuronal circuits in the globus pallidus interna&#xD;
      (Gpi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) - areas of the basal ganglia of the brain that do not&#xD;
      work correctly in patients with dystonia. This results in decreased movement and therefore&#xD;
      may lessen patients' symptoms and pain. The study will also examine the physiology of&#xD;
      dystonia and determine whether the treatment effects of DBS in the Gpi differ significantly&#xD;
      from DBS of the STN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with primary cervical dystonia that does not respond to&#xD;
      medical treatment or botulinum toxin (Botox) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with blood and urine tests, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI, see below) of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant undergoes the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging. This procedure is done after implantation of the stimulators&#xD;
           to verify position of the electrodes. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to&#xD;
           produce images of the brain. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner&#xD;
           (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that&#xD;
           occur during the scanning process. The procedure usually lasts about 45 to 90 minutes,&#xD;
           during which the patient is asked to lie still for up to 15 minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation. This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is&#xD;
           held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a&#xD;
           magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the patient may be&#xD;
           asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The stimulation&#xD;
           may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the patient may hear a click&#xD;
           and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. During the stimulation,&#xD;
           electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer, using electrodes attached to&#xD;
           the skin with tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurologic evaluation. Before and after DBS, the patient's dystonia is measured with a&#xD;
           standardized rating scale called the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Scale&#xD;
           (TWSTRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DBS treatment. Patients are randomly assigned to have electrodes implanted in either the&#xD;
           Gpi or STN area of the basal ganglia. The electrodes are what stimulate the brain in DBS&#xD;
           therapy. Before surgery, a frame is secured to the patient's head, and an MRI scan is&#xD;
           done. DBS involves making two small incisions and two small holes in the skull, opening&#xD;
           the lining around the brain, locating the Gpi or STN, securing the electrodes in place,&#xD;
           and connecting them to the pulse generator that is placed under the skin below the&#xD;
           collar bone. In addition, during the surgery, the patient is asked to move certain&#xD;
           muscles. The muscle activity is recorded to gain a better understanding of the&#xD;
           physiology of movement. After surgery, MRI scans are done to confirm placement of the&#xD;
           electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulation and evaluation. After surgery, patients' movements are evaluated during and&#xD;
           after stimulation. The changes in movement and function are videotaped and scored&#xD;
           according to a rating scale. The optimal stimulation settings are determined and the&#xD;
           stimulators are adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurologic evaluations with the TWSTRS scale are repeated at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery, and the stimulators are adjusted as needed. Some of the evaluations are videotaped.&#xD;

      Objective: For patients with cervical dystonia who have failed medical therapy, stereotactic&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (Gpi) or subthalamic nucleus&#xD;
      (STN) can provide significant symptom improvement, but it is not known which site provides&#xD;
      maximum benefit or the physiologic mechanisms by which these improvements may occur. The&#xD;
      study goals are to determine if DBS of Gpi or STN provides significant clinical improvement&#xD;
      in patients with primary cervical dystonia, whether the anatomic DBS site (if either)&#xD;
      provides optimal improvement, and to gain deeper insight into the underlying pathophysiology&#xD;
      of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients with medically refractory primary cervical dystonia will&#xD;
      make-up the study population. Patients with primary cervical dystonia suffer a wide range of&#xD;
      symptoms including physical deformity, speech difficulties, swallowing dysfunction, visual&#xD;
      problems, and intractable pain, which can result in an inability to care for themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: We propose placing DBS electrodes (using microelectrode guidance) bilaterally into&#xD;
      either the Gpi or STN of medically refractory cervical dystonia patients. Physiological&#xD;
      studies will be performed and compared with clinical changes to understand the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of DBS and underlying pathophysiology of cervical dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Clinical effectiveness of DBS of the Gpi or STN will be measured by the&#xD;
      Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Scale and monitored over time to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of DBS and if there is an ideal anatomic stimulation site. Electrophysiologic&#xD;
      outcome measures will be obtained to determine the underlying pathophysiology of cervical&#xD;
      dystonia, and the mechanism of action of DBS.&#xD;
