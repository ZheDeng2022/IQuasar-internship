    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects (good and bad) that the combination of&#xD;
      the drugs letrozole (also called Femara™) and trastuzumab (also called Herceptin®) has on&#xD;
      breast cancer. The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration has approved both&#xD;
      letrozole and Herceptin for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Doctors hope that the&#xD;
      combination will work better than either drug alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since ER function is regulated by peptide growth factor signaling, the phenotype of ER&#xD;
      positive tumors may be influenced by the expression of growth factors and growth factor&#xD;
      receptors. A potential interaction between ErbB2 (HER2/neu) expression and the success of&#xD;
      endocrine therapy has been examined. ErbB2 expression was shown to correlate with resistance&#xD;
      to hormone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An inverse relationship between endocrine therapy responsiveness and ErbB2 expression has not&#xD;
      been observed in all studies. This may be due to discordant ER status between the primary&#xD;
      tumor and metastatic sites. ER status can be discordant in approximately 20% of cases, with a&#xD;
      tendency for metastatic disease to become ER negative with time. Data concerning ErbB2 is&#xD;
      more limited, but there may be similar lack of concordance between primary tumor and&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition of ErbB2 signaling may slow the development of resistance to estrogen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy by inhibiting a pathway that promotes estrogen independent growth. The ErbB2 signal&#xD;
      transduction pathway bypasses the requirement for estrogen for breast epithelial cell growth.&#xD;
      When ErbB2 is activated in ER positive breast cancer cells in vitro, ER becomes&#xD;
      phosphorylated and capable of stimulating transcription without estrogen. Chronic activation&#xD;
      with heregulin, a ligand for the ErbB family of receptors, leads to ER down-regulation and&#xD;
      the acquisition of an ER negative phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogen deprivation therapy with selective aromatase inhibitors (SAIs) has become the&#xD;
      standard of care for postmenopausal women with tamoxifen-resistant advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
      About 1/3 of patients benefit from this therapy. There is interest in treating endocrine&#xD;
      therapy refractory breast cancer with the recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody trastuzumab. When given alone, trastuzumab has an endocrine therapy-like risk&#xD;
      benefit ratio. Trastuzumab targets ErbB2 (HER2/neu). Some breast cancers may coexpress ER and&#xD;
      ErbB2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole (Femara™) is a highly selective oral non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. According&#xD;
      to in vitro data, letrozole is 170-fold more potent in inhibiting aromatase than&#xD;
      aminoglutethimide (AG) and 19-fold more active than anastrozole. Letrozole effectively&#xD;
      inhibits intratumoral aromatase according to in vitro and in vivo data. It is indicated for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced breast carcinoma in post-menopausal women who have failed prior&#xD;
      anti-estrogen therapy. Final FDA approval was granted in 1997. In two randomized phase&#xD;
      IIb/III studies in patients previously treated with an antiestrogen, 19.5% and 23.6% of&#xD;
      patients achieved an objective response with letrozole 2.5 mg/day compared with 12.4%&#xD;
      receiving AG and 16.4% of patients receiving megace. Median overall survival was increased in&#xD;
      the letrozole 2.5 mg/day group by 8 months compared to AG and by 3 months compared to megace.&#xD;
      The lower 0.5 mg/day dose of letrozole was associated with poorer response rates and overall&#xD;
      survival in both studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) was approved in 1998. A trial of trastuzumab as a single agent for&#xD;
      first line treatment of advanced disease has been reported. Response rate in the first 62&#xD;
      patients was 24%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the proportion of patients with ER and/or&#xD;
      PR positive, ErbB2 positive tamoxifen resistant metastatic breast cancer who achieve complete&#xD;
      remission or partial remission or no significant change in lesion size for &gt; 24 weeks from a&#xD;
      combination of letrozole and trastuzumab. The study will also determine duration of response&#xD;
      and median time to progression, evaluate toxicity, generate a tumor and serum bank, and&#xD;
      analyze ErbB2 expression on circulating malignant cells during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 35 patients&#xD;
