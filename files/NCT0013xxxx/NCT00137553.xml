    <textblock>
      Children participating in a study evaluating the efficacy of chloroquine and amodiaquine for&#xD;
      the treatment of malaria will, if getting malaria during follow-up, be re-treated with&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in accordance with the recommendations of the National Malaria&#xD;
      Programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the actual efficacy of SP with that in 1995 - 1996 we, the investigators of the&#xD;
      Bandim Health Project, will visit these children once a week for 5 weeks. A finger prick&#xD;
      blood sample will be collected for a malaria test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with malaria during follow-up will be treated according to the guidelines of the&#xD;
      Bandim Health Centre.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Bandim Health Project studies the efficacy of different treatment regimens for malaria in&#xD;
      children. If the included children during follow-up get malaria again they are, according to&#xD;
      the recommendations of the National Malaria Programme, treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine&#xD;
      (SP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1995 - 1996 the efficacy of this re-treatment regimen was evaluated in the same area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if treatment with SP is still efficient we want to follow children included in a&#xD;
      study comparing treatment with chloroquine and amodiaquine having recrudescent malaria for 35&#xD;
      days following the re-treatment with SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with reappearing parasitaemia will be treated with SP. If accepting to participate&#xD;
      in this study the children will be visited once a week and a capillary blood sample will be&#xD;
      drawn. The blood sample taken on the day of reappearing parasitaemia in the&#xD;
      chloroquine/amodiaquine study will be used as the day 0 blood sample in the SP-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the child gets malaria during the follow-up he will be treated according to the guidelines&#xD;
      of the Bandim Health Centre. All treatment during follow-up will be free.&#xD;
