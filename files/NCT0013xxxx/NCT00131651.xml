      The purpose of this study is to determine an active dose of ATN-161 for future studies while&#xD;
      establishing preliminary evidence of effectiveness in patients with renal cell cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis, defined as the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is a&#xD;
      requirement for the growth of nearly all tumors. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) is a&#xD;
      malignancy characterized by abundant vascularization and a high degree of resistance to&#xD;
      chemotherapy which makes antiangiogenic therapy an intriguing concept for treatment. This&#xD;
      concept has been established by the initial successes observed in recent studies of&#xD;
      antiangiogenic therapies for CCRCC. ATN-161 is an attractive candidate for investigation as a&#xD;
      therapeutic agent in CCRCC because it binds to several fully activated integrins, which are&#xD;
      essential downstream components in the angiogenic signaling cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional imaging using dceMRI has been demonstrated as an effective way to show effects on&#xD;
      the vasculature across different tumors, including CCRCC. Preclinical experiments have shown&#xD;
      that ATN-161 affects tumor perfusion in tumor bearing mice. Therefore, use of imaging in this&#xD;
      study is expected to be an effective method for evaluating the antiangiogenic response to&#xD;
      ATN-161.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be administered ATN-161 three times weekly by short (10 minute) IV infusion at&#xD;
      1 of 3 dose levels (20, 100, and 600 mg). Patients will be treated until progression of&#xD;
      disease, unacceptable drug toxicity, or withdrawal of consent occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional imaging (dceMRI) will be performed within 1 week prior to first treatment, again&#xD;
      during the second week of treatment, and finally during the fourth week of treatment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have unresectable and/or metastatic kidney cancer with a component of&#xD;
             clear cell adenocarcinoma that is histologically confirmed. A pathologist at the&#xD;
             investigator's institution must have reviewed the material sent by outside&#xD;
             institutions and confirm the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have been previously treated with at least one FDA-approved therapy or&#xD;
             commonly used treatment (such as interferon or low dose interleukin-2) for advanced&#xD;
             kidney cancer. Any number of other prior treatments, approved or investigational, is&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20&#xD;
             mm with conventional techniques or as 2 times the measurable slice width with spiral&#xD;
             CT scan. See RECIST Appendix B for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have at least one lesion amenable to dceMRI as per lesion guidelines&#xD;
             (see Section 8.1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have recovered from the reversible effects of prior treatment (with the&#xD;
             exception of alopecia) by returning to normal or mild severity (Grade 1) or their&#xD;
             pre-treatment baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Life expectancy of greater than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (≤2.5&#xD;
                  x ULN for patients with liver metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  alkaline phosphatase ≤5.0 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum calcium ≤1 x ULN (the patient may be on treatment for hypercalcemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The effects of ATN 161 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown. For this reason and because antiangiogenic agents are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal and/or barrier method of&#xD;
             birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation through the follow up visit 28 days after the last dose of ATN 161.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Similarly, if the partner&#xD;
             of a male patient should become pregnant while he is participating in this study, he&#xD;
             should inform his treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have not recovered from reversible adverse events due to&#xD;
             previously-administered agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be receiving any agents, approved or investigational, for the&#xD;
             treatment of CCRCC, and may not be receiving any investigational agents for other&#xD;
             conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with documented brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
             Institutional practices should be followed to establish the absence of brain&#xD;
             metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ATN 161 is an antiangiogenic agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with ATN 161, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with ATN 161.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who cannot undergo dceMRI analysis for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who do not have adequate wound healing based on clinical judgment following a&#xD;
             major surgical intervention.&#xD;
