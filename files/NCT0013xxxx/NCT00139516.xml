      The study has two objectives/aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the efficacy of the intervention among adult smokers with cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus related illnesses (later modified to Chinese&#xD;
      adults with and without diseases); and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine a set of measures (background, general health, psychosocial, and smoking&#xD;
      process) that are associated with smoking cessation at 6 and 12 months&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of smoking cessation intervention among hospitalized patients with CVD and pulmonary&#xD;
      disease produced varying cessation rates, ranging from 20 to 51% among patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, from 22 to 71% among survivors of coronary disease and as much as 80%&#xD;
      among lung cancer patients (3-8). Recently published Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Guideline (1) provides detailed evaluation and synthesis of evidence-based&#xD;
      components of effective smoking cessation interventions and summary results for selected&#xD;
      treatment modalities are presented in Table 1. Face-to-face counsel, strong advice from&#xD;
      physician or nurse, the number of reinforcing sessions and duration of these sessions were&#xD;
      related to success (9). Compared to no treatment, estimated abstinence rates for treatment&#xD;
      modalities ranged from 10.2% to 26.5%. Thus, use of combination treatment modalities in&#xD;
      smoking cessation intervention is expected to result in higher abstinence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed four-year prospective, randomized clinical trial with 12 months follow-up, will&#xD;
      test the efficacy of a culturally and linguistically tailored physician directed, nurse&#xD;
      managed, smoking cessation and relapse prevention intervention among Chinese smokers. The&#xD;
      study has two aims: 1) To test the efficacy of the intervention among smokers; and 2) To&#xD;
      examine a set of measures (background, general health, psychosocial, and smoking process)&#xD;
      that are associated with smoking cessation at 6 and 12 months. Subjects who smoked in the 3&#xD;
      months prior to admission at 6 San Francisco Bay Area hospitals (1 university, 4 private and&#xD;
      1 county) will be screened, recruited and randomized to one of two interventions: a)&#xD;
      Intensive [n=190] (physician advice, bedside counseling with a family member, 5 telephone&#xD;
      contacts within 90 days, with nicotine replacement therapy and one repeat relapse counseling&#xD;
      with 1 more telephone contact for relapsers). b) Minimal [n=190] (physician advice and a&#xD;
      self-help manual). Random assignment will be stratified by recruitment site, gender and&#xD;
      disease category. Primary outcomes include biochemically confirmed abstinence and quit&#xD;
      attempts at 6 and 12 months. Power calculation is based on 15% difference in abstinence rates&#xD;
      between the two intervention groups. The findings from this propose study will yield&#xD;
      significant knowledge for effectively treating Chinese smokers and will provide insight into&#xD;
      treatment for smokers of other racial and ethnic minorities that is likely to have&#xD;
      significant public health impact by reducing health disparities among US sub-populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized clinical trial with 12-month follow-up linguistically tailored,&#xD;
      nurse-managed smoking cessation and relapse prevention trial. It involves several stages in&#xD;
      the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Recruitment - verify eligibility criteria and making phone appointment for&#xD;
      face-to-face baseline interview and individualized counseling session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Baseline face-to-face interview either in a hospital setting for inpatients, or in&#xD;
      an office setting for those who were not inpatients - explain study, obtained informed&#xD;
      consent, conducting baseline survey and randomized patients into one of two research arms:&#xD;
      Intensive or minimal. Intensive patients will receive a specific set of interventions and&#xD;
      asked to contract a quit date, whereas minimal subjects will receive the usual care and&#xD;
      advice to quit from the research staff and their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: For subjects randomized to the intensive group, they will receive a set of&#xD;
      intervention support phone calls for their quit-smoking efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4: Outcome Measurement - All subjects will receive 6- and 12-month phone calls and&#xD;
      saliva samples will be collected to verify non-smoking status. At six months - interim&#xD;
      outcome, at 12 months - final outcome measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Pretest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted pretest of the translated materials using individual interviews to ascertain&#xD;
      their face validity. Participants for the cognitive pretest were either bilingual or fluent&#xD;
      in either English or Chinese. These participants will include both current and recent&#xD;
      ex-smokers from the community who speak either Mandarin or Cantonese (the two most commonly&#xD;
      spoken Chinese dialects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the minimal intervention group will receive physician advice and a&#xD;
      standard self-help manual, either an English version of &quot;Freedom From Smoking&quot; from the&#xD;
      American Lung Association (ALA), or a Chinese version &quot;Victory over Smoking,&quot; (see attached).&#xD;
      The physician advice consists of a strong message urging the patient to quit smoking (see&#xD;
      attached). Physicians will be prompted to deliver a 1- to 2-minute unequivocal scripted&#xD;
      message about the necessity to quit smoking. For the inpatients, a 1-page prototype Physician&#xD;
      Advice Statement will be placed in the progress notes section of the patient's medical record&#xD;
      to serve as a physician reminder. For the outpatients, if the first counseling session is&#xD;
      done outside of the physician's office setting, the 1-page prototype will be faxed to the&#xD;
      physician's office to notify the physician and to remind them to counsel the study subjects.&#xD;
      If the counseling is done in the physician's office, the 1-page prototype will be given&#xD;
      directly to the patients physician or be placed inside the office chart in his absence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intensive group will receive the nurse- or health educator-managed&#xD;
      smoking cessation and relapse prevention intervention. The intensive intervention has two&#xD;
      periods: initial counseling session and follow-up phone support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Counseling Session - Patients in the intensive group will receive the scripted&#xD;
      physician advice as well as an endorsement from their physicians about the nurse/health&#xD;
      educator-managed smoking cessation intervention. A nurse/health educator-mediated behavioral&#xD;
      counseling will be provided after obtaining the baseline smoking history and determining&#xD;
      self-efficacy for smoking cessation. The 60- to 90-minute nurse/patient educator-managed&#xD;
      intervention includes components of patient education, skill building and relapse prevention&#xD;
      counseling. During this session, the patient will be given individually-tailored counseling&#xD;
      based on his/her baseline assessment information. They will also be given a 20-minute smoking&#xD;
      cessation video in Chinese, a Chinese workbook Victory over Smoking self-help manual, based&#xD;
      on the Freedom From Smoking workbook from the American Lung Association, and a 15-minute&#xD;
      relaxation audiotape in Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the primary focus of the intervention is a cognitive behavioral intervention,&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) will be offered to patients who do not have medical&#xD;
      contraindications to the NRT and: a) meet the criteria for nicotine dependency; or b) are&#xD;
      noted by the nurses to have severe withdrawal symptoms (inpatients) or self-report severe&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms during previous quit attempts,; c) relapse after the initial counseling;&#xD;
      and d) smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in either group who have been smoking within the 7 days prior to the time of the&#xD;
      interview, 2-3 cc of saliva will be collected from them for studying the metabolic rate of&#xD;
      cotinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be offered NRT by trained nurse/health educators, in the form of gum (Nicorette&#xD;
      2 or 4 mg) or patch (Nicoderm 14 or 21 mg), depending on patients' preference. We will obtain&#xD;
      the approval from each subject's physician before providing NRT. Upon physician consent,&#xD;
      patients will be instructed in the correct use of nicotine patch or gum by nurses/health&#xD;
      educators using an 8-week protocol for both the nicotine patch and gum) [see NRT protocol].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Counseling Period (from 2 to 90 days) - During this period, the nurses/health educators&#xD;
      will contact patients in the intensive group beginning 48 hours post discharge for the&#xD;
      inpatients, and 48 hours post patients' quit dates for the outpatients. Additional calls are&#xD;
      made at 7-, 21-, 45- and 90-day intervals during the period of greatest risk for relapse (9).&#xD;
      Reinforcements for proper nutrition, physical activity and enlisting support from family&#xD;
      members and friends will be provided during each 10-minutes telephone follow-up contact. If&#xD;
      the subjects relapse during the first 90-day period of enrollment (identified through&#xD;
      scheduled telephone calls by nurses/ health educators), they will be offered one additional&#xD;
      intervention telephone call. The purpose of this call is to review the smoking cessation&#xD;
      materials that had been originally presented to the subject, to continue problem solving with&#xD;
      the subject regarding high-risk situations that led to relapse, and to reinforce the&#xD;
      importance of quitting smoking permanently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary focus of our intervention is in cognitive behavioral intervention. Nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy is only one component of the intensive intervention. Because NRT is&#xD;
      considered a standard of care, we are not proposing to withhold NRT but rather will not offer&#xD;
      the medication as part of the minimal intervention. Regardless of the intervention arms,&#xD;
      participants will be able to take NRT either on their own or as prescribed by their&#xD;
      clinicians. The nurse/health educator will record the use of NRT among all the other&#xD;
      participants who are treated with NRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Follow-up Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, all subjects will be reassessed by scripted telephone interviews at 6&#xD;
      and 12 months (see attached). Each telephone call will take approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Nurses/health educators will be blinded to group assignment as they made follow-up calls.&#xD;
      Initial questions assess smoking status and categorize each subject into one of three&#xD;
      categories: nonsmoker (had not smoked since the initial counseling session or the last&#xD;
      telephone call), relapser (had smoked since the initial counseling session or the last&#xD;
      telephone call but not on a continuous basis), or continuous smoker (had smoked daily for the&#xD;
      past 7 days). After each assessment, a saliva sample collection kit will be mailed out to the&#xD;
      non-smoking participants with instructions and a postage-paid envelope for return.&#xD;
      Participants who have not returned their cotinine within 15 days will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;
