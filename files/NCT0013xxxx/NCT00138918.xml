    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the effects of combined therapy with androgen ablation&#xD;
      and OGX-011 (an antisense to clusterin) given prior to radical prostatectomy on pathologic&#xD;
      complete response rates in men with localized prostate cancer and high risk features.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clusterin as an anti-apoptotic cytoprotective chaperone protein upregulated in an adaptive&#xD;
      cell survival manner that confers resistance to various cell death triggers, including&#xD;
      hormone-, radiation-, and chemotherapy. In pre-clinical models, inhibition of clusterin&#xD;
      expression using the second generation antisense OGX-011 can enhance cell death following&#xD;
      treatment with androgen ablation, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. In phase I clinical trials,&#xD;
      OGX-011 has been well tolerated and a biologically effective dose has been identified in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, non-blinded, phase II clinical, tissue pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic study of weekly OGX-011 and neoadjuvant hormone therapy prior to radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate carcinoma and high-risk features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effects of combined neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) and OGX-011 prior to&#xD;
           radical prostatectomy on pathologic complete response rates in men with high risk&#xD;
           localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify changes in clusterin expression in residual prostate cancer after treatment&#xD;
           with NHT and OGX-011.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure levels of full length OGX-011 in prostate tissues after 3 months of NHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability toxicity of 3 months of OGX-011 and NHT prior to&#xD;
           radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure evidence of OGX-011's effect on clusterin expression in patient peripheral&#xD;
           blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure evidence of OGX-011's effect on patient clusterin serum levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effects of combined NHT and OGX-011 on time to PSA nadir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine PSA recurrence rates after combined NHT and OGX-011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, previously untreated&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Potential candidate for radical prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any one of the following criteria (minimum of 2 positive biopsies):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical stage T3&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gleason score 7-10&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gleason score 6 and &gt; 3 positive biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ECOG performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. WBC ≥ 3.0 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Hemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. PTT, INR, AST, ALT, creatinine, total bilirubin within normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 45 newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients with clinically localized,&#xD;
      high-risk prostate carcinoma will be entered into this trial. These patients will receive&#xD;
      neoadjuvant hormone therapy (buserelin 9.9 mg subcutaneously x 1 injection with flutamide 250&#xD;
      mg orally T.I.D. for the first 4 weeks only) for 12 weeks in combination with OGX-011 (a&#xD;
      2'MOE phosphorothioate clusterin antisense oligonucleotide) weekly on a 4 week cycle for 3&#xD;
      courses. For week one, cycle one only, OGX-011 will be given on Days 1, 3 and 5. OGX-011 is&#xD;
      given at a dose of 640 mg by intravenous infusion over 2 hours. Radical prostatectomy will&#xD;
      take place within 14 days of the last dose of OGX-011.&#xD;
