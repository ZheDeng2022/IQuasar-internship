  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma. The main&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to see how their disease responds to consolidation treatment&#xD;
      (treatment aimed at further decreasing cancer cells) with a radioactive antibody (protein)&#xD;
      called iodine I 131 tositumomab (known by the tradename BexxarÂ®) and also to look at the side&#xD;
      effects which occur with this type of treatment. The investigators will also be looking at&#xD;
      how long disease responds to treatment, if it responds at all, and how long patients who have&#xD;
      had this treatment survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bexxar is a monoclonal antibody (protein) to which radioactive iodine 131 is attached. The&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody in Bexxar (tositumomab), targets a protein called CD20 found on the&#xD;
      surface of a variety of B-cells, including lymphoma cells, and some myeloma cells. The&#xD;
      antibody is given as an infusion and finds its way to these cells. The radioactive iodine&#xD;
      attached to the antibody delivers radiation directly to these cells which works to harm or&#xD;
      kill the cancer cells. Approximately 20-25% of patients with multiple myeloma have this&#xD;
      protein on the surface of their tumor cells. In addition, this protein was found on the&#xD;
      surface of myeloma stem cells. While myeloma stem cells represent a minority of all myeloma&#xD;
      cells (less than 5%), these cells are resistant to chemotherapy and are believed to be&#xD;
      responsible for a recurrence of the disease after chemotherapy. In this study, Bexxar will be&#xD;
      used after patients complete a course of chemotherapy and have residual myeloma cells left in&#xD;
      their body. The Investigators are hoping that the treatment with Bexxar will decrease and&#xD;
      possibly eliminate residual myeloma cells resistant to chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is ranked second in hematological malignancies in the United States (Munshi&#xD;
      et al., 2001). Because no curable option exists, patients with early stage disease are&#xD;
      typically observed without treatment until the disease progresses or symptoms appear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of patients will respond to initial chemotherapy, however, all treated patients&#xD;
      repeatedly relapse with shorter remissions following each subsequent course of chemotherapy&#xD;
      (Rajkumar et al., 2002a). Regimens most commonly used for initial therapy include melphalan&#xD;
      and prednisone (MP), which induce remission in approximately 50% of patients (Alexanian et&#xD;
      al., 1969), VAD-vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone with response rates in the 50%&#xD;
      range (Salmon et al., 1994; Barlogie et al., 1984; Alexanian et al., 1986), dexamethasone&#xD;
      pulses, and more recently introduced combinations of thalidomide with dexamethasone (Rajkumar&#xD;
      et al., 2002b; Weber et al., 2003). All these regimens have comparable response rates. With&#xD;
      the exception of the recent report, which showed a superior response rate to the combination&#xD;
      of thalidomide with dexamethasone versus dexamethasone pulses (Rajkumar et al., 2004),&#xD;
      multiple other comparative studies did not show superiority of any of these regimens for&#xD;
      overall survival. Complete responses to any of these regimens are observed infrequently (&lt;&#xD;
      5%). Patients who complete initial therapy, usually proceed to high dose chemotherapy with&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant support. Alternatively, patients may be placed on maintenance&#xD;
      regimen or can be observed. Except for one study with alternate day high dose of Prednisone&#xD;
      (Berenson et al., 2002), no convincing evidence exists that maintenance impacts the natural&#xD;
      history of the disease (Kyle, 2002; The Myeloma Trialists' Collaborative Group, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      High dose chemotherapy has been used as consolidation in multiple myeloma by a number of&#xD;
      investigators (Barlogie et al., 1986; Cunningham et al., 1994; Harousseau et al., 1995). A&#xD;
      randomized trial conducted by French Myeloma Intergroup (IFM 90) provided evidence that&#xD;
      treatment with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) after&#xD;
      initial therapy results in significantly longer event-free survival (median 28 vs. 18 months)&#xD;
      and overall survival (57 vs. 42 months) if compared to conventional chemotherapy (Attal et&#xD;
      al., 1996). The benefit of auto transplantation was seen in patients of all ages (Siegel et&#xD;
      al., 1999). More recently, similar results were reported from a large randomized study in&#xD;
      Great Britain (Childs et al., 2003). Based on these studies, in patients eligible for&#xD;
      transplant, consolidation of initial therapy with high dose therapy followed by ASCT is&#xD;
      considered a standard of care (NCCN Guidelines 2004). However, ASCT is not curative even in&#xD;
      patients who achieve complete response (CR), which is observed in 20-30% of patients who&#xD;
      completed ASCT. Contamination of autologous stem cell collection with malignant myeloma cells&#xD;
      may play some role. In support of this notion, syngeneic bone marrow transplants showed&#xD;
      better and more durable outcomes than those seen with ASCT (Gahrton et al., 1999). Another&#xD;
      reason for failure of autologous stem cell transplant is ineffective eradication of myeloma&#xD;
      clone with high dose chemotherapy. In an effort to provide more effective elimination of&#xD;
      malignant clones, some investigators developed intensified treatment regimens. Improved&#xD;
      results have been reported using Total Therapy, which involves a sequence of treatments,&#xD;
      including tandem ASCT (Barlogie et al., 1999, Barlogie at al., 2004). The notion that&#xD;
      intensification of therapy improves outcomes has been validated in a recent randomized study,&#xD;
      which showed that consolidation of initial therapy with tandem autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant was superior than consolidation with single autologous stem cell transplant as&#xD;
      measured by an improved duration of responses and overall survival (Attal at al, 2003). In&#xD;
      contrast to ASCT, allogeneic stem cell transplantation can provide stem cell products free of&#xD;
      malignant cells, as well as the benefit of graft-versus-myeloma effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, very high 1-year mortality (30-60%) was reported in early allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant studies, with disease free survival in only 15-30% of patients and no superior&#xD;
      survival if compared to ASCT (Bensinger et al., 1996; Bjorkstrand et al., 1996; Barlogie et&#xD;
      al., 1995). More recent studies, including allogeneic transplants with nonmyeloablative&#xD;
      conditioning regimens, provide more encouraging results (Reynolds et al., 2001; Badros et&#xD;
      al., 2002). Recently, a combined treatment with ASCT followed by a non-myeloablative&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplant showed very promising outcomes and improved, although still&#xD;
      significant toxicity, with CR rates in 55-60% range (Kroger et al., 2002; Maloney et al.,&#xD;
      2003). It is too early to determine whether improved responses using this approach will&#xD;
      result in an increased survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging data suggest that achieving CR or near CR (nCR) will result in more durable&#xD;
      remission and longer survival. Recent analysis of long term outcomes of patients treated on&#xD;
      randomized French study IMG90 clearly indicates that the longest survivors are those patients&#xD;
      who achieve at least very good partial response or complete response (Harousseau, 2003). At 7&#xD;
      years, 60% of patients were alive in a group, which achieved CR or near CR. In contrast, in a&#xD;
      group of patients who achieved &gt; PR but less than CR or near CR only 30% were alive and among&#xD;
      patients who had less than PR none were alive. Similar results have bee recently reported for&#xD;
      patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant (Corradini et al., 2003). It is not&#xD;
      clear whether CR in response to initial therapy and prior to transplant may have similar&#xD;
      impact on overall outcomes. Regardless of specific transplant approach, survival curves do&#xD;
      not plateau and all patients are expected to relapse, regardless of method of intensification&#xD;
      therapy, possibly due to persistence of residual population of chemotherapy-resistant&#xD;
      clonogenic myeloma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have relapsed or are refractory to therapy, there is no agreed upon standard&#xD;
      treatment (Anderson et al., 2002; Kyle, 2002). Treatment options include salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplant (if not previously done or as a second&#xD;
      transplant), or allogeneic stem cell transplant, full or low intensity (Kyle, 2002). Salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy is most widely used in clinical practice. Among a variety of salvage regimens,&#xD;
      both monotherapy and combination therapy have been applied. Monotherapy with Dexamethasone or&#xD;
      other steroids administered as pulse therapy produced responses in the 35-40% range&#xD;
      (Alexanian et al., 1983; Gertz et al., 1995). Thalidomide used as a single agent showed a 32%&#xD;
      response rate in this patient population (Singhal et al., 1999). More recently, VELCADE as a&#xD;
      single agent induced at least minimal responses (i.e. &gt; 25% reduction in monoclonal protein)&#xD;
      in 35% of patients and at least a stabilization of the disease in 59% of patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma using strict SWOG criteria (Richardson et al., 2003).&#xD;
      Combination therapies historically show higher response rates. VAD has been demonstrated as&#xD;
      an effective regimen in patients refractory to alkylating agents, with response rates of 60%&#xD;
      (Lokhorst et al., 1989). A similar regimen called DVd, with Doxil, Vincristine, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone, showed comparable efficacy and acceptable toxicity (Hussein et al., 2002;&#xD;
      Rifkin et al., 2004). Newer combinations, including combinations of VELCADE, thalidomide, and&#xD;
      Revlimid (analog of thalidomide) are promising, and appear to be able to induce higher&#xD;
      response rates and complete remissions as per unpublished yet reports from different meetings&#xD;
      (Agarwal et al, 2003; Orlowski et al, 2003, Richardson et al, 2003; Richardson et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clonogenic Multiple Myeloma Cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myeloma is characterized by an accumulation of malignant plasma cells in bone marrow.&#xD;
      Numerous observations indicated that malignant plasma cells have low proliferative capacity&#xD;
      and it is believed that the vast majority of the malignant cell population in myeloma is&#xD;
      represented by terminally differentiated plasma cells, similar to their normal counterparts&#xD;
      (Barlogie et al., 1989). It is unclear whether these terminally differentiated malignant&#xD;
      plasma cells are capable of self-renewal. During the past decade, several studies indicated&#xD;
      that multiple myeloma, similarly to other malignancies, may consist of heterogenous&#xD;
      population of malignant cells (Bakkus et al., 1994; Billadeau et al., 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clonotypic studies identified a population of circulating B-cells in blood samples of&#xD;
      patients with myeloma (Bergsagel et al., 1995, Chen and Epstein, 1996), sharing the same&#xD;
      clonotypic CDR3 region as is detected in the bone marrow malignant plasma cells (Pilarski et&#xD;
      al, 1996, Szczepek et al., 1998). Further studies provided additional insights into the&#xD;
      evolution of the myeloma clone supporting a notion of heterogeneity of the population of&#xD;
      clonal cells in myeloma (Taylor et al., 2002). The B-cell component of the myeloma clone&#xD;
      appeared to be clonogenic in xenografted mice (Pilarski et al., 2000; Reiman et al., 2001).&#xD;
      Moreover, clonotypic cells with B-cell phenotype express CD19+/CD20+ antigens and may&#xD;
      represent a reservoir of disease that persists after therapy, including high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Kiel et al., 1999; Rottenburger et al., 1999; Pilarski et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of myeloma cells express CD138, a highly specific surface antigen of terminally&#xD;
      differentiated plasma cells, which is absent on highly proliferative normal plasmablast and&#xD;
      earlier stages of B-cells (Jego et al., 2001). Based on these observations, it was&#xD;
      hypothesized that clonogenic myeloma cells should lack CD138 expression. Using CD138+ and&#xD;
      CD138- subsets of cells isolated from myeloma cell lines and from primary myeloma patient&#xD;
      samples, Matsui et al. (2004), showed that only a minority of all myeloma cells have CD138-&#xD;
      phenotype (&lt;5%). However, only CD138- have clonogenic potential, as demonstrated in colony&#xD;
      formation assays in methylcellulose and after transplantation to NOD/SCID mice. Moreover,&#xD;
      these cells express B-cell antigens, including CD19 and CD20 and their growth could be&#xD;
      inhibited by in vitro treatment with rituximab, an antibody directed against CD20 antigen&#xD;
      (Matsui et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for anti-CD20 Therapy in Myeloma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent observations that clonogenic cells in myeloma express CD20 (Kiel et al, 1999,&#xD;
      Rottenburger et al, 1999) and that their growth could be inhibited in vitro by rituximab, an&#xD;
      anti-CD20 antibody (Matsui et al, 2004), provides a rationale for using CD20-directed therapy&#xD;
      in patients with myeloma. Moreover, CD19+/CD20+ clonotypic cells appear to be more refractory&#xD;
      than CD19-/CD20- cells to commonly used chemotherapy regimens in myeloma including high dose&#xD;
      therapy with stem cell transplant (Kiel et al., 1999, Rottenburger et al, 1999). Therefore,&#xD;
      CD20+ directed treatment of myeloma would complement chemotherapy by targeting chemoresistant&#xD;
      clonogenic myeloma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that therapy with Rituximab, unlabeled anti-CD20 antibody, could be&#xD;
      active in multiple myeloma (Hussein et al. 1999, Treon et al, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we propose to apply therapy with Bexxar, a radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibody.&#xD;
      Bexxar Therapeutic Regimen is composed of the murine anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      Tositumomab and Iodine I 131 Tositumomab. Iodine I 131 Tositumomab is a radio-iodinated&#xD;
      derivative of Tositumomab that has been covalently linked to Iodine-131.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibody will be more efficacious than unlabeled&#xD;
      antibody (i.e. rituximab) in eradication of highly radiosensitive myeloma cells, similarly to&#xD;
      what was observed in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Horning et al., 2000; Davis et al, 2001 Flinn et&#xD;
      al, 2001; Witzig et al, 2002). It is presumed, that higher efficacy of radiolabeled anti-CD20&#xD;
      antibody, if compared to unlabeled antibody, may be due to &quot;crossfire effect&quot; as the&#xD;
      radiation is delivered not only to target cells but also to neighboring cells, both&#xD;
      expressing and not-expressing CD20 (Vose et al, 1999). In the proposed design, we will apply&#xD;
      Bexxar after completion of a course of initial chemotherapy for newly diagnosed patients or a&#xD;
      course of salvage chemotherapy, provided that patients achieve at least partial response to&#xD;
      prior therapy (i.e. &gt; 50% reduction of tumor mass) and reach a plateau of their response to&#xD;
      prior therapy. By using patients in a period of stable disease, we will have a better chance&#xD;
      to observe the effects of radioimmunotherapy against CD20+ cells, which represent a minority&#xD;
      of all malignant cells. In addition, we will evaluate the impact of Bexxar therapy on&#xD;
      clonogenic myeloma cells using clonogenic assays as described in Methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that majority of newly diagnosed patients will be eligible and will&#xD;
      subsequently proceed to autologous stem cell transplant as part of standard therapy of&#xD;
      myeloma (NCCN Guidelines 2004) if, as hypothesized, bexxar treatment does have the potential&#xD;
      to eliminate clonogenic myeloma stem cells; stem cells collected post-bexxar treatment should&#xD;
      be depleted of re-populating myeloma cells. Therefore, this combination of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      targeted therapy against clonogenic cells may have a potential of eliminating myeloma clones.&#xD;
      Although stem cell collections and autologous stem cell transplants have been used without&#xD;
      apparent difficulties in the past in patients treated with anti-CD20 radio-conjugates&#xD;
      (Ratanatharatorn et al, 2001; Kaminski et al, 2001; Ansell et al, 2002), we plan to collect&#xD;
      backup stem cells prior to treatment with Bexxar, to allow to proceed with the standard stem&#xD;
      cell transplant in the unlikely cases of failure of collection of stem cells post-Bexxar.&#xD;
      Anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy was previously used in combination with chemotherapy without&#xD;
      additional toxicity (Emmanoulides et al, 2001; Gregory et al, 2001, Press et al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioimmunotherapy of B-Cell Malignancies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies are efficacious in treating B-cell malignancies for the&#xD;
      following reasons: B-lymphocytes, lymphoma, and myeloma cells are inherently sensitive to&#xD;
      radiotherapy (Parker et al, 1980); the local emission of ionizing radiation by radiolabeled&#xD;
      antibodies may kill cells with or without the target antigen in close proximity to the bound&#xD;
      antibody; and penetrating radiation may obviate the problem of limited access in bulky or&#xD;
      poorly vascularized tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early investigations of therapeutic radiolabeled antibodies for B-cell lymphoma were&#xD;
      performed with iodinated antibodies (Press et al, 1989; Kaminski et al, 1993; Wahl et al,&#xD;
      1994; Press et al, 1995). Currently, two treatment regimens have been approved for treatment&#xD;
      of relapsed/refractory and transformed follicular lymphoma. The Bexxar Treatment Regimen&#xD;
      includes murine anti-CD20 antibody Tositumomab iodinated with Iodine I 131. The Main&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect comes from high energy beta particles emitted by I 131. In addition, I 131&#xD;
      is emitting also low energy gamma radiation, allowing for gamma camera measurements and&#xD;
      calculation of individualized dose of radioactive tracer for a given patient during&#xD;
      therapeutic phase (see below). In Zevalin, a murine anti-CD20 antibody ibritumomab is&#xD;
      covalently linked to 90Yttrium (90Y), which is a pure beta emitter. Lack of gamma radiation&#xD;
      from 90Y does not allow for dosimetric assessments and a fixed dose of Zevalin is used for&#xD;
      all patients based on their weight. This can possibly result in either under- or overdosing&#xD;
      of some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to treatment of follicular lymphoma, ongoing studies explore a possibility of&#xD;
      treatment with either Bexxar or Zevalin of other B-cell malignancies. In particular,&#xD;
      anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy appears very promising as part of treatment of mantle cell&#xD;
      lymphoma, large cell lymphoma, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine I 131 Tositumomab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tositumomab is a murine IgG2a lambda monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen,&#xD;
      which is found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Tositumomab is produced&#xD;
      in an antibiotic-free culture of mammalian cells and is composed of two murine gamma 2a heavy&#xD;
      chains of 451 amino acids each and two lambda light chains of 220 amino acids each. The&#xD;
      approximate molecular weight of Tositumomab is 150 kD. In vitro studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that upon binding to the CD20 antigen, Tositumomab is capable of inducing apoptosis. In&#xD;
      addition, Tositumomab induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and&#xD;
      complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC). Iodine I 131 Tositumomab is a&#xD;
      radio-iodinated derivative of Tositumomab that has been covalently linked to Iodine-131.&#xD;
      Unbound radio-Iodine and other reactants have been removed by chromatographic purification&#xD;
      steps. This agent produces its cytotoxic effect through the antitumor effects of ionizing&#xD;
      radiation, as well as the more direct antitumor effects of the antibody. The goal of&#xD;
      treatment with Iodine I 131 Tositumomab is selective delivery of radiotherapy to&#xD;
      radiosensitive malignant cells, thus minimizing toxicity to the normal organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bexxar Clinical Experience:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing regimen and maximally tolerated dose of Bexxar were established in a phase I/II&#xD;
      single-center study conducted at the University of Michigan (Kaminski et al, 2000). The&#xD;
      RIT-II-001 trial included 47 patients and was designed to validate the dosing methodology&#xD;
      developed at Michigan (Vose et al, 2000). The RIT-II-002 trial randomized 78 patients to&#xD;
      receive either the tositumomab and I 131-tositumomab regimen or the unlabeled tositumomab to&#xD;
      determine the value added of the radionuclide component (Davis et al, 2001). Patients treated&#xD;
      on the radiolabeled antibody arm showed a higher overall response rate (OR = 55% vs. 19%) and&#xD;
      complete response rate (CR = 33% vs. 8%). The RIT-II-004 study enrolled 60 patients with&#xD;
      chemotherapy-refractory disease (no response or response lasting less than 6 months to the&#xD;
      last chemotherapy received) to assess the efficacy of the Bexxar therapeutic regimen in this&#xD;
      patient population (Kaminski et al, 2001). The number of patients who achieved longer&#xD;
      duration of response to Bexxar was about 5 times higher than the number of patients who had a&#xD;
      longer duration to chemotherapy (p &lt;0.001). In addition, patients treated with Bexxar&#xD;
      achieved a higher overall response (OR) rate (47% vs. 12%) and complete response (CR) rate&#xD;
      (20% vs. 2%) than patients treated with chemotherapy. In summary, all 4 initial studies,&#xD;
      including the Phase I/II trial, showed high response rates and duration of responses in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory low grade or follicular lymphoma, including transformed&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma previously-treated with chemotherapy. Most remarkably, patients who&#xD;
      achieved complete responses experienced often particularly long duration of responses lasting&#xD;
      for years. In recognition of remarkable activity, the FDA approved an expanded indication for&#xD;
      the Bexxar Therapeutic Regimen on January 3, 2005.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to determine of the rate of objective response (percentage of patients with an objective response) defined as sustained reduction of monoclonal proteins by more than 25% versus pre-Bexxar level.&#xD;
An objective response may be:&#xD;
Minimal Response (MR) - 25-49% reduction on the level of the serum monoclonal protein for at least 2 determinations.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR) - 50-89% reduction in the level of the serum monoclonal protein for at least 2 determinations.&#xD;
Complete Response (CR) - Absence of the original monoclonal protein in serum and urine on at least 2 determinations by immunofixation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Response (CR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the rate of conversion to complete response (CR). CR requires all of the following:&#xD;
Absence of the original monoclonal protein in serum and urine on at least 2 determinations by immunofixation. The presence of oligoclonal bands consistent with oligoclonal immune reconstitution does not exclude CR.&#xD;
Less than 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow on at least 2 determinations. Repeat bone marrow is not required for patients with secretory myeloma who have sustained absence of monoclonal protein on immunofixation.&#xD;
No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response).&#xD;
Disappearance of all soft tissue plasmacytomas.&#xD;
Patients in whom some, but not all the criteria for CR are fulfilled are classified as nCR or PR or VGPR (see below), providing the remaining criteria for nCR, VGPR, or PR are satisfied.</description>

    <description>The Bexxar therapeutic regimen is delivered in two sets of intravenous infusions given 7-14 days apart. Nonradioactive Tositumomab is given before both the &quot;dosimetric&quot; infusion and the &quot;therapeutic&quot; infusion to improve distribution of these doses throughout the body. A trace amount of radioactive Iodine 131 Tositumomab is initially given to enable physicians to evaluate the clearance of radiation from the subject's body with gamma camera scans. Calculations made on the basis of these individualized radiation clearance rates allow the therapeutic dose (given 7-14 days after the dosimetric infusion) to be tailored for each patient. The therapeutic dose contains Tositumomab labeled with the amount of Iodine 131 tositumomab specifically calculated based on the scans performed following the dosimetric dose.</description>

            <description>The Bexxar therapeutic regimen is delivered in two sets of intravenous infusions given 7-14 days apart. Nonradioactive Tositumomab is given before both the &quot;dosimetric&quot; infusion and the &quot;therapeutic&quot; infusion to improve distribution of these doses throughout the body. A trace amount of radioactive Iodine 131 Tositumomab is initially given to enable physicians to evaluate the clearance of radiation from the subject's body with gamma camera scans. Calculations made on the basis of these individualized radiation clearance rates allow the therapeutic dose (given 7-14 days after the dosimetric infusion) to be tailored for each patient. The therapeutic dose contains Tositumomab labeled with the amount of Iodine 131 tositumomab specifically calculated based on the scans performed following the dosimetric dose.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Complete Response (CR)</title>
          <description>Determine the rate of conversion to complete response (CR). CR requires all of the following:&#xD;
Absence of the original monoclonal protein in serum and urine on at least 2 determinations by immunofixation. The presence of oligoclonal bands consistent with oligoclonal immune reconstitution does not exclude CR.&#xD;
Less than 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow on at least 2 determinations. Repeat bone marrow is not required for patients with secretory myeloma who have sustained absence of monoclonal protein on immunofixation.&#xD;
No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response).&#xD;
Disappearance of all soft tissue plasmacytomas.&#xD;
Patients in whom some, but not all the criteria for CR are fulfilled are classified as nCR or PR or VGPR (see below), providing the remaining criteria for nCR, VGPR, or PR are satisfied.</description>
