      The purpose of this study is to see if the MMR and chickenpox vaccines work as well in&#xD;
      premature infants as in children that were carried to full term. A group of children who were&#xD;
      carried full-term will be matched for age, sex, and race and will be used for comparison.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to see if the MMR and chickenpox vaccines work as well in&#xD;
      premature infants as in children that were carried to full term. A group of children who were&#xD;
      carried full-term will be matched for age, sex, and race and will be used for comparison.&#xD;
      Extremely premature infants (born at &lt;28-30 weeks gestation) have lower antibody responses&#xD;
      than full-term infants to several vaccines given at the postnatal ages recommended for full&#xD;
      term infants. We propose to evaluate the immunogenicity of varicella and&#xD;
      mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccines in relatively healthy 15 month-old children born at &lt;29&#xD;
      weeks gestation. This is a phase IV, observational study with 2 study arms having 16 infants&#xD;
      each. The first group will enroll infants 9-12 months old that were born premature (&lt;29 weeks&#xD;
      gestation). The second group will be matched for sex, race, and postnatal age, but will have&#xD;
      been full term (&gt;= 37 weeks gestation) at birth. Infants will be vaccinated at visit 1 and&#xD;
      post-vaccine serology will drawn at visit 2 (4 to 6 weeks after visit 1).&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Parental permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Agreement of primary care pediatrician/ health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Receives primary pediatric care within an approximate 25-mile radius of the University&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Healthy status at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Requiring oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically significant findings on review of medical history and physical exam&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Any condition determined by the investigator that would interfere with the evaluation&#xD;
             of the vaccine or be a potential health risk to the subject.&#xD;
