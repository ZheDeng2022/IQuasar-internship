  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer may be caused by a build-up of genetic defects, or damaged genes within the&#xD;
      cells of the body. Because the genes are damaged, the body is unable to produce a group of&#xD;
      proteins called cytokines which are used by the immune system to fight cancer and some&#xD;
      infections. The investigational gene transfer agent EGEN-001 (phIL-12-005/PPC) contains the&#xD;
      human gene for interleukin-12 [IL-12] (a cytokine) in a special carrier system designed to&#xD;
      enter the cells and help the body produce cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two purposes; the first is to determine what different strengths of EGEN-001&#xD;
      can be given safely without major side effects, and the second is to see if EGEN-001 is able&#xD;
      to slow down the growth of ovarian cancer.&#xD;

      EGEN-001-101 is a Phase 1, open label, non-randomized, dose escalation study in up to 18&#xD;
      (eighteen) patients (three to six patients in each of the first three cohorts, and up to nine&#xD;
      patients in a fourth cohort or MTD). The fourth cohort (or MTD, if earlier) will be expanded&#xD;
      in increments of three patients until a total of 18 patients have been enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will provide written dated informed consent prior to undergoing eligibility&#xD;
      screening for entry into the study. Screening evaluations will be performed within 21 days&#xD;
      prior to scheduled study drug administration. If all eligibility criteria are met, the&#xD;
      patient will be enrolled and will be scheduled for placement of the IP catheter at least 7&#xD;
      days prior to the scheduled dosing (Day -7) to allow adequate time for healing around the&#xD;
      catheter insertion site. Baseline evaluations will be performed prior to dosing. At that time&#xD;
      the investigator will ensure that the patient remains eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study drug will be administered on an inpatient basis and the patient will remain&#xD;
      confined for 24 hours following study drug administration for evaluation of safety and&#xD;
      collection of specified body fluid samples for plasmid IL-12-DNA and cytokine determinations.&#xD;
      Each patient will receive the same dose of EGEN-001 once weekly for four weeks (administered&#xD;
      on Day 0, Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21). Patients will undergo safety evaluations 1, 4 and 24&#xD;
      hours and 3 days following each dose. Patients will return to the clinic for safety&#xD;
      evaluations three days, one week and five weeks (± one week) following the last dose.&#xD;
