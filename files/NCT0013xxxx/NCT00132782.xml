  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the interrelationships between&#xD;
      health status and measures of cardiac performance in children 6 to 18 years of age with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease who have undergone a Fontan procedure as surgical treatment for&#xD;
      functional single ventricle. The goal was to develop a data set that will permit&#xD;
      identification of a clinically relevant endpoint for subsequent trials of medical management&#xD;
      of the Fontan patient.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children born with one functional ventricle and who undergo a Fontan procedure, have a higher&#xD;
      incidence of late complications than other congenital heart patients. While the Fontan&#xD;
      procedure results in restoring near-normal systemic oxygen saturation, there are recognized&#xD;
      problems and little information about the overall health status, functional status and&#xD;
      ventricular performance in these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-sectional observational study included children 6-18 years of age who had&#xD;
      undergone a Fontan procedure for a congenital cardiac defect. Prospective data collection for&#xD;
      each patient occured within a 3 month time period and included cardiac MRI, echocardiography,&#xD;
      serology and exercise testing. Historical clinical and surgical data, as well as parent and&#xD;
      child self reports of health status, was collected.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 6 through 18 years at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fontan surgery of any type at least 6 months prior to the time of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agreement and ability to have all of the following testing completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. An echocardiogram at the study center,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Parent health status questionnaire, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Blood testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned or ongoing cardiac care at the study center that will allow completion of&#xD;
             study testing within 3 months of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent of a parent or guardian, and assent of the study participant if&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-cardiac medical or psychiatric disorder that would prevent successful completion&#xD;
             of planned study testing or would invalidate the results of study testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing or planned participation in another research protocol that would either&#xD;
             prevent successful completion of planned study testing or invalidate the results of&#xD;
             study testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of reading fluency by the primary caregiver in both English and Spanish,&#xD;

             validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy at the time of enrollment or pregnancy planned prior to completion of study&#xD;
             testing.&#xD;
