  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if 1 course of antibiotic treatment with&#xD;
      telithromycin is superior to azithromycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections (LRTIs), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs) and community-acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia (CAP) in the community setting.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Had a normal menstrual flow ≤ 1 month before study entry&#xD;
&#xD;

             (ie, before the start of treatment or any other study procedure that could potentially&#xD;
             harm the fetus). If obtaining the serum pregnancy test result will cause a delay in&#xD;
             treatment, a subject may be entered on the basis of a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             sensitive to at least 50 mU/mL, pending results of the serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
             Subsequently, if the result of the serum test is positive, the subject must be&#xD;
             discontinued from study drug, and every attempt must be made to follow such subjects&#xD;
             to term.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must agree to use an accepted method of contraception (ie, oral or implanted&#xD;
             contraceptive with a barrier method; spermicide and barrier methods; or intrauterine&#xD;
             device). The subject must agree to continue with the same method throughout the study.&#xD;
