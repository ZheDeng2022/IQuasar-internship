      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new method of detecting the flu infection. This&#xD;
      method may allow researchers to identify new proteins being made in response to an infection&#xD;
      even before symptoms of the infection are present. The goal of this study is not to prevent&#xD;
      the flu but to monitor the immune system response. The elderly and those with chronic health&#xD;
      problems are at greater risk for complications (i.e., pneumonia, bronchitis [bacterial&#xD;
      infection in the lungs], and sinusitis [bacterial infection in the sinuses]) from the flu.&#xD;
      Early detection and diagnosis of the flu decreases the number of people with these&#xD;
      complications. Participants will include healthy people between the ages of 21-40, between&#xD;
      the ages of 60-89, or 90 years and older, who are living in the communities surrounding the 3&#xD;
      study sites in Virginia. There will be 5 study visits, and subjects will participate up to 1&#xD;
      month.&#xD;

      The central hypothesis of this study is that immune responses to vaccination can be&#xD;
      quantified by proteomic profiling of serum (and other clinical fluids), and that the host&#xD;
      responses to different infectious agents are unique and can be 'fingerprinted' by proteomics.&#xD;
      Using influenza virus vaccination, this study proposes to use mass spectrometry platforms to&#xD;
      profile and characterize proteins from serum samples obtained from recipients. These samples&#xD;
      will be used to develop a proteomic profiling system for monitoring vaccine response and,&#xD;
      eventually, early detection/diagnosis of infection. The long-term goal of this approach is to&#xD;
      develop tools useful for reducing the morbidity and mortality of influenza from natural and&#xD;
      potential bioterrorism-related infections by improving measures of vaccine efficacy and early&#xD;
      diagnosis. The primary objective is to use surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization&#xD;
      time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization&#xD;
      time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry proteomic profiling tools to analyze a series of&#xD;
      serum samples obtained from cohorts of young and elderly subjects, before and after trivalent&#xD;
      split-virus influenza vaccination, to identify surrogate markers reflective of the immune&#xD;
      response. The secondary objective is to use concurrent T-cell activation, cytokine assays,&#xD;
      and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) serologic assays to correlate cellular and humoral&#xD;
      responses to influenza vaccination with protein profiling changes. Comparisons of the protein&#xD;
      profile data with the T-cell activation, cytokine assays, and HI results will be evaluated&#xD;
      using multiple classification algorithms, and potential biomarker proteins will be identified&#xD;
      by sequencing with either a MALDI-TOF or electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. Study&#xD;
      Participants will include healthy adult volunteers between the ages of 21-40, between the&#xD;
      ages of 60-89, or 90 years and older, who are living independently in the communities&#xD;
      surrounding the 3 study sites in Virginia. There will be 5 study visits, and subjects will be&#xD;
      in the trial for up to 1 month. The primary endpoint of the study is to identify surrogate&#xD;
      markers reflective of the immune response and to correlate these markers to cellular and&#xD;
      humoral responses (demonstrated with T-cell activation, cytokine assays, and the HI serologic&#xD;
      assays) to influenza vaccination. The secondary endpoint is safety. Data on the following&#xD;
      solicited local reactions (injection site pain, bruising, redness, tenderness, and&#xD;
      induration) and solicited systemic reactions (fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, cough, runny&#xD;
      nose, chills, vomiting, arthralgia, rash, and diarrhea) will be collected from Day 0-Day 14&#xD;
      and categorized as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Unsolicited adverse events (including&#xD;
      serious adverse events) will be collected and categorized throughout the study by severity,&#xD;
      duration, and relatedness to the vaccine.&#xD;
