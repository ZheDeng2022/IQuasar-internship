      Objectives are: To confirm the safety and tolerability of 2-dose regimens of 100 g rPA&#xD;
      vaccines (3 products) administered by the intramuscular (IM) route to healthy adults.To&#xD;
      describe the immunologic responses to 2-dose regimens of 3 rPA vaccines and to compare the&#xD;
      responses to those following administration of Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA or BioThraxTM),&#xD;
      the currently available vaccine. The primary immunologic outcome is the proportion of&#xD;
      volunteers in each group that mounts an antibody response (defined as a 4-fold or greater&#xD;
      increase from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination of anti-rPA IgG antibody with a minimal&#xD;
      concentration of 10 µg/ml as measured by ELISA). Secondary outcomes are time to peak response&#xD;
      and GMC of anti-PA antibody at peak for each group. In addition, the following immunologic&#xD;
      assays will be performed: toxin neutralization assay, oral fluid ELISA, antibody avidity, IgG&#xD;
      subclasses, and B-cell memory,T-cell memory and effector subpopulations.&#xD;

      Anthrax CVD 3000: A Phase II Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      Optimal Primary Schedule of 3 Recombinant Protective Antigen (rPA) Anthrax Vaccines&#xD;
      Administered in Two Intramuscular Doses to Healthy Adults aged 18 to 50 years. The targeted&#xD;
      number of subjects is 270.The study objectives are:To confirm the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      2-dose regimens of 100 g rPA vaccines (3 products) administered by the intramuscular (IM)&#xD;

      oral fluid ELISA, antibody avidity, IgG subclasses, and B-cell memory,T-cell memory and&#xD;
      effector subpopulationsThis is a two center study; in which 270 healthy adults aged 18 to 50&#xD;
      years are randomly assigned to 1 of 9 groups; knowledge of rPA product received is&#xD;
      double-masked, but schedule and receipt of AVA are unmasked. The duration of study&#xD;
      participation is 12 months per volunteer following a screening period of no more than 30&#xD;
      days: administration over a 1- to 4-week period of two doses of IM rPA or 3 doses of SQ AVA&#xD;
      with 12-14 follow-up visits. A subset of the approximately 45 volunteers who have agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the special immunology subgroup (those with continued antibody responses at 1&#xD;
      year) will be offered extended participation beyond 1 year in which blood is drawn at 18&#xD;
      months, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years for examination of long-term immune responses.&#xD;

                  diastolic blood pressure exceeds 90, the volunteer will be asked to return&#xD;
                  another day for a repeat test. If, on repeat, either value is again elevated, the&#xD;
                  volunteer will be excluded, counseled on appropriate health habits to combat&#xD;

             to determine whether the subject has had medical, occupational, or family problems&#xD;
             related to alcohol or illicit drug use during the past 12 months. These questions are&#xD;
             derived from the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST 10) developed by the Addiction&#xD;
             Research Foundation and recommended by the National Institute for Drug Abuse as a tool&#xD;

             syphilis (defined as positive RPR and FTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Failure to pass the written exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Screening laboratory values that fall outside the acceptable study allowable range as&#xD;
             delineated in Appendix 1 of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Receipt of an experimental vaccine or medication within the 30 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Receipt of a live, attenuated vaccine within the 30 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Receipt of a blood product, including immunoglobulin, in the 90 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Donation of a unit of blood within the 56 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Anything that, in the opinion of the investigator, will compromise the participation&#xD;
             of the volunteer with respect to his/her rights or risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Oral temperature &gt; 37.7 degrees C or other acute illness occurring prior to&#xD;
             inoculation on the day of vaccination. (This circumstance will lead to postponement of&#xD;
             enrollment, not exclusion from the trial)&#xD;
