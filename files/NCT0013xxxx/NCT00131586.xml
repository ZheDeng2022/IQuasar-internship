    <textblock>
      Cisplatin is a widely used anti-tumor agent for the treatment of testicular and ovarian&#xD;
      cancers. Carboplatin is used extensively for small cell, non small cell lung cancer and&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. Oxaliplatin has recently been approved in the United States (US) for&#xD;
      treatment of colorectal cancer. A large portion (in the range of 65% to 98%) of cisplatin in&#xD;
      the blood plasma was bound to protein within a day after intravenous administration. The&#xD;
      binding of cisplatin and other analogues to proteins and enzymes is generally believed to be&#xD;
      the cause of several severe side effects such as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The&#xD;
      interactions between platinum based chemotherapy drugs and proteins is proposed to play&#xD;
      important roles in both drug activity and toxicity. Therefore, a better understanding of the&#xD;
      molecular mechanism of platinum-protein interactions may have an impact on optimization of&#xD;
      strategies for treatment. The objective is to develop novel approaches and techniques to&#xD;
      provide detailed mechanistic, kinetic and high-resolution structural information on the&#xD;
      binding of platinum analogues to blood proteins, and to improve treatment efficacy and reduce&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;

      Cisplatin, cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2], is a widely used antitumor agent for the treatment of&#xD;
      testicular and ovarian cancers. Carboplatin is used extensively for small cell, non small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer. Oxaliplatin has recently been approved in the US for&#xD;
      treatment of colorectal cancer. All of these analogues are administered by intravenous&#xD;
      injection, and within one day, 65-98% of the platinum in the blood plasma is bound to&#xD;
      protein. Binding of cisplatin to proteins reduces urinary excretion of platinum, and causes&#xD;
      deposition of platinum in tissues. Binding of cisplatin to proteins and enzymes is generally&#xD;
      believed to be the cause of several severe side effects exhibited by these drugs, especially&#xD;
      ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite numerous studies of platinum-protein binding in the last few decades, the roles of&#xD;
      platinum-protein adducts in drug action, and in toxicity of these drugs are not known.&#xD;
      Although cisplatin-protein adducts are widely believed to cause the drug's side effects,&#xD;
      there are also claims that platinum-protein adducts are important for the drug's activity.&#xD;
      Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of platinum-protein interactions&#xD;
      may have an impact on the optimization of strategies for platinum treatment. It is important&#xD;
      to understand basic principles that govern formation and reactivity of platinum-protein&#xD;
      adducts because these adducts may be important in defining the therapeutic profile of these&#xD;
      drugs. In this quest, the first goal is to develop a reliable technique for these studies. To&#xD;
      date, ultraviolet/visible (UV-Vis), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and nuclear magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (NMR) studies of cisplatin-protein interactions have provided only low-resolution&#xD;
      information on the mechanism of the binding or on the nature of the adducts. The researchers&#xD;
      propose to investigate the role of platinum-protein adducts in the mechanisms of the drug&#xD;
      action and their contributions towards the toxicity of these drug. The short-term objective&#xD;
      is to investigate platinum interaction with serum proteins using both nanoelectrospray mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (nanoESI-MS) and a combination of size exclusion high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS). The long-term&#xD;
      objective of this research is to develop biomarkers based on platinum-protein adducts for&#xD;
      clinical monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, metallothionein and human hemoglobin were used as model proteins to develop&#xD;
      nESI/MS and HPLC/ICP-MS techniques for studying cisplatin-protein interactions in vitro. The&#xD;
      researchers have demonstrated that the combination of size exclusion HPLC/ICP-MS and&#xD;
      nanoESI/MS provided new information on the adduct formation and potential reaction mechanism.&#xD;
      The size exclusion HPLC with ICP-MS enables monitoring of cisplatin-protein binding under&#xD;
      physiological conditions. Nanospray tandem MS offers information on formation of specific&#xD;
      complexes and on characteristics of binding. This information is useful for a better&#xD;
      understanding of drug toxicity and treatment resistance. The information on platinum-protein&#xD;
      interactions allows us to evaluate the utility of both nanoESI/MS and size exclusion&#xD;
      HPLC/ICP-MS techniques in providing mechanistic, kinetic and structural information on the&#xD;
      binding of platinum to other proteins. The methodology will be further validated by studying&#xD;
      the platinum-blood protein adducts in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapeutic treatments.&#xD;
      The correlation between the levels of platinum-protein adducts and clinical outcomes will be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The successful completion of this research program should provide the researchers with a&#xD;
      better understanding of mechanisms of the drug action and toxicity. This knowledge will be of&#xD;
      great importance in clinical monitoring of cancer patients to assist doctors to improve&#xD;
      cancer chemotherapy.&#xD;
