  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to test the hypothesis that at the end of 28 days, infants and&#xD;
      children with acute lung injury treated with prone positioning would have more&#xD;
      ventilator-free days than those treated with supine positioning.&#xD;

      Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted from August 28, 2001 to April&#xD;
      23, 2004, of 102 pediatric patients from 7 US pediatric intensive care units aged 2 weeks to&#xD;
      18 years who were treated with supine vs. prone positioning. Randomization was concealed and&#xD;
      group assignment was not blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized to either supine or prone positioning within 48 hours of meeting&#xD;
      acute lung injury criteria, with those patients in the prone group being positioned within 4&#xD;
      hours of randomization and remaining prone for 20 hours each day during the acute phase of&#xD;
      their illness for a maximum of 7 days, after which they were positioned supine. Both groups&#xD;
      were treated using lung protective ventilator and sedation protocols, extubation readiness&#xD;
      testing, and hemodynamic, nutrition, and skin care guidelines.&#xD;
