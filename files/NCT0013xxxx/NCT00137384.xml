  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use various methods to measure the activity of the motor cortex (the part of&#xD;
      the brain that controls movements) in order to learn more about focal hand dystonia. Patients&#xD;
      with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive movement or&#xD;
      abnormal postures. In focal dystonia, just one part of the body, such as the hand, neck or&#xD;
      face, is involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with focal hand dystonia and healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of&#xD;
      age may be eligible for this study. Each candidate is screened with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination and questionnaire. Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finger Movement Tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects perform two finger movement tasks. In the first part of the study, they move their&#xD;
      index finger repetitively from side to side at 10-second intervals for a total of 200&#xD;
      movements in four blocks of 50 at a time. In the second part of the study, subjects touch&#xD;
      their thumb to the other four fingers in sequence from 1, 2, 3 and 4, while a metronome beats&#xD;
      2 times per second to help time the movements. This sequence is repeated for a total of 200&#xD;
      movements in four blocks of 50 at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test records brain waves. Electrodes (metal discs) are placed on the scalp with an&#xD;
      electrode cap, a paste or a glue-like substance. The spaces between the electrodes and the&#xD;
      scalp are filled with a gel that conducts electrical activity. Brain waves are recorded while&#xD;
      the subject performs a finger movement task, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetoencephalography&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEG records magnetic field changes produced by brain activity. During the test, the subjects&#xD;
      are seated in the MEG recording room and a cone containing magnetic field detectors is&#xD;
      lowered onto their head. The recording may be made while the subject performs a finger task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromyography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles. This study uses surface&#xD;
      EMG, in which small metal disks filled with a conductive gel are taped to the skin on the&#xD;
      finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. The&#xD;
      patient lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow metal cylinder),&#xD;
      wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning.&#xD;
      Most scans last between 45 and 90 minutes. Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 30&#xD;
      minutes at a time, and can communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      This questionnaire is designed to detect any sources of discomfort the subject may have&#xD;
      experienced during the study.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dystonia is a disabling movement disorder that manifests with sustained co-contraction of&#xD;
      agonist and antagonist muscles, giving rise to abnormal twisted postures and overflow of&#xD;
      muscle activity. Abnormal neurophysiologic parameters of the somatosensory and motor cortex&#xD;
      have been demonstrated, although it is unclear how these changes lead to the predominant&#xD;
      motor manifestations. In normal voluntary movement, communication between sensory and motor&#xD;
      cortices is important and these interactions may be dysfunctional in dystonia. Coherence is a&#xD;
      powerful method used to assess brain communication and has been instrumental in demonstrating&#xD;
      the interregional interactions involved in normal movement. Inappropriate connectivity in&#xD;
      terms of the duration of communication or the extent of spread over sensorimotor areas may&#xD;
      give rise to the involuntary overflow of movements that characterize dystonia. We propose to&#xD;
      examine changes in coherence associated with disorganized movements to yield insight as to&#xD;
      the brain networks involved in the development and expression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with focal hand dystonia and normal volunteers will take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, EEG/MEG coherence analysis will be used to investigate corticocortical and&#xD;
      corticomuscular interactions during voluntary hand movements in focal hand dystonia patients&#xD;
      and normal subjects. Power spectral changes in the beta and alpha frequency range over the&#xD;
      hand sensorimotor cortex will be studied using a 28-channel EEG montage while subjects&#xD;
      perform various tasks involving the hand. The interregional coherence between sensory and&#xD;
      motor, premotor and motor, and interhemispheric cortices will be assessed for changes between&#xD;
      study populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of interregional coherence changes will be performed between dystonia patients and&#xD;
      normal volunteers as well as between affected and unaffected sides. Furthermore, coherence&#xD;
      changes will be compared between rest and during task performance.&#xD;
