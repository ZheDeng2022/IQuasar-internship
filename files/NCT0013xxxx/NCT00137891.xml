  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty-six (46) eligible, healthy subjects who provide written informed consent will be&#xD;
      enrolled to participate in a 2 arm parallel group study to assess and compare the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety profile of Thyrogen dosed at 0.1 mg versus a modified release&#xD;
      formulation of recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH) dosed at 0.1 mg. Ten&#xD;
      (10) of these subjects will have the thyroid uptake of radioiodine (123I) measured at&#xD;
      baseline and following their single dose of study medication. All doses will be administered&#xD;
      via intramuscular (IM) injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of study eligibility, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either a single administration of 0.1 mg of Thyrogen (THYR) or 0.1 mg of the modified&#xD;
      release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by whether or not patients will have the thyroid uptake of&#xD;
      radioiodine (123I) measured following their single dose of study medication. Five (5)&#xD;
      patients in each treatment arm will have uptake measured, while 18 in each arm will not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have blood samples taken to determine the pharmacokinetics of serum TSH at&#xD;
      -12 hours and just prior to dosing and at various hours up to 14 days following the&#xD;
      administration of Thyrogen or the modified release formulation. In addition, for the&#xD;
      evaluation of pharmacodynamics, each subject will have samples of blood taken to determine&#xD;
      serum free T4, total T4, free T3, and total T3 at -12 hours and just prior to dosing and at&#xD;
      various hours up to 14 days following the administration of study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) just prior to dose administration&#xD;
      and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 14 days following study treatment administration. In addition,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo 24 hours of Holter monitoring at baseline and four (4) consecutive&#xD;
      24-hour Holter monitoring sessions post treatment to yield a total of 96 hours of continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of cardiac function following treatment administration. All subjects will undergo&#xD;
      ultrasound evaluations to determine thyroid volume at baseline and 48 hours following&#xD;
      treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four hours following the administration of Thyrogen or the modified release&#xD;
      formulation, a subset of five (5) subjects in each treatment arm will receive a dose of 123I&#xD;
      prepared to be 400ÂµCi on the day of radioiodine administration based on the utilized nuclear&#xD;
      pharmacy's calibration schedule. Thyroid gland uptake will be measured via a probe in these&#xD;
      10 subjects at 6, 24 and 48 hours following radioiodine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood chemistry, complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis and a physical exam will be conducted&#xD;
      14 days after treatment administration, or at the time of early termination, as a final&#xD;
      safety assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject's duration of study participation will be approximately 4 weeks.&#xD;
