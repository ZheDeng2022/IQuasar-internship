  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if, among women who were treated for a prior&#xD;
      chlamydial infection, home-based, self-collected vaginal swabs can increase rescreening for&#xD;
      chlamydia in comparison with rescreening in the clinic. The study design is two randomized&#xD;
      trials with enrollment at multiple family planning clinics and sexually transmitted disease&#xD;
      (STD) clinics following a common protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study consists of two complementary trials, denoted as Part A and Part B. In Part A,&#xD;
      women/girls who had a positive test for chlamydia will be enrolled when they visit the study&#xD;
      clinics for treatment. After written informed consent is obtained, women will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the Clinic Group, in which they will be advised to return to the clinic for&#xD;
      rescreening for chlamydia, or the Home Group, in which women will be asked to collect a&#xD;
      vaginal swab at home and mail it to the study laboratory for chlamydia testing. In part B,&#xD;
      women who were tested and empirically treated for a chlamydial infection will be called if&#xD;
      their tests were positive. Enrollment will be offered over the phone after verbal consent.&#xD;
      Rescreening will be scheduled 3 months after treatment of the initial infection for women in&#xD;
      both trials.&#xD;
