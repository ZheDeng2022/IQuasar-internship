  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), the administration of gradually increasing quantities&#xD;
      of an allergen extract to an allergic patient, is a curative approach which directly treats&#xD;
      the underlying allergic disease. GrassMATAMPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal&#xD;
      specific immunotherapy for patients with an allergy to grass pollen (hay fever). The purpose&#xD;
      of this double-blind Phase IIb study is to assess the tolerability and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      different doses of GrassMATAMPL in volunteers allergic to grasses and rye pollen.&#xD;
