    <textblock>
      This study will help determine whether the agent UC-781, formulated as a gel, is safe when&#xD;
      applied to the vagina twice daily for 14 days. It will also assess whether women find the gel&#xD;
      acceptable to use.&#xD;

      Purpose: To assess the safety and acceptability of vaginal use of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel&#xD;
      in sexually active HIV-uninfected women, and their male partners, and sexually abstinent&#xD;
      HIV-infected women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single-center, phase I randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with 14 days of&#xD;
      twice-daily product or control gel exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Sexually active, HIV-uninfected women at low-risk for HIV and their male&#xD;
      partners; sexually-abstinent HIV-infected women; all age 18-45&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size: 36 sexually active HIV-uninfected women and up to 36 of their male partners; 18&#xD;
      sexually abstinent HIV-infected women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: HIV-uninfected, sexually active women and 1 male partner per woman:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 women assigned to 0.1% UC-781 twice daily x 14 days; 12 women assigned to 0.25% UC-781&#xD;
      twice daily x 14 days; 12 women assigned to control gel twice daily X 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: HIV-infected, abstinent women: 12 assigned to 0.25% UC-781 twice daily x 14 days; 6&#xD;
      assigned to control gel twice daily x 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Participant accrual will take 6 months. Each participant will be followed for&#xD;
      14 days in Stage 1 and 21 days in Stage 2. Total study duration will be 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site: The Hope Clinic of Emory University, Decatur, GA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and toxicity of 0.1% UC-781 gel and 0.25% UC-781 gel administered&#xD;
           intravaginally twice-daily for 14 days on the vulvar and cervicovaginal mucosa of&#xD;
           sexually active HIV-uninfected women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and toxicity of 0.25% UC-781 gel administered intravaginally&#xD;
           twice-daily for 14 days on the vulvar and cervicovaginal mucosa of sexually abstinent&#xD;
           HIV-infected women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the acceptability of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel administered intravaginally&#xD;
           twice-daily for 14 days among HIV-uninfected, and the acceptability of 0.25% gel&#xD;
           similarly administered to HIV-infected women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of study product on vaginal microflora of HIV-uninfected and&#xD;
           HIV-infected women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the systemic absorption of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel when administered&#xD;
           intravaginally&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess HIV viral load in genital secretions in HIV-infected women during 0.25% UC-781&#xD;
           gel use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the genotypic resistance patterns of HIV in genital secretions and peripheral&#xD;
           blood in HIV-infected women during 0.25% UC-781 gel use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the acceptability of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel in male sexual partners of&#xD;
           HIV-uninfected women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and toxicity of 0.1% UC-781 gel and 0.25% UC-781 gel administered intravaginally&#xD;
      twice-daily for 14 days in sexually-active HIV-uninfected women and 0.25% UC-781 gel&#xD;
      administered in sexually-abstinent HIV-infected women will be assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Macroscopic and/or microscopic evidence of vulvar and/or vaginal epithelium damage,&#xD;
           including ulceration, abrasion, severe erythema, and/or severe edema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Macroscopic and/or microscopic evidence of cervical mucosal damage including ulceration,&#xD;
           abrasion, severe erythema, and/or severe edema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms of genital irritation, including burning, itching or soreness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory evidence of grade 3 or higher toxicity for hematology, liver or renal&#xD;
           function which cannot be attributed to another cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel use by HIV-uninfected and 0.25% UC-781 gel use by&#xD;
      HIV-infected women will be assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants who at Day 14 visit indicate they would be 'somewhat&#xD;
           unlikely' or 'very unlikely' to use 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel during sexual intercourse&#xD;
           in the future compared to control gel users&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reported positive aspects of using 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel compared to control gel&#xD;
           users&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reported negative aspects of using 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel compared to control gel&#xD;
           users&#xD;
