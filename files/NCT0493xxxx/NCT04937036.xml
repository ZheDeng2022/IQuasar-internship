  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing is a common and serious health problem. According to&#xD;
      epidemiological data, it may affect about 20% of adult population. The majority is not aware&#xD;
      of the disease. The most common sleep disorder is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The essence&#xD;
      of OSA are the episodes of airway obstruction repeated many times during sleep, as a result&#xD;
      of which the level of partial oxygen in the blood decreases. Apnea episodes end up waking&#xD;
      from sleep, causing sleep fragmentation, deep sleep and REM deficiency. Frequent&#xD;
      complications of OSA are hypertension, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease&#xD;
      and pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbid Insomnia and Sleep Apnea (COMISA) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder&#xD;
      that causes additional disturbances in sleep, daytime functioning, and quality of life for&#xD;
      patients, and is a significant diagnostic and therapeutic problem for clinicians. Although&#xD;
      the presence of COMISA was first noticed by Christian Guilleminault and his colleagues in&#xD;
      1973, it received very little research attention for almost three decades. There is still&#xD;
      lack ofclinical trials concerning this topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional problem in apnea patients is the increased incidence of bruxism. Bruxism is&#xD;
      associated with increased masticatory muscle activity during sleep, which may be phased or&#xD;
      tonic. It is estimated that the incidence of bruxism in the adult population is 13%. The most&#xD;
      common symptoms of bruxism include: pathological wear and tooth sensitivity, damage to the&#xD;
      periodontium and oral mucosa, muscle pain in the stomatognathic system, headaches and damage&#xD;
      to prosthetic restorations. However, the symptoms of bruxism can go unnoticed for a long&#xD;
      time, leaving patients often unaware of the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the prevalence of sleep bruxism in COMISA, OSA and insomnia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to examine of arousals (type, frequency) in COMISA, OSA and insomnia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate the relationship between arousals and blood pressure values and&#xD;
           variability, arrhythmias, sinus rhythm variability, vascular endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk in COMISA, OSA and insomnia.&#xD;

      I. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep disordered breathing is a common and serious health problem. According to&#xD;
      epidemiological data, it may affect about 20% of the adult population, the majority is not&#xD;
      aware of the disease. The most common sleep disorder is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The&#xD;
      essence of OSA are the episodes of airway obstruction repeated many times during sleep, as a&#xD;
      result of which the level of partial oxygen in the blood decreases. Apnea episodes end up&#xD;
      with arousal, causing sleep fragmentation, deep sleep and REM deficiency. The consequence of&#xD;
      episodes of OSA and fragmentation of sleep is ineffective, non-restful sleep, pathological&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness, shortness of breath or choking. Fragmentation of sleep and repeated&#xD;
      episodes of hypoxia result in a deterioration of the quality of life, chronic fatigue, and an&#xD;
      increased risk of road accidents. The immediate consequences of apnea are hypoxia, awakening,&#xD;
      increased heart rate, and an increase in blood pressure. Common complications of OSA include&#xD;
      high blood pressure, stroke, arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension,&#xD;
      and heart failure. Untreated OSA increases the risk of premature death, especially in men&#xD;
      under 50, contributing to the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction and increasing&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbid Insomnia and Sleep Apnea (COMISA) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder&#xD;
      that causes additional disturbances in sleep, daytime functioning, and quality of life for&#xD;
      patients, and is a significant diagnostic and therapeutic problem for clinicians. Although&#xD;
      the presence of COMISA was first noticed by Christian Guilleminault and his colleagues in&#xD;
      1973, it received very little research attention for almost three decades. There is still&#xD;
      lack ofclinical trials concerning this topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional problem in OSA patients is the increased incidence of bruxism. Bruxism is&#xD;
      associated with increased masticatory muscle activity during sleep, which may be phasic or&#xD;
      tonic. It is estimated that the incidence of bruxism in the adult population is 13%. The most&#xD;
      common symptoms of bruxism include: pathological wear and tooth sensitivity, damage to the&#xD;
      periodontium and oral mucosa, muscle pain, headaches and damage to prosthetic restorations.&#xD;
      However, the symptoms of bruxism can go unnoticed for a long time, leaving patients often&#xD;
      unaware of the problem. There are two different types of bruxism: sleep bruxism (SB) and&#xD;
      awake bruxism (AB). The etiology of bruxism is multifactorial and not fully understood, it is&#xD;
      believed that it may be modulated by biological, psychological and exogenous factors. Bruxism&#xD;
      may also be a protective factor in patients with disordered breathing during sleep. A key&#xD;
      aspect of this relationship is likely related to arousals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, it has not been possible to clearly define the exact cause-and-effect relationship&#xD;
      between obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia and sleep bruxism. The relationship with&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk is also unclear.More research is needed to clarify the relationship&#xD;
      between these phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the prevalence of sleep bruxism in COMISA, OSA and insomnia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to examine of arousals (type, frequency) in COMISA, OSA and insomnia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate the relationship between arousals and blood pressure values and&#xD;
           variability, arrhythmias, sinus rhythm variability, vascular endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk in COMISA, OSA and insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will take place at the Sleep Laboratory at the Department and Clinic of Internal&#xD;
      Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology of the Wroclaw Medical&#xD;
      University. About 120 patients will be examined, referred to the Department and Clinic of&#xD;
      Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology due to suspected&#xD;
      COMISA and sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnograms will be assessed in 30 second epochs, according to standard sleep criteria.&#xD;
      The PSG results will include data on sleep latency, total sleep time (TST), and sleep&#xD;
      efficiency (%), as well as an assessment of N1, N2, N3, and REM sleep stages. Pathological&#xD;
      respiratory events will be assessed according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine&#xD;
      standards. An apnea will be defined as the lack of airflow through the airways for more than&#xD;
      10 seconds. Hypopnea will be defined as a reduction in respiratory amplitude by more than 30%&#xD;
      for more than 10 seconds, followed by blood desaturation by more than 3% or subsequent&#xD;
      arousal. Also, limb movements and types of arousals (including spontaneous and related to&#xD;
      limb movements, periodic limb movements, respiratory events and bruxism) and RERA will be&#xD;
      assessed. The activity of the masticatory muscles will be assessed on the basis of the EMG&#xD;
      recording from the electrodes placed in the area of masseter muscles. Bruxism will be&#xD;
      assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each patient, diagnostics will also be extended to ambulatory blood pressure measurement&#xD;
      (ABPM), central blood pressure measurement and EKG Holter. Each patient will give the blood&#xD;
      sample to measure inflammatory markers (interleukin, TNF alpha, fibrinogen, CRP), lipid&#xD;
      profile (TGL, cholesterol, LDL, HDL), creatinine, glucose, blood count, electrolytes and&#xD;
      markers of vascular endothelial dysfunction in serum. Each patient will have their&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk assessed (SCORE). Patients will also fill in the questionnaires: Epworth&#xD;
      Sleepiness Scale, STOP-bang questionnaire, author's questionnaire on cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, Insomnia Severity&#xD;
      Index, Graded Chronic Pain Scale , Patient Health Questionnaire - 9, Perceived Stress Scale -&#xD;
      10, Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 questionnaire, the Athens Insomnia Scale, Satisfaction&#xD;
      With Life Scale, Somatic Symptom Scale - 8, Central Sensitization Inventory and Migraine&#xD;
      Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Expected effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the project will enable patients with COMISA syndrome detailed sleep&#xD;
      diagnostics, which is extremely beneficial due to the fact that access to polysomnographic&#xD;
      assessment is quite limited. In addition, the research will allow to determine the potential&#xD;
      cause-and-effect relationship between bruxism and cardiovascular risk in patients with COMISA&#xD;
      syndrome, which in the future will contribute to more effective diagnostics and therapy of&#xD;
      all described entities.&#xD;
