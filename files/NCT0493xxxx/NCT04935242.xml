  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syntocinon was granted marketing authorization in France in 1970. Since the 1960s, it has&#xD;
      been frequently used during childbirth, particularly in cases of stagnation of cervical&#xD;
      dilatation due to a lack of uterine contractility. According to the latest National Perinatal&#xD;
      Survey of 2010, 66.5% of patients go into labor spontaneously and 58% of them receive&#xD;
      Syntocinon during labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported maternal effects associated with the use of synthetic oxytocin include uterine&#xD;
      hyperactivity, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and severe PPH. The administration of oxytocin&#xD;
      increases the risk of uterine hyperactivity in a dose-dependent manner. Regarding fetal risk,&#xD;
      the reported adverse effects concern fetal heart rate abnormalities related to uterine&#xD;
      hyperactivity. However, no study has shown an association between oxytocin administration and&#xD;
      excess neonatal morbidity and mortality, except in the subpopulation of patients with a&#xD;
      scarred uterus.&#xD;

      In the 1950s, the speed of cervical dilation during labor was studied by Friedman. Dilatation&#xD;
      is then divided into several phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A first phase known as the latency phase which corresponds to the effacement of the&#xD;
           cervix and its dilation up to 3 cm. It lasts on average 7 hours for a primipara and 5&#xD;
           hours for a multipara.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second active phase which corresponds to the dilation of the effaced cervix. This&#xD;
           phase includes the progressive acceleration phase (up to 4-5 cm of dilation), a phase of&#xD;
           maximum slope (up to 9 cm) and a deceleration phase where the slope decreases from 9 cm&#xD;
           to full dilation (FD). This active phase lasts, on average, 4h30 in primiparous women&#xD;
           and 2h30 in multiparous women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Friedman concluded that cervical dilatation should be of the order of 1.5 cm/h and more in&#xD;
      the active phase and that it should not fall below 1 cm/h in nulliparous women and 1.5 cm/h&#xD;
      in multiparous women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1980s, the use of syntocinon became commonplace.Under the influence of an Irish&#xD;
      physician, O'Driscoll, policies of quasi-systematic direction of labor were implemented, in&#xD;
      particular in nulliparous women. This concept of active management of labor was developed in&#xD;
      response to the observation of a high rate of cesarean sections performed for stagnation.&#xD;
      This active labor management included systematic rupture of membranes (amniotomy) and&#xD;
      infusion of Syntocinon when the dilation rate was less than 1 cm/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in the 2000s, Zhang also focused on the physiological duration of labor. He showed&#xD;
      that a so-called normal labor could be much longer than previously described, especially&#xD;
      before 6cm of cervical dilation. In 2010, he proposed a new partogram for nulliparous&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, Neal performed a review of the literature in 2010, evaluating 7,009 low risk&#xD;
      primiparous patients in spontaneous labor. He showed longer active phase durations than those&#xD;
      described so far. The duration of labor at the 95th percentile was 13.4 hours and the average&#xD;
      dilation rate around 0.6cm/h. The author concludes that a dilation speed of 0.5 cm/h can be&#xD;
      tolerated in primiparous patients, without requiring additional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, new French recommendations regarding oxytocin administration during&#xD;
      spontaneous labor were published in December 2016. These recommendations were based mainly on&#xD;
      studies including patients at term, without a history of cesarean section, with a&#xD;
      single-fetal pregnancy and cephalic presentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is recommended that the diagnosis of abnormal progression of labor (dynamic dystocia)&#xD;
           not be made before 5-6 cm of cervical dilation, corresponding to the end of the latency&#xD;
           phase of the 1st stage of labor (professional agreement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is recommended to consider a dilation speed as abnormal if it is less than 1 cm/4 h&#xD;
           between 5 and 7 cm, and less than 1 cm/2 h beyond 7 cm of dilation (grade B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the absence of dynamic dystocia, active direction of labor is not recommended (Grade&#xD;
           B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before 5 cm, it is recommended that neither amniotomy nor oxytocin administration be&#xD;
           performed routinely, regardless of the speed of dilation (Grade B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early epidural analgesia (EAP) during the latent phase does not increase the frequency&#xD;
           of indications for oxytocin administration during spontaneous labor (Grade B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If dynamic dystocia is present during the active phase, amniotomy is recommended before&#xD;
           oxytocin administration (professional agreement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the 2nd stage is prolonged beyond 2 hours, it is recommended that oxytocin be&#xD;
           administered to correct a lack of progression of presentation (professional agreement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is recommended to start at an initial dose of 2 mIU/min (professional agreement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervals of at least 30 min are recommended before each oxytocin dose increase (Grade&#xD;
           B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is recommended that oxytocin be increased in dose increments of 2 mIU/min, not to&#xD;
           exceed an absolute rate of 20 mIU/min, and that dose escalation be discontinued when&#xD;
           cervical change or 5 uterine contractions per 10 min are achieved (professional&#xD;
           consensus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These recommendations began to be applied in the maternity ward of Saint Joseph Hospital&#xD;
      following their publication, starting in January 2017. These recommendations concern patients&#xD;
      at low obstetrical risk, i.e., presenting a singleton pregnancy with a fetus estimated to be&#xD;
      eutrophic and in cephalic presentation, a non-scarring uterus and spontaneous labor at term.&#xD;
