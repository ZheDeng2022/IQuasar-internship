      pharmacodynamics of RXC007.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be split into 3 parts: Part A, Part B &amp; Part C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts A and B of this study will enrol up to 80 healthy males; maximum of 52 in Part A,&#xD;
      maximum of 28 in Part B. The sample size to be enrolled in Part C will be determined as Parts&#xD;
      A &amp; B are ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of Part A is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and concentration of RXC007 in&#xD;
      the blood when it is given as a single dose on one occasion at different dose strengths. In&#xD;
      addition, one group in Part A will investigate the effect of food on the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and concentration of RXC007 in the blood by taking a single dose of RXC007 following an&#xD;
      overnight fast and then following a high fat breakfast. Part A will consist of 6 planned&#xD;
      groups of 6 participants: each group investigating a different dose strength starting at the&#xD;
      lowest dose and gradually increasing in each group. If required and determined as necessary&#xD;
      following dose escalation data review, Part A may enrol up to a maximum of 2 additional&#xD;
      cohorts with a maximum of 8 participants within each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of the study will consist of a screening visit (between 28 and 2 days prior to first&#xD;
      dose), a treatment period (consisting of a maximum of 5 days with 4 overnight stays) and a&#xD;
      post-study follow-up visit on Day 15. For the food effect cohort, an additional treatment&#xD;
      period (consisting of a maximum of 5 days with 4 overnight stays) will be undertaken&#xD;
      following an approximately 4-week washout period with a second follow-up visit to be&#xD;
      conducted on Day 15 following the second treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of Part B is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and concentration of RXC007 in&#xD;
      the blood when it is given as a single dose once a day for a period of 14 days at different&#xD;
      dose strengths. Part B will consist of 2 planned groups of 6 participants; each group&#xD;
      investigating a different dose strength based on the data generated during Part A of the&#xD;
      study. If required and determined as necessary following dose escalation data review, Part B&#xD;
      may enrol up to a maximum of 2 additional cohorts with a maximum of 8 participants within&#xD;
      each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B of the study will consist of a screening visit (between 28 and 2 days prior to first&#xD;
      dose), a treatment period (consisting of a maximum of 18 days with 17 overnight stays) and a&#xD;
      post-study follow-up visit on Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each cohort in Part A and Part B, 4 participants will receive RXC007 with the&#xD;
      remaining 2 participants receiving a matching placebo. Each cohort will follow a dose leader&#xD;
      schedule, whereby 2 participants (1 active, 1 placebo) will be dosed a minimum of 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to the remaining 4 participants in the cohort. Between each cohort, safety and PK data&#xD;
      up to the 72-hour post-last dose time point for Part A and up to Day 17 in Part B will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a Dose Escalation Review Committee (DERC) to determine whether it is appropriate&#xD;
      to dose escalate into the next cohort. If required, i.e., the safety or pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      data indicates, dose modifications may be made in order to select an intermediate/lower dose.&#xD;
      In addition, modifications may be made following both treatment periods for the food effect&#xD;
      cohort in Part A to dose all remaining cohorts in Part A and Part B in a fed state (with a&#xD;
      standardised breakfast) and in Part B, the dose regime may be modified in terms of frequency&#xD;
      to increase dosing from once per day to multiple times per day. In addition, decisions may be&#xD;
      made that the proposed length of the in-house treatment period in both Part A &amp; Part B should&#xD;
      be reduced by one day (from Day 4 to Day 3 in Part A and from Day 17 to Day 16 in Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage of the study, the details of the design, conduct and implementation of Part C&#xD;
      are still to be determined and will be implemented via substantial amendment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a first-in-human, single ascending (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study, including the evaluation of drug-drug interactions. Each cohort will adopt a dose leader design with 2 participants being dosed on the first dosing day of each cohort. Of these 2, 1 will be on active drug and 1 on placebo. The remainder of the cohort will be dosed at least 24 h later pending an acceptable safety profile in the dose-leader group and will contain at least 1 additional placebo participant.&#xD;
In both Part A (SAD) and Part B (MAD), sequential cohorts will be exposed to increasing doses of RXC007. Prior to dose escalation between cohorts, safety and PK data from the previous cohort will be reviewed by the Dose Escalation Review Committee (DERC) to determine whether it is appropriate to proceed to the next cohort/dose level.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Part A &amp; Part B of the study will assume a double blind design whereby both study participants and investigators will be blinded to active IMP versus placebo assignment. Within each cohort, 4 participants will be randomised to active versus 2 placebo participants.&#xD;
A designated individual will generate the randomisation code under the guidance of a statistician. All other site and Sponsor personnel involved in the study will be blinded with regards to the IMP being administered. The Pharmacist (or designee) responsible for the preparation of participant doses and emergency code break envelopes will not be blinded.</masking_description>
