  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of a protocol in which individuals&#xD;
      with comorbid depression or anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorder will be randomized to&#xD;
      complete Amplification of Positivity for Alcohol Use Disorder (AMP-A)- a psychological&#xD;
      treatment focused on increasing positive thoughts, emotions, and behaviors- or a traditional&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention. Assessed outcomes will include participant&#xD;
      acceptability and completion rates, participant compliance with the intervention, positive&#xD;
      and negative affect, substance use- and depression and anxiety-related symptom severity, and&#xD;
      functional disability.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence and Acceptability Scale (AAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post intervention (approximately 2 weeks after completing intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The AAS assesses the acceptability and tolerability of the intervention. Scores may range from 10 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater acceptability of treatment and greater anticipated ability to adhere to it.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Distress/Endorsement Validation Scale (DEVS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post intervention (approximately 2 weeks after completing intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The DEVS measure assesses two factors, distress (7 items) and endorsement (3 items). The distress subscale score ranges from 7 to 63, with higher scores indicating more distress experienced during the intervention. The endorsement subscale ranges from 3 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater endorsement of the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Completion rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Post intervention (approximately 2 weeks after completing intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Completion rate assessed as whether or not the participant completes all 12 sessions of intervention</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Primary Endpoint: Post-treatment (i.e., within two weeks of completing the intervention), Secondary Endpoints: Three month follow-up (i.e., 12-15 weeks after completing the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Positive Affect and Well-being Scale assesses positive or rewarding affective experiences over the past 7 days. The score is presented as a T score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10, with higher scores indicating greater positive affect and well-being.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in alcohol craving as measured by the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Primary Endpoint: Post-treatment (i.e., within two weeks of completing the intervention), Secondary Endpoints: Three month follow-up (i.e., 12-15 weeks after completing the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ assesses four dimensions of alcohol craving. A total score ranges from 1-12, with higher scores indicating higher levels of alcohol craving.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in positive affect as measured by Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Primary Endpoint: Post-treatment (i.e., within two weeks of completing the intervention), Secondary Endpoints: Three month follow-up (i.e., 12-15 weeks after completing the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measures positive affect. Items are answered on a 5 point scale, 1 (Very slightly or not at all) to 5 (Extremely). The positive affect scale ranges from 10-50 and higher scores indicate greater levels of positive affect.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS Anxiety scale assesses symptoms of anxiety over the past 7 days. The score is presented as a T score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10, with higher scores indicating greater symptoms of anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in depression as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression Scale</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Primary Endpoint: Post-treatment (i.e., within two weeks of completing the intervention), Secondary Endpoints: Three month follow-up (i.e., 12-15 weeks after completing the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by self-reported drinks per day</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pleasure experience as measured by the Snaith-Hamilton Please Scale (SHAPS)</measure>
