  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EMB-001 is a combination of 2 drugs: the cortisol synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone&#xD;
      (Metopirone®), and the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, oxazepam (original trade name Serax®;&#xD;
      now marketed as oxazepam (generic) only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label study in up to 50 adult subjects to help smokers abstain from smoking&#xD;
      during a 12-week trial period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This an exploratory, single-group, open-label study of up to 50 subjects to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects on smoking cessation and the safety and tolerability of EBM-001 in smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, adult smokers will be enrolled into the study. There will&#xD;
      be an observational period of at least five days to obtain baseline data on use of&#xD;
      combustible cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be treated with EMB-001 (720 mg&#xD;
      metyrapone/24 mg oxazepam mg BID, for a total daily dose of 1440 mg metyrapone and 48 mg&#xD;
      oxazepam) for a 12-week period, followed by a one week taper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Taper Period, subjects will receive EMB-001 240/8 mg BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a follow-up visit for safety assessments at Week 15.&#xD;
