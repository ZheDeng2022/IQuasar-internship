  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A majority of residents in low income communities have been exposed to a potentially&#xD;
      traumatic event, and up to half (30-50%) of trauma-exposed residents in safety net clinical&#xD;
      settings meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite this, only 13%&#xD;
      receive treatment. Poor access to PTSD treatment is due to a shortage of mental health&#xD;
      specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a brief,&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral intervention for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-Skills Training in&#xD;
      Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR)- that will be offered in Boston Medical Center&#xD;
      (BMC)'s primary care clinics as the new standard of care following integrated behavioral&#xD;
      healthcare (IBH) therapist training. In response to clinician capacity concerns and the&#xD;
      impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be offering the intervention in both&#xD;
      clinician-administered and self-paced, web-administered formats. The evidence base suggests&#xD;
      that STAIR, delivered both synchronously (in-person/telehealth STAIR) and asynchronously&#xD;
      (webSTAIR), is associated with significant improvements in PTSD and depression symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who enroll in the study will be randomized to either in-person/telehealth STAIR&#xD;
      or webSTAIR. Those who do not enroll in the study will still be able to receive STAIR in&#xD;
      person or via telehealth as part of usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant data will be for 9 months. Treatment plans will continue to be determined by&#xD;
      usual care providers, the study has no involvement in any decisions regarding care. This&#xD;
      means that a participant's IBH therapist can continue the therapy, offer a different&#xD;
      treatment option, or refer to other services at any time in the study and after the study is&#xD;
      completed. At any time, patients can also choose to change their treatment plans, for example&#xD;
      from webSTAIR to in-person/telehealth STAIR, or to another treatment option in the clinic.&#xD;
      Access to webSTAIR will be discontinued at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that offering a low intensity treatment for PTSD through&#xD;
      primary care will improve access to and engagement in care for PTSD among BMC's patient&#xD;
      population. The feasibility of two modes of treatment delivery will be compared, while&#xD;
      gathering further evidence of the effectiveness of the intervention in our local setting. It&#xD;
      is also hypothesized that both formats will be effective in reducing mental health symptoms,&#xD;
      while webSTAIR may have some advantages in regard to uptake and long-term sustainability in&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
