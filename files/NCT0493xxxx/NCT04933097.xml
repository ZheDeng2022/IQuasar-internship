    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease, affecting&#xD;
      0.4-0.8% of the population. This inflammatory rheumatism leads to progressive, bilateral and&#xD;
      symmetrical joint destruction, predominantly in the hands, which is responsible for&#xD;
      significant functional repercussions, a sedentary lifestyle and a reduction in physical&#xD;
      capacities leading to the onset of comorbidities. Among these comorbidities, sarcopenia is an&#xD;
      emerging concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is defined as a decrease in the quality and quantity of a person's muscles. It can&#xD;
      be primary, and therefore due to physiological ageing, or secondary to a chronic disease such&#xD;
      as inflammatory rheumatism. The definition of sarcopenia has become consensual since the 2019&#xD;
      European Working group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) recommendations and is&#xD;
      characterised by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A decrease in strength. It is assessed by the grip test with a threshold of 27 kg in men&#xD;
           and 16 kg in women. When this manual grip measurement is not possible, the authors&#xD;
           advise measurement on an isokinetic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a decrease in overall muscle mass. This is assessed either by dual energy X-ray&#xD;
           absorptiometry (DEXA whole body, the reference technique) and defined by a decrease in&#xD;
           the appendicular muscle mass index (AMMI) &lt; 7 kg/m² in men and &lt; 5.5 kg/m² in women&#xD;
           (AMMI corresponds to the lean mass of the 4 limbs in relation to the height for&#xD;
           Europeans); or on the scanographic measurement of the surface of the psoas muscle at L3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a decrease in muscular performance. This last point makes it possible to evaluate the&#xD;
           severity of this sarcopenia. Muscular performance is assessed by walking speed and/or&#xD;
           tests combining balance and walking such as the short physical performance battery test&#xD;
           (SPPB) or the timed up and go (TUG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of sarcopenia is certain when there is a decrease in muscle mass; it is&#xD;
      characterised as severe when there is a decrease in physical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two other concepts are associated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presarcopenia when there is a decrease in strength or muscle mass alone,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sarcopenic obesity when there is, in addition to the decrease in IMMA, an increase in&#xD;
           the percentage of fat mass to 40% in women and 27% in men However, these tests are&#xD;
           expensive, radiating and difficult to access for the general population. For these&#xD;
           reasons, a screening algorithm is proposed by measuring hand grip strength, which is&#xD;
           correlated with the decrease in overall muscle mass and physical performance in the&#xD;
           general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of sarcopenia are numerous. In patients with severe sarcopenia, the risk of&#xD;
      falling is doubled, increasing the risk of hospitalisation and the length of hospital stays.&#xD;
      Severe sarcopenia is also associated with an earlier risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of primary sarcopenia is between 15 and 20% in patients over 70 years of age,&#xD;
      40% after 80 years of age. In rheumatoid arthritis, Italian, Chinese, Japanese and Moroccan&#xD;
      cohorts report a prevalence of sarcopenia in RA ranging from 21 to 40.9% with a median age of&#xD;
      52.3 to 56.5 years in these studies. There is thus an overrepresentation of this condition&#xD;
      with an early age of onset compared to primary forms. In addition, there is pre-sarcopenia in&#xD;
      20% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pre-sarcopenia could correspond to a window of opportunity for the management of these&#xD;
      patients, both in terms of diet and rehabilitation. Indeed, the new recommendations of the&#xD;
      European League Against Rheumatism concerning physical activity in inflammatory rheumatism&#xD;
      propose the combination of aerobic and resistance work in patients with inflammatory&#xD;
      rheumatism. However, when management is delayed, rehabilitation is sometimes no longer&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific consequence of sarcopenia in rheumatoid arthritis is a significant functional&#xD;
      impact, with an increase in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score. In addition,&#xD;
      loss of muscle mass and function was highly correlated with a decrease in overall bone mass,&#xD;
      leading to a higher risk of osteoporotic fracture in this population. However, the method of&#xD;
      assessing this sarcopenia does not seem to be the most appropriate in this population. There&#xD;
      is a risk of overestimating the loss of strength through joint deformities. Indeed, one study&#xD;
      showed that hand grip strength was correlated with age in the general population as opposed&#xD;
      to a population of patients followed for RA. If this is not possible, the authors suggest&#xD;
      that isokinetic measurements of other muscle groups should be performed to identify patients&#xD;
      who may benefit from quantitative dynamometric muscle measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several methods of assessing isokinetic strength. As muscle testing is very&#xD;
      operator dependent, these new standardised and reproducible measurement techniques are&#xD;
      expanding rapidly. There are two main types of dynamometry, isokinetic machines such as&#xD;
      CYBEX® and BIODEX® and hand dynamometers, with a good correlation between the two techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of its low cost, portability and ease of use, this technique could justify wider use,&#xD;
      particularly in consultation. In this context of potential bias with overestimation of grip&#xD;
      strength, it would be useful to evaluate isokinetic measurement of other muscle groups to&#xD;
      assess which patients require quantitative muscle mass measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no study has yet validated such a measure in rheumatoid arthritis. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      our work is that manual dynamometry on other muscle groups would be more reproducible and&#xD;
      reliable than grip force dynamometry for the detection of sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the sensitivity and specificity of quadriceps/triceps/biceps muscle strength&#xD;
      measurement by handheld isokinetic dynamometer in screening for sarcopenia versus gold&#xD;
      standard (DEXA whole body).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA whole body is the gold standard method of measuring body compartments and allows the&#xD;
      diagnosis of sarcopenia (IMMA&lt;7 in men and 5.5 in women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual dynamometry allows isokinetic measurements of muscle strength on 3 muscle groups using&#xD;
      a manual measurement sensor of the Microfet2 ® type: quadriceps, triceps brachii, biceps&#xD;
      (results in newtons/m²).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both examinations will be performed during the patient's visit to the day hospital and will&#xD;
      be interpreted blind to the results of each of these examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Calculation of the intra-class correlation coefficient to assess inter-operator&#xD;
           agreement for manual dynamometry. To evaluate the concordance, isokinetic measurements&#xD;
           of muscle force on the 3 muscle groups using a manual measurement sensor such as&#xD;
           Microfet2 ® will be performed by 2 different operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of the sensitivity and specificity values of the JAMAR® and Microfet2®&#xD;
           dynamometer The isokinetic measurements of muscular force will be carried out using a&#xD;
           Microfet2 ® type manual measurement sensor at the level of the quadriceps, triceps&#xD;
           brachii, and biceps (results in newtons/m²) The measurement of grip strength will be&#xD;
           performed with Jamar® equipment as recommended by the EWGSOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DEXA whole body is the reference method for measuring body compartments and allows the&#xD;
           diagnosis of sarcopenia (IMMA&lt;7 in men and 5.5 in women).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identification of risk factors for sarcopenia (smoking, alcohol, corticosteroids,&#xD;
           duration of RA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Description of comorbidities associated with sarcopenia (metabolic syndrome, cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Impact on fatigue assessed by FSS questionnaire, HAQ assessment and SF 36&#xD;
