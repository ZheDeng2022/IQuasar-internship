      Patients will be enrolled at 28w0d-36w0d. Randomized to one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Labor podcasts - Seven labor podcasts that can be downloaded for any podcast app&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Usual care&#xD;

      Objectives Overall objectives To assess the effect of listening to physician-created podcasts&#xD;
      of common labor topics on patient satisfaction and perception of their birth experience&#xD;
      Primary outcome variable(s) Patient satisfaction as measured by LAS + 2 satisfaction&#xD;
      questions Secondary outcome variable(s) Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) scores&#xD;
      Logistic regression for multivariate analysis with regards to demographics and other birth&#xD;
      outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Recently, podcasts have been used for both undergraduate and graduate medical&#xD;
      education, with studies showing that they are feasible, acceptable, and effective. Learners&#xD;
      appear to enjoy podcast learning because they increased efficiency by allowing listeners to&#xD;
      multitask, made listeners keep up to date with medical literature, and increased overall&#xD;
      knowledge. However, podcast learning has not been as widespread for patient education. There&#xD;
      have been some studies that showed that podcast patient education is feasible, and one small&#xD;
      study showed increased knowledge scores after listening to podcasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, podcast learning has never been studied in the obstetric population. Labor&#xD;
      and delivery is usually a time that is fraught with questions from first time mothers, and&#xD;
      more education may increase these women's perception of control and satisfaction overall with&#xD;
      birth and the postpartum period. The Labor Agentry Scale (LAS)-10 is a validated instrument&#xD;
      measuring expectancies and experiences of personal control during childbirth. The Edinburgh&#xD;
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is also a validated scale that measures levels of&#xD;
      postpartum depression that is commonly used at our institution both immediately postpartum&#xD;
      and at the postpartum visit 4-6 weeks after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Design Pregnant patients between 28w0d - 36w0d will be randomized to one of the&#xD;
      following study arms upon enrollment. Patients will be approached after 20 weeks for consent&#xD;
      and randomized after they reach 28 weeks. The study will be done in an intent-to-treat&#xD;
      fashion. Due to the nature of the study, blinding will not be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms 1) Labor Podcast Group - Women randomized to this arm will receive access to a&#xD;
      link to download seven HUP physician created labor podcasts in addition to usual care during&#xD;
      labor, delivery, and postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Podcast topics: Labor Anesthesia, Induction of Labor, Second Stage of Labor, Reasons for&#xD;
      Cesarean Section, Postpartum Recovery, Complications of Labor and Birth, Normal Labor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LAS-10 and Birth Satisfaction survey - Women will be sent these surveys on postpartum&#xD;
           day 2 via method they indicated they desire (either email or text message)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EPDS - Women will receive this survey on postpartum day 7 via method they desire&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Usual care Women randomized to this arm will receive usual care during labor,&#xD;
           delivery, and postpartum with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LAS-10 and Birth Satisfaction survey Women will be sent these surveys on postpartum day&#xD;
           2 via method they indicated they desire (either email or text message)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EPDS Women will receive this survey on postpartum day 7 via method they desire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration Estimated length of time to enroll all subjects and complete the study Length&#xD;
      of a subject's participation time in study Project date of the proposed study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated length of time to enroll all subjects and complete study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies using the LAS-10, average score ranged between 45-53/70, with&#xD;
      standard deviations ranging from 6-12. Therefore, we would estimate that the LAS score in the&#xD;
      usual care group to be approximately 50. To be able to detect an effect size of 4, with a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 9, and to achieve a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05, we would need a&#xD;
      sample size of approximately 79 subjects per group. Calculating for a 20% loss to follow-up&#xD;
      rate, we would anticipate recruiting 95 subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our city has an average of 16% preterm birth rate. Our hospital averages 1400 nulliparous&#xD;
      deliveries/year. We would conservatively estimate approaching 50% of these women in the&#xD;
      prenatal period for enrollment. If we assume a 75% consent rate for the RCT, which is&#xD;
      standard for our center, we anticipate enrolling 30-36 women per month in our study. We would&#xD;
      therefore anticipate it taking 6 months before we reach our target sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would then require an additional 6 months to compile and analyze the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of subject's participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be followed from time of consent until 7 days postpartum Women will be followed&#xD;
      from time of consent until 7 days postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project date of the proposed study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed to start April 2021 for recruitment and enrollment. We anticipate enrolling all&#xD;
      patients by end of September 2021. We would likely be able to conclude the study by April&#xD;
      2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resources necessary for human research protection Subjects will be recruited from looking at&#xD;
      antepartum clinic charts and messaged via MPM once they are deemed eligible. This can be one&#xD;
      by Dr. Cai and Dr. Srinivas. Both will be trained in the study protocol prior to enrolling&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff will also distribute information regarding the study to the aforementioned&#xD;
      prenatal clinics so that written information can be handed out by providers to patients. This&#xD;
      will allow for patients to be aware of the study. However, only study personnel will be able&#xD;
      to consent and enroll patients.&#xD;
