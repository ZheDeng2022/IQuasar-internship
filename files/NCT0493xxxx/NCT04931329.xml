  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to show the interest of setting up a drug vigilance card in&#xD;
      Oncology in order to reinforce patient safety, develop compliance and avoid drug interactions&#xD;
      when the patient consults town professionals or other specialists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent developments in oral chemotherapy and targeted therapies have radically changed cancer&#xD;
      patient management; ambulatory care is now common. Oral therapies afford many advantages,&#xD;
      improving patient quality of life and autonomy by reducing hospital stays and involving&#xD;
      patients in their own care. Optimising the care of cancer patients at home requires the&#xD;
      coordinated intervention of hospital and town healthcare professionals and involvement of the&#xD;
      patient to detect, prevent, and manage adverse events, avoid drug interactions, and educate&#xD;
      patients. Preliminary work in haematology has highlighted (n = 31 patients) the interest of a&#xD;
      &quot;drug vigilance card&quot; in three indications (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia, Chronic Myeloid&#xD;
      Leukaemia and Multiple Myeloma) with an increase in the town-hospital link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an prospective cohort study. Following the announcement consultation, in addition to&#xD;
      the personalised care plan, the information about the treatment will be contained in a drug&#xD;
      monitoring card that will be given to the patient by the health professional (doctor or&#xD;
      nurse). This drug monitoring card should be presented to the health professionals by the&#xD;
      patient. During the entire period of treatment, the patient will have a card.&#xD;
