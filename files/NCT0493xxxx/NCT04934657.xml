  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walking is the most common, simple and convenient way of exercise with the lowest cost.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that daily steps are related to important health outcomes such as&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Catrine et al. believe that daily steps can be&#xD;
      used as a basic index to evaluate physical fitness. Many observational studies have found&#xD;
      that postoperative daily steps collected by wearable devices or smart phones are related to&#xD;
      length of hospital stay or even postoperative depression, which is suggested that the average&#xD;
      daily steps may be an important index to predict the prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we aim to explore the association between peri-operative average daily steps and&#xD;
      postoperative recovery of patients scheduled for elective surgery.&#xD;

      Patients scheduled to undergoing elective surgery including thoracic surgery ,abdominal&#xD;
      surgery, primary hip replacement and radical mastectomy will be recruited.The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are as follows: With preoperative unconsciousness; Day surgery (planned length of&#xD;
      stay &lt; 1 day); Wheelchair, walking aid or crutch were used before operation; Unable to walk&#xD;
      due to physical limitations; The collection time of preoperative steps was less than 1 week;&#xD;
      The patient refused to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment and screening ,we will ask the participants to wear a smart band to record&#xD;
      data of their daily steps , in addition we will collect the peri-operative data of these&#xD;
      participants which includes their rehabilitations and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
