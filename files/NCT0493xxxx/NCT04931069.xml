  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the most performed pancreatic surgery for malignant or&#xD;
      premalignant tumors of the region of the head of the pancreas. Its post-operative morbidity&#xD;
      is very high, over 40%. There is very little data on the impact of microbiota on&#xD;
      complications after pancreatic surgery. The purpose of this research is to study the&#xD;
      correlation between the microbiota (fecal, blood, oral, biliary, pancreatic and intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota) and the postoperative complications in patients who undergo&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After pancreaticoduodenectomy, the post-operative complications can be surgical (pancreatic&#xD;
      fistula, gastroparesis) but also infectious, digestive (diarrhea) and lead to malnutrition.&#xD;
      They are responsible for prolonged post-operative hospitalizations, impaired quality of life&#xD;
      of patients and induce a delay in the implementation of adjuvant chemotherapy, or even an&#xD;
      impossibility to achieve it. The absence of adjuvant chemotherapy adversely affects the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients, by increasing the rate of recurrence and decreased survival. There is&#xD;
      therefore a real oncological benefit in finding solutions to reduce the number and severity&#xD;
      of these complications. A change in post-operative microbiota composition has been shown to&#xD;
      play a role in the development of post-surgical anastomotic fistulas in colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Despite their importance, there is very little data on the impact of microbiota on&#xD;
      complications after pancreatic surgery. We postulate that microbiota variations could have an&#xD;
      impact on early and late post-operative complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Any&#xD;
      patient hospitalized at the Toulouse University Hospital with an indication of a&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy will be offered to participate in this study. Microbiota analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out on different samples: blood, stool and saliva samples will be collected&#xD;
      during the surgery, between J5 and J10 (post-operative during hospitalization) and at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after the surgery. Bile, pancreatic and intestinal mucosa samples will only be&#xD;
      collected during the surgery. Complications will be collected throughout this study. This&#xD;
      study will not create any additional constraints on patient management. The follow-up period&#xD;
      will be 6 months. This follow-up period will be fixed for all patients included. The&#xD;
      microbiota analyses will be centrally determined during the study.&#xD;
