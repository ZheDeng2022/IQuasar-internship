      The aim of this study is to assess the levels of neuregulin-4 and its receptor ErbB4 in the&#xD;
      GCF and saliva in stage III and IV periodontitis patients with and without type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to measure the levels of Nrg4 and ErbB4 in the GCF and saliva of&#xD;
      periodontitis stage III and IV patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus and to&#xD;
      correlate their levels with the periodontal clinical parameters and the blood glucose levels&#xD;
      including the fasting plasma glucose level (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in the Oral Medicine and Periodontology department, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry- Cairo University, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected from the outpatient clinic of the department of Oral Medicine and&#xD;
      Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry-Cairo University.&#xD;

        Dental patients will be recruited in a consecutive manner from the clinic of the department&#xD;
        of Oral Medicine and Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry -Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical history and dental history will be taken; thorough oral examination will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The aim of the study will be explained to the patient and the patient's acceptance to&#xD;
        participate in the survey will be received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-respondent patients or patients refusing to participate will be reported with the cause&#xD;
        of their refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Conventional oral and periodontal examination will be held on a dental unit using the light&#xD;
