    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide plus ADT&#xD;
      versus placebo plus enzalutamide plus ADT in Chinese participants with mHSPC. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that in participants with mHSPC, the combination of pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      enzalutamide plus ADT is superior to placebo plus enzalutamide plus ADT with respect to 1)&#xD;
      radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group&#xD;
      (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by&#xD;
      blinded independent central review (BICR) and 2) overall survival (OS).&#xD;
