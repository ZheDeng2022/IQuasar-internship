      This phase III study investigates if a de-escalated induction treatment in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      primary CNS lymphoma is superior to the standard MATRix protocol in terms of event free&#xD;
      survival. Two arms are compared, in the experimental treatment group, participants receive&#xD;
      one course of R/HD-MTX, followed by two courses of MATRix and autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. In the control treatment, participants receive four coourses of MATRix&#xD;
      followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
