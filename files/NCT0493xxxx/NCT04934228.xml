  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the hypothesize that 4 weeks of sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      activity (SNA) inhibition (oral clonidine) will cause a significant reduction in circulating&#xD;
      blood concentrations and endothelial cell expression of inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-α,&#xD;
      IL-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a prospective study using a randomized, double-blinded design to test 4 weeks of&#xD;
      SNA blockade (oral clonidine) compared with a BP-lowering control condition (diuretic,&#xD;
      hydrochlorothiazide) or a placebo.&#xD;

      1. Using a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-design approach, we hypothesize that 4&#xD;
           weeks of SNA blockade (oral clonidine) will cause a significant reduction in expression&#xD;
           of inflammatory markers in blood, endothelial cells, and central adipose compared with a&#xD;
           BP-lowering control condition using hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and a separate placebo&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the extent to which inflammation in the body is caused by elevated sympathetic&#xD;
           nerve activity&#xD;
