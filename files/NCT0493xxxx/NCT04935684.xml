  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) efficacy in the&#xD;
      prevention of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) complications&#xD;
      and particularly Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that allogeneic FMT may improve outcomes of these patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TMF-Allo study is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, parallel, randomized phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing a group patients with FMT and a control group of patients without&#xD;
      FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the effect of allogeneic FMT versus no&#xD;
      treatment on Graft-versus-host disease and Relapse-Free Survival (GRFS) at one year in adult&#xD;
      patients treating with myelo-ablative allo-HSCT for haematologic malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival, progression-free survival at 1 and 2 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The haematological evolution,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evolution of infections,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tolerance and safety of the TMF carried out in post-transplant,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evolution of the composition and diversity of the microbiota in allograft patients&#xD;
           receiving TMF or not.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at Day -7, Day 30, Day 90, Day 180, Day 360 and Day 720 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life will be auto-evaluated by the patients using a validated questionnaire: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer- Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30). The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized in the &quot;FMT group&quot; will received FMT. FMT product will be made by the the pharmacy of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital from stools of healthy volunteer donors within 6 hours after defecation in order to preserve the viability of the bacteria. The preparation will be standardized: 50g aliquots will be prepared and diluted in 250mL of 0.9% NaCl containing 10% glycerol, until a homogeneous suspension is obtained. The preparation will be rapidly frozen at -80°C until use, with a maximum shelf life of 18 months.</description>

    <description>The comparator group will be constituted by patients randomized in the &quot;no FMT&quot; group. For ethical reasons, these patients will not receive any FMT and therefore no enema or colic preparation. No placebo will be administered. Prophylactic anti-infective treatments can be introduced at any time.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized in the &quot;FMT group&quot; will received FMT within 4 weeks following neutrophils recovery after the allo-HSCT procedure. The stool transplant will be done by enema. The day before FMT, patient will undergo bowel cleansing by ingestion of two liters of polyethylene glycol solution. The day of FMT, a colon cleanse enema will be performed in the morning and FMT will be delivered around two hours after the cleanse enema. This colic preparation is essential to optimize the results of FMT.&#xD;
The enema (50g of stools diluted in 250mL of NaCl 0.9%) will be performed by a qualified member of the study team (nurse) by using a rectal cannula (within 6 hours of thawing). The enema will have to be kept by the patient for as long as possible and at least 30 minutes.</description>
