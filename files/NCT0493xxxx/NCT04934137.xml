  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure-related injuries in individuals with SCI are one of the most dangerous secondary&#xD;
      health problems encountered throughout the lifespan. With recurrence rates as high as 79% and&#xD;
      mortality rates as high as 48% when sepsis is present, there exists a critical clinical need&#xD;
      to target prevention of pressure injuries. For almost 50 years, clinicians and researchers&#xD;
      have been interested in devices to monitor pressure and weight shift frequency, send alerts,&#xD;
      provide cues, or track movement patterns in wheelchair users. Our hypotheses are that A)&#xD;
      Individuals will complete more frequent and more consistent weight shifts with access to the&#xD;
      feedback systems compared to baseline and B) Self-efficacy beliefs for completing weight&#xD;
      shifts will increase with use of the feedback systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the prevention efforts implemented over the years, pressure injuries continue to&#xD;
      occur at a high rate of incidence. Without sensation to guide the need for changes in&#xD;
      position to alleviate pressure, individuals with SCI move significantly less than individuals&#xD;
      with normal sensory systems. Thus, movement is a potentially robust protective factor to&#xD;
      target. When focusing on movement as a modifiable risk factor, there is evidence that more&#xD;
      in-seat movement is protective in wheelchair users. Behaviors, such as weight shifting to&#xD;
      relieve pressure, decay over time, which could be attributed to lack of sensation to provide&#xD;
      a natural cue to move. More work is needed to understand the types of movement that are most&#xD;
      beneficial, and how to empower wheelchair users to move more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the effects of two novel seat mapping technologies (&quot;AW-Shift&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;WiSAT&quot;) on increasing in-seat movement in persons who may be at risk for pressure injuries&#xD;
      due to altered sensation on their sitting surface. AW-Shift provides a rich visual display&#xD;
      about pressure distribution directly between the body and the seat cushion to a wheelchair&#xD;
      user outside of a clinical setting. WiSAT represents a novel technology to promote tissue&#xD;
      health by providing users with information about their daily in-seat movement and providing&#xD;
      weight shift reminders that are based on time since previous weight shift activities. Changes&#xD;
      in the frequency of in-seat movement behaviors will be compared between baseline and each&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The successful completion of this project will make large advancements in optimizing feedback&#xD;
      about pressure and movement that will help wheelchair users with spinal cord injuries (SCI)&#xD;
      become more effective in managing pressure distribution on an ongoing, daily basis.&#xD;
