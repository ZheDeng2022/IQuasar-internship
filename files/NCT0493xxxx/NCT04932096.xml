  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep wake disturbances compound recovery in over half of pediatric traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      survivors, leading to impaired quality of life, and few effective interventions exist to&#xD;
      treat this important morbidity. Therefore, this study will conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial evaluating a melatonin and sleep management intervention started during hospitalization&#xD;
      and continued after discharge compared to standard care with placebo. The trial will&#xD;
      investigate if this intervention is feasible, acceptable, and effective at reducing sleep&#xD;
      wake disturbances as measured on the Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children 1-month after&#xD;
      hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention (melatonin and sleep plan)&#xD;
      or to the control group (placebo with standard care) with a goal of equal numbers of&#xD;
      participants in each group. Participants will be followed closely after consent and outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed at hospital discharge, 2-weeks, and 1-month. Outcomes will focus on&#xD;
      feasibility (ability to recruit patients into the trial) and acceptability (patient safety&#xD;
      and satisfaction), but will also assess the effectiveness of the intervention to reduce sleep&#xD;
      disturbances after discharge. The investigators will assess sleep using questionnaires and&#xD;
      actigraphy (watch-like activity monitors). Exploratory outcomes will include global health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
