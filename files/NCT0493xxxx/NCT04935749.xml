  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2013, it was estimated that 16% (7.5 million) of all Egyptian adults between the ages of&#xD;
      20 and 79 years have type 2 diabetes and 2.6 million have diabetic retinopathy. A small pilot&#xD;
      study looking at 323 patients with previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) and 183&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed DM found that the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) was&#xD;
      48.3% and 10.4% in each group respectively. By 2035, the Middle Eastern Region and Egypt is&#xD;
      projected to have an over 96% increase in the diabetes population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrawide field (UWF) imaging is a novel technology that allows the visualization of&#xD;
      approximately 82% of the retina in a single image. Its use in diabetic retinopathy (DR) has&#xD;
      been widely explored both as a diagnostic as well as a screening tool. Using this technology,&#xD;
      more of the peripheral retina can be readily visualized allowing significantly greater&#xD;
      hemorrhages/microaneurysms, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities and non-perfusion to be&#xD;
      detected. UWF imaging in patients with DM allowed the identification of a distinct sub-set of&#xD;
      eyes with lesions that are predominantly distributed in the peripheral retina. Eyes with&#xD;
      significantly greater DR lesions in the extended peripheral fields compared to their&#xD;
      respective ETDRS fields are said to have predominantly peripheral lesions or PPL. Eyes with&#xD;
      PPL are at greater risk of progressing to more advanced DR and developing proliferative&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR) after 4 years of follow up. The increased risk of vision&#xD;
      threatening complications in eyes with PPL has made the identification of these eyes an&#xD;
      essential part of DR evaluation and screening. Furthermore, the presence of lesions in the&#xD;
      peripheral retina results in a more severe DR grade in approximately 20% of eyes thereby&#xD;
      making this tool more accurate at grading DR severity. A recent DRCR retina network&#xD;
      multicenter study established earlier findings confirming the validity of this tool in DR&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-care Ophthalmology Center will acquire the first UWF device in Egypt, the Optos California&#xD;
      (Optos Plc, Dunfermline). Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy UWF imaging has been approved by both&#xD;
      the FDA and EMA since 2011. Patients with DM, with or without known DR, will be imaged using&#xD;
      the UWF imaging device both for diagnosis and screening purposes at I-care Ophthalmology&#xD;
      center after informed consent. These images will be graded for the level of retinopathy and&#xD;
      the presence/absence of PPL by certified trained graders. Internal validation and continuous&#xD;
      quality control will routinely be conducted. Patients with vision threatening retinopathy&#xD;
      (moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse, or the presence of diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema) will be instructed to come back for further retinal evaluation and ancillary&#xD;
      testing. Patients with mild retinopathy will be instructed to come for yearly follow up&#xD;
      imaging. The expected duration for data collection will be 5-years, with interim data&#xD;
      analysis on a yearly basis. The design although cross sectional, will have a prospective&#xD;
      sub-analysis group in patients who have repeat imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and imaging will be conducted in Egypt and anonymized deidentified data will&#xD;
      be shared with the Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Ophthalmology Department for joint&#xD;
      research purposes. Data will be analyzed for the prevalence of DR and the distribution of DR&#xD;
      severity levels in the studied population. In addition, the presence and absence of PPL and&#xD;
      its association with DR progression will be studied. Non-modifiable (duration of DM, age of&#xD;
      onset, type of DM etc.) and modifiable risk factors (HbA1c, hypertension, hyperlipidemia&#xD;
      etc.) for increased risk of DR progression will also be analyzed. Sensitivity analysis will&#xD;
      explore the sensitivity/specificity of initial DR grading compared to trained retina&#xD;
      specialists.&#xD;
