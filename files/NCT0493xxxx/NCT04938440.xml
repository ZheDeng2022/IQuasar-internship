  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Instanyl study is to learn how much doctors know and understand about&#xD;
      Instanyl® before and after they receive updated educational information, including the risks&#xD;
      of its unapproved use. In this study, the doctors will complete two surveys: one three months&#xD;
      before they receive the updated educational information, and one about six months after they&#xD;
      receive this information. They will answer questions about their prescribing behavior plus&#xD;
      their knowledge of Instanyl® including any risks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, observational, cross-sectional study of prescribers of&#xD;
      Instanyl®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the prescribers' awareness of the updated EMs and changes in&#xD;
      prescribers' knowledge and understanding of the key information contained in the updated EMs.&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 768 prescribers. The first survey (pre-EM survey) will be&#xD;
      conducted three months before the distribution of updated EMs, second survey (post-EM survey)&#xD;
      will be conducted six months following the distribution of updated EMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected, through a self-administered web-based questionnaire. All&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in a single observational group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Prescriber of Instanyl®&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center study will be conducted in France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland and Spain.&#xD;
      The overall duration of the study will be approximately 22 months.&#xD;
