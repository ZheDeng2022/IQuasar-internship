  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, the incidence of esophageal cancer has been increasing over time, while surgical&#xD;
      standards for esophageal resections have remained unchanged. Currently, the standard of&#xD;
      surgical care for this cancer is Open Transthoracic Esophagectomy (OTE), a highly morbid&#xD;
      operation that is associated with a complication rate of 60-80%, and a recovery period of&#xD;
      many months. While Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy (MIE) has been developed it has not been&#xD;
      adopted because it is highly complex, technically demanding, and has a longer operative time&#xD;
      than OTE. With the advent of robotic platforms, Robotic Assisted Minimally Invasive&#xD;
      Esophagectomy (RAMIE) has recently emerged as a novel minimally invasive alternative to OTE.&#xD;
      RAMIE utilizes the DaVinci Xi robotic surgical platform which offers superior dexterity,&#xD;
      3D-vision, and wristed surgical equipment. To date, case reports and small case series have&#xD;
      demonstrated the safety of RAMIE, however it has not been performed yet in Canada, and there&#xD;
      has been no randomized trial that has compared RAMIE to OTE. This study proposes to build the&#xD;
      infrastructure for introducing RAMIE to Canada, while laying the foundations for a future&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial which will compare it to OTE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In Canada, the incidence of esophageal cancer has been increasing over time. The treatment of&#xD;
      patients with cancer of the esophagus is multi-modal, with surgery being the cornerstone of&#xD;
      most treatment regimens. Operative treatment is usually performed through Open Transthoracic&#xD;
      Esophagectomy (OTE), a highly morbid procedure that is associated with a complication rate of&#xD;
      60-80%, and a recovery period of many months. This standard is being challenged by a growing&#xD;
      body of evidence demonstrating that a minimally invasive approach can reduce post-operative&#xD;
      morbidity and improve quality-of-life, while still offering an adequate oncological outcome.&#xD;
      The minimally invasive alternative to OTE is Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy (MIE). Although&#xD;
      MIE has been shown to reduce the morbidity associated with esophagectomy, it has not been&#xD;
      widely adopted. This failure of adoption is due to the high complexity of MIE; it is an&#xD;
      exceedingly difficult operation, is associated with a very steep learning curve, and can take&#xD;
      8-10 hours to complete. As a result, less than 10% of esophageal cancer programs in Canada&#xD;
      have adopted MIE, and there remains a need for a minimally invasive alternative to OTE.&#xD;
      Robotic Assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy (RAMIE) has recently emerged as a minimally&#xD;
      invasive alternative to OTE. RAMIE utilizes the DaVinci Xi robotic surgical platform which&#xD;
      offers superior dexterity, 3D-vision, 7-degrees of freedom for range of motion, and&#xD;
      near-infrared imaging for detection of blood vessels. As a result, RAMIE has succeeded where&#xD;
      MIE has failed, and has been widely taken up in Europe and the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, near-infrared fluorescence (NIF)-guided RAMIE using indocyanine green (ICG) dye has&#xD;
      not been performed in Canada, and there has been no randomized controlled trial that has&#xD;
      compared RAMIE to OTE. This study proposes to build the infrastructure for introducing RAMIE&#xD;
      to Canada, while laying the foundations for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) which&#xD;
      will compare it to OTE.&#xD;

    <description>The patient will undergo NIF-guided RAMIE using ICG dye using the standard Ivor-Lewis approach. This will be a two-stage operation involving a first stage through a 5-port robotic approach through the abdomen to achieve a proximal gastrectomy and D2 nodal dissection. A feeding jejunostomy would not be inserted, as per the enhanced recovery pathway for esophagectomy. In addition, the vascularization of the conduit can be confirmed using the near-infrared camera of the robot with the ICG dye. The second stage of the operation will involve a 4-port robotic approach through the right chest to achieve thoracic nodal dissection, esophagectomy, and a hand-sewn anastomosis between the residual esophagus and the gastric conduit at the level of the azygous vein. During this second stage of the operation, NIF with ICG dye will be used to visualize the vascular supply of the gastric conduit, and assess the gastric conduit for any perfusions to potentially reduce anastomotic leaks.</description>
