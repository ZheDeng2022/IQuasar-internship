  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the lower extremity is the third leading cause of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity. Endovascular treatment has become the principal&#xD;
      surgical strategy in femoro-popliteal lesions. Stent placement induces significant changes in&#xD;
      the arterial geometry and thereby in the hemodynamic environment. Visualization of local&#xD;
      blood flow patterns (around stents) is challenging, but clinically relevant. Blood flow has a&#xD;
      significant influence on the development of atherosclerosis and therefore stent patency. In&#xD;
      vivo blood flow characterization might enable the recognition, prediction and explanation of&#xD;
      (in-stent) restenosis. This study will therefore aim to investigate the feasibility of a&#xD;
      novel ultrasound technique (echoPIV) to quantify spatiotemporal blood flow near stented&#xD;
      femoral artery lesions. Furthermore, the blood flow information obtained during the echoPIV&#xD;
      measurements will be used as patient-specific boundary conditions in a computational fluid&#xD;
      dynamics (CFD) simulation. The tested hypothesis is that blood flow quantification using&#xD;
      echoPIV is feasible in and around stents in the femoral artery and that it will improve CFD&#xD;
      simulations.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative assessment vector velocity fields</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (stent placement of SFA)</time_frame>
    <description>Vector velocity fields derived from the echoPIV data will be used to calculate and visualize the velocity profile. In order to answer the question regarding feasibility of echoPIV the quality of the vector velocity fields will be assessed using three different metrics of which the first one is a qualitative assessment by different observers. Recordings of the contrast-enhanced ultrasound with an overlay of the vector velocity profiles will be reviewed on different topics following a scoring rubrics.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contrast-to-background ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (stent placement of SFA)</time_frame>
    <description>The contrast-to-background ratio (CBR) is the second metric to assess the outcomes of the echoPIV measurements. The CBR is a quantitative measure for the contrast levels and therefore for the quality of the contrast-enhanced US image. The higher the CBR level (in dB) the higher the intensity of the contrast which is needed for sufficient PIV analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vector correlation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (stent placement of SFA)</time_frame>
    <description>The vector correlation is the third metric to assess the outcomes of the echoPIV measurements. The vector correlation demonstrates the tracking performance of the PIV algorithm. The vector correlation provides a unitless value between 0 and 1 in which 0 indicates poor tracking of the microbubble contrast and 1 indicates perfect tracking of the microbubble contrast.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vorticity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (stent placement of SFA)</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple blood flow parameters will be derived from the echoPIV data. The first one is the vorticity, or the curl of the velocity. The vorticity represents the rotation of particles inside the flow field. This measure can potentially be used to define regions with disturbed blood flow, as a high value (in rad/s) indicates the occurence of a recirculation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vector complexity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (stent placement of SFA)</time_frame>
    <description>The second blood flow parameters derived from the echoPIV data is the vector complexity. Vector complexity is a measure of multi-directional flow, ranging from 0 till 1. a value of 1 means complex flow with all velocity vectors pointing in all directions, whereas a value of 0 means laminar flow with all velocity vectors pointing in the same direction. This measure can potentially be used to indicate regions with disturbed blood flow.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation echoPIV and CFD</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (stent placement of SFA)</time_frame>
    <description>Velocity profiles obtained with echoPIV will be compared to outcomes of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation model of the femoral artery. Multiple points along the imaged vessel will be selected in both the echoPIV and the CFD data to extract the temporal velocity profile. This profile will be compared point-by-point after which the correlation between both outcomes/techniques will be obtained.</description>
