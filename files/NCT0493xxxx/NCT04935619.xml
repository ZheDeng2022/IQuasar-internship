  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is ~5.0%, and rates of co-occurring SUDs in&#xD;
      these patients approach 40-50%. Specifically, rates of co-morbid cannabis use disorder (CUD)&#xD;
      in patients with MDD are elevated 2-3 fold compared to 2.9% in the general population, and is&#xD;
      associated with poorer treatment outcomes and impaired cognitive and psychosocial functioning&#xD;
      in comparison to MDD patients without CUD. Most studies of cannabis use in MDD are&#xD;
      cross-sectional in design, and therefore causal relationships are unclear. This study&#xD;
      investigates the effects of cannabis abstinence over a 28-day period in patients with MDD&#xD;
      with co-occurring CUD using a randomized controlled design, namely contingent reinforcement.&#xD;

      The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is ~5.0%, and rates of co-occurring SUDs in&#xD;
      these patients approach 40-50%. Specifically, rates of co-morbid cannabis use disorder (CUD)&#xD;
      in patients with MDD are elevated 2-3 fold compared to 2.9% in the general population, and is&#xD;
      associated with poorer treatment outcomes and impaired cognitive and psychosocial functioning&#xD;
      in comparison to MDD patients without CUD. To date, most studies of cannabis use in MDD were&#xD;
      cross-sectional in design, and therefore causal relationships are unclear. The investigators&#xD;
      previous studies in cannabis dependent patients with schizophrenia suggest that extended&#xD;
      cannabis abstinence (up to 28 days) using contingent reinforcement is associated with&#xD;
      improvements in specific areas of cognition (e.g. verbal learning and memory) and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. A more recent study using an open-label design demonstrated that 28 days of&#xD;
      cannabis abstinence improves depressive symptoms and anhedonia in participants (N=11) with&#xD;
      co-occurring MDD and CUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a controlled cannabis abstinence paradigm in patients with&#xD;
      co-morbid MDD and CUD (N=52) to further investigate these findings. Stabilized MDD patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe CUD will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) A contingent&#xD;
      reinforcement (CR) intervention (n=26); 2) a non-contingent reinforcement (NCR) intervention&#xD;
      (n=26), which will serve as a time and non-abstinence control. In the CR group, subjects&#xD;
      achieving biochemically-verified cannabis abstinence at study endpoint (Day 28) will receive&#xD;
      a $300 contingent payment; participants in the NCR group will not receive this contingent&#xD;
      payment. The primary outcomes are: 1) cannabis abstinence rates at Day 28 in CR versus NCR&#xD;
      groups; 2) changes in mood (depressive), anxiety and sleep symptoms over the 28-day&#xD;
      assessment period. Secondary outcomes include cognition.&#xD;
