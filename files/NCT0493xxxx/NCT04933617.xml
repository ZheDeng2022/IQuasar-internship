    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are aggressive B cell&#xD;
      lymphomas. Frontline treatment does not always work. Researchers want to see if a combination&#xD;
      of drugs can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if it is safe to give people with certain cancers copanlisib together with rituximab&#xD;
      and combination chemotherapy (DA-EPOCH-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with relapsed and/or refractory highly aggressive B-cell lymphomas&#xD;
      such as BL and certain types of DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. A needle will be put into their hipbone. Marrow will be&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and/or brain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsy (if needed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given in 21-day cycles for up to 6 cycles. Participants will get copanlisib&#xD;
      by intravenous (IV) infusion. They will also get a group of medicines called DA-EPOCH-R, as&#xD;
      follows. They will get rituximab by IV infusion. Doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine will&#xD;
      be mixed together in an IV bag and given by continuous IV infusion over 4 days. They will get&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide by IV infusion. They will take prednisone by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have frequent study visits. At these visits, they will repeat some&#xD;
      screening tests. They may give tissue, saliva, and cheek swab samples. They will have at&#xD;
      least one spinal tap. For this, a needle will be inserted into the spinal canal. Fluid will&#xD;
      be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit 30 days after treatment ends. They will have follow-up visits&#xD;
      for at least 5 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B cell lymphoma that often involves the bone&#xD;
      marrow and central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frontline therapy cures 80-85% of adults with BL but patients with CNS involvement or those&#xD;
      who relapse after frontline therapy are at high risk for treatment failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous group of aggressive B-cell lymphomas&#xD;
      that are successfully cured by frontline therapy in 60-70% of cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of DLBCL that have MYC gene rearrangement as well as those that have transformed&#xD;
      from an underlying indolent lymphoma have a lower cure rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-adjusted (DA)-EPOCH-R is an infusional chemotherapy platform often used as frontline&#xD;
      therapy for these aggressive B-cell lymphomas and is an effective chemotherapy platform from&#xD;
      which to rationally design novel therapies for patients with BL, high grade B-cell lymphomas-&#xD;
      double hit/triple hit (HGBCL-DH/TH), DLBCL and MYC rearrangements, and other high-risk DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is an important signaling pathway for cellular&#xD;
      responses to growth factors and a downstream event of B-cell receptor signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copanlisib targets both PI3K-a and PI3K-d isoforms and is approved for relapsed FL, active as&#xD;
      monotherapy in DLBCL, and highly effective in pre-clinical models of BL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copanlisib crosses the blood brain barrier suggesting it may prevent secondary CNS spread in&#xD;
      highly aggressive B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copanlisib is a rational targeted agent to be added to DA-EPOCH-R in patients with BL,&#xD;
      HGBCL-DH/TH, and other high-risk B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the Maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      copanlisib in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and high&#xD;
      grade B-cell lymphomas- double hit/triple hit (HGBCL-DH/TH) relapsed after or refractory to&#xD;
      chemo-immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have a histologic diagnosis, confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI with&#xD;
      one of the following subtypes and prior therapy, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burkitt lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberration, High-grade B-cell lymphoma, NOS,&#xD;
      High-grade B-cell lymphoma, with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements - following at least&#xD;
      1 anthracycline-containing regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLBCL, NOS, Germinal center B-cell type (GCB) type, T-cell/histocyte-rich large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma, following at least 1 anthracycline-containing regimen AND at least 2 prior regimens&#xD;
      OR be primary refractory to frontline therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate bone marrow and organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1, open-label, single center, non-randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;3+3&quot; dosing will be used to determine the RP2D and MTD of dose escalated copanlisib in&#xD;
      combination with standard regimen DA-EPOCH-R&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum 6 cycles (21-day cycles) of combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion at the RP2D or MTD to evaluate efficacy and further evaluate safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in dose expansion cohort, the&#xD;
      accrual ceiling will be set at 34&#xD;

        oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for continuous 12 months&#xD;
        without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in&#xD;
        the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using&#xD;
        hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. The investigator or a designated&#xD;
        associate is requested to advise the subject how to achieve highly effective birth control&#xD;
        (failure rate of less than 1%), e.g., intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine&#xD;
        hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner and sexual&#xD;
