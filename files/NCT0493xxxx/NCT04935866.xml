  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NeurO2 study is a multicenter observational study looking at NIRS monitoring in&#xD;
      neurocrocritically ill patients during the acute phase of care following an acute brain&#xD;
      injury. The study is nested within the HEMOTION Trial and the SAHaRA Trial&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NeurO2 study is a multicenter prospective study nested within two large-scale pragmatic&#xD;
      randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) trials in neurocritically ill patients, the HEMOTION&#xD;
      and the SAHaRa trials. These two trials are designed to compare a restrictive and a liberal&#xD;
      transfusion strategies in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage. The NeurO2 will report on prospectively gathered regional cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      data (rSO2) from enrolled patients randomized to either the liberal or restrictive RBC&#xD;
      transfusion strategy of their parent trials. The primary outcome will be 6-month neurologic&#xD;
      function based on the GOSe. The established infrastructure of the trials will be used,&#xD;
      including part of the data collection instruments and the outcome assessment team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NeurO2 study will achieve three separate but interconnected primary objectives: i)&#xD;
      Evaluate if the cerebral hypoxemic burden as measured by NIRS during NICU stay, is associated&#xD;
      with functional neurologic outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale extended - GOSe) at 6 months, ii)&#xD;
      Determine if the cerebral hypoxemic burden is impacted by red blood cell transfusion, iii)&#xD;
      Determine if the level of response in cerebral hypoxemic burden after RBC transfusion is&#xD;
      associated with the 6-month functional neurologic outcome (GOSe)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate whether the cerebral hypoxemic burden measured by&#xD;
      NIRS is associated with other clinically relevant outcomes including ICU, hospital and&#xD;
      6-month mortality and hospital, ICU length of stay and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardised measure of health-related quality of life developed by the EuroQol Group. The EQ-5D-5L includes a 5-dimension questionnaire and an overall health question using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The 5 dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is evaluated based on 5 levels (from the worst (1) to the best (5)). The overall health evaluation is based on a 100 point VAS where 100 means the optimal health</description>

    <description>Non invasive brain oxygenation monitoring with Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) technology. Patients enrolled in the NeurO2 study will have bilateral NIRS sensors applied to the forehead according to manufacturer recommendations. Data will be monitored continuously throughout the study intervention in the parent trials (HEMOTION and SAHaRA trials) in the neurocritical care unit. Data will be extracted from the device at the end of the study period.</description>
