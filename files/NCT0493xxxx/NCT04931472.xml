  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Clinical&#xD;
      Frailty Scale (CFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scale can potentially be adopted for daily use in the Emergency Department (ED) and have&#xD;
      been evaluated with regard to feasibility to a certain extent, but have so far not been&#xD;
      evaluated in the Swedish emergency care context.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CFS is introduced and tested as part of a quality-improvement process regarding elderly&#xD;
      people within the three Emergency departments (ED) of Region Östergötland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFS is a 9-point scale developed within the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, a pictograph&#xD;
      and a clinical description aids to assign scores from very fit to terminally ill. The scale&#xD;
      enable clinicians to stratify elderly people's degree of frailty with the help of questions&#xD;
      and clinical assessment. However, even excellent tools will not be used if they are too&#xD;
      difficult or time consuming. The amount of papers addressing issues regarding feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the CFS in a clinical ED-setting is still limited, and for Swedish EDs&#xD;
      non-existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a larger research project, data will be collected in three ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. All eligible patients who visit the ED for a period of six weeks will be enrolled, and&#xD;
      subsequently assessed with CFS by one of their responsible health-care professionals (i.e.&#xD;
      physician, registered nurse or nurse assistant). The number of screened patients divided by&#xD;
      the total number of eligible patients will yield the screening rate. Patient- and&#xD;
      organisational related characteristics will be collected from the electronic health record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. 100 patients will be assessed when someone from the research team is present to enrol&#xD;
      patients and clock the assessments. These work shifts will be selected using the online&#xD;
      application Research Randomizer, to randomly include all hours of the day as well as eligible&#xD;
      health-care professionals. The research-team member will document the time to complete the&#xD;
      assessment using CFS, which will give us the screening time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. To assess acceptability, health-care professionals will be sent a questionnaire per email,&#xD;
      including two reminders. The questionnaire will consist of Likert scales, multiple-choice&#xD;
      questions and open textboxes with the aim to explore facilitators and barriers for screening&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To explore the feasibility and acceptability of the CFS in a Swedish Emergency&#xD;
      care context.&#xD;
