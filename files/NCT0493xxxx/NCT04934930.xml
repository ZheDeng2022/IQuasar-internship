  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a chronic indolent malignancy, where treatment with 6 cycles of&#xD;
      bendamustine obinutuzumab (BO) is highly effective but at a cost of increased adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor specific DNA can be traced in blood and bone marrow of follicular lymphoma patients&#xD;
      even after therapy, and when detected after lymphoma treatment it is referred to as minimal&#xD;
      residual disease (MRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRD elimination after effective lymphoma treatment is a marker for deep response and&#xD;
      correlates with prolonged remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we aim to omit chemotherapy after 4 cycles of treatment in patients achieving&#xD;
      MRD elimination after 3 months of therapy, as well as complete metabolic response on positron&#xD;
      emission computed tomography (PET-CT), hoping to preserve treatment effectiveness while&#xD;
      reducing adverse events.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with an&#xD;
      estimated incidence of 3.18 cases per 100000 people a year in the United States The disease&#xD;
      is characterized by an indolent behavior, where often treatment is unnecessary at diagnosis,&#xD;
      and a &quot;watch &amp; wait&quot; approach is the standard of care for asymptomatic patients. FL is also a&#xD;
      highly responsive disease for immuno-chemotherapeutic combinations, although most patients&#xD;
      will eventually relapse. Since the disease is incurable &amp; indolent in nature, the therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy should aim for disease control, while using treatments with high safety profile in&#xD;
      order to minimize the chance for life threatening adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy with rituximab cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine &amp; prednisone (R-CHOP)&#xD;
      combination &amp; subsequent rituximab maintenance therapy for 24 months shows excellent results&#xD;
      with a median progression free survival (PFS) of above a decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more recent GALLIUM trial has shown that combining the monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab&#xD;
      with chemotherapy is even more efficacious compared to rituximab combinations. When different&#xD;
      combinations were examined in this trial the best results were achieved with the&#xD;
      bendamustine-obinutuzumab (BO) combination with 3 year PFS of 84%. Unfortunately the trial&#xD;
      also revealed a downside for this effective combination with higher rate of fatal adverse&#xD;
      events among patients receiving 6 cycles of bendamustine combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with acute leukemia evaluation for minimal residual disease (MRD) is a routine&#xD;
      procedure, and the nature &amp; length of treatment are guided by MRD status at different time&#xD;
      points during therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among FL patients treated with obinutuzumab-chemotherapy combinations, it has been shown that&#xD;
      after 3 cycles of treatment about 90% of patients were MRD negative. In addition MRD&#xD;
      negativity at the end of induction in either peripheral blood or bone marrow was found to be&#xD;
      associated with improved outcomes in patients with 1st line treatment for FL as well as in&#xD;
      the relapsed setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings raise the possibility for an MRD based treatment approach, where the duration&#xD;
      of chemotherapy could be guided by MRD status at mid-induction. Eliminating chemotherapy&#xD;
      while continuing immunotherapy after achievement of MRD negativity &amp; complete metabolic&#xD;
      remission on PET-CT at mid-induction could reduce treatment toxicity, while potentially&#xD;
      preserving efficacy.&#xD;
