    <textblock>
      Modic changes have been associated with low back pain in many clinical studies and are often&#xD;
      considered a part of the disc degeneration process. Modic type 1 change is considered an&#xD;
      inflammatory process. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of lumbar&#xD;
      transforaminal epidural steroid injections in Modic type-1 changes.&#xD;

      Modic changes have been associated with low back pain in many clinical studies and are often&#xD;
      considered a part of the disc degeneration process. However, in degenerative disc disease,&#xD;
      whether the pain could be attributed to Modic changes or not is still a matter of debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different options in the treatment of low back pain due to degenerative disc&#xD;
      disease (DDD) and Modic changes. Conservative treatments and surgical approaches are some of&#xD;
      them. Other interventional procedures include intradiscal and epidural steroid injections&#xD;
      which have relatively less risk of complications than surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only study in the literature investigating the effectiveness of epidural steroid&#xD;
      injections in patients with low back pain associated with modic changes belongs to Butterman&#xD;
      et al. They reported that patients with Modic changes (type 1) responded better to epidural&#xD;
      steroid injections than those without endplate irregularities. However, they did not report&#xD;
      the details of the procedure, such as the steroid and local anesthetic they used, the amount&#xD;
      of them and the level of the procedure. Moreover, they used different approaches including&#xD;
      interlaminar and transforaminal, which may be misleading while interpreting the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these results, the aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of lumbar&#xD;
      transforaminal epidural steroid injections in Modic type-1 changes.&#xD;

The items question the severity of pain, self-care, lifting-carrying, walking, sitting, standing, sleep, the degree of pain change, travel and social life. There are six statements under each item, marking what is appropriate for the patient's condition. The first statement is scored as &quot;0&quot; and the sixth statement as &quot;5&quot;.

    <description>Kambin's triangle approach in transforaminal epidural injection: Kambin's triangle is defined as a right triangle over the dorsolateral disc. The hypotenuse is the exiting nerve root, the base is the superior border of the caudal vertebra, and the height is the dura/traversing nerve root. it is possible to inject agents at the entrance and middle zone as the main areas of nerve entrapment by injecting at the retrodiscal area of the entrance zone, as proximal area of the targeted nerve root.</description>
