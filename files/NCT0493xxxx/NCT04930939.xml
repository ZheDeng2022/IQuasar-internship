  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Previous studies have reported that heart rate variability (HRV)-guided training&#xD;
      is a better option for improving autonomic function and aerobic capacity (i.e., oxygen uptake&#xD;
      and power output at second ventilatory threshold and maximal exercise) during a&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test compared to predefined training in sedentary and physically&#xD;
      active healthy people. Nevertheless, none of these previous studies have been carried out&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 23 patients with CAD were divided into HRV-guided training group (HRV-G;&#xD;
      n = 11) and predefined training group (PRE-G; n = 12). All patients trained three days a week&#xD;
      for eight weeks (18 sessions). Patients allocated in the PRED-G carried out a previously&#xD;
      established cardiac rehabilitation programme, combining sessions of moderate and high&#xD;
      intensity, while patients allocated in the HRV-G carried out sessions of moderate or high&#xD;
      intensity on the basis of their daily HRV assessments. The weekly averaged and isolated&#xD;
      parasympathetic-related HRV indices, heart rate recovery, resting heart rate, and aerobic&#xD;
      capacity were assessed before and after of the training programme.&#xD;

      This study was a parallel-group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. This study was&#xD;
      approved by the ethical committee of the local University and was conducted conforming to the&#xD;
      recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible patients were men and women with&#xD;
      low-risk and age ≥ 18 years, who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction, angina&#xD;
      pectoris, had undergone revascularisation (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting) or coronary heart disease was documented by angiography, up&#xD;
      to one year before to the enrolment in the study. Exclusion criteria included unstable&#xD;
      angina, atrial fibrillation, cardiac implantable electronic devices, complex ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, conditions limiting participation in exercise&#xD;
      training and/or symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test at pre-intervention. Before&#xD;
      taking part in the study, patients were interviewed and signed a written informed consent.&#xD;
      The patients were randomly allocated to a predefined training group (PRED-G; n = 12) or heart&#xD;
      rate variability (HRV)-guided training group (HRV-G; n = 11).Before to start the study&#xD;
      protocol, patients were instructed to properly carry out day-to-day HRV measurements. The&#xD;
      study protocol was divided into two periods: a 2-week baseline period (BP) and a 6-week&#xD;
      training period (TP). Before and after TP, baseline assessment week (PRE) and final&#xD;
      assessment week (POST) were conducted, respectively. The variables/tests assessed/included in&#xD;
      the assessment weeks were: cardiopulmonary exercise test, autonomic function, body&#xD;
      composition, blood analysis, quality of life and dietary intake. Assessments were carried out&#xD;
      in the same sequence and at the same period of the day. Patients and assessors recording the&#xD;
      outcome measurements were blinded to the group allocations. Throughout the 6-week TP,&#xD;
      patients allocated to PRED-G carried out a predefined training program, while patients that&#xD;
      were assigned to HRV-G trained based on day-to-day HRV measurements.&#xD;

    <description>Isolated heart rate variability (HRV) assessments were performed in a quiet room with an average temperature of 22ᵒC. Polar H7 chest strap (Polar Electro OY, Kempele, Finland) and Elite HRV app (Perrotta, Jeklin, Hives, Meanwell, &amp; Warburton, 2017) were used to capture HRV measurements. Patients were informed to avoid talking and sleeping, controlling breathing pace to 12 breaths per min. The length of the recording was 20 min, and the last 5 min was selected to calculate HRV indexes. Kubios HRV Software 2.0 for Windows (The Biomedical Signal Analysis Group, Kuopio, Finland) was used to analyse time and frequency domain indices in absolute and normalised units.</description>

    <description>All patients were instructed to assess their heart rate variability (HRV) in the morning at home every day throughout the entire study. The HRV recordings were attained via a photoplethysmography smartphone application (HRV4Ttraining) previously validated (Daniel J Plews et al., 2017). HRV assess were done at rest, as patients lay supine for 90 s with spontaneous breathing in a semi-dark room, and the las 60 s were capture. Day-to-day HRV values across assessment weeks (PRE and POST) were averaged to obtain a 7-day weekly averaged HRV value.</description>

    <description>The MacNew heart disease health-related quality of life (HRQL) instrument was used as a disease-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire. MacNew has been proved to be a valid and reliable questionnaire applicable to patients with coronary artery disease. The MacNew consists of 27 items that fall into three domains (a 13-item physical limitations domain scale, a 14-item emotional function domain scale, and a 13-item social function domain scale). The maximum possible score in any domain is 7 (high HRQL) and the minimum is 1 (poor HRQL).</description>
