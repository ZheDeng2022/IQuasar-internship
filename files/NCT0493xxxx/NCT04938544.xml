  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the absence of excessive alcohol consumption, increased levels of fat in the liver (&gt;5%)&#xD;
      are diagnosed as non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). It has been shown that NAFL is strongly&#xD;
      associated with impairments in metabolic health such as hepatic and whole-body insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Insulin resistance is seen as the earliest hallmark in the development of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin has two main effects on the liver: suppressing endogenous glucose production (EGP)&#xD;
      and increasing glucose uptake. While the former has been extensively studied and is known to&#xD;
      be impaired in NAFL, no studies have yet examined whether insulin-stimulated hepatic glucose&#xD;
      uptake is affected by NAFL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent methodological developments allow us to visualize and quantify glucose uptake in any&#xD;
      given tissue using dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with 18Fluorinated glucose&#xD;
      tracer (FDG) during insulin stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we will in a first instance optimize the insulin-stimulated whole-body&#xD;
      PET protocol and apply the dose as reported in the literature 4 megabequerels per kg of body&#xD;
      weight (MBq/kg) (±8 mSv) in the first three subjects. It will then be evaluated whether the&#xD;
      dose can be decreased in the remaining measurements. Another twelve individuals will then&#xD;
      undergo the optimized dynamic PET protocol to assess insulin-stimulated hepatic glucose&#xD;
      together with whole-body glucose uptake measures. Liver fat content and composition will be&#xD;
      assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Fasted De Novo Lipogenesis (DNL)&#xD;
      will also be measured by deuterated water. Additionally, a two-step clamp will be performed&#xD;
      to measure whole-body insulin sensitivity and insulin-stimulated suppression of EGP. The&#xD;
      identification of the contributing factors to insulin resistance during the development of&#xD;
      NAFL is crucial in order to develop more effective strategies for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of metabolic disorders.&#xD;

    <description>Insulin-stimulated hepatic glucose uptake rate constant (Ki) will be determined by [18F]- FDG PET, by using the Patlak method (Patlak et al. 1983) in each voxel. Influx rate will be calculated in mL/cm3/min</description>

    <description>Liver fat will be quantified by 1H-MRS with which the water and fat resonances can be detected. The intensity of the fat resonance will be expressed relative to the water resonance (%).</description>

    <measure>Hepatic insulin sensitivity measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Hepatic insulin sensitivity is measured as % suppression of endogenous glucose production and peripheral insulin sensitivity is measured as Rd in μmol/kg/min. During the clamp, four blood samples in time are taken during each of the three steady states (basal, low insulin and high insulin phase). The average of these four blood samples will be taken for further calculations regarding glucose tracer kinetic: rate of appearance (Ra) and Rd.</description>

    <description>Liver fat will be quantified by 1H-MRS with which the water and fat resonances can be detected. The intensity of the fat resonance will be expressed relative to the water resonance (%). Hepatic fatty acid composition is measured as relative amount of SFA, MUFA and PUFA to the total amount of fatty acids determined by MRS.</description>

        A total of 15 healthy overweight/obese males and post-menopausal females (45-75 years, BMI&#xD;
        27-38 kg/m2) will participate in the study. Recruitment of participants will be performed&#xD;
        in Maastricht and surroundings, by means of posters in public spaces (supermarkets,&#xD;
        hospital, pharmacy, general practitioners), advertisements in local newspapers (e.g.&#xD;
        Dagblad de Limburger and EenLokaal) and on the internet (e.g. digiprik.nl, proefbunny.nl&#xD;
        and facebook.nl). Participants from previous studies will be contacted as well in case they&#xD;
        provided written consent for this. To increase recruitment efficiency, potential&#xD;
        participants can register at a mailing list. With this list, the researcher can approach&#xD;
        individuals who showed interest in participating scientific research.&#xD;
