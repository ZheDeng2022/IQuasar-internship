  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent training (CT, characterised by the inclusion of two exercise modalities), is&#xD;
      recognised to improve metabolic syndrome (MetS) markers, but little is known about order&#xD;
      session effect on interindividual variability. The purpose of the present study was to&#xD;
      describe the effects, and the interindividual variability, of 20 weeks of CT in different&#xD;
      order at (i.e., high intensity interval training (HIIT) plus resistance training (RT),&#xD;
      compared with another group doing RT plus HIIT) in women with severe/morbidly obesity at risk&#xD;
      of MetS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Morbid obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 (class III obesity), is a&#xD;
      chronic disease with life-threatening cardiometabolic consequences such as elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure (systolic [SBP] or diastolic BP [DBP]), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglycerides&#xD;
      (Tg), and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), all summarised as metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome (MetS). In this sense, exercise training as resistance training (RT), defined as any&#xD;
      exercise that causes voluntary skeletal muscle contraction by using external weights such as&#xD;
      dumbbells and metal bars, is a known non-pharmacotherapy strategy for improving muscle&#xD;
      strength and functional capacity in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Similarly,&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT), defined as several and brief bouts of high-intensity&#xD;
      effort usually by cycling/running, interspersed by recovery periods ), has produced strong&#xD;
      evidence for the improvement of cardiometabolic risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      arterial hypertension, central arterial stiffness and, vascular function, and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness. Thus, in individuals with morbid obesity, for example, exercise&#xD;
      training has proven to be effective for inducing clinically significant weight loss (5-10%),&#xD;
      and for the reduction of cardiovascular risk, following the standard recommendations for&#xD;
      these cohorts prior to bariatric surgical. However, some inconsistencies have been described&#xD;
      after CT, which are directly concerned with the 'order' (i.e. starting the CT session with&#xD;
      MICT followed by RT, or vice versa) of the CT session. However, little is known about the&#xD;
      interindividual variability of exercise training (IVET) in relation to different order&#xD;
      sessions of CT in morbidly obese populations and health-related outcomes, such as MetS&#xD;
      markers. Briefly, IVET means that some subjects achieve benefits after training, and are&#xD;
      termed responders (Rs), while others exhibit a worsened or unchanged response, and that is&#xD;
      commonly known termed as nonresponders (NRs).&#xD;

    <description>The HIIT+RT group, the HIIT section consisted of 60 seconds of maximum intensity exercise using a magnetic resistance static bicycle (OxfordTM Fitness, model BE-2701, Chile), followed by 60-120 seconds of passive recovery over the bicycle totally off. This was repeated four to seven times according to the weekly schedule. The intensity of the exercise was measured on the Borg scale of 1 to 10 of perceived exertion and the participants worked at a level of between 6 to 9 points. Second, in the RT section, three to out of four RT exercises were included (according to the planning week), targeting the following different muscle groups: (1) forearm, (2) knee flexors and extensors, (3) trunk, (4) chest, (5) shoulder elevators, (6) horizontal shoulder flexors, (7) extensors, and finally (8) plantar flexors. These exercises were performed in three 3 sets of as many repetitions as possible in 60 seconds, followed by 60 to 120 seconds of passive recovery.</description>
