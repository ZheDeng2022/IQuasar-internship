  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an implementation trial of the All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL) smoking cessation&#xD;
      program, which has already been tested for efficacy in reservation populations and shown&#xD;
      feasibility in urban populations. It includes four implementation sites, two reservation&#xD;
      sites and two urban sites. Therefore, investigators plan to test efficacy simultaneously.&#xD;
      Implementation will follow guidelines described in the protocol, with all sites implementing&#xD;
      certain parts of the intervention the same way, with the freedom to modify some aspects of&#xD;
      the intervention for appropriate use in their communities. Statistical considerations are&#xD;
      described in the appropriate section.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL) is a culturally tailored, group-based quit smoking program&#xD;
      for American Indian (AI) people. For this project, there are certain aspects of ANBL that are&#xD;
      maintained across all sites. There are other aspects that may be modified at different sites&#xD;
      to best fit the community. The aspects of the program that are maintained include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Support Sessions: The primary component of ANBL is group-based support sessions, led by&#xD;
      an AI community member. Due to low rates of educational attainment among AI, the study team&#xD;
      decided to not limit session leaders to individuals with counseling degrees; investigators&#xD;
      will train community members in group support and counseling skills. Group leaders are not&#xD;
      called &quot;counselors&quot; due to community reticence to trust providers trained in Western&#xD;
      counseling. Investigators chose the term &quot;facilitator&quot; because this role facilitates&#xD;
      discussion and creates positive interactions. All group sessions begin with team building and&#xD;
      discussion about things people are experiencing in their lives, both those related directly&#xD;
      to smoking and other things that help or hinder quit attempts. The first group session is&#xD;
      devoted to forming a cohesive group and learning about individual journeys with tobacco.&#xD;
      Participants are asked to bring their primary support person with them. This is the quit date&#xD;
      for all participants to ensure they go through the process together. During the traditional&#xD;
      tobacco session, participants bring personal items about traditional tobacco and can conduct&#xD;
      a group ceremony signifying the end of their journey with recreational tobacco and&#xD;
      celebrating it as a sacred plant. Facilitators acknowledge the diversity of tobacco use (or&#xD;
      nonuse) and adjust the session as appropriate. There are two &quot;Family Sessions&quot; (weeks 7 and&#xD;
      12) where participants bring family or household members to a group dinner to mobilize&#xD;
      support and reinforce family-level intervention components. Guests are provided with&#xD;
      additional information about how to support someone who is trying to quit. One support person&#xD;
      is asked to attend additional sessions with the person they are supporting; this person is&#xD;
      welcome at any and all sessions. All attendees are taught the importance of home smoking&#xD;
      rules and are encouraged to implement them, along with the individual trying to quit. The&#xD;
      study team will track social support and home smoking rules throughout the program to&#xD;
      identify any impact they may have on quitting through surveys with the individual who is&#xD;
      quitting, asking them to identify how they are being supported and what types of home smoking&#xD;
      rules have been implemented. Support people will not be considered study participants and&#xD;
      will not complete surveys. This is done at the request of community members because they&#xD;
      believe it will be more difficult to get support people to participate if they must also be&#xD;
      subjects of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual Telephone Counseling: Between groups, facilitators call participants to see how&#xD;
      they are doing and if they are having side effects to medications, discuss personal issues,&#xD;
      and to remind them of the next group. Facilitators use Motivational Interviewing (MI)&#xD;
      counseling techniques. MI has shown effectiveness with AI, is designed to enhance motivation&#xD;
      and is based on the assumption that many people with addictions are not in an advanced state&#xD;
      of readiness to change. The goal is to increase motivation by developing a discrepancy&#xD;
      between behavior and goals. The study team developed culturally sensitive MI scripts to&#xD;
      conduct telephone sessions exploring positive and negative aspects of, ambivalence about and&#xD;
      motivation/confidence for quitting, the pros and cons of behavior change, and plans for&#xD;
      change. Because previous ANBL participants and facilitators have not believed that MI has&#xD;
      been instrumental in participant ability to quit and because some have found it to be&#xD;
      burdensome, investigators leave it up to individual sites whether they will use MI or not,&#xD;
      tracking use for secondary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Curriculum: The curriculum includes 11 brochures, given throughout the program;&#xD;
      it combines cessation information with cultural elements. Community members have stressed&#xD;
      throughout development that cultural issues must be ingrained in the program and its&#xD;
      accompanying materials, not given &quot;lip service&quot; by putting AI pictures on &quot;White&quot; materials.&#xD;
      These materials were created by the study team and Community Advisory Board (CAB) members,&#xD;
      with input from pilot participants, then sent to an AI graphic artist for final layout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy: Current treatment guidelines suggest pharmacotherapy be offered to all&#xD;
      smokers making a quit attempt. Study sites may work in conjunction with health centers and&#xD;
      pharmacies to provide medication if they so choose; it is not provided as a part of the&#xD;
      study. Participants must be under the care of a physician to receive prescription medication.&#xD;
      Sites are required to track participant use of medication.&#xD;
