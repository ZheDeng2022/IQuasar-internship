  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal diseases are infections cause by dental plaque (Socransky, 1970). Risk factors&#xD;
      are present which modify the course of disease progression. One of these risk factors is&#xD;
      tobacco smoking, which was first evaluated by Pindborg in 1947 and later by Grossi et al. in&#xD;
      1995. They found that tobacco smoking was strongly associated with attachment loss, bone&#xD;
      loss, and lastly, tooth loss. Tooth loss in one of the most visible results of periodontal&#xD;
      disease, which negatively affects physiological and psychological patient's life. The effects&#xD;
      of cigarette smoking on periodontal status are independent of the plaque index and oral&#xD;
      hygiene of the patient, due to the direct influence of tobacco on periodontal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of periodontal therapy in reducing the&#xD;
      rate of tooth loss as well as the importance of patient compliance with periodontal&#xD;
      maintenance therapy and adequate oral hygiene practice in achieving this reduction.&#xD;
      Compliance is the main problem faced in periodontal maintenance therapy. Low rates of&#xD;
      compliance and patient adherence to a maintenance program was reported in the literature.&#xD;
      Periodontal maintenance therapy can be considered a critical factor for success in&#xD;
      controlling periodontitis and in the long-term maintenance of teeth. In addition, neglecting&#xD;
      a regular periodontal maintenance therapy program has been associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      reinfection and progression of periodontitis, as well as increased tooth loss. The&#xD;
      establishment of a criteria for time interval between different supportive periodontal&#xD;
      maintenance visits, is still controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers are associated with low level of compliance to prevent being constantly reminded of&#xD;
      quitting smoking as well as the health complications associated with the habit. There is a&#xD;
      void in the literature addressing the direct influence of compliance and adherence in&#xD;
      periodontal maintenance therapy and its contribution to arrest periodontitis progression,&#xD;
      minimizing tooth loss, specifically in tobacco smoking patients, whether they are regular or&#xD;
      irregular compliant with a long term follow-up up to 40 years. On the other hand, there is&#xD;
      moderate scientific evidence that the independent effect of smoking is associated with the&#xD;
      occurrence of tooth loss in individuals undergoing periodontal maintenance therapy. Lastly,&#xD;
      only very few studies reported the specific outcome of periodontal maintenance therapy on&#xD;
      tooth loss in regular and irregular compliant smokers compared to regular and irregular&#xD;
      compliant non-smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focused question in this study is &quot;Does periodontal maintenance therapy affect annual&#xD;
      tooth loss rates differently in regular and irregular compliant smokers and non-smokers?&quot;.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moderate scientific evidence that the independent effect of smoking is associated with the&#xD;
      occurrence of tooth loss in individuals undergoing periodontal maintenance therapy. Only very&#xD;
      few studies specifically reported the outcome of tooth loss and periodontal maintenance&#xD;
      program in regular and irregular compliant smokers compared to regular and irregular&#xD;
      compliant non-smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will analyze the data provided by a specialized dental clinic in the field of&#xD;
      periodontology and will divide the subjects into four groups: Group ICS (irregular compliant&#xD;
      smoker), Group RCS (regular compliant smoker), Group ICN (irregular compliant non-smoker),&#xD;
      and lastly, Group RCN (regular compliant non-smoker). The subjects present in the data will&#xD;
      be randomly selected and divided into the appropriate groups with the aid of a permutation&#xD;
      table. The researcher will not call the patient and perform a clinical examination but rather&#xD;
      analyze the data retrospectively. Statistical data will be compared according to annual tooth&#xD;
      loss rates and OR of tooth loss will be calculated for each group. After statistical&#xD;
      analysis, the researcher will formulate proper concluding remarks regarding the importance of&#xD;
      periodontal maintenance therapy on tooth loss rates in regular and irregular compliant&#xD;
      smokers and non-smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine whether periodontal maintenance therapy decreases tooth loss in regular and&#xD;
      irregular compliant smokers compared to regular and irregular compliant non-smokers after 40&#xD;
      years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shed light on the importance of periodontal maintenance therapy, in its ability to reduce&#xD;
      tooth loss, in smokers and non-smokers after 40 years of follow-up.&#xD;
