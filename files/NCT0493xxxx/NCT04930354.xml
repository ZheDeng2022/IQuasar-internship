  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and optimal recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) during a 28-day dosing period&#xD;
      of ECP-1014 in patients with solid tumors and by evaluation of dose limiting toxicities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single-center, open-label, ascending dose study in which dose&#xD;
      escalation will be determined based on safety and tolerability. Up to a total of 6 cohorts of&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled unless additional intermediate doses are studied, not to exceed the&#xD;
      maximal dose per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 Parts to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 involves enrolling sequential cohorts of patients into a dose-escalation design,&#xD;
           in which doses are assessed for safety/tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 involves randomizing a cohort of patients to the highest and second-highest&#xD;
           tolerated doses as identified in Part 1.&#xD;
