  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic effectiveness of three modes of&#xD;
      repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in chronic neuropathic pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Classical rTMS stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deeper rTMS stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sham rTMS stimulation&#xD;

      Conduct of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Entry into the study: After informed consent, patients will be randomised. The physician&#xD;
           responsible for conducting neurostimulation sessions will make the randomization via an&#xD;
           interactive web response system (IWRS). Only this physician will have the knowledge of&#xD;
           the group allocated to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline : Patients, will record on a diary form, a daily Visual Numeric Scale(VNS) of&#xD;
           Pain Intensity for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment sessions: after the baseline, sessions of neurostimulation will begin for&#xD;
           seven weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the end of neurostimulation sessions, patients will be followed for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Throughout their participation in the study, patients will plot on a diary form their&#xD;
           daily VNS.&#xD;
