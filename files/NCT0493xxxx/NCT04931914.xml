      adding pharmaceutical services to patient care and changing the professional activity of&#xD;
      pharmacists from drug-focused to patient-oriented care,in the current study, clinical&#xD;
      pharmacists will be assigned to monitor pharmacotherapy regimens, participate in patient&#xD;
      care, and cooperate in educating the staff and evaluating care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the intervention period, the pharmacist attended daily unit rounds with ICU&#xD;
      intensivist with a focus on optimization of antibiotic regimens. Pharmacist consultative&#xD;
      services were also available by phone calls 24 hours x 7 days if needed. For every patient&#xD;
      surgical prophylactic antibiotic initiated immediately before surgery and continued for 48&#xD;
      hours following surgery. Antibiotic therapy had given as either directed or empiric. Directed&#xD;
      therapy was defined as treatment of a documented infection based on culture and sensitivity.&#xD;
      Empiric therapy was defined as any antibiotic therapy administered when no documented&#xD;
      infection was present, and the patient had clinically suspected infection following surgery.&#xD;
      Empiric antibiotic administration was required in majority of our SICU patients. Antibiotics&#xD;
      had given after exclusion of allergy by history and intradermal sensitivity test.&#xD;
