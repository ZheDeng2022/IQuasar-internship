  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, phase 1/1b study of the pressure-enabled hepatic artery infusion&#xD;
      of SD-101, a TLR 9 agonist, alone or in combination with intravenous checkpoint blockade in&#xD;
      adults with metastatic uveal melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Sentinel Cohort, patients will receive 2 SD-101 infusions (2 weeks apart) with&#xD;
      assessments for toxicity prior to escalating from the first dose level (0.5 mg) to the second&#xD;
      dose level (2 mg). In the absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), each patient will be&#xD;
      eligible to transition into Cohort A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohorts A-C and Phase 1b, patients will receive 2 cycles of SD-101. Each cycle consists of&#xD;
      3 consecutive weekly infusions. Escalating doses of SD-101 will be administered alone (Cohort&#xD;
      A), together with nivolumab (Cohort B), and together with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab&#xD;
      (Cohort C). Cohorts B and C will begin one dose level below the MTD or optimal dose from&#xD;
      Cohort A to optimize safety when adding CPI to SD-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following determination of the recommended MTD or optimal dose of SD-101 for PEDD/HAI and&#xD;
      which checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) regimen(s) are tolerated, the study will progress to Phase&#xD;
      1b. Patients in Phase 1b will receive the SD-101 dose selected from Phase 1 in the presence&#xD;
      of systemic single- or double-agent checkpoint blockade. The choice of single- or&#xD;
      double-agent CPI therapy together with SD-101 for Phase 1b will consider safety data in&#xD;
      addition to response rates from Cohorts B and C in Phase 1.&#xD;
