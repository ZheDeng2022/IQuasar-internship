      This is a single-center study comparing the effect of intravenous (IV) Lignocaine given&#xD;
      throughout posterior spinal fusion surgery on the reduction of morphine usage during&#xD;
      postoperative period in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients.&#xD;

      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) performed for the correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis&#xD;
      (AIS) is a complex surgery which result in severe postoperative pain. Early and adequate&#xD;
      analgesia facilitates early mobilization hence reduces postoperative complications.&#xD;
      Multimodal analgesia technique has been shown to improve perioperative pain management and&#xD;
      significantly reduced the opioid usage and its side effects. Intravenous lignocaine infusion&#xD;
      has been used as an analgesic adjunct for the management of acute postoperative pain in many&#xD;
      clinical settings which include adult complex spinal surgery. However, until this date no&#xD;
      study which examines AIS patients undergoing PSF surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized using a sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelope (SNOSE) method into two&#xD;
      groups: Group A, Lignocaine and Group B, placebo. Group A will receive 1.5mg/kg IV lignocaine&#xD;
      bolus prior to induction followed by 2mg/kg/hour of lignocaine infusion throughout surgery&#xD;
      until wound closure in which the infusion rate will be halved to 1mg/kg/hour until the end of&#xD;
      surgery. The same rate will be infused in the recovery room for another half an hour before&#xD;
      patient discharge. Group B will receive saline of similar volume and rate as for Group A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial drugs are prepared in a 10-ml syringe for the bolus injection and an 50-ml syringe&#xD;
      for continuous infusion. For the bolus injection, IV lignocaine 1% will be drawn into the&#xD;
      10-ml syringe according to the weight of the patient (0.15ml/kg) or an equal amount of 0.9%&#xD;
      saline. The 50-ml syringe will contained either 50ml of lignocaine 1% solution or 0.9% normal&#xD;
      saline solution. Both syringes will be labeled as Drug X.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The depth of anesthesia will be monitored using a processed electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
      monitor called Conox (commercial brand name of Fresenius Kabi, Germany depth of anesthesia&#xD;
      monitor). There are two indices, the qCON which is the index of hypnotic effect and the qNOX&#xD;
      which is the index of pain/nociception. A qCON value of 40-60 indicates general anesthesia&#xD;
      state and a qNOX value of 40-60 implies that patient is unlikely to respond to noxious&#xD;
      stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous monitoring of patients will be carried out using invasive blood pressure via&#xD;
      radial artery cannulation, heart rate, pulse oximetry and 3-lead electrocardiogram. All&#xD;
      participants will be operated utilizing a dual attending surgeon strategy involving two&#xD;
      senior surgeons. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring using somatosensory and motor&#xD;
      evoked potentials will be used throughout the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be adequately fasted for at least 6 hours prior to surgery without&#xD;
      premedication. The trial drug will be administered to the participants according to the&#xD;
      allocation. The bolus injection will be administered over 3 minutes prior to induction&#xD;
      followed by an infusion as per protocol. Induction of anesthesia will be performed with IV&#xD;
      Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) of Propofol 4-6mcg/ml and TCI Remifentanil 3-5ng/ml. After&#xD;
      tracheal intubation, patients will be ventilated with 50% Oxygen/air mixture and anesthesia&#xD;
      is maintained with TCI Propofol 2-4mcg/ml and TCI Remifentanil 2-5ng/ml. A qCON value of&#xD;
      40-60 will be targeted intraoperatively. IV Dexamethasone 4mg and IV Morphine 0.5mg/kg will&#xD;
      be administered prior to skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the maintenance phase of anesthesia if the qCON value is outside this range for longer&#xD;
      than 10 seconds, the concentration of Propofol will be increased or decreased by 0.5mcg/ml.&#xD;
      After the new target concentration is reached, an additional 20 seconds will be given to&#xD;
      bring the qCON value within the pre-established range before making further adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon wound closure, additional IV Morphine 0.5mg/kg will be administered with IV&#xD;
      acetaminophen 15mg/kg and IV Ondansetron 0.15mg/kg. IV Fentanyl 0.5mcg/kg will be given prior&#xD;
      to cessation of TCI Remifentanil at skin closure. TCI Propofol will be ceased once skin&#xD;
      closure is completed. Participants are extubated in the operation room after completion of&#xD;
      surgery and transfer to recovery bay for monitoring. The time of discontinuation of TCI&#xD;
      Propofol (T0) and the time elapsed from T0 to extubation will be recorded. The qCON value at&#xD;
      extubation will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial drug is continued up to 30 minutes post-operation in the recovery room. Sedation&#xD;
      score will be assessed using Richmond Analgesia Sedation Scale (RASS) at the interval of 15&#xD;
      minutes. Pain score will be evaluated using Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at the interval of&#xD;
      10 minutes. Rescue bolus of IV Fentanyl 10mcg will be given every 5 minutes to treat&#xD;
      breakthrough pain when pain score is &gt;=4. Once the pain score is &lt;4, Patient Controlled&#xD;
      Analgesia (PCA) with morphine will be started at a concentration of 2mg/ml, a demand dose of&#xD;
      1mg/ml with a lockout interval of 5 minutes and a maximum dose of 20mg over 4 hours without&#xD;
      background infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia will be maintained using multimodal strategy. Participants will be&#xD;
      continued on PCA morphine for up to 48 hours. Participants will receive IV acetaminophen&#xD;
      15mg/kg every 6 hours for the first 24 hour and changed to oral thereafter and oral Celebrex&#xD;
      200mg daily (for &lt;35kg) or 200mg every 12 hours (for &gt;= 35kg), NRS will be recorded every 4&#xD;
      hours until the patient is discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Plasma Concentration Levels of Lignocaine&#xD;
&#xD;
      5mls of blood samples will be collected from participants using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic&#xD;
      acid (EDTA) tube 30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours and 8 hours after the bolus injection.&#xD;
      Collected blood samples will be centrifuged immediately and the plasma will be transferred&#xD;
      into cryo vials in duplicates and kept at -80 degree Celsius until further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To extract lignocaine from plasma 0.5ml volume of plasma, 0.1ml internal standard (IS)&#xD;
      solution (500ng/ml), 0.1ml 1Molar of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and 3ml of methyl-tert-butyl&#xD;
      ether (MTBE) will be placed in a 4.5ml propylene tube. The content will be mixed for the&#xD;
      minimum of 5 minutes by the shaker and then centrifuged at 3000-3500rpm for 5 minutes. The&#xD;
      top layer will be transferred to a 4.5ml propylene tube containing 0.25ml of 0.1% Formic&#xD;
      acid. The tube will be mixed again for the minimum of 5 minutes by the shaker and then&#xD;
      centrifuge at 3000-3500rpm for 5 minutes. The top solvent layer will be discarded by vacuum&#xD;
      and the remaining solution will be transferred into an autosampler vial. A 100 microliter&#xD;
      volume will be injected into the analytical column connected to light chain mass spectrometry&#xD;
      system. The calibration curve will be plotted by the ratio of the lignocaine/IS vs the&#xD;
      concentration of lignocaine. The concentration of lignocaine in all samples will be&#xD;
      calculated from the calibration curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be tabulated in a computer files and analyzed using International Business&#xD;
      Machines Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS) software version 25. All&#xD;
      randomized participants will be analyzed according to their original allocation according to&#xD;
      the (modified) intention-to-treat principle except those who deemed ineligible after&#xD;
      randomization or the treatment is never started (such as last minute cancellation of&#xD;
      surgery). Data normality will be assessed by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and confirm&#xD;
      with visual inspection of the histogram. Categorical data will be presented as counts and&#xD;
      percentage. Continuous date will be expressed as mean +/- standard deviation, or median&#xD;
      (Q1-Q3) for data with skewed distribution. Data differences between the two groups will be&#xD;
      computed by independent t-test or Mann Whitney U test for continuous data and the Chi square&#xD;
      test for categorical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean plasma concentration of lignocaine will be plotted against time from bolus injection&#xD;
      and during continuous infusion perioperatively until the infusion is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome, postoperative morphine consumption at 24 hour and Propofol requirements&#xD;
      between group, will be analyzed by using independent t-test. Mixed analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) will also be conducted to determine whether the change in the use of PCA morphine&#xD;
      over time (at 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours and 48 hours post-surgery), the change in target&#xD;
      effect site concentration of Propofol and remifentanil and qCON value over time are the&#xD;
      result of the interaction between the two groups and time. If an interaction is present, the&#xD;
      differences between group at each time point will be calculated and compared by using the&#xD;
      independent t-test; however, if no statistical interaction is present, the main effects of&#xD;
      the analysis will be reported. The occurrence of adverse events or complications will be&#xD;
      compared between group by using the Chi square test. A Kaplan-Meier analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted for time-to-first flatus, time-to-first ambulation and time to recovery from&#xD;
      anesthesia and will be compared between group using Mantel-Cox test. A 2-sided p&lt;0.05 is&#xD;
      considered statistical significant.&#xD;
