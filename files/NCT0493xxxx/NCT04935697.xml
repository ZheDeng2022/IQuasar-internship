  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, two-arm, controlled 30-day investigational pilot trial&#xD;
      using the gammaCore Sapphire S non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) device + standard&#xD;
      of care (SOC) in newly-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI) to prevent the progression towards immunokine storms, systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome (SIRS), severe respiratory distress, and requirement for invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, and death, when compared to SOC alone (the control arm).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot population of 46 individuals between 18-80 years of age inclusive, will be enrolled,&#xD;
      with an in-trial monitoring period of up to 30 days following baseline measurements. Study&#xD;
      subjects will remain in-trial until one of the following occurs: a) 30 days without any&#xD;
      progression to respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation; b) requirement for&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation prior to 30 days; or c) death prior to 30 days. In addition to the&#xD;
      screening, a total of up to 6 additional in-trial events (depending on the time at discharge&#xD;
      from hospitalization) plus one additional clinical site visit at the end of the follow-up&#xD;
      period will comprise the study events schedule of this trial.&#xD;

             excluding CPAP alone) for longer than 48 h prior to the diagnosis of mild-to-moderate&#xD;
             respiratory distress/ARDS&#xD;
