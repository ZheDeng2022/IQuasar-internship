  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single oral administrations of study drug (Lamnet and Lamictal) in two periods separated by a&#xD;
      washout period of 14 days. The washout period will be calculated from day of dosing (Day 2)&#xD;
      to at least 14 days post dose in each period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drugs will be administered with 240 mL ambient Temperature water after at least 10&#xD;
      hours fasting in each periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters include Lamotrigine plasma concentrations at the given sampling&#xD;
      times. In each period 18 blood samples for plasma Lamotrigine concentrations will be taken on&#xD;
      Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 5, Day 6 and Day 7 (at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 ,4, 6, 8, 12,&#xD;
      24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours post-dose.) The primary parameters to be analyzed are the&#xD;
      maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero&#xD;
      to the time of the last measurable time point t (AUClast or also termed as AUC0-t) and area&#xD;
      under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUCtotal or, also termed as&#xD;
      AUC0-inf) and (AUC0-t)/ (AUC0-inf).&#xD;
