  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to ass wether or not the use of virtual reality during oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval provides a better pain relief for patients, compared to a standard analgesic&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be included during the consultation with the gynaecologist, whom will explain&#xD;
      the protocol to the patient and give her the consent to sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be then randomized by a computer (using the software REDCAP) into either the&#xD;
      experimental group or the standard group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental group, a virtual reality device will be installed on the patient as soon&#xD;
      as she arrives in the operating room, and the intervention will start after 3-5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both group, the patient will benefit of a local anesthesia in the vagina, and if they want&#xD;
      it of an oral analgesic before the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just at the end of the intervention, the pain will be evaluated orally by the nurse, using a&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale. This consist of the Primary Outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, the gynaecologist will fill a form assessing his satisfaction&#xD;
      concerning the use of virtual reality during the intervention (efficacy, security...) One&#xD;
      hour after the intervention, the patient will fill a form about her self-estimation of the&#xD;
      post-procedural pain and her satisfaction concerning the use of virtual reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of oocytes collected and the number of oocytes expected on the ultrasound&#xD;
      monitoring will be gathered and a ratio will be calculated, in order to estimate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five days after the intervention, the patient will have to fill a form evaluating her&#xD;
      consumption of painkillers during the 48hours following the intervention.&#xD;
