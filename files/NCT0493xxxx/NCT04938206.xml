  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Febrile neutropenia (NF) is the leading cause of unscheduled hospitalization in children with&#xD;
      cancer. Management classically involves emergency admission to hospital for intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment until resolution of fever and neutropenia. However, children with NF are&#xD;
      a heterogeneous group with varying risks of severe infection (10-29%). This approach, which&#xD;
      is recognized as excessive for low-risk episodes of severe infection, particularly in terms&#xD;
      of quality of life and cost, is no longer recommended. Management should move to a more&#xD;
      personalized model that takes into account the individual probability of severe infection.&#xD;
      Clinical decision rules (CDRs) have been proposed to facilitate risk stratification, but none&#xD;
      are useful in our French population because of insufficient reproducibility or effectiveness.&#xD;

    <description>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) is a brief measure of health-related quality of life in children and young people. The measure can be completed by parents (the Proxy Report) as well as children and young people (the Self-Report).&#xD;
On the PedsQL Generic Core Scales, for ease of interpretability, items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better HRQOL (Health-Related Quality of Life).&#xD;
To reverse score, transform the 0-4 scale items to 0-100 as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Decision Rule will be applied to all patients included in the study at different times depending on the type of cancer: at H12-H24 of admission for patients with solid tumor; at H24-H48 for patients with hematological cancer. Patients classified as being at low risk of severe infection by the DRC were then randomized to a control group under standard management or to an experimental group with therapeutic relief. Treatment reduction for the experimental group was started immediately after randomization, in hospital. Discharge was proposed 24 hours later, with follow-up every two days, by telephone or in</description>
