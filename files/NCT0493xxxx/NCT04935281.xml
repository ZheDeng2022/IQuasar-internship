    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled study carried out between May 2016 and December&#xD;
      2020. It included 98 patients presented with acute rupture of Achilles tendon The patients&#xD;
      were randomly distributed by closed envelop technique (49 in each group). Group A included&#xD;
      those managed with the assistant of an intra-operative ultrasound. Group B included those&#xD;
      done without ultrasound assistant&#xD;

      A preoperative prophylactic dose of antibiotic was given intravenously in the form of 2gm of&#xD;
      cephalosporin one hour before operation. Under general or regional anesthesia, the patient&#xD;
      laid in prone position without a tourniquet and both feet out of the table for easily&#xD;
      mobilization of the ankle joint. In group A, an intraoperative ultrasound was done by a&#xD;
      radiologist before the repair for identification the course of sural nerve and outline the&#xD;
      medial and lateral edges of torn tendon. Then ultrasound was repeated after repair for&#xD;
      confirmation of adequate contact of both stumps and satisfactory strength of the repair by&#xD;
      visualization of the tendon with passive motion of the ankle. For patients in group B, the&#xD;
      course of the sural nerve was determined according to the technique described by Blackmon et&#xD;
      al. This technique depends on the leg length for location the point where the nerve crosses&#xD;
      the lateral edge of the tendon. The medial and lateral borders of both stumps were outlined&#xD;
      by palpation with identification of the gap in-between. The technique of repair was&#xD;
      standardized for all patients in both groups. We used the technique described by Maffulli et&#xD;
      al&#xD;

Four incisions were on medial and lateral edge of the proximal stump and the other two were around distal stump.</description>
