  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients ineligible for HD-ASCT will be included in the&#xD;
      study. All participants will receive isatuximab in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide&#xD;
      and minimal dexamethasone until disease progression. The primary objective of this study is&#xD;
      the MRD negativity rate during and/or after first 18 cycles of study treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 53 participants will be screened to achieve 50 enrolled (sample size) to study&#xD;
      intervention.All participants will receive isatuximab in combination with bortezomib,&#xD;
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone for 2 cycles, followed by isatuximab in combination with&#xD;
      bortezomib and lenalidomide for 6 cycles, followed by isatuximab in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide for 10 cycles, followed by continuous lenalidomide until disease progression.&#xD;
      The cycle duration is 28 days.Bone marrow MRD Euroflow NGF will be assessed once in&#xD;
      participants achieving CR/sCR during the first 18 cycles of treatment, and in all&#xD;
      participants (except for those who already are defined as MRD negative) achieving VGPR or&#xD;
      better after finishing the first 18 cycles of treatment to assess. Those who are in VGPR and&#xD;
      are MRD negative after 18 cycles of treatment will be response evaluated monthly for up to 4&#xD;
      months and if they become &gt;CR during this period they are defined as MRD negative. The&#xD;
      cut-off for MRD negativity is 100 plasma cells per 100 million nucleated cells (10-5).&#xD;
