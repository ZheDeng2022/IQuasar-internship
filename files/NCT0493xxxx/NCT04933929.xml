  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this interventional, multicentre study is to compare the impact of a&#xD;
      follow-up by monthly telephone dietetic consultations, started 3 months after discharge from&#xD;
      hospital, for a period of 3 months, on the energy intake in patients elderly people recently&#xD;
      hospitalized for Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), Coronavirus disease Positive group&#xD;
      &quot;Covid (+)&quot;, or not, Coronavirus disease Negative group&quot;Covid (-)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure is to compare the total energy intake at 6 months, after 3 months of&#xD;
      dietary consultations, between Coronavirus disease Positive group &quot;Covid (+)&quot; and Coronavirus&#xD;
      disease negative group &quot;Covid (-)&quot;.&#xD;

      This study consists of nutritional monitoring after hospitalization, carried out by&#xD;
      dieticians. Consultations are done remotely, by phone only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects are included, either upon discharge from hospital or within 3 months (at&#xD;
      the latest) following their hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      135 subjects will be included, 50% will be included in Coronavirus disease Positive group&#xD;
      &quot;Covid (+)&quot; and 50% in the Coronavirus desease negative group &quot;Covid (-)&quot; .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Inclusion (D0): Average length of hospital stay, medical diagnoses, severity of&#xD;
           hospital stay, autonomy and dependency scores, albumin and body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At M3, M4, M5 and M6: Dietary monitoring data, patient's vital status and dependency&#xD;
           scores.&#xD;
