      The aim of the current clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhibition of&#xD;
      Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) in ameliorating the proinflammatory state&#xD;
      and improving outcomes in severe COVID-19.&#xD;

      Study Design Proposed is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase&#xD;
      2 study of the efficacy and safety of PF-06650833, an investigational drug, in hospitalized&#xD;
      adult male and female patients with severe COVID-19 and pneumonia, who require supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen (O2) support but, who do not need mechanical ventilation or ECMO, to maintain adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      infection, and meeting all other inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be randomized within&#xD;
      3 days of screening to receive PF-06650833 400 mg modified release (MR) tablets (2 x 200 mg&#xD;
      tablets) or matching placebo administered orally once daily (QD), under fasted conditions&#xD;
      (preferably about 4 hours after and 1.5 before a meal) for up to 28 days (or until discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital should this occur earlier). Subjects unable to take tablets by mouth will&#xD;
      receive a 200 mg dose of PF-06650833 as an immediate release (IR) suspension or matching&#xD;
      placebo administered orally (via nasogastric [NG] or orogastric [OG] tube) every 6 hours,&#xD;
      under fasted conditions (as feasible, and preferably about 4 hours after and 1.5 before a&#xD;
      meal). Subjects for whom concomitant administration of a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450&#xD;
      (CYP) 3A4 (eg, ritonavir) will have the dose reduced to either 200 mg MR or IR QD. All dosing&#xD;
      of study drug will be in addition to current hospital SOC treatment, that must include some&#xD;
      treatment targeting SARS-CoV-2 (eg, remdesivir, if available under emergency use&#xD;
      authorization, and/or other targeted anti-viral therapies considered SOC treatment, some of&#xD;
      which may also be experimental). Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized for a&#xD;
      variety of clinical, biomarker, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Study Sites One study site: BronxCare Health System (Bronx Care Hospital;&#xD;
      additional site[s] may be added).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The study population will be derived from patients admitted to the hospital,&#xD;
      and will consist of adult male and female patients with severe COVID-19 (pneumonia requiring&#xD;
      oxygenation support), aged ≥18, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants Approximately 68 patients will be recruited to receive PF-06650833 in&#xD;
      addition to SOC or placebo plus SOC treatment in a 1:1 ratio. This study utilizes an adaptive&#xD;
      design with sample size re-estimation at the interim analysis, with the maximum sample size&#xD;
      at 136 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8-point National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) ordinal scale of&#xD;
      disease severity is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given&#xD;
      study day. The scale is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen*.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen* - no longer requires ongoing medical&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen* - requiring ongoing medical care&#xD;
           (COVID-19 related or otherwise).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen*.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices**.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Death.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For subjects on chronic home O2 supplementation (pre-morbid state), supplemental O2&#xD;
                is defined as ≥ home O2 requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Use of non-invasive ventilation for chronic conditions (eg, Obstructive sleep&#xD;
                     apnea [OSA]) is not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Variable&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects improved at end of treatment (Day 29), as defined by categories&#xD;

        -  Proportion of subjects recovered at end of treatment (Day 29), as defined by categories&#xD;
           1, 2, and 3 in the 8-point NIAID ordinal scale of disease severity.&#xD;

        -  All-cause mortality at Days 29 and 61, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to clinical improvement (defined as an at least 1-point decrease on the 8-point&#xD;
           NIAID ordinal scale of disease severity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to worsening (defined as an at least 1-point increase on the 8-point NIAID ordinal&#xD;
           scale of disease severity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of subjects in each category of the 8-point NIAID ordinal scale of disease&#xD;
           severity at Days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the 8-point NIAID ordinal scale of disease severity from Day 1 to Days 3, 5,&#xD;
           8, 11, 15, 22, and 29, as available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects that have required mechanical ventilatory support through Day 29.&#xD;

           hemoglobin [Hb], white blood cells [WBCs], platelets, hepatic transaminases, serum&#xD;
           creatinine [SCr], bilirubin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects alive with resolution of respiratory insufficiency (defined as&#xD;
           not requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry [SpO2]&#xD;
           &gt;94% while breathing room air) at Days 29 and 61.&#xD;

    <description>PF-06650833 is an investigational, highly potent and selective, reversible inhibitor of IRAK4. IRAK4 is a serine, threonine kinase that is a key intracellular signaling node downstream of the myddosome-associated Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, and the interleukin (IL)-1 family receptors (IL-1R, IL-18R and IL-33R) that mediate much of the innate immune signaling.&#xD;
As an inhibitor of TLR signaling, PF-06650833 targets a different part of the immune system from the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Given the partial redundancy of innate immune signaling through IRAK4-independent TLR pathways and the lack of direct suppression of T- and B-cell signaling, PF-06650833 is unlikely to lead to exaggerated immunosuppression.</description>
