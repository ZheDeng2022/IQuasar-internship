    <textblock>
      This research will compare a psychological intervention (&quot;ACT1VATE&quot;) versus diabetes&#xD;
      self-management education and support (DSME/S; usual care) in improving clinical, behavioral,&#xD;
      psychosocial, process, and cost outcomes among adults with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      (T1D) who are experiencing significant diabetes-related emotional distress and poor glycemic&#xD;
      control in a real world, healthcare environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will compare a telemedicine psychological intervention&#xD;
      specifically designed to address diabetes distress (&quot;ACT1VATE&quot;) versus traditional diabetes&#xD;
      self-management education and support (DSME/S; usual care) in improving glycemic control&#xD;
      among N=484 adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 8.0% in the&#xD;
      last 90 days, and significant diabetes distress. Capitalizing on existing and real-world&#xD;
      processes, the electronic health record (EHR) will be used to identify eligible patients at&#xD;
      Scripps Health and examine primary outcomes. Participants randomized to the usual care group&#xD;
      will be offered standard, 1:1 DSME/S delivered by a Certified Diabetes Care and Education&#xD;
      Specialist via telemedicine format. Participants randomized to the ACT1VATE group will be&#xD;
      offered 5 group-therapy telemedicine sessions delivered by a Behavioral Health Provider who&#xD;
      is an integrated member of the diabetes care team. ACT1VATE is grounded in Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy (ACT), which has been delivered effectively in clinics via brief format;&#xD;
      implemented via phone and other modalities; and adapted for a wide range of chronic&#xD;
      conditions. The primary clinical outcome, HbA1c, assessed as part of quarterly&#xD;
      standard-of-care medical visits will be extracted from the EHR over 12 months. Changes in&#xD;
      patient-reported behavioral (diabetes self-care) and psychosocial (emotional well-being,&#xD;
      quality of life) outcomes will be evaluated via online surveys at baseline, month 6, and&#xD;
      month 12. A thorough process evaluation will be conducted to establish reach,&#xD;
      acceptability/feasibility, adoption/maintenance, and fidelity of the intervention and will&#xD;
      integrate patient and provider perspectives. Cost-effectiveness will also be examined from&#xD;
      the health system perspective. By maximizing integration with routine medical care for T1D in&#xD;
      a real world, healthcare environment, results will be highly generalizable and hold great&#xD;
      potential to inform the future of care for adults living with T1D.&#xD;

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Long-term cost-effectiveness of ACT1VATE will use a simulation model. The UKPDS Outcomes Model Risk Engine (UKPDS-OM) developed the predictive equations for diabetes-related complications, mortality, and assigned utilities conditional on disease. Estimated clinical effects + costs of each arm will be inputs into the UKPDS-OM model. Estimated clinical effects (HbA1c change) come from Aim 1. Intervention costs will be estimated using standard accounting methods, process mapping + time-based activity costing. Base case assumes a health system perspective, 40-year time horizon, and 3% discount rate for both QALY and costs. Sensitivity analyses will investigate the influence of the estimated treatment effects and intervention costs, the influence of time horizon and discount rate, and second order uncertainty. UKPDS-OM provides equation parameters derived from bootstrap samples of the original UKPDS population. Estimates will be used to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness plan.</description>
