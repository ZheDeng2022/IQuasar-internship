  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic diseases, including allergic reactions of respiratory tract and skin, are often&#xD;
      triggered by mast cell degranulation mediated by allergen-specific IgE and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation of target organs, which are involved in a variety of immune cells and&#xD;
      inflammatory factors. Recent studies have shown that intestinal immunity is closely related&#xD;
      to immune responses to various diseases. Intestinal microecology influences the occurrence&#xD;
      and regression of various diseases by regulating the growth, differentiation and maturation&#xD;
      of various immune cells. Probiotics are widely used in children with allergies. This study&#xD;
      aims to analyze the correlation between the intestinal microecology of children with&#xD;
      rhinitis/asthma, eczema and urticaria and the clinical manifestations of the patients. By&#xD;
      observing the influence of probiotics intervention on clinical symptoms and changes in&#xD;
      intestinal microecology, the influence of intestinal microecology on children's allergic&#xD;
      diseases was clarified. Study protocol: 1) children with definitive diagnosis of allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis, asthma，atopic dermatitis and chronic urticaria were enrolled, each with 50 cases.&#xD;
      2) collect manure application of 16s rDNA probe hybridization technique to analyze the fecal&#xD;
      flora, and compared with clinical symptoms rating scale and serum sIgE, IgG4 correlation&#xD;
      analysis (3) application of probiotic intervention or conventional drug intervention, again&#xD;
      in 3 months, 6 months after collecting dung is used to detect the intestinal flora in&#xD;
      children with its correlation with clinical symptoms change were observed.&#xD;

      1. Fifty children（0-14years）with clear diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, asthma，atopic&#xD;
           dermatitis and chronic urticaria were selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feces were collected for analysis of fecal flora by 16S rDNA probe hybridization, and&#xD;
           the correlation between the fecal flora and clinical symptom scoring scale, serum sIgE&#xD;
           and IgG4 was analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Using probiotics intervention or conventional symptomatic drug intervention, the feces&#xD;
           of the children were collected again after 3 months and 6 months for intestinal flora&#xD;
           detection, and the correlation with clinical symptoms was observed. Probiotics for&#xD;
           granules a blunt and can be used for infants and young children and adolescents,&#xD;
           conventional drugs within 2 years old infant antihistamines for children drops, nasal&#xD;
           drops and atomization inhalation antiasthmatic, 2-5 years of age can contain montelukast&#xD;
           sodium chewing tablets, children over the age of five, including inhaled&#xD;
           corticosteroids, oral antihistamines and montelukast sodium chewing tablets and&#xD;
           expectorant drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inclusion criteria: patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis or&#xD;
           urticaria aged 0-14 years with elevated serum total IgE were clinically diagnosed as&#xD;
           allergic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Exclusion criteria: patients who withdrew due to treatment intolerance or other reasons&#xD;
           during the treatment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involved children, but the feces were collected and measured in vitro, which was&#xD;
      harmless to children.&#xD;
