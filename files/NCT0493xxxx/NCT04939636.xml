      I DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBJECTS AND THEIR RECRUITMENT Four hundred volunteers from the&#xD;
      2nd Infantry Brigade of the Kuperjanov Infantry Battalion (Võru, Estonia) aged 18-30 are&#xD;
      invited to participate in this study. To this end, a general meeting will be held at the&#xD;
      beginning of the conscription. The participants will be given an overview of the study, its&#xD;
      objectives and methods, all the risks that may be involved, and the potential benefits. The&#xD;
      meeting will emphasise the voluntary nature of the study and the fact that non-participation&#xD;
      in the study does not lead to changes in the overall cost of their conscription. Conscripts&#xD;
      wishing to participate in the study can sign an information sheet and informed consent form&#xD;
      to participate in the study after the meeting. Based on previous studies (experience of our&#xD;
      working group in 2014-2017), the participation of about 150-170 conscripts is expected&#xD;
      (25-30% of the total number).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Places of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. University of Tartu Clinic, Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic, Sports&#xD;
           Traumatology Centre, Puusepa 1a, Tartu, 51014&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment of subjects, general medical assessment and completion of questionnaires,&#xD;
           blood sampling, physical tests, and bone densitometry analysis. Kuperjanov Infantry&#xD;
           Battalion, 2nd Infantry Brigade (Kose tee 3a, 65603, Võru)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determination of vitamin D, PTH, and Ca in the blood: Synlab Eesti OÜ, Teguri 37b,&#xD;
           50107, Tartu&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires used in the study will be completed on site at the Kuperjanov Infantry&#xD;
      Battalion. The subjects are divided into two groups by a computer with double-blind&#xD;
      randomisation in a 1 : 1 ratio - subjects receiving 4,000 IU of vitamin D or a 100 µg capsule&#xD;
      (Group I, n = 75-85) and subjects receiving 600 IU or 15 µg vitamin D capsules (Group II, n =&#xD;
      75-85) of the same shape and colour once a day with breakfast The corresponding capsules are&#xD;
      pre-prepared in agreement with the manufacturer (HC CLOVER Productos y Servicios, S.Lk) and&#xD;
      packed in standard jars (100 capsules per jar; a total of three jars with the corresponding&#xD;
      number of capsules for ten months should be used for the study). Each jar is coded&#xD;
      individually for each subject in accordance with the randomised groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum levels of vitamin D (25(OH)D), s-PTH, s-Ca, and s-iCa are determined in all subjects&#xD;
      during the visits (SynLab Eesti OÜ, Tartu). Analyses are taken four times during the study&#xD;
      (visits): July, October, February, and April/May. All analyses are determined at the end of&#xD;
      the study at the same time to reduce intra-assay variability due to the use of different&#xD;
      kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all health-related problems related to the study, as well as other problems related to&#xD;
      the study, conscripts are consulted by the orthopaedist in charge (Dr Leho Rips). If there&#xD;
      are any health problems not related to the study, the medical staff of Kuperjanov will inform&#xD;
      the principal researcher (Dr Leho Rips). The subjects have the right to contact the principal&#xD;
      researcher directly in case of problems related to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion from the study: - refusal of a conscript or withdrawal of consent, departure from&#xD;
      military unit, force majeure, acute trauma, or illness in the course of conscript requiring&#xD;
      hospital treatment. All these cases are recorded and taken into account in the subsequent&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements. The length of the body (LB) is measured with a metal&#xD;
      anthropometer in a vertical position, the heels are together and the person measuring the&#xD;
      subject ensures that the lower eyelid and the outer ear canal of the subject are in a&#xD;
      horizontal plane. To determine body weight (W), the subject should wear as little clothes as&#xD;
      possible. An electronic scale with a measuring accuracy of ± 0,1 kg is used for the&#xD;
      measurement. The formula BMI = W / LB [kg/m2] is used to calculate the body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D in serum ((25(OH)D is determined by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). (LIAISON&#xD;
      25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Assay (REF 310600, DiaSorin Inc, USA)) with a sensitivity of 4 ng/ml&#xD;
      and an intra-assay variability coefficient (CV) of 0.1-3.8%. Vitamin D levels in the blood&#xD;
      are determined four times during the study period to explain the effects of strain, Estonian&#xD;
      climate, and supplementation on serum concentrations (at the beginning of the conscript,&#xD;
      twice in the middle of the conscript, and in the final phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium (s-Ca), ionised calcium (s-iCa), and parathyroid hormone (s-PTH) are determined from&#xD;
      blood serum by potentiometry and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood tests are taken at the same time in the morning before breakfast and during the&#xD;
      same periods, analogously to vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 5 to 8 ml of blood is taken during each blood test, a total of 20 to 32 ml. This is&#xD;
      about 2 tablespoons of blood throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of knee pain. The visual analogue scale VAS is used where '0' - no pain and '10' -&#xD;
      maximum pain, associated with the KOOS questionnaire to assess subjective complaints related&#xD;
      to the knee joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective assessment of knee joint function by the subject. The subjects evaluate the&#xD;
      subjective complaints and function of the knee joint with a questionnaire (Knee Injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS), which is used to find out their assessment of the&#xD;
      condition of their knee(s) and how well they can cope with daily activities. It is possible&#xD;
      to get a maximum of 100 points (no complaints) and a minimum of 0 points, which means extreme&#xD;
      complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand grip strength is determined by isometric contraction while standing, upper limb away&#xD;
      from the body, using a hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Co., USA). The studies use&#xD;
      maximal hand grip strength as an indirect indicator of whole-body muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective assessment of physical activity by the subject. The Baecke Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire consists of three parts and is based on a person's subjective assessment of&#xD;
      their work, sport, and leisure (it is possible to get 1-5 points for each question). To&#xD;
      interpret the results, the number of points in each subsection and the total number of points&#xD;
      in the whole questionnaire are given. A similar questionnaire has been used to determine&#xD;
      physical activity in previous studies in conscripts. IPAQ International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire, which assesses the level of physical activity in the last 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of subjective pain in different regions of the body is done with the Cornell&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaires (CMDQ), where the intensity of pain and the region&#xD;
      of the body can be noted. Pain questionnaire ( to assess pain in different regions of the&#xD;
      body on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (maximum possible pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of subjective health status and health-related quality of life by the subject&#xD;
      is performed using standard questionnaires SF-36, RAND36, and BDI - Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory. The questionnaires have been validated in Estonia and are valid for identifying&#xD;
      health-related aspects. The questionnaires are based on the subject's assessment of their&#xD;
      health aspects. The SF-36 questionnaire identifies the health status with a descriptive&#xD;
      health profile and is more sensitive than other questionnaires. It also calculates the total&#xD;
      physical and mental health scores. The BDI questionnaire is based on the assessment of the&#xD;
      subject concerning aspects related to their mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of emotional well-being and somatic symptom disorder symptoms on the basis of the&#xD;
      EEK-2 emotional well-being questionnaire and ACR 2010 questionnaires The emotional well-being&#xD;
      questionnaire is a patient-completed self-assessment scale for identifying major depression&#xD;
      and anxiety disorders and their adjacent symptoms in the past month. The EEK-2 questionnaire&#xD;
      consists of 28 statements formulated based on diagnostic criteria and clinical feasibility.&#xD;
      The answers are on a scale of 0-4 and the subject indicates how much the problem has&#xD;
      disturbed them in the last month. The ACR 2010 questionnaire is a questionnaire developed and&#xD;
      validated by the American College of Rheumatology to assess the presence of the somatic&#xD;
      symptom disorder and non-physical pain (such as fibromyalgia) in subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitness tests. Along with other data, the level of physical training of the conscripts is&#xD;
      analysed using the standardised Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT), consisting of push-ups,&#xD;
      sit-ups, and a 2-mile (3.2-km) run. The test has been adapted and used for a long time in the&#xD;
      Estonian Defence Forces. Based on the results, the total score is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone density study or densitometry. A mobile DXL machine is used to determine bone density.&#xD;
      Bone density is determined from the heel bone. Bone density is determined twice during the&#xD;
      study period on site. Bone density measurement of the heel bone is performed by densitometry&#xD;
      with a DXL Calscan instrument (Demetech AB, SWE). The measurements are performed at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study and after about 10 months, just before the end of the conscript. The&#xD;
      procedure shows the bone density of the subjects. The second study provides an assessment of&#xD;
      the effects of exercise on the musculoskeletal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health status monitoring. The health status of conscripts is monitored in the medical centre&#xD;
      of the Combat Service Support Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, where records are made&#xD;
      of the appeals and complaints of the conscripts, the number of days in inpatient care and bed&#xD;
      rest, and the number of days when a conscript was absent from the conscript due to health&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of vitamin D content in food rations of the Defence Forces. The average daily&#xD;
      vitamin D content of the 1-month period of conscription in the daily food ration for&#xD;
      conscripts is assessed. Based on international analytical data on vitamin D content in food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire completion and data collection, blood sampling, anthropometric evaluations, and&#xD;
      health monitoring are performed by the study team.&#xD;
