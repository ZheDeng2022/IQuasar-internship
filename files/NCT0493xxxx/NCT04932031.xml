  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to discover risk factors of chemotherapy-induced peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (CIPN) in 350 patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing taxane-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy at two main sites (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Hospital,&#xD;
      including Rex Hospital, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital). The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study to explore patient- and procedure-based variables that identify&#xD;
      patients at risk for developing CIPN during chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is common and provokes pain, poor QoL, and loss of&#xD;
      independence, as well as increases the risk of falls and opioid addiction. Beyond the&#xD;
      inciting agents, risk factors for CIPN are not understood or systematically evaluated in&#xD;
      clinical practice, precluding prevention. Therefore, a clinical decision tool to predict an&#xD;
      individual patient's risk of neuropathy remains a critical unmet need. A diagnostic test that&#xD;
      predicts CIPN risk in this clinical context would provide an essential clinical-decision tool&#xD;
      to guide treatment and post-treatment care in breast cancer, prevent CIPN occurrence, and&#xD;
      improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators' pilot data uncovered a strong association between cellular senescence and&#xD;
      CIPN. In this prospective, observational study of participants with early-stage breast&#xD;
      cancer, the investigators will assess the contribution of senescence and clinical variables.&#xD;
      The investigators will determine the ability of these factors to identify patients at risk&#xD;
      for CIPN during chemotherapy and up to one year after the last dose of taxane-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy. This study will employ both patient- and clinician reported CIPN scoring&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
