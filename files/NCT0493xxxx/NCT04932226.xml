      We aim to determine the effect of three different types of face mask compared to no face mask&#xD;
      on the oxygen saturations, heart rate and symptoms of healthy young adults during 15 minutes&#xD;
      of moderate to high intensity exercise. The three face masks will be a cloth mask, a surgical&#xD;
      mask and a FFR.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We will conduct a crossover study comparing three different types of face mask (cloth,&#xD;
      surgical or FFR) versus no face mask to determine the effect on oxygen saturations, heart&#xD;
      rate and symptoms of healthy young adults during 15 minutes of moderate to high intensity&#xD;
      exercise. We will promote the study through sports societies at three leading UK&#xD;
      universities, namely the University of Oxford, University of Nottingham and King's College&#xD;
      London. We will also advertise the study on social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested individuals will be encouraged to visit the study website or read the patient&#xD;
      information sheets available to share via email. Volunteer participants will be asked to read&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria, patient information sheet and recruitment information before&#xD;
      applying to take part. Those who wish to participate will be asked to complete an online&#xD;
      form, including their first name, date of birth, address, email address, demographics,&#xD;
      details of their regular exercise and details of any past medical history or medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those wishing to discuss the study will have the opportunity to request a phone call from a&#xD;
      member of the study team before agreeing to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submitted applications will be screened by the study team for eligibility. Those who are&#xD;
      deemed not to be eligible will be contacted, explaining the reason. Selected participants&#xD;
      will be informed and contacted to arrange a date for the study session. This will be&#xD;
      conducted at their local university sports centre or a local park. The number of participants&#xD;
      attending a single study session will be in compliance with any UK government restrictions&#xD;
      relating to COVID-19 in place at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the study, participants will meet a member of the study team, who will ask them&#xD;
      to complete an online consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be asked to complete an exercise study session. The type of exercise&#xD;
      will be either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Running&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rowing on a fixed machine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete four x 15 minute pieces of exercise within this single&#xD;
      session. The aim will be to exercise at moderate to high intensity with the goal of covering&#xD;
      the same distance each time. Between 15 minutes of exercise, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      take a 5 minute rest break. For each 15 minute session, participants will wear one of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a cloth mask&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a surgical mask&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a FFR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no mask&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order in which participants wear the face masks will be determined by a random sequence&#xD;
      generator(https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/technology-outputs/sortition-clinical-trial-rando&#xD;
      misation-software). The masks will be provided by the researcher at the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear no mask during each rest period. Prior to starting, participants will&#xD;
      have their resting heart rate and oxygen levels recorded. Halfway through each exercise&#xD;
      period, immediately on completing the exercise and at 1 minute following completion of the&#xD;
      exercise, participants will have their heart rate, oxygen levels and distance travelled&#xD;
      recorded by a member of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the exercise session, participants will be asked to complete an online&#xD;
      survey via a secure portal, hosted by the University of Oxford. They will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questions regarding the type of exercise they did, oxygen levels and heart rate at&#xD;
      each time point, distance travelled and average speed, and questions regarding the ease of&#xD;
      exercise and comfort of wearing each masks, as well as any additional symptoms they might&#xD;
      have experienced during the exercise session as a result of wearing the mask.&#xD;
