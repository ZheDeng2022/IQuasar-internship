    <description>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) is a 40-item measure that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It was developed in the mid-1990's to meet a growing demand for more precise evaluation of fatigue associated with anemia in cancer patients. It is a subset of the longer (47-item) Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anemia (FACT-An), which includes the 27-item FACT-G and a 20-item subscale addressing additional concerns associated with the anemia of cancer and its treatment. This 20-item subscale, referred to as the anemia subscale, is comprised of 13 items that assess fatigue and its impact (the FACIT-Fatigue), and 7 additional symptoms associated with anemia (e.g., shortness of breath; headache).</description>
