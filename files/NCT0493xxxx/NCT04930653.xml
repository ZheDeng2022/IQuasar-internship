      This phase II trial studies the effect of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) and&#xD;
      mogamulizumab in treating patients with erythrodermic cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), a&#xD;
      type of skin lymphoma. CTCL is a rare type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells&#xD;
      called T cells. Erythrodermic is a widespread red rash that may cover most of the body. ECP&#xD;
      is a medical treatment that removes blood with a machine, isolates white blood cells and&#xD;
      exposes them to ultra violet light, then returns the cells to the body. Mogamulizumab is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Giving mogamulizumab with ECP may work together to kill the tumor cells directly (with&#xD;
      mogamulizumab) and boost immune response to cancer (with ECP).&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess tolerability and overall response rate (ORR) of the (ECP)/mogamulizumab regimen&#xD;
      in CTCL patients previously untreated with mogamulizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate complete response (CR) rate, time to response, duration of response,&#xD;
      progression free survival, and overall survival in CTCL patients treated with the&#xD;
      ECP/mogamulizumab combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To summarize the toxicities in CTCL patients treated with the ECP/mogamulizumab&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess quality of life (QoL) parameters before, during, and after the regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor and immunomodulatory effects of mogamulizumab in the CTCL&#xD;
      microenvironment in skin and blood samples of erythrodermic CTCL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive mogamulizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, of&#xD;
      cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. Beginning in cycle 2, patients also undergo&#xD;
      ECP over 3 hours on days 8, 9, 22,and 23. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete&#xD;
      response (CR)/partial response (PR) after 6 cycles receive up to 6 additional cycles of&#xD;
      treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then for up to 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
