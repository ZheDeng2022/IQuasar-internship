  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle depletion and sarcopenia are the most typical features of cachexia, which&#xD;
      occurs in 80% of patients with advanced esophageal cancer. Skeletal muscle consumption is an&#xD;
      independent factor for poor prognosis, which negatively affects therapeutic toxicity, length&#xD;
      of hospital stay, quality of life, complications, infection, and survival. The vast majority&#xD;
      of patients had already experienced severe weight loss and skeletal muscle loss before the&#xD;
      treatment began. During the concurrent chemoradiotherapy period, the intensity and long cycle&#xD;
      of treatment, the toxic and side effects of treatment and the occurrence of radiation&#xD;
      esophagitis would further lead to the increased demand for energy and decreased intake of&#xD;
      patients, thus leading to continuous weight loss. Based on the previous literature, we&#xD;
      suggest that baseline body composition has a significant impact on nutritional status, the&#xD;
      incidence of adverse reactions, and survival during treatment. This research mainly for the&#xD;
      thorough chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer, analysis treatment precursor&#xD;
      composition, including skeletal muscle index, visceral fat area, body fat percentage and&#xD;
      other parameters on the side reaction of chemoradiation, nutritional status and the influence&#xD;
      of survival, and observe the baseline body composition and cure after 1 month of body&#xD;
      composition changes of the impact on the survival time.&#xD;
