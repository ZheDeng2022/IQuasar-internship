  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to determine the effect of nursing care provided to intensive unit&#xD;
      care patients according to their circadian rhythms on sleep quality, pain, anxiety and&#xD;
      delirium.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the current national and international literature review, the studies were seen to&#xD;
      mostly focus on subjects such as circadian rhythm and psychological disorders and problems,&#xD;
      obesity, cancer, etc. No studies were found on the effect of nursing care provided according&#xD;
      to circadian rhythm. Therefore, it is thought that determining chronotypes and providing&#xD;
      appropriate nursing care is important to prevent pain, sleep, delirium and many physiological&#xD;
      parameters and comorbid diseases, especially in intensive care patients, in terms of&#xD;
      maintaining the circadian rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of patients treated in the Coronary Intensive Care Unit of&#xD;
      Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital. A total of 32 patients will form the&#xD;
      sample of the study, including 16 in intervention and 16 in a control group that agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study and meet the study criteria. In terms of the reliability of the&#xD;
      study results, the patients in this study will be allocated to the groups with a stratified&#xD;
      randomization method. Patients will be randomly matched to the intervention (I) and control&#xD;
      (C) group according to their gender, age, and circadian rhythms. Data will be collected after&#xD;
      obtaining the institution's permission, the approval of the Ethics Committee, and the&#xD;
      patients' consent through a face-to-face interview with patients. Firstly, the patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated after admitted to the intensive care unit, and the intervention and control&#xD;
      group will be formed using a stratified randomized method from those meeting the study&#xD;
      criteria. All surveys that will be used in the study will be applied to both groups during&#xD;
      the first interview. According to their chronotype, the intervention group will then be given&#xD;
      sleeping glasses and earplugs at night for those who are in the morningtype, and till&#xD;
      afternoon during the day for those who are in the eveningtype. Moreover, patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group will be given 5000 Lux daylight(Maldonado, 2017) during the time they are&#xD;
      awake depending on their circadian rhythms. An Android smartwatch will be used to determine&#xD;
      patients' sleeping and waking up times, sleep quality and sleep depth. Nursing care will also&#xD;
      be provided when patients are awake per their chronotype. Before the study, intensive care&#xD;
      nurses will be trained to provide appropriate care according to the circadian rhythm and&#xD;
      chronotype to have consistency in the care. Patients will be observed for three days and&#xD;
      during this time cortisone and melatonin levels will be checked in both control and&#xD;
      intervention groups (this test is not provided regularly but it will be paid by the financial&#xD;
      sponsors). At the end of the third day, surveys will be conducted once again with both&#xD;
      groups. All through this time, the control group will not have any interventions, only the&#xD;
      standard ICU care to be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, &quot;Patient Information Form, The Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, the Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Scale which is planned to be developed, Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist,&#xD;
      Horne and Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Daily Rhythm Questionnaire, Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale&quot; will be used as a part of the pre-test. Three days later,&#xD;
      &quot;Patient Information Form, The Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, the Sleep Quality Scale&#xD;
      which is planned to be developed, Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, Horne and&#xD;
      Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Daily Rhythm Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety&#xD;
      and Depression Scale&quot; will be applied to the patients as a part of the post-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, a new scale specific to intensive care patients will be developed. The&#xD;
      effects of nursing care given in accordance with the circadian rhythm, which has not been&#xD;
      investigated before, on sleep quality, pain, delirium, and anxiety will be revealed.&#xD;
