  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent endocrine disease in female&#xD;
      reproductive-age. Recently, increasing evidence has shown that natural plant-based products&#xD;
      may play a role in PCOS management. Previous study in PCOS preclinical model and in humans&#xD;
      demonstrated that berberine is an effective insulin sensitizer and improves homeostasis of&#xD;
      metabolic, inflammatory and hormonal disorders. However, to date there is no clinical study&#xD;
      that considers globally all the activities carried out by berberine in PCOS clinical&#xD;
      features. Given this background, aim of this study was to evaluate in normal-overweight PCOS&#xD;
      women with normal menses the berberine effectiveness on: insulin resistance by Homeostasis&#xD;
      Model Assessment (HOMA); inflammation by C-Reactive Protein (CRP), TNF-alpha; lipid&#xD;
      metabolism; sex hormone profile and symptoms correlated to hyperandrogenism, such as acne, by&#xD;
      Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) and Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI); body composition&#xD;
      by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. All these parameters were collected at baseline and 60&#xD;
      days after supplementation with a new bioavailable and safe berberine formulation. Finally,&#xD;
      adverse effects were assessed by liver and kidney functions. To evaluate statistically&#xD;
      significant pre- post-supplementation changes, fitted a linear mixed model for each&#xD;
      investigated endpoint was performed.&#xD;

    <description>Global Acne Grading System (scale): each type of acne lesion is given a value depending on severity: no lesions = 0, comedones = 1, papules = 2, pustules = 3, and nodules = 4. Each of the location was graded separately on 0-4 scale, with the most severe lesion within that location determining the local score. The severity was then graded according to the global score which is the summation of all local scores. A score of 1-6 was considered mild; 7-18, moderate; 19- 26, severe; and 27-32, very severe. The maximum score was 32</description>

    <description>Cardiff Acne Disability Index (scale): the Cardiff Acne Disability Index consists of five questions with a Likert scale, four response categories (0-3). The five questions relate to feeling of aggression, frustration, interference with social life, avoidance of public changing facilities and appearance of the skin-all over the last month-and an indication of how bad the acne was now. The CADI score was calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a possible maximum of 15 and minimum of 0. CADI scores were graded as low (0-4), medium (5-9), and high (10-15)</description>
