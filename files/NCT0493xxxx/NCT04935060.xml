  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the acceptability of a guide developed to improve&#xD;
      people's experiences of dementia assessment outcome appointments in comparison to a standard&#xD;
      consultation. This study will also inform the feasibility of future research evaluating the&#xD;
      guide and provide information on how well the measurements used provide evaluation of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the acceptability of a guide supported consultation (intervention) for&#xD;
      clinicians, patients and companions, in comparison to a standard diagnostic consultation&#xD;
      (usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To inform the feasibility of future research establishing recruitment processes and study&#xD;
      uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish how well the chosen measurement strategy provides evaluation of the intervention&#xD;
      (including completion rates, perceived relevance and burdensomeness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHS Secondary care, Memory Assessment Service (MAS). Services within the identified area are&#xD;
      split into four teams. One team will provide the usual care treatment arm. Another team will&#xD;
      provide the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 Patients and 24 Companions will be recruited for the quantitative component of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two clinicians and six participants will be recruited for the qualitative component of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Measurement The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) questionnaire and the&#xD;
      adapted CARE (for companions) will be used to collect baseline data for each of the two&#xD;
      sites. Baseline data will be collected from anyone attending outcome appointments at both&#xD;
      sites during a recruitment period prior to the implementation of the intervention and will&#xD;
      form an initial baseline cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Data Collection Usual Care Procedure The usual care procedure involves&#xD;
      assessment of patient's cognitive abilities, daily functioning and physical health to&#xD;
      determine the possibility of them having a dementia. This is done through a detailed history&#xD;
      taking by MAS clinicians including information given by the patient, companions and&#xD;
      information included from a GP referral. Standardised assessments are also conducted to&#xD;
      inform the assessment process. These assessments are used based on the needs of the patient&#xD;
      and companions involved. Access to scores on these assessments will be gained through their&#xD;
      medical records and will provide a measurement for comparison between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAS outcome appointments are provided as part of routine care. These appointments require&#xD;
      clinicians to rely on their professional judgement of the best way for the outcomes of&#xD;
      assessments to be communicated to patients and their companions. There are no current&#xD;
      standardised guidelines used within the service for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the service's usual practice, participants will be asked to complete the CARE&#xD;
      and the adapted CARE following their initial assessment and their outcome appointment. The&#xD;
      completed questionnaires will be returned to the researcher by post via pre-paid envelope. A&#xD;
      reminder via telephone call will be given to participants on the day following their&#xD;
      appointment and if they haven't completed the questionnaire they will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to complete it whilst on the call with the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Procedure The intervention procedure will follow the same steps as the usual&#xD;
      care procedure with the addition of use of the Bennett, De Boos and Moghaddam (2018) guide&#xD;
      for clinicians, patients and companions. After gaining of written consent at the initial&#xD;
      assessment appointment, the clinician will give the patient a copy of the guide and inform&#xD;
      them that they can share this with their companion should they wish to. When conducting&#xD;
      outcome appointments clinicians will use the guide to inform communication with the patient&#xD;
      and companion. Clinicians will also refer patients and companions to their copy of the guide&#xD;
      during the outcome appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Data Collection Qualitative data will be collected using semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews with patients and companions as well as clinicians focussing on their experiences&#xD;
      of the outcome appointment. Individuals taking part in the interviews will be involved will&#xD;
      therefore be involved with the study for a further four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall: March 2021-February 2022 Participants and companions involvement with the study will&#xD;
      be for the duration of their assessment by the MAS teams. This is usually around 16 weeks but&#xD;
      varies depending on the clinical needs of the patient. Participants taking part in the&#xD;
      additional qualitative interview will extend the duration of their involvement in the study&#xD;
      by up to four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Quantitative data analysis Quantitative analysis will be descriptive and&#xD;
      will aim to give confidence interval estimation. Baseline measures will be collected for each&#xD;
      location to allow estimates of the variability between the two sites for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra Class Correlations (ICCs) will be carried out to examine the degree of clustering.&#xD;
      Intention to treat (ITT) analysis will be carried out to give a more accurate estimate of&#xD;
      effectiveness in clinical practice. Participants data will be analysed based on their&#xD;
      experimental arm allocation.&#xD;

      effectiveness in clinical practice. Participants data will be analysed based on their&#xD;
      experimental arm allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viability of recruitment will be assessed using eligibility and consent rates for patients&#xD;
      and clinicians. The burden of measure completion will be assessed through missing data levels&#xD;
      as well as interviews with patients and clinicians. Withdrawal rates post consent will be&#xD;
      calculated by study arm for use in future sample size calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis A framework method, as set out by Ritchie and Spencer (1994), will&#xD;
      be used to identify themes. This will allow for comparison of the experiences of participants&#xD;
      in the two arms of the study. Analysis will follow the steps set out by Ritche and Spencer&#xD;
      (1994); familiarisation, identifying a thematic framework, indexing, charting and mapping and&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
