    <textblock>
      Hemiplegic shoulder pain treatment methods are, analgesics, local steroid injection, physical&#xD;
      therapy modalities and exercise. There are publications about the use of TENS and&#xD;
      interferential currents (IFC) in the treatment of hemiplegia related shoulder pain and their&#xD;
      effectiveness. However when we look at the literature, we did not find a study that evaluated&#xD;
      the efficacy of TENS and IFC in hemiplegic shoulder pain. For this reason, in this study, we&#xD;
      aimed to determine the effects of these analgesic treatment modalities on the patient's pain,&#xD;
      functional status and shoulder range of motion (ROM) in these patients. 60 stroke patients&#xD;
      with shoulder pain randomized to four treatment groups. 15 patients in Group 1 were given&#xD;
      TENS treatment to the shoulder area for 25 minutes by conventional method ( 20 sessions, 5&#xD;
      times a week), then, a classical stroke rehabilitation program was applied under the guidance&#xD;
      of a physiotherapist.. 15 patients in Group 2 were given shamTENS treatment to the shoulder&#xD;
      area for 25 minutes ( 20 sessions, 5 times a week), then, a classical stroke rehabilitation&#xD;
      program was applied under the guidance of a physiotherapist.15 patients in Group 3 were given&#xD;
      100 Hz IFC treatment to the shoulder area for 25 minutes ( 20 sessions, 5 times a week),&#xD;
      then, a classical stroke rehabilitation program was applied under the guidance of a&#xD;
      physiotherapist. 15 patients in Group 4 were given shamIFC treatment to the shoulder area for&#xD;
      25 minutes ( 20 sessions, 5 times a week), then, a classical stroke rehabilitation program&#xD;
      was applied under the guidance of a physiotherapist.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline VAS (visual analog scale) at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to make an assesment of their pain level between 0 and 10 scale</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline quality of life (short form 36) at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The physical and mental health summary scores were the primary components used. Scoring is on a scale of 0 to 100 and a higher score reflects better health-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline shoulder range of motion (ROM) at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patients' shoulder joint range of motion will be measured with a goniometer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Beck depression inventory (BDI) at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A total Beck score (0-63) is obtained by giving each question a score of 0-3 in the survey. 17 is considered the threshold value for the degree of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Brunnstrom staging at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>According to Brunnstrom, the motor recovery of the hemiplegic patient is divided into six stages. These stages are defined according to muscle tone and extremity synergies. Stage 1: The involved side is flaccid, there is no active movement. Stage 6: Isolated joint movement is freely available.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Functional ambulation score (FAS) at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to evaluate the support patients need during walking. It has 5 phases. STAGE 0: Non-functional ambulation: The patient does not walk, he can only walk on the parallel bar. STAGE 5: There is independent ambulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline functional independence measure (FIM) at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FIM consists of 2 parts: motor and cognitive skills. Each of the sections contains 18 sub-items under 6 main items (self-care, sphincter control, mobility and transfer, mobility and walking, communication and social perception). The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 18, and the highest score is 126.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline modified ashworth scale (MAS) at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is used when evaluating the upper extremity muscle tone of patients. Stages on this scale: 0: Muscle tone is normal. 4: The affected parts are rigid in flexion and extension, there is a severe increase in tone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline fugl meyer assessment at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a stroke-specific, performance-based scale, with each parameter being 0; fail, 1; partially successful and 2; is scored as a completely successful performance. It is based on the motor recovery stages of Twitchell and Brunnstrom.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ) at 4th and 8th week</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 16-item pain-related disability questionnaire describing common conditions that exacerbate symptoms in patients with shoulder disease. A score of zero indicates maximum well-being, and a score of 100 indicates maximum ill health.</description>
