  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the prehospital setting, the risk of difficult intubation and life-threatening&#xD;
      complications is increased under particular conditions due to the environment or the frequent&#xD;
      instability of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To limit this risk procedures and devices to ease and secure tracheal intubation must be&#xD;
      developped and integrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the prevalence of complications increase with the number of attempts of intubation, one&#xD;
      strategy is to facilitate the intubation technic itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct laryngoscopy with Macintosh blades is the standard device commonly used in first place&#xD;
      for tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other devices are available and used, mostly for difficult intubation, included&#xD;
      videolaryngoscopy. This device has been used and studied for years now. Allowing a better&#xD;
      view and glottic visualisation, videolaryngoscopy could increase the first-pass success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among all videolaryngoscopes, the McGrath videolaryngoscope is the most similar device to the&#xD;
      standard Macintosh laryngoscope. It is light, compact, with a screen directly linked to the&#xD;
      handle, easy to use and offering excellent view. Its usability and efficacy make it a device&#xD;
      of choice for the prehospital setting and worth further clinical trials to define its place&#xD;
      in the airway strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In the prehospital setting, the use of McGrath videolaryngoscope as the primary&#xD;
      device for tracheal intubation could facilitate tracheal intubation and decrease the number&#xD;
      of attempts of intubation and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to determine if the use of McGrath videolaryngoscope increase&#xD;
      the rate of successful first-pass intubation in the prehospital setting compared to direct&#xD;
      view Macintosh laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the rate of successful intubation at the first attempt. One attempt is&#xD;
      defined as an advancement of the tube towards the glottis during a laryngoscopy ; every new&#xD;
      try even during the same laryngoscopy is considered as a new attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful intubation is confirmed by the visualisation of 6 waves of EtCO2.&#xD;
