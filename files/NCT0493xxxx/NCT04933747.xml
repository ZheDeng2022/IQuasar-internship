  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of iberdomide in participants with severe renal impairment or&#xD;
      participants receiving dialysis compared to participants with normal renal function. An&#xD;
      open-label design was selected based on the objective nature of the primary endpoints (i.e.,&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics parameter estimates based on measurement of iberdomide and M12&#xD;
      concentrations). Participants with severe renal impairment (RI), participants with kidney&#xD;
      failure on intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), and participants with normal renal function are&#xD;
      being included in the current study. Participants with severe RI and kidney failure&#xD;
      participants will be matched to participants with normal renal function based on sex, age (±&#xD;
      10 years), and BMI (± 20%).&#xD;
