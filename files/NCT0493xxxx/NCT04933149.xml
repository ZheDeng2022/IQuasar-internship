      The purpose of this study is to assess pre- and postoperative neuropathic pain in patients&#xD;
      with traumatic brachial plexus injuries to determine if intraoperative ketamine infusion&#xD;
      affect neuropathic pain associated with avulsion injuries of the brachial plexus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain following traumatic brachial plexus injuries is a common and debilitating&#xD;
      problem that has been reported in up to 64-75% of patients. Neuropathic pain is difficult to&#xD;
      treat, particularly when secondary to avulsion injuries of the brachial plexus. Current&#xD;
      treatment options include neuromodulating pharmacologic agents including gabapentin,&#xD;
      pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, and duloxetine among others. Other analgesic&#xD;
      modalities include TENS unit application, massage, acupuncture, and topical medications.&#xD;
      Despite these treatment options, patients frequently continue to experience significant,&#xD;
      debilitating neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ketamine has recently been studied in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS),&#xD;
      spinal cord injuries, and chronic neuropathic pain with encouraging results. Ketamine is&#xD;
      thought to exert its analgesic properties via noncompetitive central nervous system&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism among other primarily central mechanisms including&#xD;
      sodium channel blockade, activation of D2 dopamine receptors and facilitation of&#xD;
      Î³-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) signaling. It is utilized clinically in acute and chronic pain&#xD;
      management primarily in hospitalized settings to treat a variety of pain states as well as&#xD;
      medically refractory depression and headache disorders. The dosing and administration of&#xD;
      ketamine infusion varies widely across studies and includes oral ketamine, low dose&#xD;
      infusions, and infusions producing an anesthetic effect. To our knowledge, ketamine's use in&#xD;
      subanesthetic doses has not been adequately evaluated in patients with neuropathic pain&#xD;
      following traumatic brachial plexus injuries. Our study aims to determine how intraoperative&#xD;
      ketamine infusion alters neuropathic pain severity associated with brachial plexus avulsion&#xD;
      injury in the post-operative period. In addition, we hypothesize that patients receiving&#xD;
      intraoperative ketamine infusion will require less narcotic pain medication through the&#xD;
      follow-up period of 6 months following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are undergoing planned surgery for brachial plexus reconstruction at Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      will be enrolled into this study to be randomized into getting ketamine infusions or a&#xD;
      placebo medication during surgery and in the 24 hour postoperative period after surgery. Pain&#xD;
      will be measured before surgery and at various time points to up to 6 months after surgery&#xD;
      through online pain measurement scores.&#xD;
