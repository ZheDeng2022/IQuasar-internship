  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate a 21-herb formula named modified Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (mQFPD) to treat&#xD;
      COVID-19-positive outpatients with mild-to-moderate symptoms assigned to self-quarantined and&#xD;
      home management. This the study aims to establish the safety and feasibility of the use of&#xD;
      mQFPD vs placebo in 66 total subjects. Subsequent trials will evaluate other therapeutics as&#xD;
      well as the efficacy of mQFPD in a larger study population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be assigned to one of two groups, either placebo or mQFPD.&#xD;
      Participants will be screened and consented remotely. Both groups will receive blood draws at&#xD;
      days 1 and 14, and will be sent study medication directly to their home from the&#xD;
      investigational pharmacy. Baseline and end-of-study laboratory draws will be done at home via&#xD;
      mobile phlebotomy. Adverse events and symptoms scores will be monitored by entry into a daily&#xD;
      diary along with regular phone calls with the study coordinators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, safety will be assessed by laboratory measures and adverse event&#xD;
      reporting.&#xD;
