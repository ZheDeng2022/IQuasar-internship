  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be divided into two parts, Parts A and B and will enroll patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML or MDS/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients who have&#xD;
      failed up to 2 prior therapeutic regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a dose escalation study to explore the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of DSP107 when administered as monotherapy and in combination&#xD;
      with azacitidine (AZA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a dose escalation study to explore the safety, efficacy, PK and PD profile of&#xD;
      DSP107 when administered in combination with AZA and venetoclax (VEN).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A is a dose escalation study in up to 3 cohorts of patients designed to test the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of DSP107 administered alone and in combination with AZA. The DSP107 starting&#xD;
      dose level in Part A will be 0.3 mg/kg based on aggregate safety, PK and PD data from study&#xD;
      DSP107_001, an ongoing study exploring the safety of escalating DSP107 doses in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. There will be separate DLT evaluation periods, lasting at least 28&#xD;
      days, to determine the safety of DSP107 as a single agent and in combination with AZA. The&#xD;
      safety, efficacy and PK data will be used to establish a recommended Phase II dose for&#xD;
      potential future expansion cohorts and a starting dose for Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a dose escalation study in 2 cohorts of patients that will test the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of DSP107 in combination with AZA and VEN. The starting dose for Part B will be at&#xD;
      least one dose level lower than the DSP107 dose selected in Part A as being safe and&#xD;
      effective in combination with AZA. Once a safe, effective dose has been established in Part&#xD;
      B, a recommended phase 2 dose for patients with newly diagnosed AML will be agreed with the&#xD;
      FDA at an End-of-Phase 1 meeting.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Duration of the study, estimated to be 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <measure>Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of Treatment Cycle 2 (within 2 months of treatment initiation)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as a clinically significant AE or laboratory abnormality that is related to DSP107 or the combination of DSP107 and AZA, but is unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness or concomitant medications</description>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 months of treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral and bone marrow samples will be assessed to determine ORR. The ORR will measure the proportion of patients who achieve CR, CRi, complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery (CRh), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) or partial response (PR) within 6 months of treatment initiation, with or without cytogenetic response, hematological improvements and a morphologic leukemia-free state.</description>
