      Romiplostim for low platelets caused by lomustine chemotherapy in patients with first&#xD;
      recurrence (growing back) of a brain tumor, glioblastoma that is MGMT methylated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lomustine is an anticancer drug often used to treat glioblastoma that grows back after&#xD;
      initial treatment. This anticancer drug can cause side effects. The most frequent and&#xD;
      potentially serious side effect of all is lowering of the blood platelets. Low platelets can&#xD;
      cause bleedings in the the stomach and intestines, the skin, the brain and other systems and&#xD;
      tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low platelets are also the main cause of delaying or prematurely (ending treatment before the&#xD;
      planned end) stopping chemotherapy. There is no treatment for low platelets except platelet&#xD;
      transfusions. Romiplostim is a drug that stimulates the production of platelets in the bone&#xD;
      marrow. It is an approved drug in USA, Europe, Australia and Switzerland for a special type&#xD;
      of blood disease in which the body breaks down its own blood platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to start the treatment with romiplostim once low platelets are&#xD;
      diagnosed in order to restore the platelet count and to prevent the platelet count from&#xD;
      dropping again during the lomustine treatment.&#xD;
