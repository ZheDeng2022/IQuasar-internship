    <textblock>
      This observational follow-up study of the randomized trial (RCT) DIQOL investigates long-term&#xD;
      effects of an intervention with quality of life (QoL) diagnosis and therapy on present QoL,&#xD;
      survival, and recurrence-free survival of colorectal cancer survivors more than 5 years after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, patients' experiences with aftercare for colorectal cancer during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic and their recollections of their illness and therapy are examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a complex intervention a clinical pathway with quality of life (QoL) diagnosis and&#xD;
      tailored therapy had been developed for patients with colorectal cancer and its effectiveness&#xD;
      was evaluated in a randomized trial (RCT DIQOL, NCT02321813, Klinkhammer-Schalke et al,&#xD;
      2020). In the RCT DIQOL a total of 220 patients were randomised (1:1) into two groups: a care&#xD;
      pathway, including QoL-profiles consisting of 13 QoL scales plus specific therapeutic&#xD;
      recommendations forwarded to the patient's doctor (intervention) or standard postoperative&#xD;
      care (control). QoL was measured (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-CR29) in all patients after surgery and&#xD;
      during aftercare (3, 6, 12, 18 months postoperatively). A need for QoL therapy was defined as&#xD;
      a score &lt;50 points on at least one QoL scale. It was demonstrated that the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with a need for QoL therapy was significantly lower in intervention group patients&#xD;
      at 12 months after surgery (primary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, it is unclear whether there are also long-term benefits of QoL diagnosis and&#xD;
      therapy. Therefore, the aim of this observational, cross-sectional follow-up study of the RCT&#xD;
      DIQOL is to investigate long-term effects of the intervention on present QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30,&#xD;
      QLQ-CR29), overall survival, and recurrence-free survival more than 5 years after surgery by&#xD;
      comparing former intervention and control group patients. Moreover, participants will be&#xD;
      asked for their experiences during aftercare in relation of the COVID-19 pandemic and for&#xD;
      their recollection of their illness and therapy. Data are collected via questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>In the present follow-up study no interventions are administered. This group encompasses patients who had been part of the intervention group of the completed RCT DIQOL with the following intervention: Patients answered QoL questionnaires after surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. Results were transferred to a QoL-profile consisting of 13 QoL scales. Three experts with various professional background used the individual patient's QoL-profile and clinical and sociodemographic information to generate a QoL-report including therapy recommendations which was sent to the patient's doctor. Specific therapeutic options for the treatment of QoL had been defined: pain therapy, psychotherapy, social support, nutrition counseling, stoma care, physiotherapy, and fitness.</description>

        Former participants of the RCT DIQOL with a primary diagnosis of colorectal cancer between&#xD;
        01/2014 and 10/2015 who had been surgically treated in one of four participating certified&#xD;
        centers for colorectal cancer (Krankenhaus Barmherzige Brüder Regensburg, Germany;&#xD;
        Caritas-Krankenhaus St. Josef Regensburg, Germany; Klinikum Neumarkt, Germany; Klinikum St.&#xD;
        Elisabeth Straubing, Germany). Originally, 220 patients were included in the RCT DIQOL. Of&#xD;
        the 220 participants who were included in the RCT 12 patients refused participation during&#xD;
        the trial so that the final sample for the follow-up study encompasses 208 patients. The&#xD;
        questionnaire is mailed to survivors of this cohort. Overall survival and recurrence-free&#xD;
        surival will be analzyed in all 208 former study participants.&#xD;
