    <textblock>
      Diabetes characterized by decreased production, or resistance to the action of insulin or&#xD;
      both. The reduced production or action alters many important body functions namely glucose&#xD;
      absorption and utilization in the body. The disturbed glucose metabolism profoundly effects&#xD;
      transportation of large neutral amino acids especially tryptophan in brain leading decreased&#xD;
      synthesis of serotonin and hence ensuing depression, memory loss and various other&#xD;
      psycho-neurological problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different antipsychotic treatments like serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine inhibitors&#xD;
      and tricyclic antidepressants are available in the market to treat depression but are not&#xD;
      devoid of adverse effects. Therefore, there is a tendency in underdeveloped countries to use&#xD;
      alternative remedies to combat the psycho-neurological issues. Nature has bestowed the bounty&#xD;
      of indigenous herbs like Saffron (Crocus sativusL) and chamomile (Matricaria chamomileL),&#xD;
      that possess neuro-protective effects and are regularly consumed in day to day delicacies&#xD;
      with no documented adverse-effects nor adverse events Though these herbs have been studied&#xD;
      widely for their multiple therapeutic benefits, however, till date both of these herbs in&#xD;
      combination have not been studied as an adjuvant therapy for mild to moderate depression.&#xD;
      Therefore the present study is designed to determine the combined beneficial effects of these&#xD;
      herbs as an adjuvant therapy for treatment of depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a psychological state constellation of sad mood, agitation, lack of interest&#xD;
      and feelings of worthlessness. Depression may be developed or aggravated by multiple factors&#xD;
      like death of a loved one, unhealthy living environmental condition, seasonal variations and&#xD;
      during postpartum state. It has been studied previously that the brain neurotransmitters,&#xD;
      monoamines namely serotonin, dopamine and/or norepinephrine are altered in depression. The&#xD;
      most notable monoamine that plays a vital role is serotonin also known as 5 hydroxy&#xD;
      tryptamine (5- HT). The precursor of serotonin in brain is identified as tryptophan and its&#xD;
      transport in brain declines leading to reduced synthesis of serotonin and hence ensuing&#xD;
      depressive states. It is also noted that serotonin production is decreased profoundly in&#xD;
      diabetic subjects. Insulin plays a vital role in mobilization of tryptophan into brain by&#xD;
      facilitating transport of other large neutral amino acids in somatic compartments. Hence,&#xD;
      insulin resistance or its deficiency leads to compromised access of tryptophan in the brain&#xD;
      ultimately resulting in reduced production of serotonin causing depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise the composition of diet consumed does have a major role in the mood alteration. Upon&#xD;
      consumption of protein rich food, the concentrations of large neutral amino acids levels are&#xD;
      increased in the blood. The competition between the large neutral amino acids and the&#xD;
      tryptophan at the brain receptor level to cross the blood brain barrier increases leading to&#xD;
      relatively lesser transport of tryptophan in the brain. On the other hand, food rich in&#xD;
      carbohydrates in normo-glycemics causes increase sugar levels in the blood resulting in&#xD;
      increased insulin secretion. The optimal level of insulin enhances the entry of large neutral&#xD;
      amino acids in the body tissues leaving increased tryptophan to enter brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of depression in the population Karachi, Pakistan is known to be 25- 30%.&#xD;
      Different antipsychotic treatments like serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine inhibitors&#xD;
      and tricyclic antidepressants are commonly available in the market to treat anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. Their principle action is mediated through alteration of the brain&#xD;
      neurotransmitters levels, however, their short and/or long term administration may&#xD;
      precipitate wide range of adverse effects including tolerance and habituation, insomnia,&#xD;
      suicidal tendency and aggravation of depressive episodes. Therefore, there is a popular trend&#xD;
      in developing countries to use alternative remedies for the treatment of psycho-neurological&#xD;
      issues like depression and nature has bestowed the bounty of indigenous herbs that possess&#xD;
      neuro-protective effects and may be used for medicinal purpose in population. Crocus&#xD;
      sativusL. commonly known as Saffron and Matricaria chamomileL. referred as chamomile, have&#xD;
      been used since ages for the diverse medicinal benefits such as fever, inflammation, muscle&#xD;
      spasms, menstrual disorders, infertility, gastric ulcers, insomnia, depression, anxiety and&#xD;
      dementia. These herbs are regularly consumed in day to day delicacies and have largely been&#xD;
      found safe at tolerated dose ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saffron The main components of saffron are crocin, picrocrocin and safranal. The median&#xD;
      lethal doses (LD50) of saffron are 200 mg/ml and 20.7 g/kg in vitro and in animal studies,&#xD;
      respectively. Saffron has been suggested to be effective in the treatment of a wide range of&#xD;
      disorders including coronary artery diseases, hypertension, stomach disorders, dysmenorrhea&#xD;
      and depression, anxiety, learning and memory impairments. Saffron is reported to be effective&#xD;
      for depression at 30mg/kg/oral dose or in two divided doses of 15 mg/kg body weight, while&#xD;
      its higher doses (200-800 mg/kg body weight) administered orally were found to be effective&#xD;
      for the treatment of epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, diverse dose-range has been&#xD;
      used for the treatment of asthma, cough, hemoptysis, Alzheimer's disease, heart burn,&#xD;
      infertility, PCOS, anti-inflammatory, anti-sclerotic as well as neuro-protective agent.&#xD;
      Administration of saffron and its constituents increases glutamate and dopamine levels in the&#xD;
      brain. It has also demonstrated antidepressant effects in clinical studies and extensive&#xD;
      anxiolytic effects in experimental animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, chamomile has also demonstrated neuro-protective and anxiolytic effects in the both&#xD;
      human and animal model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chamomile The main components of chamomile are bisabolo. The median lethal doses (LD50) of&#xD;
      chamomile are 15ml/kg. However, 1-2 ml/ kg of bisabolol can be well tolerated by rats.&#xD;
      Chamomile has been found well found well tolerated up to the dose of 1500 mg/kg/day with no&#xD;
      severe adverse effects. Chamomile is reported to be effective in the dose range from 30&#xD;
      mg/kd/day to 100mg/kg/day in form of ethanolic extract or water decoction. Different dose&#xD;
      ranges are used for the treatment of various ailments like 9-15g/kg/day for respiratory&#xD;
      infections, 30mg/kg/day to 100mg/kg/day for the treatment of eczema, skin infections, and&#xD;
      Chrons disease, abdominal spasm, diarrhea, infertility, in post-menopausal states,&#xD;
      respiratory and renal infections and inflammations as well as mood swings and anxiety.&#xD;
      Several lines of evidence suggest that most of the flavonoid constituents of chamomile may&#xD;
      produce anxiolytic activity by affecting Î³-amino butyric acid (GABA), noradrenalin (NA),&#xD;
      dopamine (DA), and serotonin neurotransmission or by modulating&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though there are studies are available in literature supporting the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      saffron or chamomile in anxiety or depression, there is no single study highlighting the&#xD;
      potential benefits of co-administration of saffron and chamomile tea for the treatment of&#xD;
      mild to moderate depression with or without co-morbid diabetes.&#xD;
