    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the treatment outcomes (clinical, functional and subjective) of&#xD;
      full arch rehabilitations supported by implants with or without an immediate loading&#xD;
      protocol. In this randomized clinical trial 20 fully edentulous patients were treated with&#xD;
      full arch rehabilitations on dental implants. In half of the sample, the implants were loaded&#xD;
      immediately by means of abutments after emplacement of the implant; but in the counterparts&#xD;
      these abutments were connected to implants two months after the surgery (conventional&#xD;
      protocol), and until that time the dentures were retained by healing abutments. Treatment&#xD;
      outcomes were assessed at 2, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Clinical outcomes were quantified&#xD;
      on the basis of implant failure rate, marginal bone loss and the peri-implant gingival index.&#xD;
      Functional outcomes were calculated according to masticatory performance, estimated by the&#xD;
      mixed fraction of a two-coloured chewing gum after 5, 10 and 15 chewing strokes, by the&#xD;
      occlusal force recorded by pressure-sensitive sheets and by the bioelectrical muscular&#xD;
      activity. The subjective outcomes of the treatment were assessed using both the oral&#xD;
      satisfaction scale (visual analogue scale) and the Spanish version of the Oral Health Impact&#xD;
      Profile (OHIP-20).&#xD;
