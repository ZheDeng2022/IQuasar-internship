  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of rhythmic auditory cueing with&#xD;
      bilateral arm training on upper limb functions in stroke patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arm and hand movement problems are major contributors to disability in patients after stroke.&#xD;
      In fact, only 5% of adults regain full arm function after stroke, and 20% regain no&#xD;
      functional use. Hence, alternative strategies are needed to reduce the long-term disability&#xD;
      and functional impairment from upper limb hemiparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To solve problems concerning upper limb dysfunction related to stroke, various treatment&#xD;
      methods have been used in several previous studies. Rhythmic auditory stimulation has been&#xD;
      reported as an effective intervention for improving movement in the affected extremities of&#xD;
      stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no mentioned previous studies evaluating the effect of rhythmic&#xD;
      auditory cueing with bilateral arm training using functional exercises on upper extremity&#xD;
      impairment in patients with stroke in Egypt are reported. So, this study aims to determine&#xD;
      the effect of rhythmic auditory cueing with bilateral arm training on upper limb functions in&#xD;
      patients with stroke.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will perform the same movement sequence in time with the metronome beat. The frequency of the rhythmic auditory stimulation will be matched to the participant&quot;s preferred movement speed, which will be assessed prior to the start of the trial, and participants typically started moving after they had heard the metronome beat two to three times. Participants will be given sufficient practice trials to ensure full understanding before the actual recording of data, and will be given 3-minutes break between trials.&#xD;
On the 3rd and 5th week, the rhythm frequency was increased by 5%.</description>
