  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to investigate the transplantation of ex-vivo cultivated allogenic limbal&#xD;
      stromal cells for the treatment of the corneal pathologies. The limbus is an ideal source as&#xD;
      the stem cells are numerous and located very superficially in the tissue (17). Pre-clinical&#xD;
      work suggests human corneal stromal stem cells can be isolated from the cadaveric tissues,&#xD;
      cultivated in conditions suitable for cell based therapy and used to prevent fibrosis in a&#xD;
      murine model of corneal stromal scarring. Further, these cells are able to successfully&#xD;
      engraft, differentiate, and mediate wound healing in the corneal stroma such that the tissue&#xD;
      remains healthy, free of fibrotic tissue, and optically transparent. The clinical&#xD;
      implications of these findings are substantial in that it represents the potential to lessen&#xD;
      the burden on donor tissue necessary for corneal allografts by using cultured cells to&#xD;
      regenerate tissue. We foresee the ability of a clinician to and grow and expand the cells in&#xD;
      number and after surgically removing the scar tissue from the wounded eye, apply the cultured&#xD;
      limbal stem cells to regenerate healthy, transparent tissue.&#xD;

      This would be a single-center prospective, open labeled, non-randomized interventional study.&#xD;
      This study is an Investigator Initiated Study (IIS). The Ethics Committee of the LV Prasad&#xD;
      Eye Institute, Hyderabad, would prospectively approve this study. This study would be&#xD;
      conducted in strict adherence to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP E6 (R2),&#xD;
      Indian GCP Guidelines and New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules 2019 and associated amendments&#xD;
      and current National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human&#xD;
      Participants and Current National Stem Cell Research Guidelines and New Drugs and Clinical&#xD;
      Trial Rules 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants are found to be suitable for limbal transplant surgery, the patients&#xD;
      will be administered written informed consent and audio /visual consent as per regulations.&#xD;
      Detailed ophthalmic examination will be done to ensure that the patient is eligible for the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the screening procedures will be accomplished within 14± 7days. On Day 0 that is the date&#xD;
      of surgery a Unique Participant Identification Number (UPIN) will be assigned to each patient&#xD;
      and it would be in addition to hospital medical record number. The surgery will be done under&#xD;
      local or general anesthesia (depending on age and patient preference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective interventional study patients with unilateral superficial corneal scars&#xD;
      will undergo a surgical procedure. Limbal ring from a cadaveric donor tissue, which is&#xD;
      therapeutically accepted and serologically tested, is collected. This tissue will then be&#xD;
      cultivated in the stem cell biology laboratory using standardized culture technique. Briefly&#xD;
      the limbal tissue will be cut up into small pieces and digested overnight using an enzyme&#xD;
      (Collagenase L). The cells obtained from the digest will be cultured on a petri-dish using 2%&#xD;
      serum and growth factors. The cultured cells will be passaged three times to remove all&#xD;
      epithelial cells from the culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second procedure, the eligible patients will undergo corneal transplant surgery, when&#xD;
      the central corneal epithelium will be removed using a surgical sponge. 0.1ml of stromal&#xD;
      cells in a concentration of 0.5x106 cells/µl diluted in the thrombin component of fibrin glue&#xD;
      (TISEEL, Baxter) will be applied to the debrided corneal stroma. A soft bandage contact lens&#xD;
      will be placed over the cornea at the end of the procedure. The patient will receive topical&#xD;
      antibiotic and steroid eye drops in the post-operative period. Periodic comprehensive&#xD;
      ophthalmic evaluation along with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT)&#xD;
      scanning and slit-lamp photography will be done at Day 1, Day 7, Day 30, Day 90, Day 180 and&#xD;
      Day 360 and 720 Days post-surgery. The primary outcome measure of this study is to note any&#xD;
      ocular or systemic adverse effects of this intervention at the various post-operative time&#xD;
      points. The secondary outcome measures are visual improvement and change in the density and&#xD;
      appearance of the corneal scarring and other pathologies after treatment.&#xD;
