  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a 2-year study to investigate vaccine hesitancy and vaccine completion among&#xD;
      vulnerable communities in the Southeastern Louisiana region. This study will be used to track&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine completion among patients who seek testing, either as in-person or&#xD;
      purchasing at home COVID testing, from pharmacies, urgent cares and clinics. The proposal&#xD;
      will introduce a rapid vaccination education model to be delivered at the point of COVID-19&#xD;
      testing by pharmacy students, pharmacy technicians, nurse's aides and other health care&#xD;
      personnel and includes monitoring for COVID-19 vaccine completion among enrolled patients.&#xD;
      Investigators anticipate an increase in COVID-19 vaccine completion rates for those who&#xD;
      participate in the rapid vaccination education model.&#xD;
