      The purpose of the MEQ00073 study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a booster&#xD;
      dose and describe the immune persistence of the priming with a single dose of Men ACYW&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine in children in Finland, Germany, Spain and Hungary, who had been vaccinated&#xD;
      approximately 5 years earlier as toddlers with MenACYW conjugate vaccine as part of the MET51&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
