      This is a single arm phase 1b/2 evaluation of the combination of oregovomab, and bevacizumab,&#xD;
      paclitaxel carboplatin in adult subjects with CA125-associated, advanced recurrent epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal carcinoma (FIGO Stage III/IV) with BRCA-wild type,&#xD;
      previously treated with 1 prior lines of therapy, and with platinum free intervals of &gt;6&#xD;
      months since last platinum-based treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, single arm, phase 1b/II, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 1b part, the recommended phase 2 dose of oregovomab combined with bevacizumab,&#xD;
      paclitaxel and carboplatin will be examined. Approximately 3 to 12 subjects(&quot;3+3&quot; dose&#xD;
      finding design) will be enrolled in phase 1b trial with starting dose of 2mg oregovmab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II trial, response rate of combination with oregovomab and bevacizumab, paclitaxel&#xD;
      will be examined. Based on Simon's two stage model, 8 patients will be enrolled in first&#xD;
      stage, after review of efficacy (response rate) of study treatment, 30 additional subjects&#xD;
      for second stage of phase 2 will be enrolled. Considering 10% of screening failure rate,&#xD;
      overall 42 patients will be enrolled in phase 2 trial.&#xD;
