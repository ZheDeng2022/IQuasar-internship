  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The limited success of our current approaches to increase adoption and maintenance of&#xD;
      physical activity in adults with overweight and obesity is a substantial barrier to&#xD;
      effectively address the current obesity epidemic. This mentored F32 application addresses the&#xD;
      significant public health issue of obesity and associated risk of major chronic diseases by&#xD;
      using mixed methods research to optimize an innovative, theoretically based physical activity&#xD;
      intervention designed to enhance motivation for exercise in adults with overweight and&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity (PA) is one of the best predictors of sustained weight loss and current&#xD;
      guidelines recommend high levels of PA to prevent weight regain after weight loss. However,&#xD;
      long-term adherence to PA is generally poor when adults with overweight/obesity are provided&#xD;
      an exercise prescription consistent with current guidelines. Thus, it is essential to&#xD;
      evaluate novel strategies to enhance adoption and maintenance of PA in adults with&#xD;
      overweight/obesity. The overall goal of this mentored F32 application is to use mixed methods&#xD;
      research to optimize an innovative, theoretically based PA intervention designed to enhance&#xD;
      motivation for exercise in adults with overweight/obesity. Specifically, the objectives of&#xD;
      this proposal are to evaluate and optimize a theory-based PA intervention (called MOVE)&#xD;
      designed to enhance motivation for exercise as a sub-study of an ongoing weight loss &quot;parent&quot;&#xD;
      trial (COMIRB, Protocol #17-0369). In Aim 1, adults from an ongoing behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      trial (R01DK111622) will receive the MOVE intervention and participate in focus groups to&#xD;
      explore how participants experience MOVE. In Aim 2, we will use a mixed methods convergent&#xD;
      design to integrate quantitative results from a secondary data analysis and qualitative&#xD;
      results (Aim 1) to optimize MOVE in preparation for a full evaluation of MOVE in a future&#xD;
      randomized controlled study.&#xD;

    <description>During a 90-minute semi-structured focus group, participants were asked about their satisfaction with major aspects of the MOVE physical activity support program including: 1) MOVE content and 2) delivery of MOVE content including meeting frequency and structure for both group-based and 1:1 meetings. Participants were also asked about their overall experience with the MOVE program, things that worked well, things that did not work well, and about the most important things they learned from the MOVE program.</description>

    <description>During a 90-minute semi-structured focus group, participants were asked about their perception of two different physical activity messages:&#xD;
&quot;For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week.&quot;&#xD;
&quot;Move in ways that make you feel good. Benefits of physical activity include improved mood, sleep, less anxiety, more patience. All movement counts. Find opportunities to move throughout the day.&quot;</description>

    <intervention_name>MOVE</intervention_name>
    <description>The MOVE physical activity support program is based on the Self-Determination Theory and targets autonomous motivation for physical activity by encouraging 1) choice in physical activity type (e.g. walking, household chores, yoga), 2) a meaningful, value-based rationale for engaging in physical activity, and 3) physical activity that is intrinsically enjoyable. MOVE was delivered during two, 60-75 minute group-based classes and one, 45 minute individualized 1:1 support session to enhance adherence to physical activity recommendations within a lifestyle weight loss program. The group-based classes included a combination of PowerPoint slides, participant handouts, and group-based discussions. All MOVE content was delivered by trained study staff.</description>
