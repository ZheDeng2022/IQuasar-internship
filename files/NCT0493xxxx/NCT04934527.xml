  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMV infection in transplantation remains the most frequent infectious complication causing&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality. International recommendations advocate prevention of this&#xD;
      infection by instituting direct antiviral treatment or monitoring viral replication by PCR&#xD;
      with the start of curative antiviral treatment when the DNAemia is positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of CMV infection varies according to the serostatus of the donor (D) and recipient&#xD;
      (R) at the time of transplantation. In the absence of prophylaxis, CMV infection occurs in&#xD;
      60-80% of D+R-, 50-60% of D+R+ and 25-50% of D-R+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The humoral anti-CMV response is represented by the production of antibodies to envelope&#xD;
      proteins (gB and gH) and to molecules involved in viral attachment and entry into target&#xD;
      cells. However, the majority of CMV-specific antibodies do not have antiviral neutralising&#xD;
      activity. The investigators have identified a new player in the specific anti-CMV response&#xD;
      expressing the Fc RIIIa receptor (CD16), that interacts with anti-CMV immunoglobulins (Ig):&#xD;
      the Tgamma-delta V delta 2-negative lymphocyte (LTgdVd2neg). This lymphocyte subpopulation&#xD;
      shows persistent expansion in the peripheral blood of kidney transplant patients with CMV&#xD;
      infection. These cells express an effector-memory phenotype (CD45RA+/CD27-). This expansion&#xD;
      is associated with resolution of infection in patients. The investigators have shown that&#xD;
      CD16 is specifically and constitutively expressed on the surface of CMV-induced LTgdVd2neg in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and kidney transplant patients. The investigators have observed that one&#xD;
      of the antiviral activities of anti-CMV IgG lies in its binding to the Fc RIIIa receptor&#xD;
      (CD16) on the surface of LTgdVd2neg. The anti-CMV IgGs capturing virions thus activate CD16+&#xD;
      LTgdVd2neg with production of IFN interferon which in turn is responsible for inhibition of&#xD;
      CMV viral multiplication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-CMV IgG is a recommended therapeutic option, with a marketing authorisation for the&#xD;
      prevention of CMV infection in kidney transplantation in Europe and a Temporary Authorisation&#xD;
      for Use in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, R+ patients expressing a significant level of LTgdVd2neg CD16+ at D0 of transplantation&#xD;
      could be protected against CMV, in the absence of direct antiviral treatment by the addition&#xD;
      of anti-CMV Ig.&#xD;

      SYNTAGME is a single-centre prospective phase II pilot study. Transplant candidates from our&#xD;
      centre who meet the inclusion criteria without exclusion criteria will be offered this study.&#xD;
      Anti-CMV Ig infusions will be performed the day of transplantation at 100 units per kilo of&#xD;
      body weight and then every 15 days for a total of 6 infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic and frequent monitoring for the occurrence of CMV DNAemia will be performed&#xD;
      throughout this study. Real-time quantitative CMV PCR on whole blood (WHO standard provided&#xD;
      by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control) will be performed every week&#xD;
      until M3, then every fortnight until 4 months and then at months 5, 6, 9 and 12. CMV&#xD;
      infection will be defined by the presence of a positive CMV PCR in whole blood. Universal&#xD;
      prophylaxis with VALGANCICLOVIR will be prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-emptive antiviral treatment will be initiated in case of CMV infection, if the DNAemia&#xD;
      reaches the threshold chosen by the centre, which is 5000 IU/ml. The choice of treatment will&#xD;
      be left to the discretion of the clinician: IV ganciclovir (5mg/Kg/12H) or valganciclovir&#xD;
      (900mg/12H) until viral replication is negated. Doses will be adjusted for kidney function&#xD;
      using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, in accordance with laboratory recommendations.&#xD;
