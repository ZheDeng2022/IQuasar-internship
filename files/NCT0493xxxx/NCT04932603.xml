  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antithrombotic drugs, which include antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies, are used to&#xD;
      prevent and treat many cardiovascular disorders. With the increase in prevalence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases and medical progress, these treatments are increasingly being&#xD;
      prescribed, particularly in older patients. One of the main indications of antithrombotic&#xD;
      drugs is atrial fibrillation (AF), a disease highly prevalent in older people, a population&#xD;
      at high risk of adverse drug events. Notably, antithrombotic drugs are the first involved in&#xD;
      serious adverse drug events, among which 40-70% may be preventable. In this context, six&#xD;
      units of the hospital group &quot;Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris&quot; have created a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team which assesses antithrombotic prescriptions in older patients with AF.&#xD;
      This team, gathering geriatricians, cardiologists, neurologists and haematologist specialized&#xD;
      in haemostasis, evaluates the patient medical profile and suggests the most appropriate&#xD;
      antithrombotic treatment based on their expertise and the available recommendations. Here we&#xD;
      want to look at patients outcomes in light of the intervention of this multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      on the composite outcome of all-cause mortality, ischemic event or bleeding event at 3&#xD;
      months. Secondary objectives are to evaluate this composite outcome at 6 months and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality, occurrence of ischemic event, occurrence of bleeding event, at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
