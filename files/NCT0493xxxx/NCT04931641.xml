  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this randomized controlled trial in virally suppressed HIV-positive&#xD;
      children with anemia and/or depleted iron stores are to determine the effect of prebiotic&#xD;
      galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) as adjunct treatment to 12 weeks of oral iron supplementation&#xD;
      on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. iron status measured by conventional iron status biomarkers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. fractional absorption of iron (fraction of total body iron per day, measured as Kabs,&#xD;
           the slope of 57Fe isotopic dilution) and mean total amount of iron absorbed each day (mg&#xD;
           Fe/day, calculated as Kabs x mean total body iron),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. systemic and gut inflammation, as well as gut mucosal integrity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. gut microbiome composition, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. adverse effects and gastrointestinal side-effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in childhood can impair growth and cognition, as well as reduce&#xD;
      school performance. Furthermore, anemia frequently complicates pediatric HIV infection and&#xD;
      predicts disease progression and mortality. However, there is no international consensus on&#xD;
      the treatment of ID and IDA in HIV-infected children, because of concerns around the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of oral iron supplements. Recent studies have suggested that oral iron supplements&#xD;
      may increase gut inflammation in African children. This could be particularly detrimental in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children, who may have gut immune activation, enteropathy and adverse shifts in&#xD;
      the gut microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous stable iron isotope studies from the ETH Laboratory of Human Nutrition showed that&#xD;
      the consumption of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) together with supplemental doses&#xD;
      of iron can increase iron absorption. In Kenyan infants, we further showed that the addition&#xD;
      of GOS to an iron-containing micronutrient powder mitigated the adverse effects of iron on&#xD;
      the gut microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we hypothesize that providing GOS as adjunct treatment to oral iron supplementation&#xD;
      will improve efficacy (iron absorption and iron status), reduce systemic and gut&#xD;
      inflammation, improve mucosal integrity, and mitigated iron-induced alterations in the gut&#xD;
      microbiome, adverse events and gastrointestinal side-effects in virally suppressed&#xD;
      HIV-infected children.&#xD;
