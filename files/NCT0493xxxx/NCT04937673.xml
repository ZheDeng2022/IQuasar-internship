  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open, two arm phase II clinical study. 40 patients are included in the&#xD;
      exploratory study. The dominant population with higher biomarker positive / IO score was&#xD;
      identified to provide the basis for the later phase III study. The subjects were randomly&#xD;
      divided into the group of camrelizumab combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin or the group of&#xD;
      camrelizumab combined with albumin bound paclitaxel and cisplatin according to the ratio of&#xD;
      1:1. The treatment cycle was every 3 weeks. The curative effect was evaluated when the&#xD;
      treatment cycle was 2, and the resection of esophageal cancer was considered after 3 cycles.&#xD;
      Postoperative adjuvant therapy was based on the patient's condition and surgical results; For&#xD;
      patients with R0 resection, postoperative adjuvant treatment is not recommended. For patients&#xD;
      with R1 / R2 resection, multi-disciplinary joint discussion and consultation are recommended&#xD;
      to propose individualized comprehensive treatment.&#xD;
