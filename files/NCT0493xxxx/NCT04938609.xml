      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunoradiotherapy&#xD;
      (NIRT) prior to surgery for the treatment of stage III and IVA HPV- HNSCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This clinical trial uses pembrolizumab and radiotherapy prior to definitive surgical&#xD;
      resection of tumors in patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OHNSCC) with the&#xD;
      primary objective of determining the safety and efficacy of preoperative immunoradiotherapy.&#xD;
      In addition, tumor tissue, microbiome samples, and peripheral blood will be obtained for&#xD;
      exploratory immunologic end points including measurements of tumor infiltrating immune cell&#xD;
      populations based on flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry as well as circulating&#xD;
      immunological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated duration of 52 weeks: neoadjuvant immunoradiotherapy +/- surgery at week 7,&#xD;
      followed by risk adapted adjuvant therapy, per standard of care. Patients will then be&#xD;
      treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for 14 additional doses (17 doses total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II efficacy study (n = 28, total) to assess rate of down-staging after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      immunoradiotherapy using Simon's two-stage design (futility assessment at n = 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I studied nivolumab in 10 patients with HPV+ HNSCC, the results of which suggest that&#xD;
      the combination is safe and efficacious. The phase II portion of study will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with SBRT as a safe means to down-stage&#xD;
      HNSCC prior to surgical resection, improve quality of life, and enhance local control and&#xD;
      overall survival. Patients will be followed for disease free and overall survival at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients may be enrolled unless a rate of unplanned surgical delay attributed to&#xD;
      immunoradiotherapy is found to exceed 33% after enrollment of the first 10 patients. We&#xD;
      estimate at least 2 patients per month will be enrolled. Time to full accrual is estimated as&#xD;
      2.5 years.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
