    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Scale-54</measure>
    <time_frame>1.week</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was developed by Vickrey et al17 to evaluate the quality of life of patients with The scale was created by adding 18 MS-related items to SF-36 (short form). Physical and mental health composite scores are calculated, and higher scores indicate better quality of life. The Turkish version was developed by Tulek et al.</description>
