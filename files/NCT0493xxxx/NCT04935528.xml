  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Special populations are people with a risk to dévelop severe forms of a disease. The&#xD;
      immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines in this population may be different compared of the&#xD;
      general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Covid-19, special populations are people with chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes,&#xD;
      cancer, etc.) and / or immunocompromised and / or elderly. It is therefore important that the&#xD;
      safety of new vaccines as well as their efficacy be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in cancer, most immunosuppressions and immunosuppressive treatments (in particular&#xD;
      chemotherapy or certain targeted therapies) risk negatively impacting the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccine both for the humoral immune responses (antibodies ) and cellular&#xD;
      (T lymphocytes). These patients may develop an insufficient post-vaccination immunity.&#xD;
      However, it seems that immunosenescence (ie the aging of the immune system) has little impact&#xD;
      on the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines and viral vector vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Canserovax study evaluates the impact of anticancer treatments on the quality of the&#xD;
      humoral (development of antibodies) and cellular (development of a specific T response)&#xD;
      immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients treated for cancer after vaccination. It is carried&#xD;
      out in patients undergoing treatment and in subjects not suffering from cancer, and not&#xD;
      treated for this pathology (vaccinated salaried staff of a french cancer center). The aim is&#xD;
      to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the post-vaccination immune responses in these 2&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;

      The main objective of this study is to describe after anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination the humoral&#xD;
      immune response against the virus (assay of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to detect the presence&#xD;
      and intensity of humoral immune responses) and the cellular response against the virus&#xD;
      (specific T response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several cohorts are studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 of vaccinated salaried staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 of unvaccinated salaried staff (controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 of vaccinated cancer patients (metastatic colorectal, metastatic pancreas and&#xD;
           metastatic breast cancer)&#xD;
