  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the extent to which a non-invasive, palpatory&#xD;
      neuromodulatory protocol on the trigeminal nerve endings on the face can affect tenderness&#xD;
      felt on the posterior neck musculature, using the Isotouch pressure sensor system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Subjects will see a decrease in tenderness in the posterior neck musculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Subjects will show a decrease in tenderness on the trigeminal tender points&#xD;
      found on the face.&#xD;

      Study Instrumentation: The Isotouch sensor device and software is a passive sensor device&#xD;
      that allows for real-time, constant visualization of pressure information. The system&#xD;
      electronics are remote (on the packet usually worn on the wrist) and the current supports a&#xD;
      Bluetooth data stream. The sensor has input power on the wrist and minimal microcurrent&#xD;
      output. The pressure range for the device ranges from 0-100 pounds per square inch (PSI),&#xD;
      although this study will only be using pressure of 0.5 to three pounds of pressure. The&#xD;
      sensors are made of both cloth and Polyimide material. This software will be directly used in&#xD;
      the neuromodulatory intervention as described below. The sensors will be used both for the&#xD;
      palpatory evaluation of trigeminal tender points on the face as well as the neuromodulation&#xD;
      portion of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects interested in the study will email the NeckPainResearch@unthsc.edu account to&#xD;
      express their interest in participating. The co-investigators will email the subject an&#xD;
      initial survey to answer questions about the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This survey&#xD;
      will primarily consist of questions related to the potential participant's medical history,&#xD;
      to best determine if they qualify for the study. If subjects qualify, they will be contacted&#xD;
      via telephone (by the principal or a co-investigator) to schedule a time to participate in&#xD;
      the study visit. Once a visit is scheduled, the participant will meet the investigators in a&#xD;
      private setting either at the UNTHSC campus or other community based designated area. After&#xD;
      the consenting process is completed, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      re-reviewed. If the subject qualifies, they will be consented and fill out a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire. Subjects will be verbally asked for demographic information including their&#xD;
      age, weight, height, gender, and have their neck circumference measured by the principal&#xD;
      investigator or a co-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting, the subject will be taken to the operator (the principal or&#xD;
      co-investigator) who will be in clinical patient room with the IsoTouch software (see&#xD;
      diagram). The subject will lie supine on the exam table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator will be wearing two IsoTouch finger sensors; one on each index finger. Non-latex&#xD;
      coverings will be used over the IsoTouch software pressure sensors to protect the&#xD;
      instrumentation from the natural oils of human skin, as well as the participant. The operator&#xD;
      will palpate 1 inch posteromedial from the posterior aspect of the mastoid process (posterior&#xD;
      neck) on each side with 3 pounds of pressure to determine if any tenderness is present, and&#xD;
      the subject will verbally give a pain rating between 0-10. This will be referred to as the&#xD;
      left and right cervical sites of tenderness (CSOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, using the IsoTouch finger sensor, the trigeminal nerve endings will be palpated for&#xD;
      tenderness with 2 lbs of pressure and subjects will verbally give a pain rating on a scale of&#xD;
      0-10 at the following sites: V1, and V2 branches of the trigeminal nerve on the face which&#xD;
      will be referred to as trigeminal tender points (TTPs, see below diagram). The three most&#xD;
      tender TTPs will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two lbs of pressure will be used on the facial sites as the anatomy is significantly&#xD;
      different. The facial structures in general are much more superficial than the layers of&#xD;
      musculature in the posterior neck. Therefore, the pressure will be less on the face than it&#xD;
      is on the posterior neck musculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator will keep one monitoring sensor with minimal pressure (less than 0.5 lbs of&#xD;
      pressure) at the CSOT while the other sensor/sensing hand applies steady pressure to each of&#xD;
      the TTPs. The CSOT remains the same throughout the protocol and does not change sides, as it&#xD;
      will be reevaluated when the protocol is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three most tender TTPs will be palpated with steady pressure (two lbs of pressure) for 30&#xD;
      seconds, as this step is the neuromodulation intervention. In the event that there are two&#xD;
      tender points rated the same (and not zero), the investigators will repeat assessment of each&#xD;
      trigeminal area again to be rated by the subject. If it happens that the same values are&#xD;
      again recorded, the investigators will include both tender points in our protocol,&#xD;
      potentially including four TTPs in the intervention. Any anomalies will be noted in the data&#xD;
      collection. The steady pressure is continuously recorded via the pressure sensing IsoTouch&#xD;
      pads and monitored in real time by the operator to keep it consistent with each intervention.&#xD;
      After the TTP's have the intervention, their face will not be touched again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all three of the TTPs assessed to have tenderness have received the intervention, the&#xD;
      CSOT will be rechecked with the same initial pressure (3lbs) to evaluate pain changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Example, The CSOT on the right was assessed to have an 8/10 tenderness to palpation. V1R,&#xD;
      V2R, V2L were found to have the most tenderness. In sequential order, V1R, V2R, V2L will have&#xD;
      the neuromodulatory pulsations applied to them, and when complete, the right sided CSOT will&#xD;
      be rechecked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the force signal drift of the ISOTOUCH, and the real-time nature of the software, the&#xD;
      pressure/force will be monitored and adjusted accordingly to maintain the appropriate&#xD;
      pressure/force throughout the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This neuromodulatory protocol is finished when the TTPs that were assessed to have the most&#xD;
      tenderness each had the 30 second intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be ended immediately if any subject asks to stop, or if any significant&#xD;
      pain or side effects develop.&#xD;
