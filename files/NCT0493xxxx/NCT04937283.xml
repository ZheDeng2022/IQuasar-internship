  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the non-inferiority in recurrence-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival of segmentectomy compared with lobectomy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma ≤ 2 cm&#xD;
      with micropapillary and solid subtype negative by intraoperative frozen sections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the technology of intraoperative frozen section has gradually matured, which can&#xD;
      diagnose the benign and malignant tumors and guide the resection strategy for peripheral&#xD;
      small-sized lung adenocarcinoma. Travis et al. reported high specificity of intraoperative&#xD;
      frozen section in the identification of micropapillary components, confirming that&#xD;
      intraoperative frozen section may guide the selection of surgical procedures. However, there&#xD;
      is still little evidence weather segmentectomy is appropriate for invasive adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      without micropapillary patterns. This prospective and multi-center study was aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the non-inferiority in recurrence free survival and overall survival of&#xD;
      segmentectomy compared with lobectomy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (≤ 2 cm) not&#xD;
      including micropapillary components.&#xD;

    <description>Segmentectomy with hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection is performed. If the tumor located at inter-segment plane and without sufficient resection margin distance, a combined segmentectomy will be performed after a comprehensive evaluation. As with lobectomy, systemic or selective lymph node dissection is mandatory, and nodal sampling is not allowed. At least three stations of mediastinal lymph node from 2R, 4R, 7, 8, 9 for the right side and 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 for the left side, respectively. The distance from the dissection margin to the tumor edge must be evaluated in the same manner as with lobectomy. When lymph node metastasis is present or resection margin is not cancer-free, the surgical procedure must be converted to a lobectomy.</description>
