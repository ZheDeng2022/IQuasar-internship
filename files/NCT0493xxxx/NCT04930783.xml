  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the drugs called NeoVax (a new type of personalized&#xD;
      neoantigen vaccine) in combination with CDX-301 and Nivolumab as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personalized Neoantigen peptides (which combined with poly-ICLC make the vaccine NeoVax)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDX-301&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab (Opdivo)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to determine if it is possible to safely administer a&#xD;
      personalized neoantigen vaccine (NeoVax) in combination with the study drug CDX-301 and&#xD;
      Nivolumab against melanoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of&#xD;
      someone's own melanoma. The study will also be determining what the appropriate dose of&#xD;
      CDX-301 to be given in combination with NeoVax and Nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved personalized neoantigen&#xD;
      peptides, poly-ICLC , or CDX-301 as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved Nivolumab as a treatment option for metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that melanoma cancers have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are&#xD;
      specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to&#xD;
      produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells.It is possible that&#xD;
      these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help someone's&#xD;
      body fight any tumor cells that could cause the melanoma to come back in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personalized Neovax vaccine will be made of protein fragments, called peptides, from an&#xD;
      individual's mutated melanoma tumor cells mixed with Poly-ICLC. Poly-ICLC is a drug that&#xD;
      binds proteins on the surface of certain immune cells and helps to activate the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDX-301 is a drug involved in regulating the activity and proliferation of a type of cell&#xD;
      named dendritic cell. Dendritic cells are key in enhancing the activation of the immune&#xD;
      system in response to the NeoVax vaccine, so the immune system has a better chance to&#xD;
      recognize the tumor cells and attack them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an antibody that prevents cancer cells from suppressing one's immune response so&#xD;
      that their body can attack and kill the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they do not have serious side&#xD;
      effects and their disease does not get worse for a maximum of 2 years and will be followed&#xD;
      for 5 years since study therapy initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Celldex Therapeutics is supporting this research by providing CDX-301.&#xD;

                       levels above institutional normal (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula&#xD;
                       below):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female CrCl = (140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male CrCl = (140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) should have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
             start of Nivolumab, because the effects of NeoVax plus Montanide and Nivolumab on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with study agents, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated Nivolumab, Personalized Neoantigen vaccine, and&#xD;
             CDX-301&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants enrolled in the study, who are not free from menses for &gt;2 years,&#xD;
             post hysterectomy / oophorectomy, or surgically sterilized, should be willing to use&#xD;
             either 2 adequate barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method of&#xD;
             contraception to prevent pregnancy or to abstain from sexual activity throughout the&#xD;
             study, starting with visit 1 through 5 months after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
             Approved contraceptive methods include for example: intra uterine device, diaphragm&#xD;
             with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, male condoms, or female condom with&#xD;
             spermicide. Spermicides alone are not an acceptable method of contraception. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.The&#xD;
             investigational product will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting&#xD;
             with visit 1 through 7 months after the last dose of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma except anti-CTLA-4. Patients who have&#xD;
             received PD-1 inhibition therapy as adjuvant therapy and stopped receiving PD-1&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Examples&#xD;

             rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
        are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated&#xD;
        vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic reactions attributed to any vaccine therapy for the&#xD;
             prevention of infectious diseases&#xD;

             they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to&#xD;
             autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring&#xD;
             systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external&#xD;
             trigger&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily&#xD;
             prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study&#xD;
             drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg&#xD;
             daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Test positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known mutations/amplifications in Flt-3&#xD;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Nivolumab, personalized neoantigen&#xD;
             peptides and poly-ICLC are agents with unknown risks to the developing fetus. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with Nivolumab, personalized neoantigen peptides and&#xD;
             poly-ICLC, nursing women are excluded from this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of an invasive malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances: a) individuals with a history of invasive malignancy are&#xD;
             eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the&#xD;
             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; b) individuals with&#xD;
             the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated - carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;
             breast, oral cavity or cervix, localized prostate cancer, basal cell or squamous cell&#xD;
