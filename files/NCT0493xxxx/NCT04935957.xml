      This study is an Observational, prospective, single center, controlled, single-arm,&#xD;
      non-randomized, open label clinical study clinical investigation designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      performance of igluco invincit in the monitoring and measurement of the blood glucose&#xD;
      compared to the standard glucometer in a group of controlled diabetic subjects. The&#xD;
      evaluation of the clinical performance including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy will&#xD;
      be also carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation has been designed to involve as little pain, discomfort, fear, and&#xD;
      any other foreseeable risk as possible for subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current methods for blood glucose measurements, glucometers, although minimally invasive,&#xD;
      can be painful, requiring puncturing the fingertip with a lancet device and removing a drop&#xD;
      of blood, that applies to a disposable test strip. This minimal invasiveness may cause&#xD;
      discomfort and deter the user from measuring his/her blood glucose levels as frequently as&#xD;
      required. Due to igluco invincit non-invasive nature, it is expected to give the patient or&#xD;
      health care provider immediate reliable quantitative as well as qualitative information,&#xD;
      safely and painlessly avoiding any type of discomfort to the user. Therefore, the primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the performance of igluco invincit device, in the monitoring and&#xD;
      measurement of the blood glucose level in adult patients with stable Diabetes Mellitus type 1&#xD;
      and 2, compared to the standard glucometer (blood capillary glucometer - Bayer, Contour XT).&#xD;
      This performance will be measured by Clarke Error. The secondary objective is to revise all&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events and local and systematic effects of igluco invincit and the standard&#xD;
      glucometer, including: redness, burns, pain, or other complications such as bleeding or local&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an Interventional, prospective, single center, controlled, single-arm,&#xD;
      non-randomized, open label clinical study clinical investigation designed with a total amount&#xD;
      of 105 subjects that will be enrolled in the investigation. Study participants will take the&#xD;
      igluco invincit and standard glucometer home and each subject will take 4 pairs of&#xD;
      measurements per day for a week.&#xD;
