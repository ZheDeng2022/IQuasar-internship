  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a rolling arm study of pembrolizumab in combination with investigational agents&#xD;
      in participants with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/ programmed cell death ligand 1&#xD;
      (PD-L1) refractory ES-SCLC in need of second-line treatment. This study will have 2 parts: an&#xD;
      initial safety lead-in to determine safety and tolerability for experimental combinations of&#xD;
      investigational agents without an established recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) followed by an&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational agents will initiate directly in or be added to the efficacy evaluation after&#xD;
      an initial evaluation of safety and tolerability of the investigational agent has been&#xD;
      completed in a separate study or in the safety lead-in of this study. If an RP2D for a&#xD;
      combination being evaluated in the safety lead-in is established from another study, then the&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation may begin at the determined RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no hypothesis testing in this study.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 that has been modified for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) will be presented.</description>

    <description>For participants who demonstrate a confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.
