  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC; colloquially referred to as a 'yeast infection') is a&#xD;
      prevalent mucosal infection caused by Candida spp. that affects ~75% of women at least once&#xD;
      in their life. VVC usually responds well to treatment, yet a small but significant fraction&#xD;
      of women experience recurrent yeast infections even with weekly treatment. A further&#xD;
      complication in understanding the causes of recurrent infections is that approximately one in&#xD;
      five females have vaginal yeast present without any symptoms at any given point. The link&#xD;
      between fungi, other microbes in the vagina (&quot;microbiome&quot;), and the human immune system&#xD;
      remain poorly understood in the switch from having yeast present in the vagina without any&#xD;
      symptoms and symptomatic yeast infections. Fungi also compose a normal component of the&#xD;
      microbiome at other sites in the body (e.g., oral, skin, gastrointestinal tract, rectum)&#xD;
      where they may serve as a source of re-infection following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the commonly prescribed 'first choice' antifungal drug fluconazole, a&#xD;
      second-line treatment, boric acid, has shown promise in the literature and has been used&#xD;
      locally with success at increasing the time between recurrent infections. A drawback of this&#xD;
      therapy, however, is cost, as it is a compounded medication, and patients have to pay out of&#xD;
      pocket. The purpose of this study is to understand how the yeast and bacterial microbial&#xD;
      communities differ for females with recurrent infections from females with their first yeast&#xD;
      infection and females with vaginal yeast present without any symptoms, and to track yeast&#xD;
      diversity following treatment with either boric acid or fluconazole. We hypothesize that we&#xD;
      will identify multiple subpopulations of yeast at multiple anatomical body sites in females&#xD;
      with VVC and recurrent VVC. We anticipate finding evidence for recurrent infection from&#xD;
      secondary sites by linking genomic diversity of vaginal yeast strains during symptomatic&#xD;
      infection to strains from other body sites. We hypothesize that yeast isolated from females&#xD;
      with recurrent infections will exhibit different drug response phenotypes than yeast from&#xD;
      females with asymptomatic vaginal yeast. We hypothesize that the vaginal microbiome of&#xD;
      post-treatment patients treated with boric acid will differ from that of fluconazole.&#xD;
      Combined, we hypothesize that post-treatment response will differ between the drugs,&#xD;
      indicating that treatment specifics influence the vaginal environment.&#xD;
