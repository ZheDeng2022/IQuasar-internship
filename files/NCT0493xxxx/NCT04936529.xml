  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to explore the combination of a bivalent vaccine, a sugar called&#xD;
      beta-glucan (β-glucan), and a protein called granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      (GM-CSF) as an effective treatment for people with high-risk neuroblastoma that is in&#xD;
      complete remission. The combination may be effective because the different parts of the&#xD;
      treatment work to strengthen the immune system's response against cancer cells in different&#xD;
      ways.&#xD;

    <description>Group 3 will include participants who cannot be randomized (e.g., due to allergy to GMCSF). It will also include participants previously treated with this vaccine and oral β-glucan on the predecessor MSK protocol IRB# 05-075 or on this protocol (participants can therefore be enrolled more than one time on this protocol). These participants will be treated as in Group 1. The analyses in this group will be exploratory.</description>
