      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the overall survival time (OS), objective remission&#xD;
      rate（ORR）, progression-free survival time（PFS）, disease control rate（DCR）of Carelizumab&#xD;
      combined with irinotecan and apatinib for the second-line treatment of locally advanced&#xD;
      unresectable, recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach and gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction. At the same time, the safety and tolerance of the scheme were preliminarily&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
