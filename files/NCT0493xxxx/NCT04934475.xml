      IFM 2020-02 will enroll patients eligible for ASCT less than 66 years. All patients will&#xD;
      receive induction based on 6 cycles (28-day) of KRD-Isatuximab (Isa-KRD), in order to achieve&#xD;
      deep responses and high MRD negativity rates. Patients will be classified at diagnosis&#xD;
      according to cytogenetics (standard vs high-risk cytogenetics defined by the LP score&#xD;
      including 17p deletion, t(4;14), del(1p32), gain 1q, trisomy 21 and trisomy 5).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to international guidelines, outside clinical trials, frontline autologous stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard of care for fit patients less than 71 years of&#xD;
      age, who are newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triplet combinations are now the backbone of induction therapy prior to ASCT. KRD&#xD;
      (Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone) is potentially the more active regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadruplet combinations are under evaluation. The prospective phase 3 CASSIOPEIA trial&#xD;
      conducted by the IFM and HOVON cooperative groups investigated the outcome of&#xD;
      transplant-eligible patients treated with VTD (Bortezomib, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone) +/-&#xD;
      Daratumumab administered both before (induction, 4 cycles) and after (consolidation, 2&#xD;
      cycles) single ASCT prepared by Melphalan 200 mg/m2.5 The addition of Daratumumab to VTD&#xD;
      during induction induced significantly higher response rates, but also higher minimal&#xD;
      residual disease (MRD) - negativity rates. The high response rates achieved after induction&#xD;
      (MRD negativity rates at 10-5 by 8-color flow cytometry 35% (188/543) in the VTD-Dara arm vs&#xD;
      23% (125/542) after 4 cycles of VTD in the intent-to-treat population), but also after&#xD;
      consolidation and before maintenance (MRD negativity rates at 10-5 by 8-color flow cytometry&#xD;
      63% in the VTD-Dara arm vs 43% in the VTD in the intent-to-treat population), translated into&#xD;
      a significant improvement in progression-free-survival (PFS) in the Daratumumab arm of the&#xD;
      study: 18-month PFS 93% vs 85% before maintenance, HR 0.47 (0.33-0.67), p &lt; 0.0001.&#xD;
      Cassiopeia is the first study showing a correlation between MRD negativity after induction&#xD;
      (before ASCT) and PFS benefit, in the setting of quadruplet combination induction. Based on&#xD;
      these results, VTD + daratumumab was recently approved by the FDA and EMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KRD has also been combined with Daratumumab in several phase 2 trials. Early results indicate&#xD;
      that this quadruplet combination might potentially be the most effective regimen prior to&#xD;
      ASCT in terms of response and MRD-negativity rates. Carfilzomib was administered&#xD;
      intravenously weekly, on days 1, 8 and 15 of 28 day-cycles at the dose of 56 mg/m². Based on&#xD;
      70 patients, the MRD-negativity rate after four cycles of KRD-Daratumumab was 39% at a&#xD;
      detection level of 10-5 by next generation sequencing (NGS). The weekly KRD-Daratumumab&#xD;
      regimen was associated with low toxicity, and stem cell harvest was adequate. The rate of MRD&#xD;
      negativity in 42 patients further improved after single ASCT, to 67% and 43% at a detection&#xD;
      level of 10-5 and of 10-6 by NGS, respectively. Due to the short 7.9 months median follow-up&#xD;
      time at the time of presentation, no PFS data were presented. At ASCO 2020, Weisel et al&#xD;
      reported the results of induction based on 6 cycles of KRD plus Isatuximab, in patients with&#xD;
      high-risk cytogenetics.8 In this interim analysis on the first 46 patients eligible for ASCT&#xD;
      with high-risk disease, the overall response rate was 100%, including 60% MRD negativity at&#xD;
      10-5 by NGS after induction and before ASCT. No death on study was reported. No data are yet&#xD;
      available regarding MRD negativity rates after ASCT or PFS. At ASH 2019, Landgren et al.&#xD;
      reported the results of eight weekly KRD-Daratumumab cycles without ASCT in a small phase 2&#xD;
      study on 41 patients after a short median follow-up time of 8.6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the same intent-to-treat basis, MRD-negativity rate at a detection level of 10-5 by NGS&#xD;
      was 61% and 65% in patients after six and eight cycles, respectively, including a very good&#xD;
      partial response (VGPR) rate or better of 85% after 8 cycles and an overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) of 100%. No death on study was seen. At the time of the report, no patient with&#xD;
      MRD-negative disease had progressed. Despite the short follow-up time, based on the high rate&#xD;
      of MRD-negativity and the 0% relapse rate achieved so far with this quadruplet combination,&#xD;
      the authors of this small phase 2 series now propose to systematically delay ASCT in patients&#xD;
      with standard-risk disease. This provocative recommendation requires validation in a phase 3&#xD;
      randomized trial comparing frontline versus delayed ASCT in patients with MRD-negative&#xD;
      disease after induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients MRD positive after quadruplet induction are at higher risk of disease progression.&#xD;
      For patients with high-risk (HR) disease, tandem ASCT has been proposed in order to improve&#xD;
      PFS and overall survival (OS). In an integrated analysis of four phase III studies&#xD;
      independently conducted by HOVON/GMMG, IFM, PETHEMA/GEM and GIMEMA European cooperative&#xD;
      groups, in the era of Bortezomib-based induction regimens, double ASCT significantly improved&#xD;
      PFS and OS in HR patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the EMN02/HO95 study, in centers with a policy of double ASCT, patients were assigned to&#xD;
      receive VMP (Bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone), single ASCT (ASCT-1) or two planned ASCTs&#xD;
      (ASCT-2) to prospectively compare ASCT-1 with ASCT-2. Patients who received ASCT-2 had a&#xD;
      prolonged PFS compared to those who received ASCT-1. Importantly, ASCT-2 overcame the adverse&#xD;
      prognosis conferred by high-risk cytogenetics. In the same study, OS from the first&#xD;
      randomization was significantly prolonged with ASCT-2 as compared with ASCT-1, a benefit also&#xD;
      seen in subgroups of patients with adverse prognosis, including those with R-ISS stage II+III&#xD;
      and high-risk cytogenetics. To date, no prospective trial has compared single vs tandem ASCT&#xD;
      in HR patients in the era of quadruplet induction combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ASCT, a systematic maintenance is recommended by International Guidelines. Lenalidomide&#xD;
      is approved in this setting, and proposed until progression. Other agents or combinations are&#xD;
      under evaluation for maintenance, such as Ixazomib, Elotuzumab, Daratumumab or Isatuximab.&#xD;
      Iberdomide is a next generation cereblon targeting agent, with antitumor and&#xD;
      immunostimulatory activities in Lenalidomide- and Pomalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma.&#xD;
      This oral agent, which could be the ideal agent for maintenance therapy, is currently tested&#xD;
      after ASCT. Phase 2 and 3 randomized studies are currently investigating the combination of&#xD;
      Lenalidomide with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies as maintenance therapy after autologous&#xD;
      stem cell transplant. We assume that a fixed duration of maintenance using Iberdomide and&#xD;
      Isatuximab will induce a high-rate of sustained MRD negativity.&#xD;
