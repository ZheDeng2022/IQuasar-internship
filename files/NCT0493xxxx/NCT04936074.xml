  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is characterized by neck pain, neck stiffness,&#xD;
      weakness, paresthesia, sphincter disturbance and balance disorder. The mean age for symptoms&#xD;
      is 64 years and more men than women, 2.7:1, are affected. The most common level is C5-C6. DCM&#xD;
      is the predominant cause of spinal cord dysfunction in the elderly worldwide. Surgical&#xD;
      options include stand-alone laminectomy, laminectomy and fusion and laminoplasty. The&#xD;
      preferable surgical approach is though, a matter of controversy. The objective of this study&#xD;
      is to compare stand-alone laminectomy to laminectomy and fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter randomized, controlled, parallel group non-inferiority trial. A total&#xD;
      of 300 adult patients are allocated in a ratio of 1:1. The primary endpoint is need of&#xD;
      supplementary fixation within 5 years of follow-up and the primary outcome measure is&#xD;
      improvement in P-mJOA. Sample size and power calculations were performed to detect the&#xD;
      minimal clinically important difference of 2 points in mJOA with a threshold of 1 in mild&#xD;
      (mJOA &gt;14), 2 in moderate (mJOA 12-14) and 3 in severe myelopathy (mJOA &lt;12). Consistency&#xD;
      between P-mJOA and mJOA is demonstrated with identical mean scores and a SD of 1.5 together&#xD;
      with a strong agreement of 0.83 with the use of intraclass correlation coefficient and the&#xD;
      Spearman correlation. Secondary outcomes are the NDI, EQ-5D, NRS for neck and arm pain, HADS,&#xD;
      patient's global assessment and development of kyphosis. Clinical and radiological follow-up&#xD;
      is performed 3, 12, 24 and 60 months after surgery. Main inclusion criteria is 1-4 levels of&#xD;
      DCM in the subaxial spine, C3-C7, with or without deformity. The REDcap will be used for safe&#xD;
      data management. Data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first randomized controlled trial comparing two of the most common surgical&#xD;
      treatments for DCM; the posterior muscle-preserving selective laminectomy and posterior&#xD;
      laminectomy with instrumented fusion. The results of the MyRanC study will provide surgical&#xD;
      treatment recommendations for DCM. This may result in improvements in surgical treatment and&#xD;
      clinical practice regarding DCM.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is characterized by neck pain, neck stiffness,&#xD;
      weakness, paresthesia, bowel and/or bladder disturbances and balance difficulties. The mean&#xD;
      age for symptoms is 64 years of age, more men than women, 2.7:1, are affected and the most&#xD;
      common level is C5-C6. DCM is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in the elderly&#xD;
      worldwide and the incidence is 41 per million within North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCM is typically the consequence of degenerative disc herniation, osteophyte formation and&#xD;
      hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum that compress the spinal cord. Ossification of the&#xD;
      posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), which is more prevalent in the Asian population, may&#xD;
      also cause compression of the spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With non-operative treatments, i.e. medication and physiotherapy, 20-60% of the patients&#xD;
      deteriorate neurologically and surgical treatment is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing knowledge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A posterior approach is often used in the elderly with severe neurological deficits, when&#xD;
      several levels are involved, in patients with OPLL and in the presence of vertebral&#xD;
      subluxation or spondylolisthesis. When propensity score matching is performed on the basis of&#xD;
      MRI classification and description of the degenerative changes in each patient, there is no&#xD;
      difference between anterior or posterior decompression and fusion approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It remains a matter of debate among spinal surgeons whether posterior fusion is mandatory or&#xD;
      not, in posterior decompression for DCM. After reports of post-laminectomy kyphosis in the&#xD;
      1970s and 1980s prophylactic fusion has commonly been added to the decompression. On the&#xD;
      other hand, non-instrumented posterior muscle-preserving selective laminectomy retains the&#xD;
      facet integrity as well as the extensor musculature and is observed to maintain sagittal&#xD;
      balance after surgery without any progression of kyphosis. Although both methods are widely&#xD;
      used, they are yet to be compared in a randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exists a controversy among spinal surgeons regarding the need for posterior fusion when&#xD;
      cervical posterior decompression for degenerative myelopathy is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that posterior decompression without fusion results in shorter&#xD;
      hospital stay and quicker return to an active life, without reduced patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      functional scores or delayed kyphosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed to assess&#xD;
      differences in the subsequent degenerative changes including spondylolisthesis, kyphosis and&#xD;
      adjacent segment pathology (ASP) to compare the two strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, data from this study can be used to identify risk factors for poor outcome to&#xD;
      guide surgical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform a non-inferiority study comparing posterior laminectomy alone with&#xD;
           laminectomy and fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate differences in outcome including surgical complications, patient&#xD;
           satisfaction, functional scores and late degenerative changes including&#xD;
           spondylolisthesis, kyphosis and ASP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uppsala University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ryhov Hospital, Jönköping&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The binary outcome &quot;re-operation with fixation&quot; within a 5-year follow-up period is the&#xD;
      primary outcome in the study. Since all patients in the control group will be subjected to&#xD;
      fixation together with laminectomy in the first surgery, investigators calculated power for a&#xD;
      non-inferiority study with a binary outcome. From previous studies the rate of re-operation&#xD;
      with fixation after laminectomy only was estimated to 2%. Investigators determined that&#xD;
      excluding a &gt;5% rate of reoperation for fixation was a clinically relevant target for the&#xD;
      study, and therefore set the non-inferiority limit at 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators used the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = (Φ-1(α) + Φ-1(β))2 × (πF × (100 - πF) + πL × (100 - πL)) / (πF - πL - d)2 where: Φ-1 =&#xD;
      cumulative distribution function α = significance level = 0.05 β = beta = 0.2 (power = 1- β =&#xD;
      80%) πF = % stable cervical spine in the group undergoing primary fixation = 100% πL = %&#xD;
      stable cervical spine in the group undergoing laminectomy only = 98% d = non-inferiority&#xD;
      limit = 5% This resulted in a required sample size of 270 patients in total randomized to&#xD;
      either laminectomy + posterior fixation or laminectomy only. The figure was increased by 10%&#xD;
      and rounded to 300 patients to allow for drop outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power to detect differences in the other primary outcome, the continuous score of mJOA was&#xD;
      calculated. The MCID as well as the standard deviation (SD) differ between severe 3/18&#xD;
      points, moderate 2/18 and mild 1/18 myelopathy. Even with a conservative estimate of the&#xD;
      standard deviation at 3 points, 300 included patients results in 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      one-point difference between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was determined with the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = (Φ-1(α/2) + Φ-1(β))2 × 2 × σ2 / (μF - μL)2 where: Φ-1 = cumulative distribution function&#xD;
      α = significance level = 0.05 β = beta = 0.2 (power = 1-β = 80%) σ = standard deviation = 3&#xD;
      μF - μL = mean difference between group = 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with degenerative cervical myelopathy referred for surgical&#xD;
      consultation to the orthopedic or neurosurgery departments at the participating centers will&#xD;
      be eligible for the study. Patients may be enrolled if they meet the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are allocated through randomization without stratification in a 1:1 ratio using&#xD;
      the REDcap (Research Electronic Data Capture)*, after informed consent and agreement to be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *(project-redcap.org) (redcap.vanderbilt.edu)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial participants will not be blinded after assignment to interventions as they have online&#xD;
      access to their medical records by a centrally managed system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded by using a coding system for the&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires including baseline questionnaires and PROMS will be distributed to the&#xD;
      participants preoperatively. Postoperatively the participants are routinely followed in&#xD;
      Swespine* and follow-up questionnaires and PROMS will be retrieved from Swespine.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Closing statement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degenerative cervical myelopathy is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in the&#xD;
      elderly worldwide and the incidence is 41 per million within North America. Until now there&#xD;
      is no consensus whether to fuse or not when decompression is performed and the choice of&#xD;
      surgical method is mainly up to the surgeon's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first randomized controlled trial comparing two of the most common surgical&#xD;
      treatments for cervical degenerative myelopathy; the posterior muscle-preserving selective&#xD;
      laminectomy and posterior laminectomy with instrumented fusion.&#xD;

    <description>Muscle-preserving selective laminectomy is performed with a posterior midline incision and longitudinal dividing of the nuchal fascia. The spinous process is split using a high-speed drill/ultrasound knife and without disturbing the bilateral deep extensor muscles the spinous process is divided at its base. Laminectomy is performed with a width no more than 2-3 mm wider than the spinal cord. The bilateral facet joints are not exposed. Finally, the split fragments of the spinous process are sutured together.</description>

    <description>Posterior decompression and fusion is performed with a midline incision over the appropriate levels defined as the same levels as the extension of laminectomy plus one level above and below but not extending beyond C3-C7. Soft tissue dissection and retraction is performed to identify osseous landmarks. Special care is taken to spare muscle attachments on C2 and C7. Spinal instrumentation is performed with lateral mass or pedicle screws (C3-C7) combined with rod fixation. Laminectomy is performed with a width not extending more than 2 mm outside the dural borders. Facet joint injury should be avoided. Special care is taken to spare the C7 spinous process and distal half of C7 lamina. The sagittal alignment is corrected before spinal fixation. No collar or restrictions will be used in either group.</description>
