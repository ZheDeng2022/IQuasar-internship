  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of NB003 administered orally in patients&#xD;
      with advanced GIST who have progressed on or had an intolerability to imatinib and other&#xD;
      standard of care (SoCs) or refused other SoCs, and patients with an advanced malignancy other&#xD;
      than Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)that harbors KIT(CD117) or platelet derived growth&#xD;
      factor receptor（PDGFRa) gene alteration who have relapsed or have refractory disease without&#xD;
      an available effective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of a dose escalation phase to determine the MTD and the RP2D and an&#xD;
      expansion phase to further explore the safety and efficacy of NB003.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients currently receiving medications or herbal supplements known to be strong&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients currently receiving acid-reducing agents and are unable to stop use at least&#xD;
             2 weeks prior to the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Spinal cord compression or brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases which in the Investigator's&#xD;
             opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which&#xD;
             would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
