  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, controlled, randomized Phase 3 trial evaluating 12-month kidney function in&#xD;
      highly sensitized (cPRA ≥99.9%) kidney transplant patients with positive crossmatch against a&#xD;
      deceased donor, comparing desensitization using imlifidase with standard of care&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo pre-screening to determine eligibility for study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an organ offer is received, a virtual crossmatch (vXM) is performed. If the crossmatch&#xD;
      is considered predictive of a positive flow cytometry crossmatch (FCXM), the patient will be&#xD;
      evaluated if eligible to receive the desensitization currently in use at the study site.&#xD;
      Subsequently the patient will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the imlifidase or the control&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is randomized to the imlifidase arm, the organ will be accepted and shipped,&#xD;
      and the patient will proceed to imlifidase treatment (generally within 24 h prior to&#xD;
      transplantation) followed by transplantation. If the patient is randomized to the control&#xD;
      arm, transplantation made possible by the local desensitization regimen will occur. If the&#xD;
      institution-specific desensitization protocol is deemed not to be successful, the organ offer&#xD;
      will be turned down, and the patient will remain active on the waiting list and remain in the&#xD;
      trial, while the kidney will be allocated to another recipient through the kidney allocation&#xD;
      system (KAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All transplanted patients will receive induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppression.&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be assessed 12 months after randomization as&#xD;
      the primary endpoint reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit in patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with donor specific antibodies (DSA) are at risk of developing antibody-mediated&#xD;
      rejection (AMR). Imlifidase removes DSA quickly and efficiently at the time of&#xD;
      transplantation but, as with other desensitization methods, the antibodies are expected to&#xD;
      re-occur after transplantation. In the imlifidase treatment arm, and for desensitized control&#xD;
      arm patients, protocol kidney biopsies will be performed at the time of transplantation and&#xD;
      at 1 year after transplantation.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>eGFR is a measure of kidney function and will be compared between treatment arms.&#xD;
eGFR will be calculated based on p-creatinine according to the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation.&#xD;
eGFR for a kidney with normal function is 90 mL/min/1.73m2. Kidney disease is characterised by a decreased eGFR value. For randomized patients who do not undergo transplantation, lose their graft or die before 12 months, eGFR will be set to zero, consistent with kidney failure.</description>
