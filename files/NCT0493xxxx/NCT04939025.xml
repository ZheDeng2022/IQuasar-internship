      The objective of this quality improvement project is to increase the one year anastomotic&#xD;
      integrity rate in patients having had completion proctectomy and pouch reconstruction for&#xD;
      Ulcerative Colitis by the routine and quality controlled implementation of a&#xD;
      multi-interventional program thereby improving long-term pouch function and survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disorder that affects predominantly young&#xD;
      patients interfering with their social, family and professional life's (Ungaro, Mehandru,&#xD;
      Allen, Peyrin-Biroulet, &amp; Colombel, 2017). When the disease is moderate to severe, it is&#xD;
      difficult to control medically even in the era of the biologic treatment. Colectomy rates are&#xD;
      reported to be as high as 50% after 5 years in patients admitted with a severe exacerbation&#xD;
      (Duijvis et al., 2016; Thorne et al., 2016). In a modified two (colectomy first followed by&#xD;
      completion proctectomy and pouch) or three stage procedure (colectomy first followed by&#xD;
      completion proctectomy and pouch with diverting ileostomy, finally stoma closure) a&#xD;
      proctocolectomy is done and continuity can be restored with a ileoanal pouch (Sahami,&#xD;
      Buskens, et al., 2016; Zittan et al., 2016). These are the preferred options for the majority&#xD;
      of our patients. Alternatives are proctocolectomy with definitive end-ileostomy or a&#xD;
      continent ileostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life of patients with pouches depends predominantly on proper function of the&#xD;
      pouch. Inadequate function and long term pouch failure are determined by the occurrence of&#xD;
      chronic anastomotic leaks, chronic pouchitis and a delayed diagnosis of Crohn's disease in&#xD;
      and around the pouch (Lightner et al., 2017). The latter two diagnoses, Crohn's disease and&#xD;
      chronic pouchitis are in an important number in fact misdiagnosed chronic leaks (Garrett et&#xD;
      al., 2009; van der Ploeg, Maeda, Faiz, Hart, &amp; Clark, 2017). Long-term pouch failure rates&#xD;
      (pouch excision or secondary diversion of the pouch) add up to more than 1 out of 10 at 10&#xD;
      years (Ikeuchi et al., 2018; Lightner et al., 2017; Mark-Christensen et al., 2018). These&#xD;
      data represent the results of expert centers, so real life data are probably worse. Chronic&#xD;
      leaks are late sequalae leaking anastomosis which has been inadequately treated; misdiagnosed&#xD;
      or diagnosed too late to treat successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many centers publish more favorable figures, the true rate of anastomotic leakage of&#xD;
      ileoanal pouches probably varies from 10-20% (Sahami, Bartels, et al., 2016; Sossenheimer et&#xD;
      al., 2019; Widmar et al., 2019). There is an important underreporting of the leaks. If the&#xD;
      pouch is diverted, the leak will only become apparent prior to ileostomy closure when the&#xD;
      anastomosis is tested. Even testing the anastomosis is not 100% accurate accounting for a&#xD;
      number of misdiagnosed leaks. These misdiagnosed and delayed diagnosed leaks are generally&#xD;
      not included in series reporting short term results (Santorelli, Hollingshead, &amp; Clark, 2018;&#xD;
      Sossenheimer et al., 2019; Widmar et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons it is of great importance to prevent anastomotic leakage when creating&#xD;
      a ileoanal pouch and if it happens, to solve the problem as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous risk factors have been identified for anastomotic leakage. The most important&#xD;
      factors are tension on the anastomosis, inadequate vascularization of the pouch, an&#xD;
      unfavorable microbiome and the use of immunosuppressive drugs (steroids, immunomodulators,&#xD;
      biologic treatments). By staging the restorative proctocolectomy, the negative impact of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs on anastomotic healing are avoided because at the time of the pouch&#xD;
      creation the drugs are weaned for a long period. Other factors including anastomotic&#xD;
      technique and anastomotic perfusion are modifiable surgical factors. A more recently&#xD;
      described pathophysiological mechanism relates to the intestinal microbiome (Alverdy, Hyoju,&#xD;
      Weigerinck, &amp; Gilbert, 2017). Apparently, this holds true for small bowel surgery as well&#xD;
      (Lesalnieks, Hoene, Bittermann, Schlitt, &amp; Hackl, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper management of a leak comprises early diagnosis and immediate and adequate management.&#xD;
      Sequential CRP measurement and early investigation of the integrity of the anastomosis are&#xD;
      key for early diagnosis, particularly in a diverted anastomosis which might not be&#xD;
      symptomatic (Adamina et al., 2015; Warschkow et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current management of the leak usually involves a diverting ileostomy, if not performed&#xD;
      primarily, in combination with passive drainage of the abscess cavity via transanal or&#xD;
      transcutaneous route. This approach showed to be relatively ineffective leading to a pouch&#xD;
      failure rate of 20%, and if resolved to a worse pouch function (Garrett et al., 2009;&#xD;
      Lightner et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endosponge vacuum assisted closure (EVAC) of the anastomotic leak on the contrary showed to&#xD;
      have a very high success rate and to prevent long-term pouch dysfunction and failure&#xD;
      (Bemelman &amp; Baron, 2018; Gardenbroek et al., 2015; Verlaan et al., 2011; Weidenhagen,&#xD;
      Gruetzner, Wiecken, Spelsberg, &amp; Jauch, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is minimal risk to patients as there is no introduction of a novel technique, rather&#xD;
      this study is an amalgamation of published improvements in pouch surgery pre, intra and&#xD;
      post-operatively to reduce the leak rate at one year.&#xD;
