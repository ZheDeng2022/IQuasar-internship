  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain reliable and interpretable data to inform future&#xD;
      trials regarding our hypothesis that a novel, liquid aspirin formulation can mitigate COVID&#xD;
      -19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) . The potential impact is to reduce COVID-19 related&#xD;
      hospitalization within 30 days of diagnosis due to (1) pulmonary events including respiratory&#xD;
      failure; (2) cardiac events including myocardial infarction and myocarditis (3) venous or&#xD;
      arterial thrombotic events; (4) acute renal insufficiency or failure.&#xD;

      200 people will take part in this LSUHSC-NO and its affiliates study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical site will offer study enrollment to newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis. Contact information will be shared with study team in a HIPAA compliant&#xD;
      manner on the same day. Within 24 hours, our Study staff will contact patient for recruitment&#xD;
      and enrollment. Within 48 hours of enrollment, the patient will come to a study site for&#xD;
      randomization to treatment arms, to be provided a no-cost supply of the treatment which they&#xD;
      are assigned, and for blood draws that help determine their risk of developing severe COVID&#xD;
      disease. Patients will be assigned to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Or&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Treatment with liquid aspirin 150 mg daily. (ASA 150).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will follow-up every 2 days for a total of 30 days by text/phone/telemedicine to&#xD;
      monitor changes in their health status, hospitalization rates, and encourage adherence to the&#xD;
      treatment arm. Between days 7 and 10 of the study, patients will undergo repeat blood draws&#xD;
      to help ensure their safety with regards to COVID-19. If they become hospitalized due to&#xD;
      COVID-19, their participation will extend until they are discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
      Medical records will be reviewed to collect data including demographics, medical&#xD;
      comorbidities, laboratory data and hospitalization course. After 30 days of treatment, weekly&#xD;
      follow up for another 30 days will take place ensure no late, adverse events occurred.&#xD;
