    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the effect of a novel patient-centered, reproductive planning&#xD;
      decision support tool developed by the research team called MyPath on postpartum&#xD;
      contraceptive decision-making among women with SUDs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The reproductive health needs of women with substance use disorders (SUDs) are unmet. Over&#xD;
      80% of pregnancies among women with SUDs are unintended, compared to 45% of the general&#xD;
      population, and over 20% of women with SUDs have had a short interpregnancy interval (i.e. â‰¤&#xD;
      18 months after a previous birth). Adverse reproductive health outcomes are perpetuated by&#xD;
      contraceptive decisions that are inconsistent with women's reproductive goals. In an&#xD;
      evaluation of women in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, only half of sexually active&#xD;
      women not wanting to get pregnant used contraception, with condoms the most frequent method&#xD;
      used. Pregnancy is a unique opportunity to address contraceptive needs due to increased&#xD;
      healthcare access and expanded Medicaid eligibility, increased access to highly effective&#xD;
      methods such as long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and enhanced motivation to avoid&#xD;
      rapid, repeat pregnancy. Despite this, over 75% of women with OUD do not use postpartum&#xD;
      contraception and less than 2% receive LARC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no effective strategies to improve postpartum contraceptive&#xD;
      decision-making for women with SUDs. As an initial step to address this gap, the&#xD;
      investigators conducted an observational study of postpartum contraceptive choices among 194&#xD;
      women with OUD at our maternity hospital (Plan NOW). Per usual care, women were provided with&#xD;
      information about all contraceptive options, consistent with &quot;information-based&quot; counseling,&#xD;
      and access to all methods including immediate postpartum LARC. Several findings informed this&#xD;
      proposal. First, women's postpartum contraceptive decisions were often inconsistent with&#xD;
      their childbearing goals. Among women who did not want another child, 36% did not choose a&#xD;
      highly effective method and 10% had a repeat pregnancy within one year. Second, women had&#xD;
      limited contraceptive knowledge and frequent misconceptions about their fertility and&#xD;
      vulnerability to pregnancy. Third, women's decisional autonomy regarding sex and&#xD;
      contraception was often threatened due to ongoing illicit drug use and reproductive coercion&#xD;
      by partners. Fourth, women who wanted another baby did not feel supported and often felt&#xD;
      pressured to choose a highly effective method. Therefore, failure to frame contraceptive&#xD;
      decisions within the larger reproductive health context of women with OUD was a major barrier&#xD;
      to high quality decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to help women with SUDs make informed decisions about their&#xD;
      reproductive health that align with their preferences, values and reproductive goals. Our&#xD;
      objective in this application is to determine the effect of a novel patient-centered,&#xD;
      reproductive planning decision support tool developed by the research team called MyPath on&#xD;
      postpartum contraceptive decision-making among women with SUDs. Designed to facilitate&#xD;
      high-quality decisions regarding pregnancy and contraception, MyPath helps women a) review&#xD;
      their thoughts about pregnancy and children, b) learn about fertility and preconception&#xD;
      health and c) prioritize their preferences for various contraceptive method characteristics&#xD;
      (e.g. effectiveness, side effects). As such, MyPath uses a patient-centered approach to help&#xD;
      women frame their contraceptive decisions in the context of their goals and health and is a&#xD;
      critical first step towards addressing reproductive health inequities among women with SUDs.&#xD;
      Our overarching hypothesis is that patient-centered, reproductive planning decision support&#xD;
      will facilitate high quality decision-making and thus improve postpartum contraceptive&#xD;
      utilization and reproductive health outcomes among women with SUDs. To test this hypothesis,&#xD;
      the investigators propose a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial, guided by the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess the effect of patient-centered, reproductive planning decision support (MyPath)&#xD;
      on postpartum contraceptive utilization and reproductive health outcomes among women with&#xD;
      SUDs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine if the relationship between MyPath and contraceptive utilization is mediated&#xD;
      by decision quality. Decision quality will be measured using four patient-centered components&#xD;
      of decision-making: knowledge, values concordance, decisional conflict and involvement. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that improvements in decision quality will mediate the relationship&#xD;
      between MyPath and contraceptive utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Identify barriers and facilitators to integrating MyPath into routine postpartum&#xD;
      clinical care. The investigators will gather process evaluation data during the randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) and conduct qualitative interviews with key patient, provider and&#xD;
      health system stakeholders to identify potential barriers and facilitators to future&#xD;
      implementation in maternity settings and routine postpartum clinical care, if MyPath is found&#xD;
      to be effective.&#xD;
