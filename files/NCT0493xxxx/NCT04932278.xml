  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SCAT5 symptom evaluation score</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom evaluation score is a self-reported measure of the participants' post-concussion symptoms. Participants are scored on Total Number of Symptoms (ranges 0 to 22) and Symptom Severity Score (ranges 0 to 132). Higher scores represent worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Head position tracking accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks from injury</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be seated in an upright position with their upper body secured to a backrest and will wear a head harness with an attached position sensor. The angular position of the head will be displayed on a monitor 1 meter in front of the participants and they will be asked to follow a moving target by moving their head. Accuracy will be determined by taking the difference between the target position signal and the actual head position.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Head force tracking accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks from injury</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be seated in an upright position with their upper body secured to a backrest and will be asked to generate force with their head against a fixed pad. The pad will be attached to a load cell that monitors how much force is being generated by their head. The force level will be displayed on a monitor 1 meter in front of the participants and they will be asked to follow a moving target by generating force with their head. Accuracy will be determined by taking the difference between target force signal and the actual head force.</description>

    <intervention_name>Osteopathic manipulative treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is hands-on care provided by an osteopathic physician (D.O.). During osteopathic manipulative treatment, an osteopathic physician may move participants' muscles and joints using osteopathic techniques including stretching, gentle pressure and resistance, as well as thrust techniques that apply a quick, therapeutic force of brief duration that travels a short distance.</description>
