  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unrecognized abdominal and pelvic injuries can result in catastrophic disability and death.&#xD;
      Sporadic reports of &quot;occult&quot; injuries have generated concern, and physicians, fearing that&#xD;
      they may miss such an injury, have adopted the practice of obtaining computed tomography on&#xD;
      virtually all patients with significant blunt trauma. This practice exposes large numbers&#xD;
      patients to dangerous radiation at considerable expense, while detecting injuries in a small&#xD;
      minority of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing data suggest that a limited number of criteria can reliably identify blunt injury&#xD;
      victims who have &quot;no risk&quot; of abdominal or pelvic injuries, and hence no need for computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT), without misidentifying any injured patient. It is estimated that nationwide&#xD;
      implementation of such criteria could result in an annual reduction in radiographic charges&#xD;
      of $75 million, and a significant decrease in radiation exposure and radiation induced&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to determine whether &quot;low risk&quot; criteria can reliably identify patients who&#xD;
      have sustained significant abdominal or pelvic injuries and safely decrease CT imaging of&#xD;
      blunt trauma patients. This goal will be accomplished in the following manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blunt trauma victims undergoing computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis in the&#xD;
      emergency department will undergo routine clinical evaluations prior to radiographic imaging.&#xD;
      Based on these examinations, the presence or absence of specific clinical findings (i.e.&#xD;
      abdominal/pelvic/flank pain, abdominal/pelvic/flank tenderness, bruising abrasions,&#xD;
      distention, hip pain, hematuria, hypotension, tachycardia, low or falling hematocrit,&#xD;
      intoxication, altered sensorium, distracting injury, positive FAST imaging, dangerous&#xD;
      mechanism, abnormal x-ray imaging) will be recorded for each patient, as will the presence or&#xD;
      absence of abdominal or pelvic injuries. The clinical findings will serve as potential&#xD;
      imaging criteria. At the completion of the derivation portion of the study the criteria will&#xD;
      be examined to find a subset that predicts injury with high sensitivity, while simultaneously&#xD;
      excluding injury, and hence the need for imaging, in the remaining patients. These criteria&#xD;
      will then be confirmed in a separate validation phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria will be considered to be reliable if the lower statistical confidence limit for&#xD;
      the measured sensitivity exceeds 98.0%. Potential reductions in CT imaging will be estimated&#xD;
      by determining the proportion of &quot;low-risk&quot; patients that do not have significant abdominal&#xD;
      or pelvic injuries.&#xD;

      RESEARCH STRATEGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injuries to the abdomen and pelvis can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in adult&#xD;
      blunt trauma patients. Clinicians, concerned about abdominal and pelvic injuries, have&#xD;
      increasingly utilized abdominal-pelvic (A/P) CT imaging of blunt trauma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT imaging is compelling because of its documented high sensitivity in detecting injuries,&#xD;
      and has lead some to recommend &quot;pan-scan&quot; imaging, which includes head, neck, chest and A/P&#xD;
      CT imaging, of all blunt trauma patients. However, well-designed comparative trials have&#xD;
      repeatedly failed to demonstrate improved patient outcomes thorough the use of&#xD;
      &quot;pan-scanning&quot;. It is hard to justify routine imaging if there is no benefit, particularly&#xD;
      since A/P CT imaging is expensive and exposes patients to ionizing radiation and risk of&#xD;
      lethal malignant transformation. As a consequence, recent recommendations emphasize the use&#xD;
      of selective imaging in assessing most trauma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, there are no definite recommendations to guide selective A/P CT imaging&#xD;
      of blunt trauma patients. In current practice, imaging decisions are typically based on&#xD;
      clinical judgment, which suffers from poor specificity and substantial variability, making it&#xD;
      an imprecise and unreliable tool. A rigorously develop decision instrument could provide&#xD;
      substantial benefit in guiding selective A/P CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decrease in CT utilization by as little as 10% would translate to substantial, direct,&#xD;
      long-term benefits. There were approximately 1.5 million blunt trauma activation visits at&#xD;
      the 1,632 adult trauma centers in the United States in 2015. Nearly half of these patients&#xD;
      underwent abdominal-pelvic CT imaging, implying that nation-wide approximately 750,000 blunt&#xD;
      trauma patients undergo A/P CT imaging each year. If a decision instrument could allow&#xD;
      clinicians to safely forego at least 10% of these CTs, up to 75,000 CTs could be eliminated&#xD;
      annually in the U.S. This reduction would provide cost and resource savings, reduced&#xD;
      radiation exposure and iatrogenic cancers in the young vulnerable trauma population, and&#xD;
      facilitate more efficient trauma evaluations, translating to shorter ED length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will employ the classic design strategy described by Stiell in developing the&#xD;
      decision instrument. The development process includes separate derivation and validation&#xD;
      phases. The clinical criteria identified in the derivation phase will form the basis of the&#xD;
      instrument, with &quot;high-risk&quot; classification assigned to patients exhibiting one or more of&#xD;
      the criteria, and &quot;low-risk&quot; classification assigned to patients who exhibit none of the&#xD;
      criteria. Investigators will then conduct a separate validation assessment to determine&#xD;
      whether the instrument retains optimal performance among a new cohort of patients. The&#xD;
      validation phase will focus on ensuring that the final instrument has the high sensitivity&#xD;
      and negative predictive value (NPV) needed to ensure its safe application, while retaining&#xD;
      the highest possible specificity (and potential to decrease imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study will be to develop an instrument that reliably identifies&#xD;
      patients who have injuries of major clinical significance that are evident on A/P CT imaging.&#xD;
      The injuries of interest in this goal include injuries that require intervention, as well as&#xD;
      any injuries to the aorta (including those not requiring intervention), and select injuries&#xD;
      to the spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary goal of the study will be to develop a tool that reliably identifies patients&#xD;
      who have injuries of major or minor clinical significance. The injuries of interest related&#xD;
      to this goal include injuries that require intervention, injuries that merit clinical&#xD;
      observation, any injuries to the aorta, and select injuries to the spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be clinically reliable, the DI must exhibit a sensitivity and negative predictive value of&#xD;
      98% or greater. At this level of precision, the risk of unfavorable outcomes due to missed&#xD;
      injuries is equivalent to the risk of lethal malignant transformation from the radiation&#xD;
      exposure associated with increased imaging. Validating a 95% lower confidence bound of 98.0%&#xD;
      for a measured NPV of 100.0% requires evaluations on 183 patients assigned &quot;low risk&quot; status&#xD;
      by the instrument. Similar validation of the sensitivity requires evaluations on 183 patients&#xD;
      who have sustained injuries of major clinical significance. Because &quot;low risk&quot; patients are&#xD;
      more prevalent than those sustaining major injuries, the ultimate sample estimate is driven&#xD;
      by the need to enroll 183 patients who have sustained major A/P injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Derivation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians will assess the presence or absence of each of the candidate criteria for each&#xD;
      imaged patient during their initial emergency department evaluation. These assessments will&#xD;
      be recorded prior to initiating CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injury status of each patient will be based on final radiologic interpretation of the&#xD;
      initial A/P CT imaging obtained in the ED. Investigators require that relevant injuries be&#xD;
      evident on CT imaging because the risk classification assigned by the instrument is&#xD;
      immaterial if an injury is not visible on CT imaging. Injuries will be further classified as&#xD;
      being of major, minor, or insignificant concern based on review of the patients care during&#xD;
      their index visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three level injury classification reflects the fact that many clinicians are comfortable&#xD;
      in missing minor injuries provided that all injuries requiring intervention are identified,&#xD;
      while other clinicians are uncomfortable using tools that occasionally miss minor injuries&#xD;
      that require no intervention, and seek to identify all injuries regardless of their clinical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accommodate these perspectives, investigators will employ identical techniques to develop&#xD;
      a two separate decision instruments. The first, and primary goal of the study, is to develop&#xD;
      an instrument that identifies all injuries requiring intervention, while a second goal is to&#xD;
      create an instrument that identifies all significant injuries, whether they require&#xD;
      intervention or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will employ binary recursive partitioning to derive the decision instruments.&#xD;
      The primary instrument must exhibit a sensitivity and negative predictive value greater than&#xD;
      98.0% in detecting and excluding major injuries. The second instrument must exhibit similar&#xD;
      sensitivity and NPV in detecting and excluding major and minor injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, investigators will apply the instruments to a new cohort of&#xD;
      blunt trauma patients to assess their performance and determine whether they retain&#xD;
      sufficient sensitivity to support their use as A/P CT decision tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians will again document the presence or absence of criteria during their initial&#xD;
      emergency department evaluations, and record their impressions prior to imaging.&#xD;
      Investigators will base the presence or absence of injury on the final radiologic&#xD;
      interpretation of the initial A/P CT imaging obtained in the ED. Injuries will be further&#xD;
      classified as being of major, minor, or insignificant concern based on review of the patients&#xD;
      care during their index visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the sensitivity of the instrument in classifying as &quot;high-risk&quot;&#xD;
      all patients harboring injuries of major importance. Investigators will also calculate the&#xD;
      NPV, specificity, and count the number of &quot;low-risk&quot; patients for whom imaging might have&#xD;
      been safely omitted had the decision instrument been implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will be to perform a similar analysis focused on identifying patients&#xD;
      with injuries major or minor clinical significance, and will measure the sensitivity, NPV,&#xD;
      specificity, and potential to reduce imaging using this additional version of the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians will assess the status of the individual criteria during their initial emergency&#xD;
      department evaluations and prior to ordering CT imaging. Investigators will record&#xD;
      demographic information for each patient, along with the clinician assessments of the&#xD;
      presence or absence of potential predictor variables. The potential predictor variables&#xD;
      include abdominal pain or tenderness, flank pain or tenderness, pelvic pain or tenderness,&#xD;
      hip or iliac pain or tenderness, midline lumbar spine or sacral pain, abnormal alertness,&#xD;
      evidence of intoxication, distracting painful injury, and hypotension. Investigators will&#xD;
      also record historical information and emergency department vital signs measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection during the validation phase will follow a similar process, but will be&#xD;
      limited to demographic information and the criteria that compose the decision instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of significant major or minor injuries will be based on final radiologic&#xD;
      interpretation of the initial CT imaging obtained in the ED. The classification into major or&#xD;
      minor status will be based on review of the patients care during their index visit to&#xD;
      determine whether the patient underwent any interventional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All injury assessments will be completed by trained investigators blinded to criteria&#xD;
      assessments and final classification by the decision instrument. Investigators require that&#xD;
      relevant injuries for the study must be evident on CT imaging because risk classification&#xD;
      assigned by the instrument is immaterial if an injury is not visible on CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injuries of major clinical significance consist of all abdominal and pelvic injuries&#xD;
      requiring intervention, as well as any injury to the aorta, and any injury to the spine&#xD;
      involving instability or neurological compromise. Injuries that require only observation, but&#xD;
      no intervention, will be considered clinically minor, provided they do not involve the aorta&#xD;
      or spine, while injuries that required neither intervention nor observation, and that do not&#xD;
      involve the aorta or spine will be considered insignificant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulation of the optimal A/P CT decision instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will treat each individual criterion as a dichotomous variable. For analytic&#xD;
      purposes in the derivation phase, each variable will be considered negative (normal) unless&#xD;
      it can be assessed and found to be abnormal. Thus, variables that cannot be measured in an&#xD;
      individual patient (such as coagulopathy in an unconscious individual) will be documented as&#xD;
      &quot;unable to assess&quot; and treated statistically as negative. This will ensure that the&#xD;
      derivation process is based on observed assessments and is as robust as possible.&#xD;
      Investigators will use the individual criteria to construct the nodal points of the recursive&#xD;
      partitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will employ binary recursive partitioning to identify a combination of&#xD;
      candidate criteria that predicts significant abdominal-pelvic injuries with &gt; 98.0%&#xD;
      sensitivity, excludes significant injuries with &gt; 98.0% NPV, and retains the greatest&#xD;
      specificity. Sensitivity will be used as the outcome measure for constructing the partitions.&#xD;
      Investigators will terminate the partitioning under the following circumstances: 1)&#xD;
      partitioning produces an instrument exhibiting a sensitivity of 100.0%, 2) partitioning&#xD;
      exhausts all patients without developing a sufficiently sensitive rule, 3) partitioning&#xD;
      exhausts all variables (criteria) without identifying a sufficiently sensitive rule.&#xD;
      Circumstance I will confirm the hypothesis driving the first specific aim. Circumstance 2 and&#xD;
      3 may confirm the first hypothesis, provided the lower confidence limit of for the&#xD;
      sensitivity of the resultant rule exceeds 98.0%, otherwise these circumstances will be&#xD;
      interpreted to refute the first hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will create two distinct decision instruments. The first, and primary&#xD;
      instrument will focus on identifying only those patients having injuries of major clinical&#xD;
      significance. Investigators will also develop a second instrument that identifies patients&#xD;
      having injuries of either major or minor significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of the A/P CT decision instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation phase will again treat each individual criterion as a dichotomous variable.&#xD;
      Each variable will be considered negative (normal) only if it is assessed and found to be&#xD;
      normal. Variables that cannot be measured in an individual patient (i.e. coagulopathy in an&#xD;
      unconscious individual) will be documented as &quot;un-assessable&quot; and treated statistically as&#xD;
      positive. This ensures that patients will be assigned low-risk status only if all criteria&#xD;
      are adequately assessed and found to be negative. Patients will be excluded from low-risk&#xD;
      classification (and assigned high-risk status) if they have one or more positive or&#xD;
      un-assessed criteria. This requirement ensures patients are not assigned low-risk status on&#xD;
      the basis of an inadequate assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the final risk assignments and patient outcomes, investigators will assign each case to&#xD;
      one of the following four categories: 1 - true-positive status (injured patients classified&#xD;
      as &quot;high-risk&quot; by the DI); 2 - false-negative status (injured patients classified as&#xD;
      &quot;low-risk&quot; by the DI); 3 - false-positive status (uninjured patients classified as&#xD;
      &quot;high-risk&quot; by the DI); and 4 - true-negative status (uninjured patients classified as&#xD;
      &quot;low-risk&quot; by the DI). Investigators will employ these values to calculate point measures and&#xD;
      95 percent confidence intervals for sensitivity, NPV and specificity of the decision&#xD;
      instrument. Investigators will consider the instrument to be validated if the lower 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval for its measured sensitivity exceeds 98.0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing the potential to decrease A/P CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators must assess whether application of the tool to blunt trauma patients actually&#xD;
      has the potential to decrease A/P CT imaging. Because of the tool's inherent sensitivity,&#xD;
      &quot;low risk&quot; patients will be free of injury and receive no benefit from imaging. They are&#xD;
      ideal candidates to exclude from imaging. Thus, measuring the proportion of &quot;low-risk&quot;&#xD;
      patients will provide the investigators with an estimate of potential imaging reductions.&#xD;
      Reductions in charges and radiation exposure will be determined by respectively summing&#xD;
      radiographic charges and life-time decreases in radiation morbidity and mortality for all &quot;no&#xD;
      risk&quot; cases.&#xD;
