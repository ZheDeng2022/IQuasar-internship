  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous seroprevalence survey showed very high seroprevalence levels among residents of&#xD;
      the two among the residents of the two migrant workers' hostels surveyed, indicating a high&#xD;
      level of circulation of the virus SARS-COV-2 during the 1st wave of COVID-19. The&#xD;
      constitution of a cohort after the event would be an opportunity to obtain opportunity to&#xD;
      obtain answers to crucial questions: duration of immunity, potential reinfections potential&#xD;
      reinfections, potential re-clustering. Going back to check the serological status seems&#xD;
      feasible, especiallyespecially in the Foyers de Travailleurs Migrants (high probability of&#xD;
      finding the participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an obvious scientific interest around the duration of immunity and reinfections in a&#xD;
      population highly exposed during the first wave. Several articles document the decline of IgG&#xD;
      antibodies in the months following an infection, but very few infection, but very few&#xD;
      evaluate the protective character in the medium term (&gt;=6 months), especially in asymptomatic&#xD;
      individuals. We are also concerned about the circulation of We are also concerned about the&#xD;
      circulation of new variants and the immunity acquired after infection in residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no study on the duration of immunity has been conducted in migrant worker's&#xD;
      residences.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The research team will develop a range of activities to disseminate the study findings. These dissemination activities will be coordinated by MSF and Epicentre. The results will be presented in an internal report and an external report for the Ministry of Health (MoH), the French National Public Health Agency and Institute Pasteur.&#xD;
An abstract of the findings will be submitted for presentation at a scientific conference, and at least one manuscript will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.&#xD;
The findings of the survey will also be used for advocacy purposes, in coordination with community leaders of participating communities.&#xD;
The results of the survey (lay version of the report), and their possible use for advocacy / communication, will be shared with the staff, resident representatives and residents of the MWRs, whether or not they actually participated in the study.</ipd_description>
