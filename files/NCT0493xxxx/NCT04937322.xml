      Bile duct cancer and pancreatic cancer are cancers that cannot be surgically removed. As the&#xD;
      cancer grows, it blocks the drainage of the bile ducts that carry digestive juices from the&#xD;
      gallbladder and pancreas to the small intestine. ERCP (endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography) is often prescribed during which a tube with a tiny camera attached&#xD;
      is inserted through the subject's mouth and advanced to a place in the small intestine where&#xD;
      the bile duct empties. Through this scope the doctor enlarges the ducts with tiny balloons&#xD;
      and places plastic or metal stents (straws) that help keep the bile ducts open so they can&#xD;
      drain properly. However, due to the cancer, the stents are blocked eventually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this registry is to record information and evaluate the impact of endoscopic&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) probes in improving the management of bile duct cancer or&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer by ablating the tissue in the bile duct(s) before the stent(s) are&#xD;
      implanted. By using radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat the tissue in the duct(s) prior to&#xD;
      stent(s) insertion, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may delay tumor growth&#xD;
      and the time before the stent lumen becomes blocked. Thereby, allowing increased periods&#xD;
      between the need for intervention and further stent implantation(s). The registry will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of RFA procedures conducted for pancreatico-biliary&#xD;
      disorders&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bile duct cancer and pancreatic cancer are cancers that cannot be surgically removed. As the&#xD;
      cancer grows, it blocks the drainage of the bile ducts that carry digestive juices from the&#xD;
      gallbladder and pancreas to the small intestine. ERCP (endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography) is often prescribed during which a tube with a tiny camera attached&#xD;
      is inserted through the subject's mouth and advanced to a place in the small intestine where&#xD;
      the bile duct empties. Through this scope the doctor enlarges the ducts with tiny balloons&#xD;
      and places plastic or metal stents (straws) that help keep the bile ducts open so they can&#xD;
      drain properly. However, due to the cancer, the stents are blocked eventually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this registry is to record information and evaluate the impact of endoscopic&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) probes in improving the management of bile duct cancer or&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer by ablating the tissue in the bile duct(s) before the stent(s) are&#xD;
      implanted. By using radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat the tissue in the duct(s) prior to&#xD;
      stent(s) insertion, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may delay tumor growth&#xD;
      and the time before the stent lumen becomes blocked. Thereby, allowing increased periods&#xD;
      between the need for intervention and further stent implantation(s). The registry will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of RFA procedures conducted for pancreatico-biliary&#xD;
      disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of various radio frequency ablation probes have been assessed in a&#xD;
      series of studies. This multi-center registry has been initiated since June 2011 and is&#xD;
      ongoing until June 2017:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the immediate and post procedure clinical performance of radio frequency&#xD;
           ablation in a &quot;real world&quot; patient population requiring stent implantation for&#xD;
           pancreatico-biliary disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immediate and 6 months post procedure adverse event rate in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of RFA on the life expectancy of patients suffering from&#xD;
           pancreatico-biliary malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design at Coordinating Center - Weill Cornell Medical College Primary site (WCMC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study entails review of data from a database protocol [IRB # 1104011642 : collected for&#xD;
      non-research related purposes]. The purpose of this protocol is to establish a database that&#xD;
      captures all Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Ultrasound and&#xD;
      Interventional endoscopy cases. Its objective is to assess prospectively the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of these routine procedures to permit identification of technical details about the&#xD;
      procedures or other factors, which might be associated with outcome or results. Assessment of&#xD;
      these details would help us with problem identification and recommendations to improve health&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life in these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will review and document:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients who have had Interventional Endoscopy procedures done which involved radio&#xD;
           frequency ablations for pancreatico-biliary disorders since June 2011 and extending&#xD;
           forward through June 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be reviewed and collected from database protocol IRB # 1104011642.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No subject intervention is involved in this study. Subject contact is not needed for&#xD;
           database review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design at Secondary sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will review and document:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients who have had Interventional Endoscopy procedures done which involved radio&#xD;
           frequency ablations for pancreatico-biliary disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No subject intervention is involved in this study. Subject contact is not needed for&#xD;
           retrospective review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These sites would have IRB approved protocols to collect and send radio frequency&#xD;
           ablation procedure data to the primary site (WCMC). Additionally, the secondary study&#xD;
           sites would mention WCMC as an entity that could receive PHI in their prospective&#xD;
           protocols and consent/HIPAA forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All secondary study sites' IRB approvals will be sent to the primary/coordinating study&#xD;
           center at WCMC. The primary center will then forward these IRB approvals to WCMC IRB as&#xD;
           soon as they are received from the secondary study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relevant IRB documentation will be maintained at both primary and secondary sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry Hosting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinating center and primary site (WCMC) will host the registry on the local servers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secure Data management or Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be used for data entry,&#xD;
      compilation and querying.&#xD;
