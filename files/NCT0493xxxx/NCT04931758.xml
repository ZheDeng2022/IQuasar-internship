  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with chronic low back pain, the Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire (FreBAQ)&#xD;
      measures the duration and intensity of pain and functional limitations. The FreBAQ is a&#xD;
      simple tool created to assess disturbances in the body representation of the back, and the&#xD;
      only one existing in chronic low back pain. It is a 9-item self-questionnaire in which each&#xD;
      item is measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Never (score of 0)&quot; to &quot;Always&#xD;
      (score of 4)&quot;. It assesses neglect, perceived body image of the back, accuracy in&#xD;
      proprioceptive perception of back movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychometric properties of the FreBAQ in English, Japanese, Dutch, Turkish and German are&#xD;
      validated and acceptable; however, they have never been studied in French and no validated&#xD;
      version of this questionnaire in French exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators hypothesize that the French version of the FreBAQ has good&#xD;
      psychometric qualities, allowing it to be used in the French chronic low back pain&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
