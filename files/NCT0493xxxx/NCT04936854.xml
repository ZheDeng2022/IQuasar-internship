  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Sirolimus is more effective and burdened&#xD;
      with less side effects than conventional treatment with corticosteroids in patients with&#xD;
      active thyroid eye disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grave's disease is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. Thyroid eye disease is&#xD;
      affecting nearly 50% of patients with Grave's disease. European guidelines recommend treating&#xD;
      patients with serious TED in the acute face with intravenous steroids for 12 weeks. This&#xD;
      treatment is burdened with metabolic complications, like raised blood pressure, high blood&#xD;
      glucose, worsening of diabetes, osteoporosis, and weight gain. In addition, peptic ulcer and&#xD;
      psychological disturbances are frequently seen. Long-term treatment with high doses of&#xD;
      steroids could also suppress the corticotropic axis for a variable time period, giving&#xD;
      temporary iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency. It is paramount to develop a treatment with equal&#xD;
      or better effect and fewer complications for this group of patients. Recently, Teprotumumab,&#xD;
      which act by inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), has been introduced in&#xD;
      treatment of TED. This represents a new area in the anti-inflammatory treatment of the&#xD;
      disease. The anti-inflammatory effect of Sirolimus has not been examined in patients with&#xD;
      TED, but there are two promising case-reports describing excellent response. Sirolimus have&#xD;
      multiple immunosuppressive actions that may be favourable in the inflammatory response in&#xD;
      TED. These are: inhibiting T-cell activation, anti-fibroblast effect and blocking the IGF-1&#xD;
      pathway. In contrast to other immunosuppressive drugs, Sirolimus is associated few side&#xD;
      effects at low doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are planning a comparative study of conventional treatment&#xD;
      (corticosteroids) compared with Sirolimus, regarding clinical outcomes and adverse effects.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to include a total of 60 patients (30 in each group) with moderate to&#xD;
      severe TED over a period of approximately 3 years.&#xD;
