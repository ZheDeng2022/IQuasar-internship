  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a prospective, observational, exposure cohort design to examine&#xD;
      pregnancy and infant outcomes in women and infants who are exposed to siponimod during&#xD;
      pregnancy to treat MS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of each outcome in women exposed to siponimod and their infants will be&#xD;
      compared to those observed in two unexposed comparator groups: a disease-matched comparison&#xD;
      group of women who have not used siponimod during pregnancy (unexposed disease-matched&#xD;
      comparison group), and a comparison group of healthy women who do not have diagnosis of MS,&#xD;
      have not had exposure to a known human teratogen, and have not taken siponimod in pregnancy&#xD;
      (healthy comparison group). Pregnant women exposed to siponimod who do not meet the&#xD;
      prospective cohort criteria will also be followed as part of an exposure series. All&#xD;
      participants will be recruited via voluntary participant registration following informed&#xD;
      consent by the pregnant woman for her participation. Participants may withdraw from the study&#xD;
      at any time.&#xD;
