  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study assesses the feasibility of an implantable myoelectric prosthesis control system to&#xD;
      control a transradial prosthesis. Implantable Myoelectric Sensors (IMES) will be implanted&#xD;
      into the residual forearm muscles of three transradial amputee subjects. These devices&#xD;
      wirelessly transmit electrical muscle signals to an electromechanical prosthetic wrist and&#xD;
      hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a two-week recovery from implantation of up to 16 IMES into residual forearm&#xD;
      muscles, subjects will begin a two week training phase. When they receive their custom-fit&#xD;
      IMES Transradial Prosthesis (including electromechanical wrist and hand) subjects initiate&#xD;
      approximately four months of home use. Subjects will be offered up to five post-study&#xD;
      follow-up visits. The usability and functionality of the prosthetic system will be evaluated&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The measure will be carried out 11 times during the study, at Baseline with the subject's own device for comparison, and at 10 study visits with the investigational device conducted over approximately 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-drafted assessment of accuracy in prosthesis movements. The purpose of this measure is to quantify subjects' ability to use the investigational device to control specific prosthetic movements. When performing the Accuracy Test, the subject attempts to execute a series of specified wrist and hand movements using the investigational device. An objective rater scores each movement on a 0-3 scale with 0 = no movement observed and and 3 = movement observed (with no unintended movements). A score is given for each movement and a combined score is derived from the complete set of movements.&#xD;
Administered as a repeated measure, the Grip Accuracy test assesses Change over time (training effect).</description>
