  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the end-expiratory occlusion test in infants or children has never been evaluated as&#xD;
      a marker of preload dependence. It therefore appears clinically relevant to evaluate this new&#xD;
      indicator to predict fluid responsiveness in all infants hospitalized in pediatric and&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the hemodynamic effects of a&#xD;
      15-second end-expiratory occlusion were able to predict fluid responsiveness in the&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated infant or newborn in pediatric intensive care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Volume expansion remains one of the first resuscitation treatments for states of shock.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the decision to perform volume expansion should be based on a &quot;functional&quot;&#xD;
      hemodynamic assessment, i.e., filling should only be performed if changes in cardiac preload&#xD;
      result in significant changes in stroke volume. This is then referred to as preload&#xD;
      dependency. Unnecessary volume expansion induces fluid overload and is associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality for shock conditions in infant and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, several studies in adults and children have demonstrated the lack of&#xD;
      effectiveness of so-called &quot;static&quot; preload variables as witnesses of preload dependence.&#xD;
      Only &quot;dynamic&quot; preload variables, based on the notion of cardiopulmonary interaction during&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, can predict this preload dependence, however with very variable&#xD;
      sensitivities and specificities depending on the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-expiratory occlusion test is a dynamic preload dependency test that can be performed&#xD;
      in patients on invasive ventilation. The test consists in interrupting the ventilator at&#xD;
      end-expiration for 15 seconds, delaying the next insufflation thus allowing an increase in&#xD;
      venous return to the right heart and then to the left heart. If the heart is preload&#xD;
      dependent, an increase in venous return is accompanied by an increase in stroke volume and&#xD;
      cardiac output (Franck-Starling's law). Volume expansion is usually considered effective or&#xD;
      positive if cardiac output increases by more than 15% from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the end-expiratory occlusion test in infants or children has never been evaluated as&#xD;
      a marker of preload dependence. It therefore appears clinically relevant to evaluate this new&#xD;
      indicator to predict fluid responsiveness in all infants hospitalized in pediatric and&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care.&#xD;

      mechanically ventilated infant or newborn in pediatric intensive care.&#xD;
