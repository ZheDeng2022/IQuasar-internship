    <textblock>
      COVAC Uganda is a study that is looking at the use of an innovative self-amplifying RNA&#xD;
      (saRNA) vaccine (LNP-nCOV saRNA-02) against the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 and&#xD;
      assessing the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 antibody seronegative and seropositive&#xD;
      individuals. saRNA is designed to amplify the quantity of RNA upon injection to produce&#xD;
      further antigen, thereby enabling lower doses for administration. In the trial &quot;COVAC1&quot;,&#xD;
      Imperial College London is currently evaluating one COVID-19 saRNA vaccine candidate in doses&#xD;
      from 0.1-10ug for individuals who are seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline.&#xD;
      Interim analyses of COVAC1 has shown a dose dependent response; however, up to 50% of&#xD;
      seronegative participants receiving doses of 2.5-10ug do not seroconvert. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that a lack of seroconversion is due to type I and III interferon (IFN)&#xD;
      production, which can inhibit translation and degrade cellular mRNA. Another variable that&#xD;
      can enhance antibody production is serological history: recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      seropositive individuals respond significantly better than naïve individuals who received the&#xD;
      Pfizer or Moderna RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, designing the saRNA backbone to&#xD;
      dampen IFN production and evaluating this in individuals seropositive at baseline will inform&#xD;
      the optimised use of this innovative technology. In COVAC Uganda, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      test an saRNA vaccine modified to dampen the activation of type I and III IFN, to increase&#xD;
      antibody production, for individuals who are seronegative and seropositive for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      antibodies at baseline, to evaluate whether people with pre-existing seropositivity have&#xD;
      enhanced immune responses compared to those without. This trial is NOT looking at whether or&#xD;
      not the vaccine is effective in terms of protection. It is just assessing whether and how&#xD;
      well the immune system responds based on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline and its safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background The ongoing pandemic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans in China sometime between October to November 2019, and the&#xD;
      disease coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in China in December&#xD;
      2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of January 2021, SARS-CoV-2 had infected with confirmed diagnosis over 106 million&#xD;
      people worldwide, resulting in over 2.3 million deaths and over 59 million people recovered&#xD;
      from infection. This yields a nominal infection fatality rate (IFR) of ~2%, and around 10% of&#xD;
      infected people have been left with health effects lasting for 6 months or more. As of 8&#xD;
      March 2021, Uganda had reported 40,452 coronavirus cases and 334 deaths. Through COVAX,&#xD;
      Uganda started rolling out the AstraZeneca vaccine (adenoviral based) from 10 March 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The developing assessment is that the only way the world can exit from the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      is through the deployment of an effective vaccine. A number of vaccines have been developed&#xD;
      and received emergency use authorization by the United States Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      and/or the World Health Organization. Examples include Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna's&#xD;
      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccines which have both shown efficacy at 95%;&#xD;
      Oxford-AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Johnson and Johnson's adenovirus based vaccines&#xD;
      which have demonstrated efficacies of 70% and 66% respectively. The problem comes with the&#xD;
      scale needed and the time frame in which vaccines need to be developed and deployed. A&#xD;
      self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine provides a novel, feasible, and time-sensitive solution&#xD;
      to contribute to addressing the SARS-CoV-2 problem, either during the current pandemic or for&#xD;
      ongoing seasonal epidemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have demonstrated that nucleic acid-based vaccination can protect against viral&#xD;
      infections in non-human primate (NHP) studies, providing proof of concept that gene-based&#xD;
      vaccination can induce protective antibodies. However, DNA vaccines require multiple&#xD;
      immunizations with the use of electroporation to induce significant immune responses in&#xD;
      humans. Non-replicating mRNA-based therapeutics typically require high doses of RNA (100-600&#xD;
      µg). The requirement for high doses, and associated cost, suggest non-replicating mRNA may&#xD;
      struggle to produce the potential hundreds of millions of doses required to rapidly respond&#xD;
      to a pandemic. In contrast, small animal and non-human primate (NHP) experiments suggest that&#xD;
      saRNA induces significantly enhanced responses in comparison to either DNA vaccines delivered&#xD;
      with electroporation or mRNA. Indeed, a single immunization with a saRNA vaccine has shown&#xD;
      protection against Ebola virus in animal models. Should a ≤10 µg dose of saRNA provide&#xD;
      protection from COVID-19, this would provide critical advantages for manufacturing where&#xD;
      100,000 doses can by synthesized in a one liter reaction volume. In contrast to viral&#xD;
      vectors, lack of anti-vector immunity provides the opportunity for repeat immunizations with&#xD;
      multiple RNA-encoded immunogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first generation saRNA vaccine (LNP-nCoV-saRNA) is already undergoing safety assessment&#xD;
      in humans in the COVAC1 trial in the United Kingdom. The safety of this first generation&#xD;
      saRNA vaccine has been assessed initially in healthy young adults i.e., 15 participants aged&#xD;
      18-45 years, given one of three different doses (0.1, 0.3 and 1 µg) by injection into the&#xD;
      muscle, going slowly from the lowest to the highest over a period of several weeks. To date,&#xD;
      there have been no reported serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with this vaccine and a&#xD;
      low frequency of Grade 2 events. An additional 35 volunteers have been randomized across each&#xD;
      dose. To date, 105 healthy subjects have received two immunizations across each dose, with&#xD;
      few Grade 2 events. All participants have safely received both doses. Initial assessment of&#xD;
      the first 15 subjects indicates that although the vaccine shows a good safety profile, the&#xD;
      levels of seroconversion (75% for the 1ug dose) and binding antibody are lower than&#xD;
      anticipated from preclinical models. Indeed, data generated to date suggest responses are at&#xD;
      the lower end of a dose response curve. An additional expansion phase has been initiated to&#xD;
      explore three higher doses 2.5, 5 and 10ug. The disconnect between human immune response to&#xD;
      the vaccine and preclinical models suggests that the level of saRNA expression in humans is&#xD;
      less effective than in small animal models. Current data indicate that 5ug dose administered&#xD;
      at 0 and 4 weeks induces an acceptable immune response to most (83%) individuals 4-weeks post&#xD;
      2nd vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have improved on this initial design (COVAC1) with the modified vector,&#xD;
      LNP-nCOV saRNA-02, which is to be investigated within this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study (COVAC Uganda) will evaluate an innovative saRNA vaccine (LNP-nCOV saRNA-02)&#xD;
      designed to increase vaccine potency by shielding the saRNA from cellular proteins known to&#xD;
      reduce saRNA expression. The investigators anticipate the safety profile of the modified&#xD;
      vaccine to be highly similar to the first generation vaccine already undergoing human trials.&#xD;
      COVAC Uganda will use the same assessment criteria as the COVAC1 study designed to see how&#xD;
      well the immune system has been activated using different dose levels of the modified&#xD;
      vaccine. COVAC Uganda will also enrol SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals to evaluate the&#xD;
      immune response based on serological history. Seronegative and seropositive participants aged&#xD;
      18-45 will be given one dose of 5.0 ug at 0 weeks and 4 weeks. Seronegative is defined as IgG&#xD;
      ≤ 10 AU mL-1 or IgM ≤ 10 AU mL-1, and seropositive is defined as IgG ≥ 10 AU mL-1 or IgM ≥ 10&#xD;
      AU mL-1. The vaccine is given by injection into the muscle of the upper arm. There are likely&#xD;
      to be mild side-effects near to the injection site. As observed in COVAC1, there may also be&#xD;
      more general side-effects such as headache, temperature and chills. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to record any symptoms in a vaccine diary. In order to see how well the immune system&#xD;
      is responding, participants will need to give blood samples several times during the first 6&#xD;
      weeks; then monthly for a few months; then at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict that the modified vaccine will induce higher levels of neutralising&#xD;
      antibodies than the first generation saRNA vaccine. However, if any of the doses do not&#xD;
      induce an adequate immune response, there is no known reason why participants who received&#xD;
      those doses could not be offered a further booster immunisation with LNP-nCOV saRNA-02 at a&#xD;
      dose that has been shown to be safe. Also there is no known reason why participants in COVAC&#xD;
      Uganda could not be immunised with other approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including vectored or&#xD;
      adjuvanted vaccines, should they be shown to be safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale This SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected over 106 million people and killed over&#xD;
      2.3 million people. As a novel zoonotic virus, no herd immunity is present and the only&#xD;
      widely available interventions to date are social distancing to reduce pressure on intensive&#xD;
      care beds and health systems, but this is not sustainable for economic reasons. Clinical&#xD;
      trials of antivirals and other drug therapies are ongoing but the intervention most likely to&#xD;
      mitigate the long-term medical, social and economic impact of the pandemic remains&#xD;
      population-wide immunisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite successfully approved COVID-19 vaccines being rolled out, substantially more&#xD;
      candidates are needed to supply 4.265 billion doses for the world's healthcare workers,&#xD;
      adults &gt;65 age, and people at higher risk (with co-morbidities such as diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity or chronic respiratory disease), let alone doses for&#xD;
      younger or healthier cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggests that immune responses to messenger RNA vaccines is enhanced for&#xD;
      individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2. This trial investigates the role of&#xD;
      seroconversion on the impact of a self-amplifying RNA vaccine candidate, and it will inform&#xD;
      on the possible application of LNP-nCOV saRNA-02 as a COVID-19 booster candidate for&#xD;
      previously infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical data suggest that the LNP-nCOV saRNA-02 vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilised&#xD;
      version of the S-glycoprotein will elicit neutralising antibodies in a higher proportion of&#xD;
      individuals than natural infection (&lt;50%), and that the LNP-nCOV saRNA-02 vaccine may provide&#xD;
      increased immunogenicity and/or dose reduction over the first generation construct as well as&#xD;
      for seropositive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a phase I clinical study which will build on clinical experience using&#xD;
      the LNP nCoV saRNA vaccine currently under evaluation in COVAC1 in the UK. The trial will be&#xD;
      conducted in 18-45 year olds in a single centre supervised by the Chief/principal&#xD;
      Investigator, by allocating 42 participants into two groups, based on seroconversion status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population The study will be conducted in healthy young adults as these individuals&#xD;
      generate the most robust responses (18-45 years). Both male and female participants will be&#xD;
      included and the trial site will attempt to keep an equal proportion, although the priority&#xD;
      will be to ensure timely accrual to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and Admiration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will each receive one IM dose of 5 ug of LNP-nCOV saRNA-02, into the deltoid&#xD;
      muscle at Week 0 and Week 4 as indicated in the table below:&#xD;

      Safety Evaluations Vaccines are associated with a number of well-characterized local,&#xD;
      systemic and laboratory reactions referred to as solicited adverse events. These adverse&#xD;
      events will be purposively collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local and systemic assessments will take place on the day of each injection before the&#xD;
      injection, and 60 minutes after the injection. Participants should remain at the clinic for&#xD;
      at least one hour after each injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with Vaccine diary cards to assist collection and grading of&#xD;
      adverse events that start within 7 days of the injection. Study staff will go through the&#xD;
      list of solicited adverse events in a structured interview and record these together with&#xD;
      grade on the appropriate eCRF in the REDCap database. If any of the events reported at one of&#xD;
      the phone visits are moderately severe (grade 2) or worse, participants will be invited to&#xD;
      the clinic for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (~10 mL) for routine safety parameters will be collected at all study visits. If the&#xD;
      total bilirubin is elevated, study staff will request a result for conjugated bilirubin in&#xD;
      order to grade the abnormality and determine any action to be taken with respect to further&#xD;
      investigation and interruption to the vaccine schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs (BP, HR, oxygen saturation and oral temperature) will be measured at every study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examinations of the injection site, and other body systems if indicated, will be&#xD;
      performed on the day of each vaccination, and 1 week after. Symptom-directed physical&#xD;
      examinations will be performed at all other follow-up visits.&#xD;
