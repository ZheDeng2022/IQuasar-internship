    <textblock>
      Ketamine and Esketamine intravenous perfusions can modulate chronic pain. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if Ketamine or Esketamine are favorable for outpatients suffering from&#xD;
      fibromyalgia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine and Esketamine intravenous perfusions in Pain Clinic can modulate chronic pain and&#xD;
      are therefore part of the therapeutic arsenal of the Anesthesiologist in pain management.&#xD;
      Patients with fibromyalgia syndrome have elevated levels of glutamate in the brain. This is&#xD;
      demonstrated by functional brain imaging techniques. Elevation of glutamate is demonstrated&#xD;
      in the posterior insular cortex, positively correlating with lower pain thresholds which is a&#xD;
      hallmark of fibromyalgia syndrome. Ketamine has (e.a.) an inhibitory role of the&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor: it is a non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA&#xD;
      receptor. In this context, Esketamine is available recently. This is the levorotatory form of&#xD;
      Ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to measure if there is a difference between Ketamine and&#xD;
      Esketamine on patients with fibromyalgia syndrome via the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire&#xD;
      (FIQ) and measurement of side effects after intravenous perfusion. The fibromyalgia impact&#xD;
      questionnaire is a global assessment of symptoms: pain, function, fatigue, stiffness,&#xD;
      discomfort when walking up stairs, difficulties at work, anxiety, depression, days not worked&#xD;
      and days of good quality in the past week.&#xD;

    <description>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) completed by the patient. The FIQ was developed from information gathered from patient reports, functional status instruments, and clinical observations. This instrument measures physical functioning, work status (missed days of work and job difficulty), depression, anxiety, morning tiredness, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well-being over the past week. The score is between 0 and 100. In the severity analysis a FIQ total score from 0 to &lt; 39 was found to represent a mild effect, ≥ 39 to &lt; 59 a moderate effect, and ≥ 59 to 100 a severe effect.</description>
