  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),&#xD;
      is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract with unknown etiology. The&#xD;
      mechanism includes environment, genetics, intestinal microecology and immunity. In recent&#xD;
      years, the incidence of IBD in Asian countries has continued to rise, and the incidence of CD&#xD;
      and UC in Guangzhou has reached 1.09/10 million and 2.05/10 million respectively. The patient&#xD;
      suffers from the disease for a long time, which greatly affects the mentality and the quality&#xD;
      of life. However, the mentality and quality of life of IBD patients have not received the&#xD;
      attention they deserve, and research in this area is relatively lacking. The study by Lewis&#xD;
      et al. found that among IBD patients, up to 1/3 of depression patients and 2/3 of anxiety&#xD;
      patients were not diagnosed in time. This study conducted an Internet questionnaire survey on&#xD;
      IBD patients diagnosed in the Department of Gastroenterology, the Second Affiliated Hospital&#xD;
      of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, to learn about the patients 'mental and&#xD;
      psychological state, to screen the risk factors of patients'mental and psychological&#xD;
      diseases, and to understand the impact of mental and psychological factors on the quality of&#xD;
      life and quality of IBD patients. The impact of the disease provides a scientific basis for&#xD;
      the optimal treatment of IBD.&#xD;
