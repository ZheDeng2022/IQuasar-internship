      The important role of Emotion Regulation (ER) in managing stress and anxiety is well&#xD;
      recognized. Aims: 1) To assess the level of Anxiety, and the level of difficulties in emotion&#xD;
      regulation (DER) among University Students, 2) to investigate the effect of emotional&#xD;
      regulation training on anxiety of university Students during COVID-19. Methods: in Part I, we&#xD;
      assessed 863 students for their anxiety, DER, impact of COVID-19. In part II, 200 students&#xD;
      were recruited and randomly assigned to either a group that received emotion regulation&#xD;
      training and or to a control group. The intervention group was trained about emotion&#xD;
      regulation and problem solving during eight 90-min sessions. The students completed Beck&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and DERS before and after the intervention.&#xD;
