    <measure>Palpitation with Heyisheng Type Symptoms Scale in Mongolian Medicine</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is to record the symptoms of palpitation with Heyisheng Type in Mongolian Medicine, which is also usually seen in cardiac neurosis. This scale includes two domain: the primary symptoms and the secondary symptoms. The domain of the primary symptoms includes palpitations, chest tightness, chest pain, insomnia, and restlessness using the evaluating 4-Grade scales (Normal:0; Mild:3; Moderate:6 and Severe:9), while the domain of the secondary symptoms includes dizziness, like to sigh, easy to startle, tinnitus, blurred vision, fatigue, sweating, irritability, using the evaluating 4-Grade scales (Normal:0; Mild:1; Moderate:2 and Severe:3).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac autonomic nervous function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The cardiac autonomic nervous function was evaluated by detecting the difference in heart rate per minute between standing and lying positions using RR interval in lead Ⅱ ECG.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac Neurosis Symptom Self-rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This self-rating scale was used to evaluate the main symptoms in cardiac neurosis, including palpitations, chest tightness, chest pain, hyperhidrosis, insomnia, irritability, with each symptom evaluated via a 4-grading scale (normal:0 points, mild: 1 point, moderate: 2 points, severe:3 points</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Self-rating depression scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) which was designed by Zung was adopted to assess participants' symptoms of depression during the past week. The SDS assesses depressive symptoms on a four-point scale ranging from &quot;a little of the time&quot; (value = 1) to &quot;most of the time&quot; (value = 4). The standard score is equal to the integer portion of 1.25 times the total score. The standard score of SDS is interpreted as: normal (≤52), mild (53-62), moderate (63-72), and severe (≥73).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS is a 20-item measure developed to assess the frequency of anxiety symptoms based on diagnostic conceptualizations. It consists primarily of somatic symptoms. The respondent indicates how often he or she has experienced each symptom on a 4-point Likert scale consisting of &quot;one or a little of the time&quot; (coded as 1), &quot;some of the time&quot; (coded as 2), &quot;good part of the time&quot; (coded as 3), and &quot;most or all of the time&quot; (coded as 4). Items 5, 9, 13, 16, and 19 are reversed scored and total scores on the SAS range from 0 to 80.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI comprises 19 self-evaluation items, among which 18 items generate 7 components. Each component is graded from 0 to 3, and the cumulative score of each component is the total score of PSQI, which ranges from 0 to 21.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consumption of estazolam</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>If the patient has a moderate or above anxiety and depression state and is intolerable, he could be given a short-term sedative and hypnotic drug,estazolam, and the frequency and dose of estazolam should be recorded in the patient's diary</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>hs-CRP is used to evaluate the level of systemic inflammation in the patients with cardiac neurosis.</description>
