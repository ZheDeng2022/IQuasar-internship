        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On continuous antiretroviral therapy and virologically suppressed HIV infection for&#xD;
             ≥12 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4 T-cell count &gt; 350 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between the ages ≥ 40 years of age to &lt;≤75&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented cardiovascular disease (1. Prior myocardial infarction, 2. History of&#xD;
             percutaneous coronary intervention, 3. History of coronary artery bypass graft OR 4.&#xD;
             Angiographic evidence of &gt;50% stenosis in at least one coronary artery] OR 1 CVD risk&#xD;
             factor (T2DM, current smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hsCRP≥2mg/L, family&#xD;
             history)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TBR of &gt;1.6 of the MDS of the carotid/aorta at baseline. This baseline arterial TBR&#xD;
             cutoff excludes the rare individual that lacks appreciable arterial inflammation. It&#xD;
             is notable that while 5-10% of uninfected individuals will have lower TBRs, it is rare&#xD;
             that an HIV infected individual will fall below this range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must either be of non-childbearing potential as defined by menopause&#xD;
             with amenorrhea for &gt;2 years, bilateral oophorectomy, or agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception throughout the study and for at least one month following termination&#xD;
             and have a negative pregnancy test at screening prior to the first dose of drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males must use at least one method of contraception throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant/nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes requiring insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST/ALT or alkaline phosphatase &gt;2x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cancer within the last 5 years with exception of squamous cell carcinoma and basal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nephrotic syndrome or eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytopenias which include 1) WBC &lt;3.5 x103/uL 2) Platelet &lt;120 x103/uL 3) ANC &lt;1.5&#xD;
             x103/uL, and absolute lymphocytes &lt;0.8 x 103/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anemia as fined by &lt;10 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of tuberculosis infection at screening within 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family history of long QT syndrome, using medication that prolongs QT internal, OR&#xD;
             evidence of prolonged QT of &gt;470 msec as evidenced by ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute systemic infection within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On additional immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapies&#xD;
