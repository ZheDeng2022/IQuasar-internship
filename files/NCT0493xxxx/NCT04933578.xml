    <description>The Faces Version of Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDASf), which is a psychometric dental anxiety scale for children with eight questions, was used to determine the dental anxiety levels of the children. The scores of each question are represented by varying cartoon faces according to emotions ranging from 1 'relaxed' to 5 'very anxious'. The total scores range from 8 to 40. The scores were categorized as not anxious (&gt;9), slightly anxious (9-16), fairly anxious (17-24), very anxious (25-32), and extremely anxious (33-40).&#xD;
the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) was administered to parents, differently from children. The MDAS has five questions. The scores of each question range from 1 'relaxed' to 5 'very anxious.' The total score ranges from 5 to 25.</description>
