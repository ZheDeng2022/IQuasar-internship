  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization ranks Saudi Arabia as having the 7th highest rate of type-2&#xD;
      diabetes in the world. This therefore makes diabetes the most challenging health problem&#xD;
      facing Saudi Arabia. Importantly, physical activity has been shown to improve disease&#xD;
      symptoms and overall health in patients with type-2 diabetes. However, findings relating to&#xD;
      the prevalence of physical inactivity in the Saudi population confirm that a sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle is on the rise, within physical inactivity levels in adults being 80.5%. Therefore,&#xD;
      interventions aimed at reducing physical inactivity using bespoke modalities pertinent to&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia are clearly warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research project is to undertake a feasibility randomised control trial,&#xD;
      examining the effects of a 12-week home-based physical activity programme on HbA1c, blood&#xD;
      lipids, fasting glucose and other indices of health-related quality of life in Saudi Arabian&#xD;
      adults with type-2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be asked to perform resistance exercises 3-times a week on alternating days for 12 weeks. Exercises will be performed with a TheraBand and will include the squat, lunge, press-up, cross body reach, reverse fly, lateral raise, biceps curl, triceps extension, frontal raise and bridge. In addition to the resistance exercises, the participants will perform aerobic exercise. They will be asked to download a specific exercise app to record the number of steps on day 1 of the intervention and participants who do not possess the required phone technology will be provided with a pedometer. They then will be asked to add 2000 steps on to their daily steps; this amount will then become their daily step goal. Once they have reached this goal on 4 out of 5 days, they will be asked to increase their new step step goal by an extra 500 per day.</description>
