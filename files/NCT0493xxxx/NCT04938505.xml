    <measure>social support as assessed by Sarason's Social Support Questionnaire 6-item (SSQ6)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after breast reconstruction</time_frame>
    <description>Social support is measured across 2 dimensions: support availability, through the number of contacts that the patient can count on (0 to 9 people) and quality of support, through patient satisfaction with support received. Each item represents a situation in which the patient may need support. Patient is asked to cite the number of people that she could count on in that particular situation. Concerning the second item, the patient is asked to assess satisfaction with the support provided. The scores are generated according to Sarason's recommendations. A score is calculated for each dimension. Support availability score is calculated as the sum of the number of people available for the 6 items, this score ranges from 0 to 54, with 54 representing the highest availability. The social support satisfaction score is calculated by the sum of the satisfaction of the 6 items. This score ranges from 6 to 36, with 36 representing the highest level of satisfaction</description>
