  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hemodynamic effect of the fluid challenge administration (FC) depends on different&#xD;
      variables related to the interplay between cardiac function and vascular tone response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the effect of adding a vasopressor to keep the arterial pressure between&#xD;
      predefined ranges may impact on the persistence of stroke volume (SV) changes after FC&#xD;
      administration. In fact, both the effect on arterial elastance and venous return may increase&#xD;
      the persistence of SV increase, which is know to drop to baseline pre-FC values within fw&#xD;
      minutes after FC administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-centre observational study, in elective patients scheduled for elective&#xD;
      laparotomy, hypothesizes that intraoperative norepinephrine infusion would prolong the effect&#xD;
      of FC administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The appropriate fluid management in the perioperative period is an important, and still&#xD;
      partially unclear, chapter of clinical practice for anaesthesiologists. Increasing evidence&#xD;
      suggests that intraoperative fluid therapy should be tailored to individual patient's&#xD;
      physiology with the purpose of targeting fluid administration to specific stroke volume (SV)&#xD;
      responses, or its surrogates. For this reason, small repeated and fast boluses challenging&#xD;
      the cardiovascular system should be preferred to continuous and prolonged infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluid challenge (FC) is defined as a small amount of fluid given in a short period of&#xD;
      time to assess whether the preload reserve of the patient can increase SV with further&#xD;
      administration of fluids. A number of studies performed in the operating room evaluated the&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects of FC solely considering the effect before and after the infusion.&#xD;
      Recently, Aya demonstrated that at least 4 ml kg-1 should be infused to effectively challenge&#xD;
      the preload, additionally showing that the hemodynamic effect of the FC is dissipated within&#xD;
      10 minutes, in both responders and in non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach of Aya et al. considers the FC as a drug evoking a systemic response on flow&#xD;
      (i.e. SV) and pressure variables [i.e. systolic arterial pressure (SAP)]. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effect is evaluated by considering the magnitude (i.e. the maximal changes&#xD;
      from baseline obtained for a specific variable), the global effect [i.e. considering the area&#xD;
      under the curve (AUC) obtained by plotting the changes overtime] and the persistence of the&#xD;
      hemodynamic response after the end of FC administration. The infusion time of FC&#xD;
      administration, which ranges in the literature between 5 and 30 minutes, may influence the&#xD;
      magnitude of SV response and, in turn, the amount of patients defined as fluid responders .&#xD;
      Since several intraoperative pathways of hemodynamic optimization are based on the response&#xD;
      to repeated FCs, a prolonged infusion time may potentially affect fluid responsiveness and,&#xD;
      in turn, wrongly drive intraoperative fluid management and eventually affect postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since FC is a test embedding at least three variables (i.e. the amount of fluid; the time&#xD;
      needed to complete the administration and the SV change threshold used to define a positive&#xD;
      response), the role of a one single component on the final outcome can be addressed only by&#xD;
      keeping fixed the others. Our group recently investigated the role of the infusion rate in a&#xD;
      multicentre study (under revision at the timing of writing this protocol) and our research is&#xD;
      now focused on the assessment of the role of the vascular tone in the persistence of the FC&#xD;
      effect overtime. The previous study demonstrated that the rate of infusion impact on FC&#xD;
      response, however another crucial issue is related to the persistence of the effect of the FC&#xD;
      on the SV. In fact, the SV is determined by the interplay between cardiac function and&#xD;
      arterial load. Diastolic filling depends on venous return, which is determined by the&#xD;
      &quot;stressed volume&quot; and venous compliance. Systolic cardiac function depends on both cardiac&#xD;
      factors and arterial load and is predominantly determined by arterial elastance (Ea) and&#xD;
      resistance. For this reason, the effect of a vasopressor (i.e. the norepinephrine, the most&#xD;
      widely used) may impact on the persistence of the increase of the SV after FC administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-centre observational study, in elective patients scheduled for elective&#xD;
      laparotomy, hypothesizes that intraoperative norepinephrine infusion would prolong the effect&#xD;
      of FC administration.&#xD;
