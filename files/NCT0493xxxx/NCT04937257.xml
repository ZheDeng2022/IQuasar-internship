    <textblock>
      All front-line healthcare workers in the United States must receive PPE training but there is&#xD;
      no gold standard for doing so(1). Training methods vary, with the conventional approaches&#xD;
      being in-person or video presentations (2). In-person, hands-on training tends to be&#xD;
      preferred, however staff shortages limit feasibility and contamination still occurs (2-4).&#xD;
      Online modules and videos are also commonly utilized but pose problems including lack of&#xD;
      student engagement, reduced accountability, and the limitations of teaching hands-on skills&#xD;
      online (5,6). Nonetheless, immersive methods with active involvement and feedback have proven&#xD;
      superior, but PPE shortages and social distancing guidelines limit their use (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR) is a potential alternative, offering similar benefits to in-person&#xD;
      training, such as immersion and feedback, while minimizing barriers related to timing, social&#xD;
      distancing, and equipment shortages(7). Importantly, VR allows for repetitive practice while&#xD;
      preserving PPE for clinical interactions. These qualities make VR a viable alternative,&#xD;
      although its impact on donning and doffing quality is unknown. Studies regarding PPE training&#xD;
      have found in-person and video methods to be comparable and computer simulations to&#xD;
      effectively complement in-person training (5, 8, 9). However, to our knowledge, this is the&#xD;
      first study to investigate the use of VR in PPE training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators proposed a randomized, blinded intervention-control trial comparing VR&#xD;
      versus e-module training in the teaching of donning and doffing PPE in associates and&#xD;
      students affiliated with the Montefiore Medical Center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic highlighted concerns regarding personal&#xD;
      protective equipment (PPE) utilization in hospitals (10,11). When used correctly, PPE can&#xD;
      prevent COVID-19 infection amongst exposed healthcare workers (12,13) . Evidence suggests&#xD;
      that up to 90% of doffing procedures are performed incorrectly (14). This failure rate has&#xD;
      been linked to healthcare workers being more likely to contract COVID-19 compared to the&#xD;
      general community (15). As a result, authorities have turned to increased training as a&#xD;
      potential solution (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All front-line healthcare workers in the United States must receive PPE training but there is&#xD;
      no gold standard for doing so(1). Training methods vary, with the conventional approaches&#xD;
      being in-person or video presentations (2) In-person, hands-on training tends to be&#xD;
      preferred, however, staff shortages limit feasibility and contamination still occurs 82% of&#xD;
      the time (2-4). Online modules and videos are also commonly utilized but pose problems&#xD;
      including lack of student engagement, reduced accountability, and the limitations of teaching&#xD;
      hands-on skills online(5,6). Nonetheless, immersive methods with active involvement and&#xD;
      feedback have proven superior, but PPE shortages and social distancing guidelines limit their&#xD;
      use (2).&#xD;

    <description>Donning and doffing performance was evaluated using a checklist based on Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. The performance checklist consisted of separate sections for donning and doffing. Scoring for each step was based on (1) completion and (2) correct sequence. All points are totaled for a maximum possible score of 64 points and minimum possible score of 0 points. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
