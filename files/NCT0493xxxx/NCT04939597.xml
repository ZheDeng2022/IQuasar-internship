  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares memantine to usual treatment in treating patients with brain&#xD;
      tumors that are newly diagnosed or has come back (recurrent). Memantine may block receptors&#xD;
      (parts of nerve cells) in the brain known to contribute to a decline in cognitive function.&#xD;
      Giving memantine may make a difference in cognitive function (attention, memory, or other&#xD;
      thought processes) in children and adolescents receiving brain radiation therapy to treat a&#xD;
      primary brain tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy, as measured by the slope of change of the Cogstate composite Z&#xD;
      score from baseline to 12 months, of oral memantine hydrochloride (memantine administered for&#xD;
      a period of 6 months, when compared to placebo, in children ages 4-18 receiving cranial or&#xD;
      craniospinal radiotherapy for primary central nervous system tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if memantine is associated with improved cognitive function as measured for&#xD;
      participants in the optional Children's Oncology Group (COG) Standardized Battery at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if memantine is associated with change in cognitive function version (vs.)&#xD;
      placebo as measured by Cogstate composite score at end of radiation therapy (RT), 3 and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if memantine is associated with differences in cognitive function vs.&#xD;
      placebo as measured by Cogstate composite score at 30 and 60 months for participants in the&#xD;
      optional COG Standardized Battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate early cognitive changes (end of RT, 3, 6, 12 months Cogstate composite&#xD;
      score) with late cognitive function (30 and 60 months Cogstate composite score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate COG Standardized Battery scores to Cogstate composite scores at 12, 30, and&#xD;
      60 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate the 36-month disease-free and overall survival (of primary brain tumor) after&#xD;
      memantine treatment compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To correlate changes in quantitative volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      measurements of critical brain regions with cognitive function over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate impact of memantine versus placebo on molecular biomarkers associated with&#xD;
      cognitive decline after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To determine whether oral memantine, when compared to placebo, is associated with&#xD;
      reduction in the incidence of decline of composite Cogstate score at 12 months in children&#xD;
      ages 4-18 receiving cranial radiotherapy for primary central nervous system tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive memantine hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also complete cognitive&#xD;
      testing over 20-30 minutes at baseline, end of radiation therapy, and at 3, 6, 12, 30, and 60&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also complete cognitive testing over 20-30 minutes at&#xD;
      baseline, end of radiation therapy, and at 3, 6, 12, 30, and 60 months.&#xD;
