  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether consuming a drink containing powdered blueberries&#xD;
      (equivalent to 150 g fresh fruit) can improve mood and cognition in healthy young adults.&#xD;
      Blood biomarkers of inflammation and neurotransmitter turnover will be analyzed as well as&#xD;
      responses to computer-based cognitive tasks designed to measure verbal memory, executive&#xD;
      function, and emotional processing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will examine the psychological effects of a single dose of freeze-dried&#xD;
      wild blueberries using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced,&#xD;
      crossover design. A total of 30 healthy young adults will consume two drinks: one containing&#xD;
      22 g blueberry powder and the other containing 22 g matched placebo powder in counterbalanced&#xD;
      order one week apart. The investigators will assess changes in transient mood,&#xD;
      cognitive-emotional function, and serum biomarkers of inflammation, neuroplasticity, and&#xD;
      monoamine metabolism from baseline to 2 hours post-ingestion.&#xD;

    <measure>Global transient mood as measured by PANAS-X</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form (PANAS-X) is a validated, self-rated measure of affective state, encompassing two general dimensions (positive and negative affect). These will be calculated separately by adding the values of the individual items (21 positive and 25 negative items). Thus, the scales will range from 0 to 84 points for positive affect and from 0 to 100 for negative affect, with a higher score indicating greater positive or negative affect. Positive affect will be considered the primary measure.</description>

    <description>A negative interpretation bias is defined as a tendency to interpret ambiguous information in a consistently threatening or negative manner, thus serving as an objective indicator of affective state. In this task, participants will be asked to categorize facial expressions of anger, happiness, and surprise as either positive or negative. Interpretation bias will be operationalized as the percent of trials in which surprised faces were rated as negative, out of the total number of surprise trials (48 trials).</description>
