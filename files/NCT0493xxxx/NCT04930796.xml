      Determination of the effect of food intake on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VER-01 in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 9 subjects receive VER-01 (corresponding to 10 mg THC) in the morning after a&#xD;
      10-hour fasting period on day 1, and 30 minutes after the intake of a standardised high-fat&#xD;
      breakfast has been started on day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: 9 subjects receive VER-01 (corresponding to 10 mg THC) in the morning after 30&#xD;
      minutes after the intake of a standardised high-fat breakfast has been started on day 1 and&#xD;
      after a 10-hour fasting period on day 4.&#xD;
