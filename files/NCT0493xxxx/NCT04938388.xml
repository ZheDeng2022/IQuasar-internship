  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at Sansum Diabetes Research Institute want to learn more about how taking a new&#xD;
      approved drug called oral Semaglutide, while eating fresh vegetables, impacts health in&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latino adults with type 2 diabetes. This study drug is approved by the United States&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration and may be available by prescription for type 2 diabetes. To do&#xD;
      this, 100 Hispanic/Latino adults who have type 2 diabetes will be split into two groups. Over&#xD;
      one year, one group will take Semaglutide pills and the other group will take a placebo (a&#xD;
      dummy pill that looks just like the real Semaglutide pill but does not contain the active&#xD;
      drug). Neither the participants nor the study investigator nor the study doctor will know who&#xD;
      is taking the real pill and who is taking the placebo. In case of an emergency, however, the&#xD;
      study investigator and doctor can get this information. All participants will receive pills&#xD;
      and vegetables every two weeks, have their health assessed by study staff, and meet with the&#xD;
      study doctor six times over the course of the study. Participant weight, height, waist&#xD;
      circumference, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels will be measured. Participants will&#xD;
      also wear monitors to measure blood glucose, physical activity and sleep. Study staff will&#xD;
      also ask questions about participant health, medications, mood, sleep, pain, exercise, diet,&#xD;
      acculturation, household, language, and trust in doctors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral Semaglutide is the first oral formulation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor&#xD;
      agonist developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Monotherapy with once-daily&#xD;
      oral Semaglutide has been shown to provide superior and dose-dependent decreases in HbA1c&#xD;
      compared with placebo, and superior decreases in bodyweight in patients with T2D whose&#xD;
      glycaemia was insufficiently controlled on diet and exercise. Recently, in patients with T2D&#xD;
      and chronic kidney disease, Semaglutide was also effective in improving glycemic control and&#xD;
      bodyweight with a low risk of hypoglycemia compared to placebo. Oral Semaglutide has also&#xD;
      been shown to be superior to Sitagliptin. Results from the PIONEER 6 trial showed that no&#xD;
      increased risk for major cardiovascular events was observed with oral Semaglutide in patients&#xD;
      with T2D at high cardiovascular (CV) risk. In that study, Semaglutide reduced CV death and&#xD;
      all- cause mortality by nearly 50% versus placebo after a median follow-up of 15.9 months.&#xD;
      Therefore based on the evidence from the PIONEER trials, oral Semaglutide is likely to offer&#xD;
      significant benefits for adults with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However in the United States (US), members of racial and ethnic minority groups are&#xD;
      disproportionally affected by T2D and there is a paucity of information on what the potential&#xD;
      impact of novel therapies such as oral Semaglutide might be for these populations. For&#xD;
      example, the prevalence of both diagnosed and undiagnosed T2D is nearly twice as high among&#xD;
      Mexican- origin Hispanic/Latino (hereafter Latino) adults compared to non-Latino whites.&#xD;
      Likewise, rates of diabetes-related complications (including premature death from diabetes,&#xD;
      acute stroke and end- stage renal disease) are also higher among Latino adults compared to&#xD;
      their non-Latino white counterparts. For Latinos and other US minorities, beyond genetics and&#xD;
      biological factors, it is recognized that sociocultural influences are also important factors&#xD;
      in determining an individual's response to a therapy. In addition, self-identified race&#xD;
      correlates with ancestry, which determines genomic variation, but this does not necessarily&#xD;
      predict the response to a particular drug, nor can it be assumed that responses are similar&#xD;
      between different races. As a corollary, being uninsured or a Medicaid recipient presents&#xD;
      formidable challenges to improving cost-effective outcomes for people with diabetes.&#xD;
      Currently, in the US, more than 29 million people are uninsured, with substantial&#xD;
      inequalities in access to health care along economic, gender, racial, and ethnic lines.&#xD;
      Racial and ethnic minority groups in the US also receive lower quality of health care&#xD;
      compared with their white counterparts and disparities exist in the burden and cost of&#xD;
      diabetes care for Medicare recipients. Identifying sub-groups with especially high risk of&#xD;
      complications early in the course of T2D will also help clinicians to offer more&#xD;
      cost-effective therapies. In addition, regulatory and policy decisions are increasingly based&#xD;
      on a continuum of data from intensively monitored randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to&#xD;
      real-world evidence (RWE), i.e., from tightly controlled, homogeneous populations to broader&#xD;
      ones seen in usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US minorities commonly live in &quot;poorer&quot; neighborhood environments with respect to access to&#xD;
      healthy food sources, places to exercise or safety from crime. Plant-based dietary foods have&#xD;
      the potential to help manage several major chronic diseases, including T2D. For underserved&#xD;
      populations with T2D, food insecurity and low socioeconomic status are frequent barriers to&#xD;
      nutrition-based self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, Sansum Diabetes Research Institute (SDRI) has recently created Farming for&#xD;
      Life, which provides medically prescribed produce to Latino adults with non-insulin treated&#xD;
      T2D. Farming for Life uses prescriptions of predominantly organic vegetable produce, as&#xD;
      studies have shown that organic crops have higher concentrations of antioxidants and a lower&#xD;
      incidence of pesticide residues than non-organic crops. There is growing evidence of an&#xD;
      association between pesticide exposure and T2D risk.&#xD;
