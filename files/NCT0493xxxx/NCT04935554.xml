  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The T2D project is a research and innovation project that will create a new comprehensive,&#xD;
      participant-centered service model for interaction, increased physical activity,&#xD;
      self-management, distance monitoring and lifestyle change for patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D). Central to the degree of innovation is a new model for interaction and use of&#xD;
      technology for distance monitoring and coping.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is both physically and mentally stressful. At the same time, it requires a&#xD;
      high individual effort, which can be demanding. Good mental health is necessary to be able to&#xD;
      manage and control diabetes in a healthy and effective way. Therefore, we want to create an&#xD;
      offer that takes care of the whole person, and physically as well as mentally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal follow-up Based on surveys and conversations, the study participant and a contact&#xD;
      person will prepare a 12-week plan that will be implemented with self-measurements and&#xD;
      follow-up from the contact person. The plan will consist of the activities that best suit the&#xD;
      participant's needs. It can be physical activity, diet course, health competence, motivation&#xD;
      and psychosocial intervention that will be useful for the participant. After 12 weeks, the&#xD;
      implementation will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several new technological solutions are developed and will be used during the project period.&#xD;
      A digital tool for mapping of the individuals needs will be an important part of the survey&#xD;
      that is done during start-up. Activity clocks will be used for measuring steps, heart rate,&#xD;
      and number of PAI. An online portal for communication and interaction will make information&#xD;
      easily accessible to users, simplify distance follow-up and communication flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will take place at two Healthy Life Centres (HLC). A HLC is an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary primary health care service which offers effective, knowledge-based&#xD;
      measures for people with, or in high risk of disease, who need support in health behaviour&#xD;
      change and in coping health problems and chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HLC is part of the public health care service in the municipality. HLC programs have a&#xD;
      patient centred approach and aim at strengthening the individual's control of his or her own&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention study starts in two municipalities in Møre og Romsdal, and the goal is to&#xD;
      make the offer national.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference is a simple method to assess abdominal adiposity that is easy to standardize and clinically apply. Waist circumference is strongly associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality</description>

    <measure>Change in physical fitness by the number of PAI from baseline until week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PAI (personalized activity index) was derived from an algorithm from one of the world's largest health studies (HUNT) and is a single, easy-to-understand personalized activity tracking metric that can help everyday people manage their health. Maintaining 100 PAI or more per week is strongly associated with adding on average 5 years to your life and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality by an average of 25%.</description>
