      This registry is an observational study designed to evaluate the effect of Oxbryta in&#xD;
      individuals with SCD in a real-world setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at approximately 25 sites in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry is an observational study to evaluate the effects of Oxbryta in individuals&#xD;
      with SCD. Any participant who is currently taking Oxbryta, or has been prescribed and will&#xD;
      initiate treatment with Oxbryta, is eligible to participate. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      receive treatment with Oxbryta as prescribed by their physician, as part of their usual care.&#xD;
      Participants will be treated and evaluated per standard of care (SOC) and at the physician's&#xD;
      discretion. This study will collect data that are recorded in the participants' medical&#xD;
      records and other secondary data sources. Study data will be collected at regular intervals&#xD;
      and entered in case report forms (CRFs) via an electronic data capture (EDC) system by the&#xD;
      study staff. Participants will be considered to be on study for up to 5 years after their&#xD;
      first dose of Oxbryta treatment, or until they withdraw their consent to participate, or are&#xD;
      discontinued from the study. Treatment, including interruptions and restarting treatment,&#xD;
      will continue at the discretion of the treating physician, and there are no pre-defined&#xD;
      treatment requirements. Participants may receive any additional medications prescribed by&#xD;
      their treating physician, or have any medical interventions that are deemed appropriate by&#xD;
      the treating physician or study doctor. The participant or treating physician may discontinue&#xD;
      Oxbryta at any time. Participants who discontinue treatment with Oxbryta earlier than 5 years&#xD;
      will continue to be followed on study to collect clinical and quality of life (QoL) outcomes&#xD;
      for up to 5 years after their first dose of Oxbryta treatment. Participant safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be assessed throughout the study data collection period by the study doctor&#xD;
      and reported to the Sponsor.&#xD;
