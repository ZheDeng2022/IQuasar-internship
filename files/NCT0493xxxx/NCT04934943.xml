    <textblock>
      The mini fluid challenge (mini_FC) is a functional hemodynamic test which has been used in&#xD;
      different clinical contexts to assess fluid responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test is performed by rapidly injecting a small aliquot of fluid (100 ml over 1 minute),&#xD;
      which is followed by the infusion of the residual aliquot of fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the threshold of the mini_FC identified by the literature is rather small (5% of stroke&#xD;
      volume (SV) increase after the 100 ml bolus to discriminate between responder and&#xD;
      non-responder), it is crucial that the hemodynamic tool assessing this change could be&#xD;
      reliable. Moreover, the SV changes with inspiratory/expiratory movements and the increase&#xD;
      after the mini_FC should also consider the physiological fluctuations of the SV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature this test has been performed by means of tolls with different least&#xD;
      significant change of the SV. The least significant change (LSC) represents the smallest&#xD;
      difference between successive measurements of SV that can be considered to be a real change&#xD;
      and not attributable to chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the agreement among MOSTCARE system (4.5&amp; of SV LSC&#xD;
      described in the literature) and the echocardiography (about 10% of SV LSC described in the&#xD;
      literature) with the PICCO system (about 1% of SV LSC described in the literature -&#xD;
      considered the gold standard) in discriminating fluid responsiveness after a mini_FC&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Targeted fluid therapy has received increasing attention in the management of patients&#xD;
      showing acute circulatory failure in both intensive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR),&#xD;
      aiming at preventing both inadequate tissue blood flow and fluid overload. In fact,&#xD;
      unnecessary fluid administration can increase morbidity and mortality and length of hospital&#xD;
      stay of critically ill and surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the only physiological reason to give a fluid challenge (FC) is to increase the stroke&#xD;
      volume (SV) and this effect is obtained only in about 50% of ICU and OR patients, a vast&#xD;
      literature investigated the possibility of predict this effect before FC administration, but&#xD;
      the issue remains extremely challenging. Bedside clinical signs and pressure and static&#xD;
      volumetric static variables, do not predict fluid responsiveness. Moreover, several&#xD;
      physiological factors affect the reliability of the ventilator-induced dynamic changes in&#xD;
      pulse pressure and stroke volume [pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume (SV)&#xD;
      variation (SVV), respectively], and their echographic surrogates, in a significant number of&#xD;
      ICU and OR patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these limitations, the functional hemodynamic assessment (i.e. the assessment of&#xD;
      the dynamic interactions of hemodynamic variables in response to a defined perturbation), of&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness has gained in popularity. A functional hemodynamic test (FHT) consist in&#xD;
      a manoeuvre determining a sudden change in cardiac function and/or heart lung interaction,&#xD;
      affecting the hemodynamics of fluid responders and non-responders to a different extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FHT called passive leg raising (PLR) has been successfully used for assessing the fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness in ICU patients since 2009 and its reliability has been confirmed by three&#xD;
      large meta-analyses. However, the PLR is not usually practicable in the OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot of different FHTs have been proposed, as alternative to the PLR, in ICU and, more&#xD;
      recently, OR. These tests could be basically subdivided in two groups. A subgroup of FHTs is&#xD;
      based on sudden and brief variations of the mechanical ventilation to induce a change in&#xD;
      right ventricle preload and/or after load and, as consequence, of left ventricle. Among these&#xD;
      tests, the rapid administration of a small aliquot of the predefined FC (the so-called mini&#xD;
      FC) has gained in popularity in the last years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On of the drawbacks of this test is that the optimal threshold identified in the literature&#xD;
      to stratify responders and non-responders (5% of SV variation) is quite small, and&#xD;
      potentially affected by the reliability of the hemodynamic tool used. The aim of this paper&#xD;
      is to compare the reliability of a hemodynamic invasive tool (the (PiCCO2 TM, Pulsion Medical&#xD;
      Systems, Munich, Germany - considered the gold standard) with a mini-invasive tool&#xD;
      (MostCareTM system (Vytech Health, Padua, Italy) and a non-invasive (echocardiography) in&#xD;
      predicting the response to the mini-FC in critically ill patients.&#xD;

    <description>The fluid challenge consists of 4 ml*Kg of Crystalloids' solution infused over 10 minutes, administered via either a central or a peripheral line.&#xD;
The patient is already connected to the PICCO monitoring for clinical purpose of hemodynamic monitoring (before study enrollment)&#xD;
The MOSTCARE system is connected to the MONITOR of the patient (and not to the patient itself) by means of a cable inserted into the connections system.&#xD;
The echocardiography will be performed by a senior intensivist/cardiologist. The stroke volume is calculated by measuring VTI and diameter at the same point. This is best performed by measuring the diameter of the LVOT in the parasternal long axis (PLAX) view</description>
