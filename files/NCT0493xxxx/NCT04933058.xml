  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unclear whether routine addition of opioids for analgesia during minor gynecological&#xD;
      procedures is beneficial. In this single-center randomized single-blinded trial, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to test the primary hypothesis that opioid-sparing anesthesia regimen&#xD;
      including intravenous acetaminophen is non-inferior to a similar anesthesia regimen&#xD;
      containing fentanyl in providing postoperative analgesia in women recovering from oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval procedures for in vitro fertilization. The investigators also aim to assess the&#xD;
      difference in incidence of patient-reported opioid related adverse-effects between the two&#xD;
      groups, time to discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit and postoperative rescue&#xD;
      analgesia requirements. If we demonstrate no clinically important difference between the two&#xD;
      interventions, clinicians may be able to substantially reduce the amount of opioids&#xD;
      administered to patients undergoing minor ambulatory procedures, and potentially decrease the&#xD;
      associated opioid related adverse effects.&#xD;

      Study Overview The investigators propose a single-center randomized single-blinded clinical&#xD;
      trial in which healthy women undergoing oocyte retrieval procedures under general anesthesia&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either 1.5mcg/kg fentanyl or IV acetaminophen as part of&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia. The investigators will evaluate the effects of an opioid-free&#xD;
      anesthesia on pain scores, analgesic medication consumption during the initial two&#xD;
      postoperative hours, and time to discharge from PACU, compared to an opioid-containing&#xD;
      anesthesia.The investigators will also compare the prevalence of opioid-related sedation side&#xD;
      effect between opioid-free anesthesia and opioid-containing anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized, single-blinded single-center clinical trial. After&#xD;
      confirming eligibility, patients will be approached before the procedure for possible&#xD;
      enrollment in the study. After thorough explanation, written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio by a web-based software to receive&#xD;
      either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Opioid-free anesthesia, including&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. IV propofol 1-1.5 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. IV acetaminophen 1000mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. IV dipyrone 1000mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. IV lidocaine 1mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. IV dexacort 4mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. PR diclofenac 50 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Opioid-supplemented anesthesia, including&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. IV propofol 1-1.5 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. IV fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. IV dipyrone 1000mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. IV lidocaine 1mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. IV dexacort 4mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. PR diclofenac 50 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist performing the procedure will not be blinded to group allocation, but&#xD;
      other research team members and caregivers who evaluate the patients after the procedure will&#xD;
      be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be induced according to the group allocation as mentioned above.&#xD;
      Anesthesia maintenance will be achieved with 50% N2O via a face-mask, and additional doses of&#xD;
      10-20 mg of propofol as needed. Ketamine will not be allowed. Postoperatively, intravenous&#xD;
      tramadol 100 mg will be ordered for breakthrough pain as well as intravenous ondansetron 4mg&#xD;
      and metoclopramide 10mg for nausea and vomiting. Patients will be followed until home&#xD;
      discharge. The rest of postoperative care will be conducted according to standard&#xD;
      departmental procedures by nurses and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient characteristics and demographic data including age, weight, body mass index&#xD;
           (BMI), tobacco use, prior IVF treatment, history of pain after previous IVF, chronic&#xD;
           pain, chronic medication use, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical&#xD;
           status will be obtained from the medical record and patient interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain scores will be documented on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
           from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) at least once every 30 minutes for the&#xD;
           initial two postoperative hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opioid-induced sedation will be captured through the Passero opioid-induced sedation&#xD;
           scale (Appendix A) 20 minutes after patient admission to the recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction with the anesthesia will be assessed using Likert scale from 1 to 5&#xD;
           grading &quot;how satisfied are the participant with the pain management they received&#xD;
           today?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of discharge will be captured from the patient's electronic medical record and/or&#xD;
           from patient interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Considerations To test a unilateral non-inferiority hypothesis, assuming a 2.5%&#xD;
      significance level, power of 80%, standard deviation of 2 points, a non-inferiority delta of&#xD;
      no more than 1.5 points in the 11-point NRS pain scale between the two groups, and assumed&#xD;
      pooled variance of 6, we will need a sample size of 42 patients in each group. Accounting for&#xD;
      a predicted loss to follow-up of up to 20% of patients, we aim to recruit 100 patients.&#xD;

We will also record the time from arrival until discharge from PACU reported as the median [interquartile range] time in each group. Overall alpha will be 0.05.</description>
