    <textblock>
      Sound sleep is needed for our overall health and optimum our productivity. Sleep quality&#xD;
      affects people's work performance, mood, safety, and quality of life. Changing times and&#xD;
      advancements in technology couples with altered lifestyles have taken a toll on human health.&#xD;
      Poor sleep quality reduces short-term memory, cognitive abilities, and motor skills for all&#xD;
      age groups. The high prevalence of poor sleep quality in every age group has triggered a&#xD;
      growing worldwide demand for a safe, effective and easily available herbal cure. Studies&#xD;
      shown that, E. hirta has sedative action. For this, I hypothesized that oral intake of&#xD;
      aqueous extract (tea) of E.hirta is efficacious in improving sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study I assessed the efficacy of aqueous extract (tea) of Euphorbia hirta (Dudhiya)&#xD;
      in improving sleep quality in persons aged 20 to 50 years with self-reported sleep&#xD;
      disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of oral intake of aqueous extract&#xD;
      of E.hirta in improving sleep quality in terms of having regular sound sleep and freshness in&#xD;
      the daytime work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 32 adults with poor sleep quality was recruited for this study and included both&#xD;
      of male and female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study was 05 months and active participation of each participant was 2&#xD;
      consecutive weeks or 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area was included Dhaka, Narayanganj and Munshiganj districts and study center was Dr.&#xD;
      Hakeem Md. Yousuf Harun Bhuiyan Hospital, Hamdard University Bangladesh.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sound sleep is needed for our overall health and optimum our productivity. Sleep quality&#xD;
      affects people's work performance, mood, safety, and quality of life. Changing times and&#xD;
      advancements in technology couples with altered lifestyles have taken a toll on human health.&#xD;
      Poor sleep quality reduces short-term memory, cognitive abilities, and motor skills for all&#xD;
      age groups. The high prevalence of poor sleep quality in every age group has triggered a&#xD;
      growing worldwide demand for a safe, effective and easily available herbal cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study I assessed the efficacy of aqueous extract (tea) of Euphorbia hirta&#xD;
      (Dudhiya) in improving sleep quality in persons aged 20 to 50 years with self-reported sleep&#xD;
      disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of oral intake of aqueous&#xD;
      extract(Tea) of E.hirta compared with placebo (PBO) in improving sleep quality in terms of&#xD;
      having regular sound sleep and freshness in the daytime work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature review have shown that sample size were included 24, 25, , 60, 112, 165 and 258&#xD;
      participants in sleep disorder related study. However, prior study on Withania somnifera in&#xD;
      insomnia and anxiety has shown that the mean of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the&#xD;
      baseline was 13.08 and Standard Deviation (SD) 1.51, post-treatment &amp; after follow up it was&#xD;
      9.15 and SD 1.8372. Based on this mean and SD, the estimated enrollment of 5 per treatment&#xD;
      group among those with poor sleep would provide the study with a statistical power of 95% (α&#xD;
      = 0.05) and confidence interval of 95% to detect significant improvements in sleep quality.&#xD;
      By using OpenEpi online calculator, my required sample size is 10. Due to chance of loss to&#xD;
      follow up and placebo effect (5%), my inflated sample size is total number of 32 participants&#xD;
      which is three times larger than estimated sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study for each participant was 05 months days with &quot;day one advertisement&quot; for&#xD;
      screening followed by randomization for the treatment. The duration of the active&#xD;
      participation of each participant 2 consecutive weeks or 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area was included Dhaka, Narayanganj and Munshiganj districts and study centre was Dr.&#xD;
      Hakeem Md. Yousuf Harun Bhuiyan Hospital, Hamdard University Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants was recruited by using online and printed advertisement of the study.&#xD;
      Advertisements was posted on the online page of dept. of public health as well as other&#xD;
      faculties of Hamdard University Bangladesh. Printed advertisement was posted on notice board&#xD;
      of different faculties of Hamdard University Bangladesh along with providing in-person.&#xD;
      Advertisements was also posted on online social networking platforms (such as Facebook,&#xD;
      Facebook groups, LinkedIn). The relevant study requirements with an email address and phone&#xD;
      number was included in the advertisement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested respondent was contact to the investigator, and he/she was invited to come to Dr.&#xD;
      Hakeem Md. Yousuf Harun Bhuiyan Hospital, Hamdard University Bangladesh for assessing sleep&#xD;
      quality by self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and checking physical&#xD;
      parameters (i.e. general appearance, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), pulse rate, body&#xD;
      temperature, blood pressure and respiratory rate) as well. Participants who met eligible&#xD;
      criteria along with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score equal or greater than&#xD;
      6, and above mentioned physical parameters were normal -enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, they were randomized (by third party) into two groups to receive either the&#xD;
      intervention or the placebo for 2 consecutive weeks or 14 days. A Sleep Diary also provided&#xD;
      to each participants and instructed to complete it every morning within one hour after wake&#xD;
      up. Participants were got reminder for taking intervention tea and completing sleep diary&#xD;
      regularly every 2/3 days interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing intervention period, Participants were fulfilled another Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Index questionnaire for post-intervention assessment, and also fulfilled Sleep Diary&#xD;
      was collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index contains seven component scores are, where the total score&#xD;
      ranges from 0 to 21 points (0-3 points for each component). Lower scores indicate better&#xD;
      sleep status. The global score is also calculated, with scores &gt; 5 used to classify&#xD;
      participants as &quot;poor sleepers&quot; and scores ≤5 used to classify participants as &quot;good&#xD;
      sleepers&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measure will be assessed by the differences between pre and post-intervention&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score as well as the percentage reduction in Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Index compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate Subjective Sleep Efficiency (sSE) during the period of oral intake of aqueous&#xD;
      extract of the intervention or placebo from sleep diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted for patients who have received intervention&#xD;
      at least once. Data will be presented as mean±SD and percentage of reduction in the change of&#xD;
      improving sleep quality with a 95% confidence interval and p=0.05. sSE also be evaluated as&#xD;
      percentage. Difference between two means will be compared with independent two sample t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Difference of baseline and post intervention mean by PSQI compared with PBO&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of sSE between 1st and 14th day of intervention period from sleep diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the % of reduction of PSQI global score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the quality of this trial, data &amp; safety monitoring will be conducted by Data &amp;&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The members of the DSMB was included that individual who was&#xD;
      not involved directly in this research. For this clinical trial, DSMB members was joined from&#xD;
      the Faculty of Unani and Ayurvedic Medicine of Hamdard University Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment was obtained from the incidence and type of adverse events during study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
