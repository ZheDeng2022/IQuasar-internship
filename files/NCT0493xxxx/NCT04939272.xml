    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects, best dose, and effectiveness of copanlisib&#xD;
      and venetoclax in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed)&#xD;
      or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Copanlisib may stop the growth of cancer cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Venetoclax may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Giving copanlisib&#xD;
      and venetoclax may help treat patients with mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety, tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of copanlisib&#xD;
      hydrochloride (copanlisib) and venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) mantle&#xD;
      cell lymphoma (MCL). (Phase 1) II. To estimate the efficacy (as measured by overall rate of&#xD;
      response [ORR]) of copanlisib in combination with venetoclax in patients with R/R MCL. (Phase&#xD;
      2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety profile of copanlisib in combination with venetoclax in&#xD;
      patients with R/R MCL. (Phase 2) II. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) and&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) associated with combined administration of&#xD;
      copanlisib/venetoclax. (Phase 2) III. To evaluate an overall survival (OS) associated with&#xD;
      combined administration of copanlisib/venetoclax. (Phase 2) IV. To characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of copanlisib and venetoclax. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the emergence of resistant clones, as determined by the presence of novel&#xD;
      mutations and expression of BCL2 family proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the T-cell population balance in patients treated with&#xD;
      copanlisib/venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of copanlisib hydrochloride, followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and&#xD;
      15, and venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
