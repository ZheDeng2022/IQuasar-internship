  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of 177Lu-FAP-2286 and&#xD;
      determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Phase 2&#xD;
      of this study is designed to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) in patients with specific&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
