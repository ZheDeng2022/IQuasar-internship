  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The children who will undergo OLV (one lung ventilation) through general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first will be intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine at 0.4 mcg / kg / hour, and the&#xD;
      second will be intravenous infusion of normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will take three samples of arterial blood gas (ABG) during the surgery at certain times.&#xD;
      We record the hemodynamic values, PaO2, and calculate the value of the shunt Qs / Qt.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung isolation or one lung ventilation OLV means the mechanical separation of the lungs with&#xD;
      independent ventilation of one lung from the other, in order to provide a suitable space for&#xD;
      the work of the surgeon, and to protect a healthy lung from bleeding or edema caused by lung&#xD;
      damage. OLV can lead to a mismatch in the ventilation / perfusion (V / Q) ratio resulting in&#xD;
      increased intrapulmonary shunt as well as hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction HPV is the most important preventive mechanism against&#xD;
      hypoxemia, as blood flow moves from the unventilated lung to the ventilated lung to maintain&#xD;
      an adequate arterial oxygen transport rate, HPV is a defense mechanism against hypoxia as it&#xD;
      reduces pulmonary shunt. So that there is less oxygen drop than expected. HPV reaches its&#xD;
      maximum effect in 15 minutes, resulting in decreased pulmonary shunt, homogenization of&#xD;
      ventilation / perfusion ratio, and improved oxygen delivery. HPV is affected by various&#xD;
      factors: changes in pulmonary pressure, alkalosis, vasodilators, anesthetic agents etc. Among&#xD;
      these factors, anesthetic inhaled gases have the greatest effect on HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary shunt: It is the sum of the physiological shunt (poorly ventilated air sacs) and&#xD;
      the anatomical shunt and the pulmonary shunt fraction (Qs/Qt) is calculated from the equation&#xD;
      Qs/Qt = (CcO2 - CaO2)/(CcO2 - CvO2) Qs: blood flow through the shunt, Qt : total blood flow,&#xD;
      Cc'O2 : pulmonary capillary content of O2, CaO2 : arterial content of O2, CvO2 : venous mixed&#xD;
      content of O2 100% O2 test: often performed in a cardiac catheterization lab, operating room,&#xD;
      or ICU, the patient breathes 100% O2 until nitrogen is washed out from their lungs (20&#xD;
      minutes). The oxygen concentration even in poorly ventilated units will approach 100%. This&#xD;
      means that the partial pressure and blood saturation are equal in the poorly ventilated and&#xD;
      well-ventilated alveolar units, thus the physiological pulmonary shunt is canceled and the&#xD;
      anatomical pulmonary shunt remains After lung isolation and OLV application, we perform&#xD;
      anesthesia maneuvers on the ventilator and adjust the applied ventilators in order to&#xD;
      maintain adequate oxygenation of the patient: increased PEEP, increased FLOW, increased tidal&#xD;
      volume Vt, increased Pmax, increased FiO2, thus eliminating the physiological pulmonary shunt&#xD;
      and the anatomical pulmonary shunt remains, in total we apply 100% O2 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a selective agonist for α2 receptors whose affinity for α2 receptors is&#xD;
      eight times more than clonidine. At a dose of 0.3 mg / kg it activates protein G and inhibits&#xD;
      norepinephrine secretion. When given in larger doses or infusion it stimulates the peripheral&#xD;
      α2 receptors; It reduces the levels of norepinephrine in the plasma by more than 90%, thus&#xD;
      reducing the cells' metabolism and their need for oxygen.Sympathetic blocker: Reduces heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure and oxygen consumption of the heart muscle. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      alpha-adrenergic blockade abolished pulmonary vasoconstriction that responds to&#xD;
      norepinephrine but not to hypoxia. That is, it does not affect the blood supply and HPV of&#xD;
      the unventilated lung, widens the blood vessels of the ventilated lung, and reduces the&#xD;
      anesthetic requirements (affecting HPV); Reduces 30% of the need for propofol; It reduces&#xD;
      desflurane concentration and its subsequent inhibitory effect on HPV. It may also lead to&#xD;
      transient increases in pulmonary artery pressure related to its direct effects on vascular&#xD;
      smooth muscle through alpha-adrenergic receptors.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. As per the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I-I physical&#xD;
             condition children undergoing thoracic surgery with OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. From one day old to 12 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. There is no prejudice in terms of gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. This study practically does not exclude any child who will undergo OLV even in the&#xD;
             presence of cardiac, renal or hepatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Or even in the presence of cardiac stimulants and supports (dopamine or dopamine), provided&#xD;
        that the general condition is stable, which allows surgery and OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Premature infants: due to immaturity of the lung and insufficient formation of the&#xD;
             surfactant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cystic Fibrosis: The depressor for surfactant and lung immaturity is not permitted to&#xD;
             perform the OLV technique&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. There is no contraindication for the administration of dexmedetomidine in children&#xD;
             except those who show signs of allergy to the dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. This study does not exclude practically any child who will undergo OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. During operating surgery: The child is excluded from the study if hypoxia occurs (SpO2&#xD;
             &lt;90%) and did not respond to maneuvers and anesthetic techniques (Increase PEEP&#xD;
             Increase the FLOW, Tidal volume, increase Vt, Pmax increased pressure, FiO2 increased)&#xD;
             Then the lungs are periodically ventilated with positive pressure, and the OLV&#xD;
             technique is switched off and the child is excluded from the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. During operating surgery: If there is a drop-in heart rate less than 60 beats / minute&#xD;
             and it does not respond to atropine or an increased dose of Cardiac tonics (dopamine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        At this time the infusion of dexmedetomidine is stopped, it is assumed that there is no&#xD;
        very slow pulse, and if it does, it is likely that the primary cardiac lesion is the cause.&#xD;
