  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The studies included the effect of chronic kidney disease advancement on the accumulation of&#xD;
      oxidative stress markers in plasma. In patients with end-stage renal disease, the effect of&#xD;
      replacement therapy was also assessed. Therefore, the patient with chronic kidney disease was&#xD;
      evaluated divided into three groups (chronic kidney disease at stage G3b-G4, peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis, hemodialysis). In addition, changes in the interrelationship between oxidative&#xD;
      modifications, carbonyl and nitrogen stress, and the carbamylation resulting from the&#xD;
      progression of kidney disease have been taken into account. This issue is related to the&#xD;
      assessment of whether the protein modification types differentiate patients depending on the&#xD;
      stage of chronic kidney disease and the method of renal replacement therapy. Protein&#xD;
      modifications associated with oxidative stress are a part of the complications resulting from&#xD;
      chronic kidney diseases, such as malnutrition, chronic inflammation, dyslipidemia, iron&#xD;
      disorder, and calcium and phosphate disorders. Also, diseases of atherosclerosis aetiology&#xD;
      are much higher frequency in patients with chronic kidney disease than in those with normal&#xD;
      kidney function. Therefore, in the studies presented here, particular attention was paid to&#xD;
      the effect of oxidative stress on chronic kidney disease complications in the aspect of&#xD;
      cardiovascular damage. The specificity of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease was evaluated by comparing groups of this type of patients with patients with&#xD;
      ischemic heart diseases and normal renal function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Redox imbalance in the course of CKD results in the intensification of oxidative and carbonyl&#xD;
      stress, which leads to the modification of many molecules, including proteins necessary for&#xD;
      the proper functioning of the body. The assessment of the accumulation of modified proteins&#xD;
      in the plasma is not only an indirect indicator of the severity of redox imbalance in the&#xD;
      system, but also allows the analysis of the influence of oxidative stress and its derivatives&#xD;
      (glycation, carbonyl stress and carbamylation) on the pathogenesis of CKD. In addition,&#xD;
      compounds formed as a result of the action of ROS on proteins may affect the development of&#xD;
      long-term consequences of CKD, such as chronic inflammation, dyslipidemia, renal&#xD;
      osteodystrophy, iron metabolism disorders and malnutrition. On the other hand, complications&#xD;
      in patients with CKD may influence the intensification of oxidative modifications of&#xD;
      proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following goals were set in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of the impact of CKD advancement on the severity of protein modification as a&#xD;
           result of oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of the effect of renal replacement therapy on protein modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of the relationship between selected protein modifications in CKD and&#xD;
           complications typical of CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Comparison of selected protein modifications in patients with CKD and patients with at&#xD;
           least one history of a cardiovascular event.&#xD;

    <description>patients with ESRD (n=78) - (eGFR &lt;15 ml/min /1.73 m2) undergoing renal replacement therapy. Depending on the method of renal replacement therapy used, two subgroups are distinguished: PD subgroup (n=35) including patients treated by peritoneal dialysis. In this subgroup, initially, due to the treatment technique, two groups were separated, a group (n=15) treated with the automatic peritoneal dialysis (APD) technique, and a group of patients (n = 20) using the technique of continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), HD subgroup (n = 43) including patients treated with repeated hemodialysis. Hemodialysis procedures were performed in each patient three times a week, via an arteriovenous fistula from own or artificial vessels. The duration of hemodialysis was at least 10 hours/week using standard bicarbonate dialysis fluids and polysulfone low-flux dialyzers. The blood flow during hemodialysis was 200-350 ml/min, with an average dialysis fluid flow of 500 ml/min.</description>

        The study involved 195 people, including 126 patients with diagnosed CKD, under the care of&#xD;
        the Nephrology Outpatient Clinic, Peritoneal Dialysis Clinic or the Dialysis Center at the&#xD;
        Clinical Hospital. H. Święcicki in Poznań (group from CKD) and 69 people who constituted&#xD;
        the control group. Recruitment to the study lasted one year. In the group of patients with&#xD;
        CKD, depending on the degree of renal impairment and the type of renal replacement therapy,&#xD;
        according to the criteria of diagnosis and classification of CKD according to KDIGO 2012,&#xD;
        several subgroups were created. The allocation to groups was based on the GFR, calculated&#xD;
        by the recommendations of KDIGO 2012&#xD;
