  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney failure is a growing public health problem and fatal unless treated with dialysis or&#xD;
      transplantation. Haemodialysis is the most common treatment for kidney failure in Australia&#xD;
      and globally. Patients find haemodialysis extremely burdensome due to symptoms like fatigue,&#xD;
      pain, cramps and poor quality of life that generally equates to &lt;60% of full health.&#xD;
      Furthermore, haemodialysis is associated with an extremely high mortality (&lt;50% survive 5&#xD;
      years), particularly in the first 3-6 months of starting haemodialysis, which is likely&#xD;
      linked to the rapid loss of patients' own kidney function when starting haemodialysis&#xD;
      abruptly at three sessions/week. Observational studies suggest that starting haemodialysis&#xD;
      incrementally at two sessions/ week is associated with lower mortality and better&#xD;
      preservation of patients' remaining kidney function while offering many patient-important&#xD;
      advantages, including dialysis free time and ability to work. However, robust evidence to&#xD;
      recommend this incremental approach is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INCH-HD study is an investigator-initiated, international, multicentre, prospective,&#xD;
      adaptive, randomised, open-label, parallel group, non-inferiority trial. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to demonstrate whether incremental HD is non-inferior to&#xD;
      conventional HD for the patient-important outcome of quality of life measured using&#xD;
      Kidney-specific component of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life - Short Form measurement&#xD;
      (KDQOL-SF) at 6 months from dialysis commencement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit a total of 372 participants across HD centres in Australia, New&#xD;
      Zealand and Canada. The outcomes of this trial will will provide urgently needed high quality&#xD;
      evidence on whether starting haemodialysis incrementally at two sessions/week compared to the&#xD;
      conventional three sessions/week can safely reduce the physical, financial and quality-of&#xD;
      life burden on patients, lower early mortality rates and slow loss of kidney function while&#xD;
      increasing haemodialysis capacity and reducing costs.&#xD;

    <description>Heath-related quality of life will be measured using EuroQol 5 Domain 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. EQ-5D has descriptive and visual analogue scale (VAS). Descriptive system consists of five dimensions mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.
