    <textblock>
      An innovative multicenter project that aims to study the evolution and predictive value of&#xD;
      new leukocyte morphological parameters (CPD) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
      Our project has 3 objectives: 1.- To demonstrate that the use of some leukocyte morphology&#xD;
      parameters at the time of diagnosis, and their changes in the first 72 hours, can help us to&#xD;
      better identify the severity and prognosis of these patients and to discriminate between&#xD;
      bacterial etiology of viral. 2.- Make a comparison with other more studied inflammation and&#xD;
      cardiovascular biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, pro-calcitonin and pro-adrenomedullin.&#xD;
      3.- Incorporate some of these CPDs parameters to a new prediction rule with greater&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity than those existing up to now (PSI, CURB-65, SCAP, ATS / IDSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study will be carried out in 3 hospitals (Galdakao-Usánsolo, Basurto and San&#xD;
      Pedro de Logroño). Prospective observational study with longitudinal follow-up up to 30 days&#xD;
      after the diagnosis of admitted patients with CAP. Patients will be included consecutively&#xD;
      for 24 months; Sociodemographic variables, duration of symptoms, previous antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
      severity of presentation, etiological diagnosis, treatment administered and evolution during&#xD;
      hospital stay and up to 30 days will be analyzed. As dependent variables of severe CAP we&#xD;
      will use, on the one hand, poor evolution (therapeutic failure, and / or need for admission&#xD;
      to high-monitoring units such as ICU or Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit (ICU) and / or&#xD;
      30-day mortality) and, for another, a microbiological etiological diagnosis. For statistical&#xD;
      processing, univariate and multivariate analyzes and logistic regression models will be used&#xD;
      to create a predictive rule.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has a high incidence of 2-8 cases per 1000 inhabitants per&#xD;
      year and a mortality rate of around 5%. Mortality in admitted patients is10-25%, and is much&#xD;
      higher in those requiring admission to intensive care (ICU). Most patients hospitalized for&#xD;
      CAP respond satisfactorily to treatment, but 10-15% experience therapeutic failure and 6% may&#xD;
      develop a rapid and progressive deterioration that can be life-threatening. Mortality from&#xD;
      CAP occurs mainly in patients with therapeutic failure. The prognostic factors of mortality&#xD;
      have been related to the germ-host binomial. Despite the emergence of antibiotic resistance,&#xD;
      there are studies that show that mortality is more associated with patient-dependent factors&#xD;
      than with germ resistance. For the management of CAP, it is essential to improve the&#xD;
      microbiological diagnosis and the assessment of its severity, which will allow the choice of&#xD;
      antimicrobial agents, establish the need for hospital admission, monitoring and care during&#xD;
      admission, the appropriate time for hospital discharge, as well as post-discharge management.&#xD;
      Determining the etiologic agent of CAP remains problematic, due to failure to detect the&#xD;
      microorganism with the usual diagnostic methods. To establish the severity of CAP, severity&#xD;
      scales have been created that allow predicting the patient's evolution. The best known are:&#xD;
      PSI, CURB-65, SCAP score, and ATS / IDSA. The objectives of stratifying patients with CAP are&#xD;
      multiple: defining which patients can be managed out-of-hospital, establishing the patients&#xD;
      who require greater monitoring in intermediate respiratory care units (ICUs) or ICUs,&#xD;
      establishing severity models to select patients for whom perform new diagnostic tests or&#xD;
      therapeutic trials. The prognostic scales measure the physiological effect of the infection&#xD;
      on the host but not the inflammatory response mechanisms against the microorganism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the early inflammatory response may have clinical significance&#xD;
      determined by greater therapeutic efficacy in patients with more severe CAP. Microbial&#xD;
      invasion of lung tissue causes an inflammatory response aimed at limiting the progression of&#xD;
      the infection and destroying the microorganism. The objective of this response is to&#xD;
      facilitate the arrival of leukocytes and other inflammatory biomarkers to exercise their&#xD;
      defense function. Among the biomarkers we can highlight C-reactive Protein (CRP), studied for&#xD;
      the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory processes, and with which a certain relationship&#xD;
      has been established with the severity of CAP. PCT, referred to as a sensitive marker of&#xD;
      severity in bacterial infection and sepsis, and as a guide to adjust antibiotic treatment in&#xD;
      patients with CAP. Pro-adrenomodulin (ProADM) has been associated with a prognostic marker in&#xD;
      patients with sepsis and as a useful marker in the risk stratification of patients with CAP.&#xD;
      Plasma levels of inflammatory mediators appear to correlate with the severity of sepsis or&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correct diagnosis of infections by the clinic, biochemical and microbiological markers&#xD;
      can be expensive and time consuming. It is important to look for new and low-cost&#xD;
      alternatives to evaluate this condition, with the aim of making an early and timely diagnosis&#xD;
      and evaluation and instituting the best therapeutic strategy and follow-up. Among these new&#xD;
      alternatives, the &quot;Cellular Popular Data&quot; (CPD) stand out, which are morphological parameters&#xD;
      of different types of leukocytes. The CPDs of the XN analyzers (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe,&#xD;
      Japan) report quantitative information on the morphological and functional characteristics of&#xD;
      leukocytes. They are morphological parameters that characterize neutrophils, lymphocytes, and&#xD;
      monocytes and classify them according to their volume, shape, granularity, and their nucleic&#xD;
      acid content. The composition of activated cell membranes is different from that of resting&#xD;
      cells, due to the expression of receptors and signaling molecules on their surface, in&#xD;
      response to activation. This membrane is more sensitive to analyzer reagents, and more&#xD;
      fluorescent dye can penetrate the activated cell, and bind to the cytoplasmic organelles and&#xD;
      nucleic acids. The optical signals are different, which makes it possible to distinguish the&#xD;
      morphological changes produced and that are directly related to the functionality of the&#xD;
      cell. Activated neutrophils and monocytes are characterized by increased &quot;deformability&quot;,&#xD;
      mobility, and their ability to adhere, granulate, and release cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPD values reflect the morphological and functional transformation of these activated&#xD;
      cells, offering very valuable information on the state of the cell and the patient at the&#xD;
      time of obtaining the sample. Recent studies have shown that these parameters are valuable&#xD;
      for the detection and control of infections and inflammation. Neutrophil structural&#xD;
      parameters NE-SSC, (NEUT GI granularity index) and NE-SFL (NEUT RI reactivity index) could&#xD;
      predict the appearance of later-stage infection markers, such as the presence of immature&#xD;
      granulocytes, suggesting that they can be used to detect bacterial infections very early. It&#xD;
      has been shown to be useful in acute bacterial infection, particularly in the differentiation&#xD;
      of bacterial infection and early detection of sepsis. The mean volume of the neutrophil and&#xD;
      its variability are more sensitive indicators of bacteremia than the leukocyte count and the&#xD;
      percentage of neutrophils. Neutrophils in sepsis are larger and their volumes more&#xD;
      heterogeneous than in the healthy population; the same happens to monocytes, larger and more&#xD;
      heterogeneous than in localized infections, and in the ROC analysis they had the highest&#xD;
      sensitivity for detection of sepsis. Lymphocyte CPDs show specific changes in viral&#xD;
      infection, providing potential for differential diagnosis between viral and bacterial&#xD;
      infection. Together, the CPDs support the differentiation between viral and bacterial&#xD;
      infections, or between acute or evolving infections, and if there is an inflammatory&#xD;
      condition without infection, with better diagnostic performance, especially in postsurgical&#xD;
      bacterial infection, than the conventional parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The available literature has focused on the potential usefulness of CPD in diagnosis, but we&#xD;
      do not have data on prognostic value or its applicability to pneumonia. The classical&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers are expensive and often not accessible in clinical practice, while&#xD;
      the evaluation of new leukocyte markers through hematimetry analysis, cheaper and more&#xD;
      accessible in clinical practice, can help to monitor the inflammatory response and recognize&#xD;
      to patients who may have poor evolution. No study, to date, has related all these parameters&#xD;
      (CPDs) together with the severe evolution of pneumonia or mortality, nor have clear cut-off&#xD;
      points been established for each of them. We propose an observational study, in which these&#xD;
      markers are related to the severity and prognosis of CAP, and a comparison between them, in&#xD;
      addition to incorporating these biomarkers into the prognostic rules currently in use and&#xD;
      seeing how their predictive capacity is modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate de predictive ability of new biomarkers such as leukocyte morphology&#xD;
           parameters (CPDs) and their short-term change over time, with poor evolution (defined by&#xD;
           therapeutic failure, and/or the need for admission to high-monitoring units such as ICU&#xD;
           or Intermediate Respiratory Care Units and/or mortality in 30 days) in patients admitted&#xD;
           for community-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze the relationship between these biomarkers (CPDs) and the etiology of&#xD;
           pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the predictive capacity at baseline and during evolution of these markers of&#xD;
           leucocyte morphology (CPDs) with other frequently used biomarkers (CRP, PCT and pro-ADM)&#xD;
           in the cohort of patients admitted for community acquired pneumonia (CAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To incorporate these new biomarkers (CPDs) to the clinical prognostic scores such as&#xD;
           PSI, CURB-65, SCAP score and ATS/IDSA score with the aim of complementing them and&#xD;
           better identifying patients at high risk of poor evolution (who require monitoring and&#xD;
           more aggressive therapies) and identifying patients with less severe disease that can be&#xD;
           managed at the outpatient level, creating a new predictive rule with higher sensitivity&#xD;
           and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: Multicenter prospective observational study with longitudinal follow-up up&#xD;
           to 25 months (24 months of inclusion and follow-up up to 30 days) of patients who&#xD;
           attended the emergency services of the participating hospitals for community-acquired&#xD;
           pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scope of study: multicenter study to be carried out in 3 hospitals of the public&#xD;
           network, Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital (Galdakao), Basurto Hospital (Bilbao) and San Pedro&#xD;
           de Logroño Hospital. The first is a general acute teaching hospital that serves a&#xD;
           population of 300,000 inhabitants. The second, Basurto, is a general university acute&#xD;
           hospital that serves a population of 450,000 inhabitants. The third, San Pedro de&#xD;
           Logroño, is a general university acute care hospital with a reference population of&#xD;
           around 320,000 inhabitants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: We estimate, from studies carried out by our groups in previous years, to&#xD;
           include about 1000-1200 useful patients with pneumonia who will require hospital&#xD;
           admission in the 24-month recruitment period. Studies on the development of predictive&#xD;
           models establish that it is necessary to have at least 10 events of the dependent&#xD;
           variable of interest (in our case the dependent variables would be those included in the&#xD;
           poor evolution: therapeutic failure, admission to the ICU or to monitoring units such as&#xD;
           Intermediate Respiratory Care Units and in-hospital mortality/30 days; and on the other&#xD;
           hand the etiological diagnosis) for each independent variable included in the&#xD;
           multivariate logistic regression model. Given that our intention is to initially include&#xD;
           a limited but comprehensive number of variables in the multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
           models (predictably, not less than 2-3 but not more than 5), we estimate that it will be&#xD;
           necessary for 50 to 100 of these to occur. Events of the dependent variable in the&#xD;
           sample from which we will derive the most complex prediction rule to ensure that the&#xD;
           logistic regression model converges properly. Data previously collected tell us that the&#xD;
           number of events of our dependent variable would be a 5-6% mortality at 30 days for&#xD;
           hospitalized patients plus 7% therapeutic failure and 4-5% of patients admitted to&#xD;
           discharge units monitoring, which makes an expected number of events of the primary&#xD;
           variable to be about 100 events in the bypass sample. With the recruitment time shown in&#xD;
           this protocol and with data from 100 useful patients, we believe that it is sufficient&#xD;
           to meet the main objectives set forth and develop and validate the predictive models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sampling: consecutive sampling where all new cases of patients diagnosed with CAP will&#xD;
           be collected consecutively in the 3 participating hospitals during a period of 24&#xD;
           months, who meet the selection criteria and sign the informed consent until the&#xD;
           indicated sample size is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethical aspects: All participants will sign the informed consent after having discussed&#xD;
           with the investigators the objectives, risks and potential benefits of the study. The&#xD;
           rights of patients will at all times be protected by the Declaration of Helsinki. This&#xD;
           project will have the approval of the Ethics and Clinical Research Committee. The terms&#xD;
           relating to the protection of personal data will be updated in the subject information&#xD;
           sheet (HIP / CI) in relation to Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 of the European Parliament&#xD;
           and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the Protection of Data (RGPD) when the data&#xD;
           protection agency incorporates it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
           .Independent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Variables related to the patient's condition (socio-demographic, comorbidities,&#xD;
                physical examination, laboratory tests), duration of symptoms at the time of&#xD;
                diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Variables related to severity at the time of admission. The variables nedeed will&#xD;
                be collected to calculate the risk class established by the Pneumonia Severity&#xD;
                Index (PSI) scale, by the CURB-65 scale (Confusion, Urea nitrogen, Respiratory&#xD;
                rate, Blood pressure, age&gt; 65) by the SCAP scale and by the ATS / IDSA scale&#xD;
                collected during the first 8 hours of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Biomarker analysis (CPDs, PCR, Procalcitonin) will be performed at the time of&#xD;
                diagnosis in all patients and 72 hours after starting treatment. For the pro-ADM&#xD;
                analysis, a plasma extraction will be performed upon admission, 72 hours, which&#xD;
                will be frozen at -70º, for later centralized analysis. The PCR will be measured by&#xD;
                immunoturbidimetry on a Roche Modular platform (CRPLX, reference no. 3002039).&#xD;
                Procalcitonin and Pro-adrenomedullin, by immunolumonometric analysis (Time Resolved&#xD;
                amplified crytate Emission, Brahms Diagnostica, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
                The PDCs markers will be measured using the Sysmex XN analyzer that reports as&#xD;
                research parameters those related to leukocyte morphology (CPD), 6 numerical values&#xD;
                for each subpopulation, which describe each cell type according to size (volume),&#xD;
                complexity (cytoplasmic granules) and activation (nucleic acid content) as&#xD;
                described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
                A.For Neutrophils:&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  MO-Z, mean cell volume; MO-WZ dispersion of MO-Z values&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Variables related to evolution (variables that can be analyzed as independent in&#xD;
                some cases and as dependent in others).&#xD;
&#xD;
                .Early therapeutic failure (first 72 hours of treatment): when the clinical&#xD;
                situation deteriorates and is accompanied by hemodynamic instability, the&#xD;
                appearance or worsening of respiratory failure, the need for mechanical&#xD;
                ventilation, radiological progression or the appearance of a new infectious focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
                .Late therapeutic failure (after the first 72 hours of treatment): Admission to the&#xD;
                Intensive Care Unit and / or admission to the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit&#xD;
                (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
                .Complications established during its evolution: shock, respiratory failure (Po2 /&#xD;
                Fio2 &lt;250), renal failure (plasma creatinine&gt; 2 mg), pleural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Variables related to the treatment administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
                .Antibiotic administration prior to diagnosis and days of treatment .Class of&#xD;
                antibiotic used at the time of diagnosis. .Adherence of antibiotic treatment to&#xD;
                SEPAR regulations (categorical variable). .Time to go from intravenous to oral&#xD;
                medication. .Use of invasive mechanical ventilation and time with this treatment.&#xD;
                .Use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation and time with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Variables related to bacteriological diagnosis: At the time of diagnosis, all&#xD;
                patients will undergo a nasopharyngeal smear to perform an RT-PCR. In addition, the&#xD;
                bacteriological diagnosis will include 2 blood cultures, the determination of&#xD;
                urinary antigens of pneumococcus and legionella in the acute phase (BinaxNOW) and&#xD;
                the Serological tests for atypical bacteria and viruses both during the acute phase&#xD;
                and in remission or convalescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Main dependent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Main dependent variable: 30-day mortality, presence of therapeutic failure and need&#xD;
                for ICU and / or ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Microbiological diagnosis (bacterial / atypical / viral ..)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Mortality will be initially determined by means of a consultation established in&#xD;
                that period of time and in the absence of a telephone interview 30 days after&#xD;
                diagnosis. Deaths and their corresponding dates will be confirmed through hospital&#xD;
                computer support and by public records of death certificates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data processing procedure of this project will be established by following the following&#xD;
      steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A descriptive analysis of the recruited sample will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To create predictive models: a. The collected sample will be divided into two&#xD;
           subsamples: Derivation Group 1: The total sample will be divided into 60% for the&#xD;
           derivation of the predictive models for each of the results studied; Group 2 of&#xD;
           validation of the predictive rules: the models will be validated in this sample (40% of&#xD;
           the sample). b. In Group 1, you will identify the risk factors of risk factors and&#xD;
           create predictive models. The unit of study will be the patient (each patient can be&#xD;
           included only once). A bivariate analysis will be carried out to study which variables,&#xD;
           of the possible predictors, are related to each outcome parameter. Those variables with&#xD;
           a p-value &lt;0.20 and using variable selection techniques (LARS, LASSO, shrinkage), the&#xD;
           potential predictors to be introduced in a multivariate logistic regression model will&#xD;
           be identified. Those variables that are statistically significant will be chosen for the&#xD;
           final scale. C. In the same way, statistical techniques of machine learning will be&#xD;
           applied (random forest, neural networks, machine support vectors, nearest neighbor&#xD;
           classification methods). d. The outcome variable will also be taken as temporary&#xD;
           dependent variables (time until the event) and Cox regression models, competitive risk&#xD;
           models and joint models will be used following the same process as that described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Goodness of fit and comparison of the developed predictive models. On the one hand, in&#xD;
           the case of dichotomous dependent variables, the area under the ROC curve (AUC,&#xD;
           discriminative capacity) will be calculated, considering a value&gt; 0.80 as a robust&#xD;
           predictive model. In addition to the AUC, the calibration of the model will be estimated&#xD;
           through the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (good calibration for a p-value ≥0.05). Finally, the&#xD;
           different proposed models will be contrasted by constructing ROC curves and comparing&#xD;
           the respective ROC curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Internal validation of predictive models:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation of the predictive model will be carried out in the validation group (Group 2).&#xD;
      The predictive model and the scale will be validated in the second subsample, making use of&#xD;
      the predicted values obtained in the derivation sample.&#xD;

      In three of the hospital participant a sample of blood has been collected in each index&#xD;
      admission and stored in each Biobank with the purpose of stuying some biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflamation. In these cases, the patient must sign a specific additional informed consent&#xD;
      established by the Biobank. With each Biobank the method will be established for the&#xD;
