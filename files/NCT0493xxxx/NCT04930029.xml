  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The omega gastric bypass (OAGB) is developing worldwide as an alternative to the Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass (RYGB). Cases of nutrition deficiency after OAGB, in particular protein deficency, are&#xD;
      regularly reported in the literature, raising the question of the medium/long-term safety of&#xD;
      this procedure. In its technology assessment report issued in September 2019 (HAS, 2019), the&#xD;
      Haute Autorité de Santé rules on the invalidity of OAGB with a 200 cm biliary limb and the&#xD;
      lack of sufficient data on the safety of OAGB with a 150 cm biliary limb compared to RYGB.&#xD;
      The lack of long-term data on weight, resolution of comorbidities, quality of life, and&#xD;
      endoscopic evaluation given the risk of lower esophageal cancer is also noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare the incidence of serious adverse events related&#xD;
      to surgery after OAGB at 10 years, according to 2 types of loop: a realization with a 150-cm&#xD;
      biliary loop (OAGB AB150) versus a realization with a 200-cm biliary loop (OAGB AB200).&#xD;
