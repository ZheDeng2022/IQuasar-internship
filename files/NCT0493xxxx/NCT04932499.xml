  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health care professionals are dedicated to the ongoing evaluation of the peri-operative&#xD;
      experience, and always striving to improve patient satisfaction. There are extensive&#xD;
      protocols and communication strategies to optimize pre-operative education, intra-operative&#xD;
      comfort and safety, and post-operative pain control, but most strategies are carried out by&#xD;
      the treating team. The idea of using mindfulness to empower patients to be active&#xD;
      participants in reducing pain and anxiety has already been successful in a number of medical&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of mindfulness based stress reduction&#xD;
      and mindfulness based cognitive therapy, a modification to treat depression. Mindfulness has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce catastrophizing, depression and disability, all of which are of concern&#xD;
      with respect to long-term success after arthroplasty. There is limited evidence to&#xD;
      demonstrate the usefulness of mindfulness as a peri-operative intervention. Although there is&#xD;
      evidence that a brief mindfulness meditation session can impact experimental pain scores and&#xD;
      anxiety, there is no current literature that has evaluated the impact of such a session as&#xD;
      part of the peri-operative teaching protocol with respect to pain and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to assess the capability of a short-term mindfulness intervention (serving&#xD;
      as a compliment to the pre-operative pathway for total joint arthroplasty) to reduce&#xD;
      peri-operative pain that can be integrated with the existing arthroplasty pathway. In&#xD;
      addition, we explore the utility of using such a tool to reframe patients' expectation of the&#xD;
      peri-operative period as evidence by its impact on anxiety and post-operative patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-two participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to either control or&#xD;
      treatment groups. The control group will receive standard care associated with total joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty. The treatment group will receive a 45-60 minute mindfulness meditation teaching&#xD;
      session administered by a credentialed mindfulness instructor and affiliated with the&#xD;
      University of Calgary Psychosocial Oncology Mindfulness Program in addition to standard care&#xD;
      for arthroplasty surgery. The treatment group will be assigned &quot;homework&quot; recordings of body&#xD;
      scan exercises and asked to listen to the recording daily for the two-week period prior to&#xD;
      surgery. Patients will be asked to listen to their body scan meditation immediately prior to&#xD;
      entering the operating room and daily each post-operative day while in hospital. Longitudinal&#xD;
      assessments encompassing the preoperative, peri-operative and post-operative periods will be&#xD;
      acquired using validated pain scores and anxiety outcomes scores including the Numerical&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)&#xD;
      and the short-form State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.&#xD;
