    <textblock>
      Studies have determined that compared to cognitively intact older adults (CIOA), older adults&#xD;
      with mild cognitive impairment (OAwMCI) exhibit more pronounced balance and gait impairments&#xD;
      which lead to an increased risk of falls and mobility decline. Such impairments are evident&#xD;
      during dual-tasking (i.e., simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor task) and OAwMCI&#xD;
      have demonstrated an increased cognitive-motor interference (deteriorated performance of&#xD;
      either or both cognitive/motor task). Furthermore, our preliminary laboratory findings&#xD;
      indicate that compared to CIOA, OAwMCI in response to large-magnitude treadmill perturbations&#xD;
      exhibits poor reactive responses (first line of defense against balance loss) and are unable&#xD;
      to modulate their responses as the magnitude of perturbation increases. Despite that&#xD;
      conventional exercise methods offer beneficial effects; they comprise of self-initiated&#xD;
      task-specific exercises and may not focus on training reactive responses. Additionally, due&#xD;
      to the presence of subtle balance and gait deficits, clinical measures used may not be&#xD;
      sensitive enough to determine the risk of fall post-training. Furthermore, these training&#xD;
      methods incorporate multiple sessions due to which adherence to exercise training is&#xD;
      difficult with only a fraction of the older adults benefiting from it. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      essential to incorporate a task-specific strategy that promotes factors associated with&#xD;
      falling like balance control, muscular responses, coordination of limbs, and cognition&#xD;
      through which OAwMCI may acquire maximum benefits to prevent a balance loss. One feasible&#xD;
      method, which harnesses technology that can be used to deliver balance disturbances either&#xD;
      while standing or walking in a consistent and controlled manner, is via a custom-based&#xD;
      motorized treadmill. The scientific rigor from preliminary studies has reported a successful&#xD;
      reduction of falls through a single session exposing CIOA to multiple treadmill-induced&#xD;
      perturbations during gait and has shown significant improvement in reactive responses. For&#xD;
      that reason, this stage 1 pilot study will examine the feasibility, applicability, and&#xD;
      tolerability of a combined cognitive, and perturbation training on biomechanical determinants&#xD;
      associated with falls and promote physical activity: kinematic variables, muscular responses,&#xD;
      and cognitive function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the cognitive decline and poor reactive responses among OAwMCI, it is essential to&#xD;
      incorporate a strategy to enhance cognition and motor performance for promoting healthy&#xD;
      aging. For this reason, we propose this study that aims to determine the feasibility,&#xD;
      applicability and tolerability of a dual-task perturbation training paradigm in OAwMCI. This&#xD;
      involves a treadmill induced perturbation training while concurrently performing a cognitive&#xD;
      task with an aim to improve effective compensatory stepping strategies to prevent balance&#xD;
      loss. Further, while testing on laboratory induced perturbations may provide an insight into&#xD;
      understanding kinematic variables, evaluating the change on performance-based outcome measure&#xD;
      may be clinically useful. The overall aim of this proposal to examine the central mechanisms&#xD;
      of reactive balance control and perturbation-training adaptation to improve fall-resisting&#xD;
      skills in healthy older adults and people with MCI using the following set of aims. Aim 1: To&#xD;
      examine biomechanical and neuromuscular differences during reactive balance control against&#xD;
      mechanical perturbations during stance and gait between OAwMCI and CIOA. Compared to CIOA,&#xD;
      OAwMCI will show: H1.1. greater falls due to impaired biomechanical (delayed step initiation,&#xD;
      lower reactive stability and greater limb support descent) and neuromuscular responses&#xD;
      (longer postural response latencies and fewer muscle synergies with different structural&#xD;
      activation) on novel stance and gait perturbations, which will worsen with dual task&#xD;
      performance; H1.2. reduced modulation (scaling) of biomechanical and neuromuscular responses&#xD;
      with increasing perturbation intensity; H1.3. slower rate of adaptation in stability control&#xD;
      and muscle synergy adjustment with repeated perturbation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To relate impairments observed during reactive balance control in perturbed stance and&#xD;
      gait with structural brain integrity, cognition and falls in OAwMCI. These older adults will&#xD;
      display H2.1: Lower gray matter volume in fronto-pareital cortex and brainstem, and lower&#xD;
      white matter integrity in sensorimotor pathways which will significantly correlate with poor&#xD;
      performance on reactive stepping response; H2.2: Lower scores on neuropsychological battery&#xD;
      test and NIH cognitive toolbox examining domains of executive function (attention, cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility and response inhibition), visuo-spatial awareness, episodic memory which will&#xD;
      correlate with deteriorated reactive stepping response. H2.3: Fall-Index computed from&#xD;
      measures of reactive stability and limb support that are obtained from perturbation-based&#xD;
      reactive measures will better discriminate prospective laboratory induced and real-life falls&#xD;
      than conventional instrumented (postural sway and limits of stability) and performance-based&#xD;
      clinical measures of balance and mobility, with increased predictive accuracy of Fall-Index&#xD;
      under dual-task conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine if deficits in reactive balance responses contribute to increased falls&#xD;
      in OAwMCI during static and dynamic tasks than CIOA especially under dual-tasking. H2.1:&#xD;
      Measures of reactive stability and limb support under dual-task conditions during perturbed&#xD;
      gait will best discriminate retrospective and laboratory induced falls in this population.&#xD;
      H2.2 Predictive accuracy of Fall-Index which will be greater than of clinical measures of&#xD;
      balance and mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine the feasibility and potential effectiveness of novel 6-week&#xD;
      perturbation-based cognitive-motor intervention for improving fall-resisting skills during&#xD;
      perturbed stance and gait. H3.1: Post-training OAwMCI will improve stability control,&#xD;
      cognition and reduced laboratory falls, especially under dual-task conditions. H3.2: Baseline&#xD;
      cognition and structural brain integrity/connectivity will predict change in stability&#xD;
      control and fall-risk. H3.3. Improvements in stability control, cognition and falls reduction&#xD;
      will be retained for at least 3 months post withdrawal of intervention resulting in improved&#xD;
      community ambulation and reduced fear of falling and perceived cognitive load on activities&#xD;
      of daily living&#xD;

    <description>Perturbation is induced successfully and safely to reproduce inadvertent falls in a protective laboratory environment. Falls will be measured by the amount of body weight supported by the full-body harness system and measured by a load cell attached to this system. Instability of the body's COM and poor limb support prior to touchdown of the recovery step account for 90~100% of subsequent falls (occurring ~500ms later) in both sit-to-stand-slip and in gait-slip, in the laboratory settings. Intervention consists of repeated perturbation training to induce a change in the laboratory induced falls immediately post-training and examine it's retention after the initial training session.</description>

    <description>Reactive balance control will be examined via the stance perturbation test under single and dual-task conditions (simultaneous performance of Letter number sequencing task or auditory stroop task).

The position is normalized with the individual's foot length, and velocity by square root of gravitational acceleration and individual's body height.
