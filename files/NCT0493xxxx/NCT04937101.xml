  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of chronic inflammatory skin diseases is a difficult point in clinical&#xD;
      diseases, which mainly include patients with pathological scars, sarcoidosis and chronic&#xD;
      eczema. Chronic nodular lesions and long-term itching symptoms bring great physical and&#xD;
      mental pain to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term repeated treatments are required. At present, the most commonly used treatment is&#xD;
      intralesional injection of glucocorticoids. Long-term glucocorticoid injections have some&#xD;
      side effects, including pain, hypopigmentation, skin atrophy, pigmentation, telangiectasia&#xD;
      and menstrual disorders in women. There are a large number of clinical patients who still&#xD;
      lack safe and effective drugs, including children, pregnant women, patients with weakened or&#xD;
      defective immunity, and even patients with mild inflammatory skin diseases with mainly&#xD;
      itching symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The systemic and topical application of antihistamine drugs provides new ideas for the&#xD;
      treatment of inflammatory skin. As the most commonly used clinical antihistamine,&#xD;
      chlorpheniramine has a long history in the treatment of allergic diseases and can improve the&#xD;
      body's inflammatory state. At the same time, the drug has high safety and is suitable for&#xD;
      children and pregnant women, or patients with underlying diseases such as hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, and immunodeficiency diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, there are more and more reports about the application of antihistamines to the&#xD;
      treatment of pathological scars. Exposing fibroblasts from normal skin and keloids to the&#xD;
      antihistamine diphenhydramine can inhibit the growth of keloid fibroblasts . Based on the&#xD;
      existing research foundation in the field and the results of our previous laboratory&#xD;
      experiments, we hypothesize that intralesional injection of chlorpheniramine can improve the&#xD;
      pruritus symptoms and the severity of skin lesions in inflammatory skin diseases, and can be&#xD;
      used as a new application of traditional medicine.&#xD;
