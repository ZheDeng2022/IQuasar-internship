  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scabies is a Neglected Tropical Disease, particularly important in autochthonous populations.&#xD;
      Treatment failures could explain the high prevalence of this disease in Amerindian and Maroon&#xD;
      populations of French Guiana. Our main objective is to look for specific sociodemographic&#xD;
      risk factors for treatment failure of scabies in the remote areas of French Guiana. A&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate the prevalence of scabies and its complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scabies is known to be a health issue of particular importance in marginal and autochthonous&#xD;
      populations throughout the world. French Guiana is a French territory harbouring several&#xD;
      autochthonous populations living in remote rainforest areas. The prevalence of scabies&#xD;
      remains high in these areas despite primary care offered by the local health centres. A&#xD;
      prevalence of 2.5% was found in two Amerindian villages in a retrospective study in 2019.&#xD;
      Therapeutic failures are known to be one of the main causes of a long-lasting high&#xD;
      prevalence. In low-resources populations, socio-economic factors and promiscuity are&#xD;
      particularly incriminated. The role played by these factors should be studied in French&#xD;
      Guiana. Secondary complications such as impetigo and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis&#xD;
      should be evaluated, as they represent an important part of the global burden of scabies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted from April to August 2021 in remote settlements of French&#xD;
      Guiana. Patients will be seen during a first inclusion consultation, realized by the same&#xD;
      investigator (RB). All patients with diagnosis of &quot; confirmed &quot; or &quot; clinical &quot; scabies&#xD;
      according to the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies will be included in case&#xD;
      of agreement. Patients will be treated according to the current protocol in the Health&#xD;
      Centres for Remote Areas of French Guiana (according to the European guidelines for the&#xD;
      treatment of scabies: two doses of ivermectin 0.2mg/kg on day 1 and day 7 ; benzyl benzoate&#xD;
      10% or permethrin 5% for children under 15kg or pregnant women). The follow-up consultation&#xD;
      will take place six weeks later. The same investigator (RB) will assess treatment failure or&#xD;
      success.&#xD;

    <description>During the follow-up consultation, six weeks after inclusion (S6), data will be collected using a standardized digital questionnaire, including clinical features, economic, social and cultural characteristics, housing conditions and therapeutic details (type of environmental decontamination and treatment received). Data will then be compared between patients with therapeutic success or failure. A urine test strip will also be used during the S6 consultation to screen for proteinuria. The prevalence of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis will be extrapolated from that of proteinuria.</description>
