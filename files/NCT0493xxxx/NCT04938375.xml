  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To record adverse events and observe the safety profile of patients in cardiogenic shock who received concomitant treatment with Levosimendan and IV beta blocker</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the beta blocker until 7 days after the start of the Levosimendan treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of beta blocker: bradycardia/high-grade atrioventricular block/hypotension/noradrenaline increase/crystalloid resuscitation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure cardiac rhythm control; Measure heart rate control; Measure beta blocker dosages administered without adverse effects; Measure veno-arterial extra corporeal membranous oxygenation weaning rate; Measure resuscitation mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the beta blocker until 7 days after the start of the Levosimendan treatment ; Haemodynamic changes will be recorded every 2 hours from the start of the beta blocker</time_frame>
    <description>Description of adverse events related to beta blocker Efficacy of beta blocker (rhythm and/or rate control) Time to resolution after discontinuation of beta blocker in case of adverse event Maximum dosage of well-tolerated beta blocker; Evolution of the haemodynamic profile in the hours following the introduction of the beta blocker Resuscitation mortality Weaning from veno-arterial ECMO at D7 of Levosimendan treatment</description>
