  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation is common in the United States, with approximately 150,000 amputations&#xD;
      annually. Most individuals walking with a prosthesis demonstrate asymmetrical loading-i.e.,&#xD;
      they favor the amputated side by placing more weight and increased ground reaction forces&#xD;
      through the intact limb-which likely contributes to increased metabolic cost of walking. Lack&#xD;
      of adequate muscular strength in the lower limb to attenuate these forces places increased&#xD;
      stress on the joints, which may be displaced proximally, and may play a role in reported knee&#xD;
      and hip pain in the intact limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower limb muscle weakness following amputation has been well documented. Increasing&#xD;
      quadriceps strength is important after an amputation because it is positively correlated with&#xD;
      gait speed. Gait speed may also be associated with successful community mobility, which leads&#xD;
      to improved quality of life following amputation. Individuals with amputation who resume an&#xD;
      active lifestyle are able to maintain strength. However, these individuals represent a&#xD;
      minority of persons with lower limb amputation; most individuals report more barriers than&#xD;
      motivators to adopt an active lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemic conditioning (IC) may strengthen leg muscles and reduce the metabolic cost of&#xD;
      activity after amputation. In IC, the limb is exposed to brief, repeated bouts of ischemia&#xD;
      (reduced blood flow) immediately followed by reperfusion. IC has been shown to improve muscle&#xD;
      performance in healthy and diseased populations. IC has also been used more recently in&#xD;
      patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as an intervention to improve function, such as&#xD;
      walking ability. Acute exposure to IC increases muscle strength and activation, both in&#xD;
      healthy, active individuals and in those with severe neuromuscular dysfunction, such as&#xD;
      stroke survivors. IC also attenuates muscular fatigue. Increased fatigue resistance at&#xD;
      submaximal contraction levels following IC may be due to increased neural activation of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle. Changes in neural activation of muscle may be particularly beneficial during&#xD;
      cortical reorganization after amputation. Reduced quadriceps fatigue during submaximal&#xD;
      activities may also drive changes in gait kinematics, such as increased knee flexion during&#xD;
      loading and mid-stance. Exposure to IC may also increase the oxidative properties of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle, offering a direct pathway to reduce metabolic cost. Therefore, IC may lead to&#xD;
      cellular changes that lower the metabolic cost of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to quantify the benefits of acute and chronic IC on&#xD;
      quadriceps strength and walking economy in individuals with PAD and history of lower limb&#xD;
      amputation.&#xD;
