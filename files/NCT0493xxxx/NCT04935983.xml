    <textblock>
      It is well known that, even in quite homogenous populations, inter-individual variability in&#xD;
      fat oxidation during exercise, in particular MFO, is quite large. Individual factors like&#xD;
      gender, body composition (lean mass) and fitness level do explain a substantial part of this&#xD;
      variation. In addition, genetic factors do underlie differences between individuals. But also&#xD;
      'external factors' like nutritional status, i.e. a low or high carbohydrate (CHO)&#xD;
      availability, and exhaustion are likely linked to maximal fat oxidation, due to alterations&#xD;
      in substrate availability. The contribution of these external factors to alterations in&#xD;
      substrate utilization is, as of yet, unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to establish the impact of pre-exercise CHO availability and exhaustion on&#xD;
      maximal fat oxidation (MFO &amp; FATmax) during exercise&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: During exercise, energy expenditure increases dramatically, with exercise&#xD;
      intensity as the single most important factor influencing substrate utilization. It is&#xD;
      commonly reported that fat oxidation increases as exercise intensity increases, up to a&#xD;
      certain point. At higher exercise intensities, fat oxidation declines quite rapidly, despite&#xD;
      increased energy requirements, and carbohydrate becomes the predominant, and finally the only&#xD;
      fuel source during (aerobic) exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximal capacity of the human body to oxidize fat during exercise can quantitatively be&#xD;
      described by the so-called 'MFO' and 'FATmax'. The MFO (maximal fat oxidation) is the highest&#xD;
      absolute level of fat oxidation as expressed in gram per minute (g/min), while FATmax is the&#xD;
      exercise intensity at which fat oxidation is highest (%VO2max or %HFmax). These concepts may&#xD;
      have importance for endurance training and performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that, even in quite homogenous populations, inter-individual variability in&#xD;
      fat oxidation, in particular MFO, is quite large. Individual factors like gender, body&#xD;
      composition (lean mass) and fitness level do explain a substantial part of this variation. In&#xD;
      addition, genetic factors do underlie differences between individuals. But also 'external&#xD;
      factors' like nutritional status, i.e. a low or high carbohydrate (CHO) availability, and&#xD;
      exhaustion are likely linked to maximal fat oxidation, due to alterations in substrate&#xD;
      availability. The contribution of these external factors to alterations in substrate&#xD;
      utilization is, as of yet, unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators aim to establish the impact of pre-exercise CHO availability and&#xD;
      exhaustion on maximal fat oxidation (MFO &amp; FATmax) during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study consist of two parts. In part I the impact of carbohydrate&#xD;
      availability will be assessed, in part II the impact of exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part I (cross-over design) subjects will perform an graded exercise test to measure&#xD;
      maximal fat oxidation ('fatmax test'). At one occasion with low CHO, the other time with high&#xD;
      CHO. The order will be randomised. One week will be considered in between conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part II (single-arm intervention), subjects will do the graded exercise test twice on a&#xD;
      single day, but now with an exhaustive exercise session ('training') of ~ 90 min in between,&#xD;
      to induce exhaustion In both parts, the experimental testing will be preceded by a visit in&#xD;
      which body composition is measured and subjects are familiarised to the test procedures. In&#xD;
      addition, a physical activity questionnaire and a 3 day food record will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The graded exercise test is the so-called 'fatmax test' as described by Achten and Jeukendrup&#xD;
      (2003). Participants start with a warming up at 95W (males) or 60 W (females), after which&#xD;
      intensity will be increased every 3 min with 35 W, till exhaustion. Heart rate as well as&#xD;
      oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) will be monitored, to obtain&#xD;
      fat oxidation rates and maximal aerobic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The population of this study will consist of both males and females, aged&#xD;
      20 to 35, with a BMI of 18.5 to 27 kg/m2. A participant should be recreationally active,&#xD;
      defined as minimal of 3 hours training per week, and a maximum of 10 hours a week. Their&#xD;
      sports activity should have an endurance component Participant do not smoke and are healthy,&#xD;
      and comply with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: In this part of the study the pre-exercise availability of carbohydrates will be&#xD;
      manipulated. Before measuring maximal fat oxidation during exercise, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly-assigned to a 36 hour period (i.e an afternoon, a single day plus a breakfast) of&#xD;
      either a low CHO / high fat diet (~65 %en by fat) or an equal energy (isocaloric), high&#xD;
      carbohydrate diet (~65 %en by CHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: in this part the intervention is a 'training session' of 90 min at 60% Wmax, with&#xD;
      every 15 min a high intensity bout of exercise of 2 min (90%Wmax). This is to simulate a&#xD;
      training session, and induce exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day before the trials, participants have to refrain from exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are the MFO and FATmax as assessed&#xD;
      with indirect calorimetry (VO2, VCO2) during a graded exercise test (35W/ 3min protocol). In&#xD;
      order to calculate MFO and FATmax, oxygen consumption (VO2) and CO2 production (VCO2) are&#xD;
      measured. From these values the respiratory exchange ration (RER) can be calculated, and fat&#xD;
      oxidation will be quantified according to the equations of Frayn.&#xD;
