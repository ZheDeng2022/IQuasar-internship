      The investigators will evaluate the effects of higher protein/amino acid dosing (≥2.2 g/kg/d)&#xD;
      vs usual care of protein/amino acid dosing (≤1.2 g/kg/d) over muscle mass in nutritionally&#xD;
      high risk ill patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EFFORT Outcomes is a sub-study of the parent EFFORT trial; a multi-center, pragmatic,&#xD;
      volunteer-driven, registry-based, randomized, clinical trial of 4000 nutritionally high-risk&#xD;
      critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Patients will be randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment groups: a usual care prescription (≤1.2 g/kg/d) or a higher prescription (≥2.2&#xD;
      g/kg/d) of protein. Other than the protein amount the patient is randomized to, the remainder&#xD;
      of care provided to randomized patient will be at the discretion of ICU providers. In both&#xD;
      groups, targets will be achieved through any combination of enteral nutrition (high protein&#xD;
      content in high group if available), protein supplements, and parenteral nutrition or amino&#xD;
      acids only (as clinically available). The only difference between the 2 groups is the protein&#xD;
      targets that are set. Similar efforts should be used in both groups to achieve at least 80%&#xD;
      of these targets. The remainder of care provided to eligible patients will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of ICU providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients included in the OUTCOMES sub-study, we will test the patient's functional&#xD;
      recovery and long-term quality of life. Patients will undergo the US measures at baseline&#xD;
      (within 24 hours of randomization, 10 days post randomization (if still in hospital) and just&#xD;
      prior to hospital discharge. In the event that hospital discharge is prior to day 10, the day&#xD;
      10 measure will not be done. To ensure standardization and quality in the measures, we have&#xD;
      created high quality training materials and will have US films sent centrally to abstract all&#xD;
      measurements. In the first 10 patients enrolled in the US sub-study, participating sites will&#xD;
      conduct a run-in phase where their submitted data will be evaluated for quality and&#xD;
      reliability (both intra and inter-rater reliability) to ensure subsequent measures are of&#xD;
      high quality. Nutritional and clinical data for these patients will be included in the parent&#xD;
      EFFORT trial but the US measures may be omitted if quality is poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator has posed the following research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome of the OUTCOMES Sub-study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the walking distance achieved during a 6-minute walk test (6MWT)&#xD;
      measured at hospital discharge. Implementation of the test will be based upon the 2014 ATS&#xD;
      standards, with adaptation, as needed, for the in-patient setting and ICU survivor&#xD;
      population. The 6MWT is a reliable, valid, responsive measure of physical function for&#xD;
      survivors of acute respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures for this OUTCOMES sub-study will include;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall strength using Medical Research Council (MRC) sum-score evaluated via&#xD;
           standardized &quot;manual muscle testing&quot; with each of 12 muscle groups assessed using a&#xD;
           6-point MRC scale and summed to a total score (range: 0-60).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quadriceps force, via hand-held dynamometry (HHD) for of both lower extremities. Each&#xD;
           will be scored by, averaging the results of 3 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Distal strength measured via isometric handgrip strength via a hydraulic hand&#xD;
           dynamometer performed bilaterally as per American Society of Hand Therapist guidelines&#xD;
           and evaluated using normal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) which measures balance, walking speed and&#xD;
           rising from a chair&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Functional Status Score for ICU (FSS-ICU), which is a 5-item, 35-point assessment of bed&#xD;
           mobility, transfers, and ambulation. designed for ICU patients, and was designed and&#xD;
           validated specifically in ICU patients evaluated 8-point Functional Independence Measure&#xD;
           (FIM) response scale used throughout rehabilitation assessments, and is responsive to&#xD;
           change during recovery for ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, outcomes after hospital discharge will be assessed via 6-month phone-based follow-up.&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life (QOL) will be measured using SF-36 version 2 (SF-36 v2) and&#xD;
      EQ-5D-5L. The SF-36 is valid and reliable across a variety of patient groups, including ICU&#xD;
      survivors. The EQ-5D-5L is included, in addition to SF-36 v2, because it is suitable for&#xD;
      patients with inattention and fatigue, recommended for use in ICU survivors. Physical&#xD;
      functional status will be measured using Katz activities of daily living (ADL) and Lawton's&#xD;
      Instrumental ADL (IADL). In order to improve retention, a call will be made to participants&#xD;
      at 3 months to update contact information and act as a reminder of upcoming follow-up&#xD;
      assessments to be completed at the 6-month time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Hypothesis: Compared to receiving a lower dose of protein/amino acids, the&#xD;
      administration of a higher dose of protein/amino acids (a consequence of having a higher&#xD;
      prescription) to nutritionally high-risk critically ill patients will be associated with&#xD;
      greater muscle mass, improved survival and a quicker rate of recovery.&#xD;
