    <textblock>
      SCALE-UP Utah is a community-academic partnership to address COVID-19 among Utah community&#xD;
      health centers. The long-term objective of the project is to increase the reach, acceptance,&#xD;
      uptake, and long-term sustainability of COVID-19 screening and testing among Utah's Community&#xD;
      Health Center patient population. The study will compare two practical, feasible, scalable&#xD;
      interventions to increase COVID-19 testing uptake in Utah Community Health Centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Text Messaging (TM): population health management (PHM) intervention that analyzes EHR&#xD;
           data to automatically identify patients with high risk for either infection or severe&#xD;
           disease, reaches and screens those patients, and addresses testing logistics using&#xD;
           bi-directional text messaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Navigation (PN): PHM intervention to increase testing uptake among eligible&#xD;
           patients (identified via TM) using patient navigation (e.g., motivating patients,&#xD;
           addressing logistics and barriers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will employ a rapid cycle research approach in which interventions are tested on&#xD;
      a small scale, using short time frames (e.g., &lt;1 month) and cyclical evaluation cycles. The&#xD;
      process will entail implementing interventions in a small number of clinics/patients,&#xD;
      evaluating the results, and either adapting the intervention based on results (and&#xD;
      retesting), or disseminating the results to other clinics/patients. A critical aspect of&#xD;
      these rapid-research cycles is that change can be quickly tested on a small scale, and then&#xD;
      disseminated to other clinics/patients. Moreover, we are able to update and adapt the&#xD;
      interventions based on changes in guidelines, testing, procedures, etc. throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement and evaluate PHM interventions for increasing the uptake of COVID-19 testing&#xD;
           among CHC patients across Utah. Our primary outcome, Uptake-Eligible, is defined as the&#xD;
           proportion of patients who are tested for COVID-19 out of the patients who meet&#xD;
           screening criteria for COVID-19 testing. Our study hypothesis is that patients in the&#xD;
           TM+PN cohort will have higher rates of uptake-eligible than those in the TM cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine implementation effectiveness outcomes, as well as characteristics of both&#xD;
           clinics and patients that may influence intervention effects and implementation&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCALE-UP Utah is a patient-level intervention involving 12 Community Health Centers (39&#xD;
      individual clinics) across Utah. The study is designed to utilize Community Health Center&#xD;
      participant records to proactively reach participants for COVID-19 screening and testing.&#xD;
      This intervention includes a randomization component between two interventions, text&#xD;
      messaging (TM) or text messaging with patient navigation (TM+PN). These two intervention&#xD;
      paths are occurring simultaneously within the same clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text messaging (TM) and text messaging with patient navigation (TM+PN)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the TM condition will receive HIPAA-compliant bidirectional text messages.&#xD;
      Texts will include a brief message regarding COVID-19 risk and will screen for if the&#xD;
      participant or someone in their close social network should get tested. Participants who&#xD;
      reply &quot;yes&quot; will receive additional messages with a recommendation to be tested, testing&#xD;
      locations/hours/phone, resources about what to do if they test positive. Participants who&#xD;
      reply &quot;no&quot; will receive a text with the clinic phone number and a note to call if anything&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the TM+PN condition will receive the same text messages as the patients in&#xD;
      the TM condition. Text messages will include a brief message regarding risk and will screen&#xD;
      for if the patient should get tested. Patients who reply &quot;yes&quot; will receive a notice that a&#xD;
      Community Health Worker will contact them for patient navigation. The Patient Navigation&#xD;
      includes practical advice from navigators to address barriers to testing such as logistics,&#xD;
      transportation, and expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step One: Primary Data Extraction To identify the cohort for the TM and TM+PN interventions,&#xD;
      a subset of EHR data will be manually extracted from the Community Health Centers as text&#xD;
      files generated by EHR reports. The first set of EHR reports will contain all patients seen&#xD;
      at each of the Community Health Centers in the last 3 years. Subsequent reports will be&#xD;
      obtained weekly, including all encounters in the previous week. Data fields will include risk&#xD;
      factors such as age, gender, body mass index, encounter diagnoses for medical co-morbidities,&#xD;
      participant demographics (e.g., zip code, insurance status, preferred language,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity); as well as cellphone number for text messaging and patient navigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step Two: Randomization &amp; Cohort Selection Once the data are securely housed, all&#xD;
      participants will be assigned to either the TM or TM+PN arm of the intervention. This&#xD;
      assignment will remain consistent throughout the study. Cohort selection will be based on EHR&#xD;
      data considering factors such as age, race/ethnicity, language, relevant medical&#xD;
      comorbidities, and residence in hotspot areas. These selection criteria are consistent with&#xD;
      recommendations from Utah Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step Three: Implementation SCALE-UP Utah will send HIPPA-compliant bidirectional texts, which&#xD;
      is a communication method routinely used by the Community Health Centers, to patients in high&#xD;
      risk cohorts. Text messages will be designed by the research team and sent using a HIPPA&#xD;
      compliant text messaging service. The text messaging service will retrieve the participant&#xD;
      cohort from the study database to send the texts to the participants. The text messages will&#xD;
      appear to the participants as having originated from their Community Health Center. As part&#xD;
      of their general Community Health Center care, participants have agreed to be contacted by&#xD;
      their Community Health Center and text message communication is one of those established&#xD;
      contact methods. Text messages will be repeated weekly, as needed, to continuously screen for&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing eligibility and to provide updates. Every text message will include the&#xD;
      option to reply STOP to opt-out of receiving text messages at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The text messaging and patient navigation arms of the study will proactively provide patients&#xD;
      with access to informative resources describing what would happen if they test positive and&#xD;
      where to seek help.&#xD;
