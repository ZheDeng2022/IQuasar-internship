    <textblock>
      In this study, the effects of core stabilization and computerized wobble board exercise&#xD;
      training programs on postural balance and functional exercise capacity in patients over 60&#xD;
      years of age with heart failure will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of core stabilization group (CSG), wobble board group (WBG) and&#xD;
      control group. In CSG, exercises that focus basically on the abdominal, pelvic floor, trunk&#xD;
      extensor and diaphragm muscles and comply with core stabilization criteria will be applied.&#xD;
      In WBG, balance exercises which focus primarily lower limb and trunk muscles, will be&#xD;
      performed on computerized wobble board with visual feed-back provided by computerized wobble&#xD;
      board. In control group, no exercise will be performed, only the evaluation procedure will be&#xD;
      applied at the beginning and 8 weeks later. It was planned to include in total of 36 patients&#xD;
      and will be randomized them into three groups with 12 patients. Following the initial&#xD;
      assessment, each patient will participate in a one-session patient education program. After&#xD;
      that, patients in CSG and WBG will participate in their exercise training program which&#xD;
      supervised by physiotherapist, 3 days a week for 8 weeks.When the exercise training programs&#xD;
      for 8 weeks were completed, initial evaluations will be re-applied. Collected data will be&#xD;
      analyzed with SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) program. The differences between pre-&#xD;
      and post-treatment evaluations will be analyzed with &quot;paired t test&quot; and/ or &quot; wilcoxon&#xD;
      test&quot;.The differences between three groups will be analyzed with one-way analysis of variance&#xD;
      and/ or Kruskal-Wallis test.&#xD;

    <description>Functional balance is going to evaluate with &quot;berg balance scale&quot;. The scale consists of 14 items including sitting, standing up and standing up on one foot positions.Each item is scored between &quot;0(unable)&quot; to &quot;4(independent) &quot; according to success of participant. Total score is obtained by summing the scores of all items. Maximum score is 56. Scores of 0 to 20 represent balance impairment, 21 to 40 represent acceptable balance, and 41 to 56 represent good balance</description>

    <measure>Postural swing assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Postural swing will have been assessed using with computerized wobble board. The participant's swings on the device are measured in the antreroposterior and mediolateral directions. Measurements are performed by the device including accelerometer which has 10 degrees of tilt angle.</description>

    <description>&quot;OctoCore application&quot; is going to be used for core stabilization assessment. The application consists of two phase. The first phase is performed with single left deadline test and bird- dog exercise test is applied in second phase. Measurement of the acceleration during tests will be performed by using smart phone which has &quot;OctoCore application&quot; putting on mid-line of participant's fourth lumbar vertebra.</description>

    <description>Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire will be utilized for evaluation. The questionnaire consists of 21 items and two sub-dimension. The sub-dimensions are as follows; physical and emotional. Each item is scored between &quot;0 (no)&quot; to &quot;5 (too much)&quot;. Total score changes betwen 0 and 105. Lower point demonstrates good quality of life.</description>

    <description>This arm consists core stabilization exercises including abdominal hallowing, supine bride, bride dog, side plank, curl-up and modified push up exercise. Each session is going to begin with warm-up training which consist of stretching exercise for upper-limb, lower-limb and trunk muscles, and complete with cool down exercise (same with warm-up training). Patients are going to attend one session of patient education before the first session.</description>
