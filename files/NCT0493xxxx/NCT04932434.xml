  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single-arm pilot study of oral psilocybin therapy for depression and&#xD;
      anxiety in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The primary goal is to examine safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and feasibility of the intervention in this patient population. We will enroll&#xD;
      ten people ages 40 to 75 with clinically diagnosed early stage Parkinson's Disease who meet&#xD;
      DSM-5 criteria for a depressive or anxious disorder and meet all other inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria at screening. After baseline assessments, participants will complete&#xD;
      preparation sessions with trained facilitators followed by an initial drug administration&#xD;
      session during which they will receive a low-moderate dose (10 mg) oral psilocybin in a&#xD;
      supervised setting with safety monitoring by facilitators and a physician. Participants who&#xD;
      do not experience significant adverse events during or following the session will complete a&#xD;
      second drug administration session approximately two weeks later during which they will&#xD;
      receive a moderate-high dose (25 mg) oral psilocybin. The second session will involve the&#xD;
      same procedures and level of monitoring as the first. Participants will subsequently complete&#xD;
      multiple follow-up sessions to assess PD motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, and function.&#xD;
      They will also complete integration sessions with facilitators to provide psychological&#xD;
      support. Follow-up will continue to 3 months after the second psilocybin administration&#xD;
      session. Primary endpoints will assess safety, tolerability and feasibility of study&#xD;
      procedures. Exploratory efficacy endpoints will assess changes in depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      anxious symptoms, and related measures of function/quality of life.&#xD;
