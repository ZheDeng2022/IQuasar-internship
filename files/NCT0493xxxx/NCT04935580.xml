  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, single-center prospective study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of GC012F as frontline therapy for transplant eligible multiple myeloma(MM) patients&#xD;
      with high-risk profile. Patients enrolled will be newly diagnosed treatment na√Øve patients&#xD;
      who are eligible for transplant.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be leukapheresed prior to receiving up to 2 cycles of standard induction&#xD;
      therapy optional at physicians' choice. After the optional induction therapy, patients will&#xD;
      receive standard lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to&#xD;
      GC012F infusion. After a single infusion of GC012F, patients will be assessed for Response&#xD;
      Rate and depth of response at month 1. In case CR/sCR not achieved, patients will be&#xD;
      re-asssesd for depth of Response at month 3 post CART infusion. If at month 3 response is&#xD;
      less than CR/sCR, patients can proceed to transplant/anti-tumor therapy according to clinical&#xD;
      practice. In case CR/sCR is achieved at either month 1 or month 3, MRD will be assessed. In&#xD;
      case MRD positive, patient may receive a hematological stem cell transplant (HSCT) optional&#xD;
      or other anti-tumor therapy. Patients who obtain a CR/sCR at month 1 or month 3 according to&#xD;
      the IMWG criteria and are assessed MRD negative response will be confirmed by PET-CT scan and&#xD;
      they will continue to be observed. If patients obtain a MRD negative CR/sCR at month 1 then&#xD;
      additional assessment at month 3 is not necessary. MRD will be tested when CR/sCR is&#xD;
      achieved. At month 6 an additional response assessment will be conducted-maintenance therapy&#xD;
      can be given post month 6 at physicians' choice. Patients will continue to be followed and&#xD;
      assessed for duration of response at fixed timepoints at months 12, 18 and 24. Safety and&#xD;
      efficacy will be analyzed throughout the study at timepoints as per schedule of assessment&#xD;
      until the end of study.&#xD;
