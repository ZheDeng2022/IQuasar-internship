  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this non-interventional multicenter study is to provide prospective,&#xD;
      observational data on patients initiating treatment with palbociclib combination to&#xD;
      contribute to the knowledge of HR+ HER2-metastatic/locally advanced Breast Cancer (BC)&#xD;
      disease management, its treatment pattern, clinical outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in the&#xD;
      routine clinical practice in Africa and Middle East countries .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic/locally advanced BC whose treatment decision with&#xD;
      palbociclib has been made by their treating physician and who meet the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the study. Patients who initiate treatment with palbociclib&#xD;
      plus letrozole/aromatase inhibitor or palbociclib plus fulvestrant in line with the licensed&#xD;
      indication(s), as first or second line therapy for metastatic/locally advanced BC at&#xD;
      enrollment may be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables assessed in this study will be patient demographics, clinical characteristics,&#xD;
      comorbid conditions and concomitant medications, HR+ HER2-locally advanced and metastatic BC&#xD;
      treatment history, current BC treatment, performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
      Group (ECOG), clinical outcomes, and QoL. All assessments described in this protocol are&#xD;
      performed as part of normal clinical practice or standard practice guidelines for the patient&#xD;
      population and healthcare provider specialty in the countries where this non-interventional&#xD;
      study is being conducted. All data collected in this study are intended to capture the&#xD;
      real-world treatment patterns and outcomes for patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic/locally&#xD;
      advanced BC. An electronic case report form (eCRF) will be used for data collection.&#xD;
      Investigators will be trained with an initial on-site visit to the clinic on the protocol,&#xD;
      electronic data capture (EDC) system (i.e., eCRF), investigator site master file (ISMF),&#xD;
      documentation, and any applicable study processes. Any new information relevant to the&#xD;
      performance of this non-interventional study (NIS) will be forwarded to the medical staff&#xD;
      during the study. Remote data monitoring will be conducted during the life of the study to&#xD;
      ensure timely reporting of safety data, data integrity and consistency.&#xD;
