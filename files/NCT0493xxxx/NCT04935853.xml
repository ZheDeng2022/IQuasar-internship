  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify prognosis and predictive markers of response to&#xD;
      treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy,loco-regional treatments ) in patients&#xD;
      with bile duct cancer. The effectiveness and tolerance of these treatments in current&#xD;
      practice will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bile duct cancers are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors with a poor prognosis. Surgery is&#xD;
      the only curative modality for localized forms. Chemotherapy is the standard treatment in&#xD;
      advanced forms. Identification of prognostic and predictive markers to better stratify&#xD;
      patients and to guide therapeutic decisions is a major issue. It is retro-prospective&#xD;
      (diagnosis between 2003 and 2021) and prospective (diagnosis between 2021 and 2030)&#xD;
      multi-center, cohort study. Follow-up for 10 years from initial cancer diagnosis will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up is retrospective only for patients operated on or diagnosed in the past for more&#xD;
      than 10 years, and retro-prospective for operated patients or diagnosed in the past for less&#xD;
      than 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected for each patient are available during the life cycle of this clinical&#xD;
      trial to fulfil an educational requirement (e.g. a doctoral thesis) upon request and&#xD;
      authorization from the study committee and the study sponsor (GERCOR).&#xD;
