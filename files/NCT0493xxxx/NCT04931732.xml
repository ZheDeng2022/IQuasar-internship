      Gliomas represent the most frequent primary brain tumor, with 2,500 to 3,000 new cases per&#xD;
      year in France. Their diagnosis, although highly complex, is essential for determining&#xD;
      patient management. While grade I gliomas (infrequent) are curable by surgery or present a&#xD;
      slow progression, grades II to IV require heavy treatment (surgery and radio-chemotherapy),&#xD;
      and are associated with a prognosis ranging from 10-15 years for grade II to only 15 months&#xD;
      for glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key processes in glioma oncogenesis is the activation of a telomeric maintenance&#xD;
      mechanism (TMM). Two TMMs ensure the maintenance of a telomere size compatible with intense&#xD;
      cell proliferation (TERT mutation and ATRX loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid biopsy is used for the routine diagnosis and monitoring of treatment efficacy of&#xD;
      different cancers. To date, no routine clinical testing of liquid biopsies is available for&#xD;
      gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of glioma-specific oncogenic processes, by liquid biopsy, in peripheral blood&#xD;
      (ctDNA) could improve diagnosis and follow-up and then avoid surgery for patients with&#xD;
      suspected lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three oncogenic markers can be used to detect gliomas: IDH mutation, TERT mutation, and a&#xD;
      marker correlated with ATRX loss on total blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that the circTeloDIAG will improve and accelerate the diagnostic/prognostic&#xD;
      value of the actual classification and provide a new tool to manage patient response to&#xD;
      treatment via liquid biopsy. It will combine detection of three markers in liquid biopsy, to&#xD;
      produce a versatile tool for all types of gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent glioma will be included.&#xD;

      Gliomas, heterogeneous and aggressive tumors awaiting new therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors, with 2,500 to 3,000 new cases per year in&#xD;
      France. They concern the elderly but can also affect children and young adults. Their&#xD;
      diagnosis is often complex (differential diagnoses, delicate classification). However, this&#xD;
      diagnosis is essential to determine the therapeutic management. Thus, while grade I gliomas&#xD;
      (infrequent) are curable by surgery or have a slow progression, grades II to IV have a cost&#xD;
      in terms of therapeutic costs (surgery and radio-chemotherapy), in connection with a&#xD;
      prognosis ranging from heavy 10-15 years for grades II to only 15 months for glioblastoma&#xD;
      (grade IV). New biotherapies (such as anti-VEGF) have not improved the prognosis and to date&#xD;
      there are no targeted therapies or immune systems that have shown a benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is more than ever necessary to propose targeted treatments against alterations of each&#xD;
      type of glioma and to develop in parallel the therapeutic tests allowing their prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIAGNOSIS OF GLIOMAS: IMPORTANCE OF BIOMARKERS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of gliomas was subject to a high rate of inter-observer discrepancies.&#xD;
      Molecular criteria have recently made it possible to refine and secure the diagnosis1. Thus,&#xD;
      in hospital routine, mutations in Isocitrate Dehydrogenases (IDH1 and 2), 1p19q deletion,&#xD;
      EGFR amplification, loss of CDKN2A, mutations in histones H3.3 and H3.1 (G35R / V, K28M),&#xD;
      methylation of MGMT, as well as two telomeric markers: mutations of the TERT promoter&#xD;
      (TERTmt) and the deletion of ATRX (lost ATRX) (see below). Thus, the new &quot;histo-molecular&quot;&#xD;
      classification of WHO1 (2016) and its following updates define different classes of gliomas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oligodendrogliomas (OD) (IDHmt, 1p19q lost) (grades II-III)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IDHmt (A) Astrocytomas (IDHmt and ATRXperdu / TP53 positive) (grades II-III)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IDHmt Glioblastomas (GBM IDHmt) (IDHmt and ATRXperdu) (grade IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IDHwt (GBM) Glioblastomas (IDHwt and TERTmt) (grade IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IDHwt Astrocytomas (A IDHwt) (IDHwt) (grades II-III)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  midline mutated histone gliomas (G35R / V, K28M)&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this classification does not fully reflect the actual aggressiveness of the tumors&#xD;
      and has prognostic insufficiencies. Adaptations are therefore regularly made to these initial&#xD;
      categories. Despite these diagnostic adaptations, some tumors present discrepancies between&#xD;
      the immunohistological and molecular diagnosis, they are annotated NEC (Not Elsewhere&#xD;
      Classified).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIQUID BIOPSY: AN EXPECTED DIAGNOSIS TOOL FOR GLIOMAS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid biopsy-type approaches have rapidly developed in the clinic; they already make it&#xD;
      possible to monitor and / or participate in the diagnosis of various cancers on a routine&#xD;
      basis (eg: EGFR mutations in lung cancers). In the case of gliomas, their benefit is obvious:&#xD;
      in addition to imaging, or as a replacement for stereotaxic biopsy (1% mortality), they could&#xD;
      improve the quality of follow-up and speed up the initial diagnosis. In particular, 47% of&#xD;
      patients with GBM have an MRI imaging suggesting progression after radiotherapy, the&#xD;
      detection of a circulating marker would make it possible to differentiate a progression (27%)&#xD;
      from a &quot;pseudo-progression&quot; (20%). When monitoring gliomas, the reappearance of the&#xD;
      circulating marker would make it possible to objectify the recurrence and to set up a second&#xD;
      line or inclusion in a clinical trial more quickly. Finally, during the initial diagnosis,&#xD;
      the delay of one month after biopsy or surgery necessary for the conventional diagnostic&#xD;
      circuit could be reduced to one week thanks to this type of test; therapeutic management&#xD;
      could then be accelerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time, there is no such test for gliomas. However, preliminary studies carried out on&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected during surgery show a sensitivity of around 100% for the&#xD;
      detection of TERTmt9. However, the removal of LCS for follow-up is an invasive act to which&#xD;
      we should favor approaches by blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first studies of this type on circulating DNA (cfDNA) in plasma, via whole exome&#xD;
      sequencing (a very expensive technique) detected gene abnormalities in nearly 50% of the&#xD;
      cfDNAs analyzed. However, detection of diagnostic hotspots characteristic of gliomas such as&#xD;
      TERTmt is insufficient on cfDNA (0-8% detection for glioblastomas). Other studies have looked&#xD;
      at the analysis of tumor DNA carried by exosome-like vesicles, but have not been&#xD;
      satisfactory. Finally, an alternative is based on the purification of circulating tumor cells&#xD;
      (CTC). The latter have been detected in nearly 77% of gliomas; the best results having been&#xD;
      obtained using density gradient centrifugation techniques, such as that offered by the&#xD;
      OncoQuick kits combining a density gradient with filtration. Using this technique, from 1 to&#xD;
      10 CTC per 7.5 ml of blood were detected in 31 patients with gliomas of different grades. The&#xD;
      advantage of this approach is that it preserves the entire genome of the tumor cell and will&#xD;
      therefore allow the identification of characteristic diagnostic hotspots such as TERTmt and&#xD;
      IDH1 / 2mt. The search for these mutations will then be objectivable by inexpensive&#xD;
      techniques (such as the digital PCR droplet), already used routinely and not by&#xD;
      high-throughput techniques (eg: whole genome sequencing) unsuitable for routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is therefore a real expectation regarding liquid biopsies for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      follow-up of gliomas. The targeted research approach for hotspot alterations with diagnostic&#xD;
      value in glioma (such as TERTmt and IDH1 / 2mt), via CTC enrichment appears to be a promising&#xD;
      avenue.&#xD;
