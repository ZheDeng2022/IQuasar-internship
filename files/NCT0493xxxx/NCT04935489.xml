  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) using intermittent theta burst&#xD;
      stimulation (iTBS) has been found to be a non inferior protocol to standard rTMS for the&#xD;
      treatment of major depressive disorder. An accelerated course is of particular interest given&#xD;
      the safety profile of the procedure and the potential to treat people more quickly making the&#xD;
      treatment more accessible. This study aims to assess the feasibility and clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      a high dose iTBS protocol in patients with unipolar depression who are waiting for&#xD;
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or rTMS due to degree of treatment resistance or severity of&#xD;
      symptoms. This is a prospective, open-label, interventional pilot study wherein patients who&#xD;
      have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and referred to brain stimulation clinic,&#xD;
      will be recruited for the treatment. Patients will be administered eight questionnaires&#xD;
      before and after the treatment to assess the change in clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      Participants will receive same stimulation protocol, however they will be given 6 times per&#xD;
      day instead of once per day. Each Treatment will consist of a single iTBS treatment&#xD;
      delivering 600 puses of iTBS (bursts of 3 pulses at 50 Hz, bursts repeated at 5 Hz, with a&#xD;
      duy cycle of 2 seconds on, 8 seconds off, over 60 cycles and it takes about 3 minutes at a&#xD;
      target of 90 to 120% of the subject's resting motor threshold. Treatment will be given&#xD;
      through the device that is usually used, which is Magpro by Magventure, B70 Fluid-Cooled Coil&#xD;
      .&#xD;
