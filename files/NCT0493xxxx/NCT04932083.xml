  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main limitations of spinal anesthesia are its short duration of action and do not provide&#xD;
      prolonged postoperative analgesia when it is performed only with local anesthetics. Adding&#xD;
      adjuvants drugs to intrathecal local anesthetics improves quality and duration of spinal&#xD;
      blockade, and prolongs postoperative analgesia. It is also possible to reduce dose of local&#xD;
      anesthetics, as well as total amount of systemic postoperative analgesics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several spinal adjuvants have been used to improve spinal anesthesia quality and to prolong&#xD;
      postsurgical analgesia; Intrathecal opioids are the most commonly utilized. Intrathecal&#xD;
      opioids cause analgesia by binding to opioid receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.&#xD;
      They prolong the duration of analgesia and allow early ambulation of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl, a short-acting lipophilic opioid, is known to augment the quality of subarachnoid&#xD;
      block in many studies. However, worrisome adverse effects such as pruritus, urinary&#xD;
      retention, post-operative vomiting, and respiratory depression limit the use of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nalbuphine is a synthetic opioid with mixed agonist antagonist effect. It binds to both mu-&#xD;
      and kappa receptors; binding of nalbuphine to mu receptors competitively displaces other&#xD;
      mu-agonists from these receptors without any agonist activity, therefore decreasing the side&#xD;
      effects on mu agonist (nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, urinary retention, pruritis,&#xD;
      and prolonged sedation). While when binding to kappa receptors, nalbuphine has agonist effect&#xD;
      (analgesic effect) through the kappa receptors distributed in the brain and spinal cord.&#xD;
      There have been no documented studies of nalbuphine neurotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant and&#xD;
      muscle relaxant effects, influencing GABA receptor and influence on neurons by entering&#xD;
      chloride into them. It is water soluble in its acid formulation but is highly lipid soluble&#xD;
      in vivo. It has been reported to have a spinally mediated anti-nociceptive effect. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that intrathecal administration of midazolam added to bupivacaine improves&#xD;
      the duration and quality of spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is carried out to evaluate and compare the effects of intrathecal midazolam (2&#xD;
      mg), fentanyl (25 micrograms) and nalbuphine (800 micrograms) as additives to intrathecal&#xD;
      hyperbaric bupivacaine (0.5 %) with regards to: onset and duration of sensory block, onset&#xD;
      and duration of motor block, duration of effective analgesia postoperative, side effects&#xD;
      associated with the drug.&#xD;
