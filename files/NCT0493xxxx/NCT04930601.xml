      The HBP Synchrony Using ECG Belt study is a prospective, non-randomized single site&#xD;
      physician-initiated research study. The study will collect ECG Belt data from up to 30&#xD;
      subjects at one single center. The target population will include subjects with a currently&#xD;
      implanted Medtronic cardiac implantable device who have a HIS placed lead. The purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to characterize the electrical dispersion using the ECG Belt provided by Medtronic&#xD;
      in patients who have a HIS placed lead and understanding the amount of synchrony with&#xD;
      intrinsic conduction compared to HIS pacing.&#xD;
