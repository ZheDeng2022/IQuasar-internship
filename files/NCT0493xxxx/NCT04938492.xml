  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will determine if cognitive behavioral therapy will help improve&#xD;
      loneliness in people who use opioids.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be the first to assess the cognitive, affective, and behavioral&#xD;
      pathways by which loneliness impacts opioid use. Individuals with an opioid use disorder&#xD;
      (OUD) reporting loneliness will be randomized to either a 6-session Cognitive- Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy for loneliness (CBT-L) or a 6-session education control condition, both delivered via&#xD;
      telehealth. Telehealth delivery can be easily implemented and can increase reach and access&#xD;
      to individuals not engaged in treatment. We will use an established brief CBT manual to&#xD;
      address loneliness. We will assess loneliness, negative affect (i.e., depression and&#xD;
      anxiety), and the quality and quantity of social interactions prior to, during, and after the&#xD;
      intervention to evaluate the subsequent impact on opioid use trajectories. Participant will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 1- and 2-months posttreatment.&#xD;

    <description>Loneliness will be measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. A 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item as 1 (never), 2 (rarely), 3 (sometimes) or 4 (often). The scores range from 20-80 with higher scores indicating worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Duke Social Support Index assesses several domains of perceived social support, including social network size, social interaction, social satisfaction, and instrumental social support. Higher scores indicate a higher quality of social interactions. Scores range from 0 to 37.</description>
