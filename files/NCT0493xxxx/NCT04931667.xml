  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a 3-year, multicenter, open-label study evaluating the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of intra-articular (IA) Lorecivivint (LOR) in subjects with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee in a real-world setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Day 1, after a screening period of up to 14 days, subjects will receive an IA injection of&#xD;
      0.07 mg LOR into one or both knees, followed by a 36-month evaluation period. Clinic visits&#xD;
      will be scheduled at Day 1, and Months 3, 12, 24, and 36 [End of study (EOS)] or Early&#xD;
      Termination (ET) for completion of all Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measurements Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Knee Injury and Ostheoarthritis&#xD;
      Outcome Score (KOOS), pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Study Form (SF)-12, Patient Acceptable&#xD;
      Symptom State Questionnaire (PASS), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire&#xD;
      (WPAI)], functional tests [40-meter walk test and Time Up and Go (TUG) test at a subset of&#xD;
      sites], and safety evaluations. On Day 1, the Charlson Comorbidity Index and Widespread Pain&#xD;
      Index and Symptom Severity [WPI&amp;SS] assessments will also be completed. A phone visit for&#xD;
      safety follow-up will occur 4 weeks after the injection on Day 1. Subjects may also have&#xD;
      Unscheduled Injection Visits for additional injections of LOR, glucocorticoid, or hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid (HA). Following each injection, subjects will return to the clinic for 3-Month&#xD;
      Post-Injection Follow-Up Visits, unless another visit has occurred between the injection and&#xD;
      the 3-month post injection date. At these injection visits and 3-Month Post-Injection&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits, subjects will complete PRO measurements and functional tests (at a subset&#xD;
      of sites).&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline in pain numeric rating scale (NRS) score for the knee. The pain NRS is an 11-point scale [0-10] for subject self-reporting of average knee pain in the last 24 hours; 0 indicates no pain, and 10 represents the worst possible pain.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline OA function in the target knee as assessed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical function subscore (WOMAC Function). The WOMAC is a widely-used, proprietary outcome measurement tool used to evaluate the condition of subjects with OA of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of a target joint. Each question is measured on a scale from 0 (lowest pain/lowest stiffness/highest function) to 4 (highest pain/highest stiffness/lowest function). The WOMAC Function subscore ranges from 0 to 68 (raw) and will be scaled 0 to 100 for reporting.</description>
