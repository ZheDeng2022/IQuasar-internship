    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong, neurodevelopmental disorder effecting one in&#xD;
      fifty-nine children. Each individual with ASD is unique. Children with ASD may have trouble&#xD;
      making friends, keeping friends, communicating their needs, engaging in leisure activities,&#xD;
      learning to read and do math, and many other challenges. The children may engage in&#xD;
      repetitive behaviors such as hitting themselves or flapping their hands, and may be over&#xD;
      sensitive to particular sounds or lights which can make certain places, such as a store, very&#xD;
      uncomfortable. Also, children with ASD may have challenging behaviors such as hitting others&#xD;
      and excessive tantrums that can seem uncontrollable. 25 to 40 hours a week of intensive&#xD;
      applied behavior analysis is the evidence-based treatment for children with ASD. Many&#xD;
      children with ASD in rural areas and certain states are unable to access evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment because of insurance barriers and lack of providers. The Competent Learner Model&#xD;
      uses strategies from applied behavior analysis to target core skills that increase successful&#xD;
      participation in life activities. Its program is applicable across all ages and developmental&#xD;
      levels, and it has an online course of study which has been used to train professionals and&#xD;
      lay people alike including parents. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility&#xD;
      of training parents in applied behavior analysis using the Competent Learner Model with&#xD;
      children with ASD who do not have access to treatment. The program consisted of a hybrid of&#xD;
      group sessions for caregivers, coaching sessions for the caregiver-child dyads, and online&#xD;
      units for caregivers. This project assessed participation in and satisfaction with the&#xD;
      program as well as changes in parenting stress. Feedback from caregivers will be used to&#xD;
      create a more satisfactory method of increasing accessing to families of children with Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorder in rural areas.&#xD;

      Specific Aims: Many children with Autism in West Virginia are not able to access the&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment, intensive applied behavior analysis, because of insurance barriers&#xD;
      and lack of providers. Training parents in applied behavior analysis using the Competent&#xD;
      Learner Model may allow children to access treatment. The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      determine if it is feasible to use online training units, group sessions for caregivers&#xD;
      co-led by a parent, and family coaching sessions to improve the functioning of children with&#xD;
      Autism. The current study is the first examination of Competent Learner Model as an&#xD;
      independent intervention for parents using a hybrid of group and family sessions. Hypotheses:&#xD;
      (1) Parent will complete therapy homework and attend 90% of sessions. (2) Parents will report&#xD;
      a decrease in parenting stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Autism is a lifelong, developmental disorder that affects 1 in 59 children, which&#xD;
      represents about 720 children in the region of West Virginia where this study took place.&#xD;
      Challenges for children with Autism include difficulty making and keeping friends, trouble&#xD;
      talking to people, and insisting on rigid routines that interfere with daily life. The&#xD;
      children may have challenging behavior such as hitting themselves, hitting others, and&#xD;
      extreme meltdowns. Children may struggle to learn in typical classrooms, and may have trouble&#xD;
      going to community events with their families. Families participate in fewer community&#xD;
      activities leading to social isolation, and parents of children with Autism are more stressed&#xD;
      than other parents. 25-40 hours per week of applied behavior analysis for 1-3 years is the&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment for Autism. Many insurance companies in West Virginia specifically&#xD;
      exclude services for children with Autism, and the Mountaineer Autism Project has estimated&#xD;
      that only 1.6% of children with Autism in the state are receiving applied behavior analysis.&#xD;
      Additionally, West Virginia has a limited number of providers for Autism. Children with&#xD;
      Autism make greater progress across multiple settings (e.g., home, public) when their&#xD;
      caregivers are involved in treatment, and coaching results in greater improvements in child&#xD;
      behavior following behavioral parent training. Parent-implemented interventions for Autism&#xD;
      are promising but more research is needed. When parents are trained to use the therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies, the parent may be able to increase the child's skill development (e.g.,&#xD;
      self-care, functional academics, and social skills) across multiple settings and feel less&#xD;
      stressed. The Competent Learner Model uses concepts and strategies from applied behavior&#xD;
      analysis, Direct Instruction, and Precision Teaching to improve functioning of individuals&#xD;
      with Autism. The program targets core skills that facilitate successful participation across&#xD;
      all areas of an individuals' life, and it can be applied across all ages and developmental&#xD;
      levels. A core component of the Competent Learner Model is the Course of Study, which has&#xD;
      been used to train professionals and lay people. The Course of Study is a sequence of online&#xD;
      training units using programmed instruction formats with embedded active student responding,&#xD;
      video examples, and skill check outs. Coaching is a critical component of the program. While&#xD;
      the Competent Learner Model uses well-researched strategies, the research of the program's&#xD;
      effectiveness consists primarily of poster presentations and a handful of dissertations. One&#xD;
      study found parents were better able to apply strategies and reported less stress when the&#xD;
      parents were trained supplemental to their child's treatment. The effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Competent Learner Model as implemented by parents independent of other treatment is unknown.&#xD;
      Parent training using the Competent Learner Model may provide access to effective treatment&#xD;
      for families. If this program is effective in training parents, it will increase access to&#xD;
      effective services, decrease the amount of face-to-face time a parent must spend with a&#xD;
      clinician and, thus, allow the clinician to serve a greater number of families&#xD;
      simultaneously. More broadly, this treatment approach may present a treatment option for&#xD;
      rural Americans with limited access to behavioral health outside of West Virginia as well.&#xD;
      The study will contribute to the literature of training parents as therapists for their&#xD;
      children with Autism.&#xD;
