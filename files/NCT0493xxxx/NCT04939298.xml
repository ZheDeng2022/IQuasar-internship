  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weakness of respiratory muscles is frequent after several days of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      Thereby an acquired diaphragm weakness has been demonstrated, linked to an atrophy which may&#xD;
      be identified by a decrease of muscle thickness in echography. This study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      with ultrasound the variation of thickness of abdominal muscles after 7 days of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;

      Weakness of respiratory muscles is frequent after several days of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      Thereby an acquired diaphragm weakness has been demonstrated, linked to an atrophy which may&#xD;
      be identified by a decrease of muscle thickness in echography. Weakness of expiratory muscles&#xD;
      is also frequent after 7 days of mechanical ventilation, however his cause is not clear: is&#xD;
      it present at admission notably in elderly patients, or acquired on mechanical ventilation ?&#xD;
      Ultrasound allows to measure the thickness of abdominal muscles which correlates with their&#xD;
      strength. This study aims to evaluate with ultrasound the variation of thickness of abdominal&#xD;
      muscles after 7 days of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
