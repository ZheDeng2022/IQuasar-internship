    <textblock>
      This phase II trial determines the effect of metformin extended release on the risk for&#xD;
      developing lung cancer in overweight/obese patients that are at high-risk for developing lung&#xD;
      cancer. Metformin is widely used to treat type II diabetes and has a long history of safety&#xD;
      and minimal side effects. At similar dosage, the drug may have potential anti-cancer&#xD;
      activity. Metformin use has been associated with improved survival in patients with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung carcinoma, a specific type of lung cancer, and it has also been shown to enhance&#xD;
      immune mobilization against tumors. This trial aims to see whether metformin extended release&#xD;
      as a preventative treatment may lower the chance of developing lung cancer, and whether it&#xD;
      may help patients' immune system learn (&quot;reprogram&quot;) to lower a certain type of immune cell&#xD;
      (called regulatory T cells) that are linked to tumor development.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of metformin treatment on the expression of programmed cell death&#xD;
      protein 1 (PD-1) on airway regulatory T cells (Tregs) in overweight and obese individuals at&#xD;
      high risk for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the impact of metformin on histologic progression of abnormal airway lesions&#xD;
      (key secondary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimated PD-1 expression of pulmonary Tregs change in Cohort B (arm II) during the wait&#xD;
      period (26 weeks with no treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the impact of metformin on circulating immune cell subsets of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the impact of metformin on cancer-related transcriptome features of airway&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the impact of metformin on immune profile of pulmonary parenchyma represented&#xD;
      by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the impact of metformin on serum adipokines and inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Participants receive metformin extended release (ER) orally (PO) once daily (QD)&#xD;
      for 26 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Participants receive no intervention for 26 weeks, then cross-over to Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at weeks 30-32 (Cohort A)&#xD;
      and weeks 56-58 (Cohort B).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pre- to post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change from pre- to post-metformin ER treatment in cell surface PD-1 expression levels of pulmonary (BAL) Tregs, measured as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Histologic progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to study completion</time_frame>
    <description>Bronchoscopic biopsies of at least 6 standard sites will be graded on the World Health Organization (WHO) scale of dysplasia and assigned numerical scores from 1 (normal) to 8 (invasive cancer). Each lesion will be classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disesae (SD) or progressive disease (PD) and each response rate will be calculated on a per-site and a per-participant basis. Additional measures of dysplasia will include the average dysplastic score and the dysplasia index (% of sites with dysplasia score &gt;= 3 (mild dysplasia)). Changes in maximum dysplasia will be analyzed using a paired t test to determine whether a reduction occurs.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization to week 26</time_frame>
    <description>This is the estimate of change in MFI following the 6-month wait period among n = 20 subjects randomized to arm II. This will confirm the stability of the PD-1 expression of pulmonary Tregs over time.</description>

               -  Average consumption of 3 or more alcohol containing beverages daily in the past&#xD;
                  12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Consumption of 7 or more alcoholic beverages within a 24 hour period in the past&#xD;

             not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses representing 3 and 6 times the maximum&#xD;
             recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg; however, animal reproduction studies are not&#xD;
             always predictive of human response. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             metformin ER, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
