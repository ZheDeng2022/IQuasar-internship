      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore effects of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block with compound&#xD;
      lidocaine on postoperative pain after gynecological laparotomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor post-surgical pain control is a leading factor that hinders the physical rehabilitation,&#xD;
      and causes acute cognitive impairment and chronic pain syndrome. Recently, the multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia strategies to minimise opioid-related side effects are highly desirable in open&#xD;
      surgical procedures. The transversus abdominis plane block is a novel technique involving&#xD;
      injection of local anaesthetic between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis&#xD;
      muscles of the abdominal wall. Although ropivacaine is most commonly used for this technique,&#xD;
      the analgesic duration remains not dissatisfied. Compared with ropivacaine, compound&#xD;
      lidocaine injection has a better and longer analgesic activity since it contains menthol and&#xD;
      ethanol with appropriate concentrations. However, whether compound lidocaine injection is&#xD;
      efficiency in the transversus abdominis plane block for abdominal open sugery lacks&#xD;
      investigations. Herein, we will evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided transversus&#xD;
      abdominis plane (USG-TAP) block with compound lidocaine injection for postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      in patients undergoing gynecological laparotomy.&#xD;

    <description>Each patient was administered analgesics using a PCA (Patient-controlled analgesia) pump containing sufentanil (200μg) in normal saline at a total volume of 200 ml after leaving PACU (Postanesthesia care unit). This device was set to deliver a basal infusion of 2 ml/h and bolus doses of 0.5 ml with a 15-min lockout period. Sufentanyl cumulative consumption is recorded 72 hours postoperatively</description>

    <measure>Normalized Area of Hyperalgesia Around the Incision</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The skin around the incision is stimulated in steps of 5 mm at intervals of 1 s starting outside of the hyperalgesic area in the direction of the incision. The distance from the incision to the first point where a 'painful', 'sore' or 'sharper' feeling occurred is measured and noted. This measurement is repeated at predefined radial lines around the incision. To eliminate the variable length of incision, this length is subtracted from the longer diameter leaving four radial distances from the end and from the middle of the incision. The normalized area of hyperalgesia is calculated by summing up the areas of the remaining four triangles measured by and Von Frey filament.</description>

    <description>Sensory block was assessed using a cold test (2 = normal sensation, 1 = decreased cold sensation compared, 0 = loss of cold sensation) on the bilateral anterior abdomen between the median line and linea semiluminaris from T7-T12. The sensation was compared with the sensation to cold at ipsilateral lateral thoracic region of T4-T5.</description>
