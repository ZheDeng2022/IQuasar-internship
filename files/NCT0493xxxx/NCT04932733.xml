  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A sample of 58 young healthy subjects (25 females, mean age 25.10Â±5.18 years) were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to either isometric exercise experimental group (n=29) or active exercise control&#xD;
      group (n=29). The Heart Rate (HR), Respiratory Rate (RR), Blood Pressure (BP), Oxygen&#xD;
      Saturation (SaO2), and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) for each participant were assessed before&#xD;
      and after the treatment session.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants in the experimental group underwent a single session of 5-minute quadriceps&#xD;
      isometric exercise. The participant was asked to take rest 10 minutes before performed the&#xD;
      exercise. After that, the exercise was performed from a long-sitting position. On the other&#xD;
      hand, the participants in the control group received a single session of 5-minute quadriceps&#xD;
      active range of motion exercise. The participant was asked to take a rest of 10 minutes&#xD;
      before participating in the exercise program. Then, the exercise was performed from a&#xD;
      short-sitting position.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Pressure (BP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline blood pressure at 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured by a trained physiotherapist in the right upper arm using an appropriate-sized cuff at the baseline and the end of the intervention using an automated Dinamap MPS Select device (Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory Rate (RR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline respiratory rate at 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory rate was assessed by visually observe for 30 seconds and multiply observed breaths by 2 to obtain breaths per minute (BPM).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen Saturation (SaO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline oxygen saturation at 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation was recorded using a finger pulse oximeter. The sensor was placed on the right index finger, and the values were recorded after at least two minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate (HR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline heart rate at 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate was recorded using a finger pulse oximeter. The sensor was placed on the right index finger, and the values were recorded after at least two minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline mean arterial pressure at 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Mean arterial pressure was calculated MAP as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) + 1/3 [systolic blood pressure (SBP) - DBP].</description>
