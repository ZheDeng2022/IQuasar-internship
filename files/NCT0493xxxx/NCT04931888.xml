  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this overall goal is to pilot an adaptation of an established&#xD;
      Social-Emotional Learning Program with novel wellness and COVID-19 safety components that are&#xD;
      trauma-informed and culturally-specific in a resettled refugee community. In this pilot,&#xD;
      &quot;EMPOWER&quot; (Emotions Program Outside the clinic and Wellness Education for Refugees), the&#xD;
      study team will assess implementation outcomes (adoption, acceptability, and feasibility) of&#xD;
      EMPOWER with refugee children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic through longitudinal&#xD;
      evaluations and measurements of feasibility, acceptability, and attrition. The study team&#xD;
      will also evaluate the impact of EMPOWER by assessing (a) children's social-emotional&#xD;
      learning competence and (b) children's and family's COVID-19 knowledge.&#xD;

      The major question that guides this research is: can an adaptation of an established&#xD;
      Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) curriculum effectively improve Social-Emotional wellness for&#xD;
      refugee children and their families? The hypothesis is that participation in this program&#xD;
      will (a) improve children's SEL competence and (b) lessen stress and improve quality of life&#xD;
      for refugee families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to establish and evaluate the preliminary efficacy and&#xD;
      implementation of an adapted social-emotional learning (SEL) and Wellness Program for&#xD;
      refugees: EMPOWER (Emotions Program Outside the clinic with Wellness Education for Refugees).&#xD;
      To achieve the two aims of this study, the study team will conduct a wait-list controlled,&#xD;
      randomized pilot to establish and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of participation in&#xD;
      EMPOWER by assessing (a) children's SEL competence and (b) measures of mental health, stress,&#xD;
      quality of life and wellness before and after participation in the program (Aim 1). Then, the&#xD;
      study team will assess the implementation of EMPOWER with refugee children by using mixed&#xD;
      methods to perform a summative evaluation of implementation outcomes-including fidelity,&#xD;
      sustainability, and reach-in the Afghan refugee community (Aim 2).&#xD;

    <description>EMPOWER is an adapted social emotional learning (SEL) and wellness education initiative delivered to a community of refugee families that was developed through a pre-pilot in the New Haven Afghan refugee community in 2020. Unlike traditional school-based SEL curricula, EMPOWER partners with community organizations to provide translated and trauma-informed wellness education to family units. The program combines in-person (socially distant) and remote delivery of culturally-informed physical, emotional, and medical wellness tools adapted from evidenced-based behavioral medicine, refugee trauma and recovery, and community health research.</description>
