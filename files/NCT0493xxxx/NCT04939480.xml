  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeting the PD-L1 pathway with atezolizumab has demonstrated objective responses across a&#xD;
      broad range of malignancies including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN). MO39839&#xD;
      is a window of opportunity study investigating the feasibility, safety and postoperative&#xD;
      complication rates of preoperative short time immunotherapy with atezolizumab in patients&#xD;
      with local SCCHN. In the scope of MO39839 a comprehensive translational research program will&#xD;
      be conducted to assess the potential effect of atezolizumab on dynamics in tumor immunity,&#xD;
      and to identify and validate potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers.&#xD;
