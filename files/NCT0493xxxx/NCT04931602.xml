  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a disorder of low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration resulting&#xD;
      in decreased mechanical strength and increased susceptibility to fractures even after minimal&#xD;
      trauma. These 'minimal trauma fractures' (also known as 'osteoporotic', 'low trauma' or&#xD;
      'fragility' fractures) are the hallmark of a chronic and disabling disease that affects both&#xD;
      men and women worldwide. On statistical grounds, more than 50 % of postmenopausal women and&#xD;
      30 % of men over the age of 60 years will suffer at least one minimal trauma fracture during&#xD;
      their remaining lifetime. Any osteoporotic fracture predisposes to further fractures,&#xD;
      significant morbidity and premature death. Thus, following a first minimal trauma fracture&#xD;
      both men and women have a two- to threefold increased risk of subsequent fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine feasibility of evaluating different models of care through a&#xD;
      structured multidisciplinary path tailored to identify, assess and treat hip fracture&#xD;
      patients in an effective timely manner that are at high risk of subsequent fracture (Type A&#xD;
      model) and to compare its effectiveness and feasibility with a type B, C &amp; D model as&#xD;
      proposed by Ganda et al at the Aga Khan University, with collaboration of the departments of&#xD;
      Orthopaedics, Chemical Pathology, Family Medicine and Internal Medicine.&#xD;

      With the severity of implications associated with fragility fractures, prevention of a&#xD;
      secondary fracture has become a primary focus from a patient care and societal standpoint&#xD;
      worldwide. However, this area has been so far neglected in Pakistan. A fracture requires that&#xD;
      two conditions occur simultaneously: week bones and a fall or stress on week bones and a&#xD;
      co-management approach is required to address both issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to determine feasibility of evaluating different models of care&#xD;
      through a structured multidisciplinary path tailored to identify, assess and treat hip&#xD;
      fracture patients in an effective timely manner that are at high risk of subsequent fracture&#xD;
      (Type A model) and to compare its effectiveness and feasibility with a type B, C &amp; D model as&#xD;
      proposed by Ganda et al. Based on this study the investigators will propose a model of care&#xD;
      for SFP for application at national level in private and public sector. The long-term plan is&#xD;
      to develop a national fragility fracture network in preventing and managing fragility&#xD;
      fractures and to promote research aimed at better treatments of osteoporosis, sarcopenia and&#xD;
      fracture in line with global CtA from FFN. This information will also help us in applying&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines for osteoporosis and driving policy change for our country which&#xD;
      is currently non-existent and is likely to be a step towards the achievement of Sustainable&#xD;
      Development Goals (SDG) (i.e. ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages)&#xD;
      and in line with WHO decade of healthy ageing 2021-23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is primarily aimed at comparison of the feasibility and effectiveness of models of&#xD;
      care (Type A, B, C &amp; D) for hip fracture patients. The Specific, Measurable, Achievable,&#xD;
      Realistic, and Time-defined (SMART) goals of this project are formulated around the 5IQ&#xD;
      approach delineated by the Royal Osteoporosis society based on the following 6 parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identification: systematic screening of high-risk individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Investigation: undertaking of relevant investigations to delineate the cause of low bone&#xD;
      mass&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Information: educating patients on falls prevention and fracture risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Initiation: provision of pharmacological, lifestyle, dietary, conservative management&#xD;
      approach and falls prevention interventions according to the model of care adopted&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Integration: promotion of integration between primary and secondary care&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Quality: Ensuring professional development, audit, and peer-review activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type A model: Intensive service with all routine interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed-up at bone, endocrine and rheumatology clinic after discharge&#xD;
      depending upon availability of the consultant. Multifaceted risk-factor assessment for&#xD;
      identifying patients at risk will be conducted including formal future fracture risk&#xD;
      assessment/life style/medication review and fall risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive laboratory designed package including calcium (Ca), albumin (ALB), phosphate&#xD;
      (P), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), C terminal peptide of type 1 collagen (CTx), vitamin D&#xD;
      (25OHD) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) will be performed at first clinic visit for all&#xD;
      patients between 6-8 weeks post fracture. Screening for secondary causes of osteoporosis will&#xD;
      be conducted for those identified in need. BMD testing as per guidelines for patients with&#xD;
      fragility fractures will be conducted at clinic visit and recorded with risk assessment form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type B model: All intervention except treatment initiation-the responsibility of participants&#xD;
      general practitioner for prevention of secondary fracture Those included in this intervention&#xD;
      arm, will be identified and risk assessment will be performed at hospital admission.&#xD;
      Recommendations for the treatment will be made to be initiated by the patient's general&#xD;
      physician. Participants will be followed at 6 months on telephone, and a questionnaire&#xD;
      related to treatment compliance &amp;/or non-compliance will be filled by the coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type C model: Health education only provided at the time of admission with handover to family&#xD;
      physician for follow-up. Participants will be given an appointment to follow-up at community&#xD;
      health center of Aga Khan University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type D model: Health Education provided. There is no physician contact with the participant's&#xD;
      general practitioner for prevention of secondary fracture. Education material for the patient&#xD;
      have been prepared and will be provided to the participant along with counselling by the&#xD;
      nurse at the time of discharge.&#xD;
