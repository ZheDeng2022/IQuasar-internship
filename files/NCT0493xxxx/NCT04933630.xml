      TRAIT-RS is an observational study to evaluate ongoing treatment response stability to&#xD;
      standard of care antidepressant treatments (ADTs) among individuals who met criteria for&#xD;
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and completed the Tracking Response to Antidepressants in&#xD;
      Advance of Investigational Trials (TRAIT) study (NCT04748276).&#xD;

    <description>Participants exiting the TRAIT study will have received a 90-day supply of their current protocol-approved antidepressant treatment (ADT) if clinically appropriate, prior to entering the TRAIT-RS study, in addition to a continuity of care letter to be given to their medical provider to facilitate a refill of that medication as desired.

        Adults who previously met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Version 5 (DSM-5)&#xD;
        criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), sought enrollment in an industry-sponsored&#xD;
        antidepressant trial, achieved MDD symptom remission in the TRAIT study, and, in the&#xD;
        opinion of the investigator, would benefit from ongoing depression monitoring and/or ADT&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;
