  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a retrospective study of critical ill patients who used ECMO during their ICU&#xD;
      stay. ICU-AW was diagnosed at the time when patients discharged and had a Medical Research&#xD;
      Council (MRC) sum score &lt; 48 out of a maximal score of 60. We divided patients to&#xD;
      ICU-acquired weakness group and no ICU-acquired weakness group and compared their clinical&#xD;
      characteristics. Baseline characteristics and therapy details were collected from the case&#xD;
      report forms and inspection reports. Univariable analysis and logistic regression analysis&#xD;
      were used to analyze clinical characteristics of individuals and to find risk factors of&#xD;
      ICU-AW.&#xD;

        There were 85 patients used extracorporeal membrane oxygenationbetween March 2017 to March&#xD;
        2020. Among the 85 patients, 22 patients presented exclusion criteria and 63 patients were&#xD;
        included in the final analysis.&#xD;
