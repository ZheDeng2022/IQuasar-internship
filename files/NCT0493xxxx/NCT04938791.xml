    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand the relationship between perceived effort and&#xD;
      physiological and kinematic variables caused by isometric activity of the upper limbs, as&#xD;
      well as its relationship with socio-demographic characteristics, level of activity and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

Participants are classified as ACTIVE if they perform: at least 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity; OR at least 75 minutes per week of vigorous physical activity; OR at least 150 minutes per week of a combination of moderate-intensity activity. If they don't present any of the conditions described, they will be categorized as SEDENTARY.</description>
