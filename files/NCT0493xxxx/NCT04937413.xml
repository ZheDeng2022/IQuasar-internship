  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 0 surgical window of opportunity trial seeks to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of an FDA-approved proprotein convertase/ kexin type 9&#xD;
      serine protease inhibitor (PCSK9i) in patients with primary and recurrent World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma. The investigators intend to evaluate whether a&#xD;
      clinically licensed PCSK9i called evolocumab (also known as Repatha) can be repurposed as a&#xD;
      potential immunotherapeutic for high grade glioma by testing its ability to access the&#xD;
      intracranial space. The primary objective is to evaluate whether evolocumab crosses the blood&#xD;
      brain barrier (BBB) and is measurable in the resected tumor specimens of patients with&#xD;
      primary and recurrent high grade glioma or glioblastoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of 10 participants will receive 420 mg (the maximum single dose) of evolocumab&#xD;
      subcutaneously into their thigh, abdomen or upper arm 7-14 days prior to surgical de-bulking&#xD;
      of their tumor. After de-bulking, leftover tissue not required for histological analysis will&#xD;
      be collected, and the level of evolocumab will be quantified. At two time points, prior to&#xD;
      injection of evolocumab and at time of their surgery, participants will have peripheral blood&#xD;
      drawn to analyze serum levels of the drug (for comparison to levels found in their leftover&#xD;
      tissue). The investigators will follow-up with participants about 2 weeks after surgery at&#xD;
      their post-operative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A matched cohort of resected tumor specimens from patients who were not treated with&#xD;
      evolocumab from the Duke Brain Tumor Center Biorepository will be used as a comparison for&#xD;
      the primary objective and 2 of the 3 secondary objectives of this study comparing brain tumor&#xD;
      tissue specimens of patients who did and did not receive evolocumab with respect to lipid&#xD;
      metabolism and tumor cells expressing MHC-I.&#xD;
