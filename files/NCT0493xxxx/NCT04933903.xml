    <textblock>
      This single-arm phase 2 study will enroll patients with resectable and operable stage IB -&#xD;
      III non-small cell lung cancer and treat them with pre-operative ipilimumab + nivolumab plus&#xD;
      low-dose stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivered concurrently. Only patients who&#xD;
      proceed to surgery will be evaluable for the primary endpoint. The primary efficacy outcome&#xD;
      measurement will be pathologic response (including Major Pathologic Response (MPR), and&#xD;
      Complete Pathologic Response (CPR)). Secondary outcome measures include safety, and&#xD;
      exploratory biomarkers of immune response in pre- and post-operative blood and tissue. A&#xD;
      two-stage design will stop the study if fewer than 3 of the first 9 evaluable patients do not&#xD;
      achieve MPR. An early stopping rule for safety will stop the study if more than 12 patients&#xD;
      are enrolled to find the first 9 evaluable patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pathologically confirmed NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age &gt; 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG Performance Status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pulmonary function capacity capable of tolerating the proposed lung resection. FEV1 at&#xD;
             least 2 L. If less than 2 L, the predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1&#xD;
             second (FEV1) must be &gt; 0.8 L or be &gt; 35% of the predicted value. Postoperative&#xD;
             predicted DLCO ≥ 35% is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Resectable stage IB-IIIB (T2-3N0, T1-T3N1-2) NSCLC (per the 8th Edition American Joint&#xD;
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification) who are candidates for surgery with intent&#xD;
             of R0 resection. Invasive T3 disease (eg, phrenic nerve, pericardium, chest wall other&#xD;
             than Pancoast superior sulcus) may be included if the surgeon and study team deem it&#xD;
             to be resectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. N2 nodes must be discrete (ie, not invading surrounding structures). If patients have&#xD;
             N2 disease, as suspected by CT or PET, histologic proof of N2 status is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be evaluated by a Thoracic Surgeon prior to registration. Operability is&#xD;
             defined as having adequate pulmonary, cardiac, renal, nutritional, musculoskeletal,&#xD;
             neurologic, and cognitive capacity to undergo major pulmonary resection with&#xD;
             acceptable morbidity and mortality. Absence of major associated comorbidities that&#xD;
             increase the surgery risk to an unacceptable level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No prior history of thoracic radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate Organ and marrow function as defined below&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥2,000/mcL,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance ≥50&#xD;
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional&#xD;
                  normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients are capable of giving informed consent and/or have an acceptable surrogate&#xD;
             capable of giving consent on the subject's behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Nonpregnant and non-nursing. The effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab on the fetus is&#xD;
             unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use 2 methods of birth&#xD;
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course&#xD;
             of the study through 5 months after the last dose of study medication. Patients of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not&#xD;
             been free of menses &gt;1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Evidence of postmenopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for&#xD;
             female premenopausal patients. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have&#xD;
             been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following&#xD;
             age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments&#xD;
             and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the&#xD;
             postmenopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Women ≥50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;
             treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had&#xD;
             chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow&#xD;
