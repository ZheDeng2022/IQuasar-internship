      This a randomized trial comparing the use of an organized podcast curriculum using the&#xD;
      podcast, CREOGs Over Coffee, to usual teaching for first and second year Ob/Gyn residents on&#xD;
      their obstetrics rotations. Residents at HUP and PAH will be included. Post intervention&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered at the end of each block to assess resident satisfaction&#xD;
      with their block as well as confidence in their clinical care and skills. CREOG scores will&#xD;
      be used to assess knowledge differences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All PGY-1 and PGY-2 Ob/Gyn residents at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania (HUP) and&#xD;
      Pennsylvania Hospital (PAH) will be eligible and recruited for this randomized trial over the&#xD;
      period of January 2021 January 2023 (period chosen as CREOGs are given in January, and trial&#xD;
      will start immediately after next CREOG exam). There are currently 7 PGY-1 residents and 8&#xD;
      PGY-2 residents at HUP and 7 PGY-1 residents and 8 PGY-2 residents at PAH. In two academic&#xD;
      years, with the addition of 7 PGY-1 residents at HUP and 7 PGY-1 residents at PAH, this will&#xD;
      total 43 residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents will be randomized individually to receive a podcast curriculum vs. usual teaching&#xD;
      on the labor floor rotations. Rotations where there will be a podcast curriculum include&#xD;
      labor and delivery, night float, and Maternal Fetal Medicine. The details of the curriculum&#xD;
      for each rotation will be listed below. At all times, all residents will have access to the&#xD;
      podcast content, but those randomized to usual teaching will not be given an organized&#xD;
      podcast curriculum for each rotation. Currently, usual teaching includes didactic teaching&#xD;
      for the above topics on Thursday mornings (7am-12 pm), clinical teaching while on the&#xD;
      rotations, simulation training, and self-learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents will be protected against undue influence or coercion as those that are&#xD;
      administering the surveys and recruiting residents (FC) will not be involved in their&#xD;
      residency reviews.&#xD;
