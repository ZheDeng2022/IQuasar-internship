    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing colonoscopy were divided into progressive relaxation exercises and&#xD;
      control groups. Pretest and posttest abdominal pain and distention scores of the patients&#xD;
      were determined after colonoscopy.&#xD;

    <measure>Individual Introductory Information Form</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This form, which was created by the researcher with the support of the relevant literature, consists of 11 questions questioning the patients' education level, age,gender, employment status, marital status,income level, the coping methods they use when there is distension in their daily lives, the coping methods they use when there is pain in their daily lives, the status of having a colonoscopy before, the history of abdominal pain and distension of those who have a colonoscopy experience.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The patient was asked to make a mark on a 10 cm horizontal line on the Visual analog scale showing his current state. In this study, for pain and distension; Markings were made on a 10 cm horizontal line, one end of which indicates that the patient's pain is very good (0 = no pain) and the other end is that the patient's pain is very bad (10 = most severe). The distance from the point where there was no pain and distension (0) to the point marked by the patient was measured. The value found shows the severity of pain and distention of the patient.</description>

    <description>The experimental group was informed about progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) before colonoscopy. PMR audio recordings were given to the patients. Abdominal pain and distention scores were determined after colonoscopy. PMR was applied to the patients for 30 minutes. These scores were determined again after exercise and at the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 24th hours.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>VAS pain and VAS distension scores of the control group were determined after colonoscopy and 30 minutes later. VAS form was given to all patients to determine VAS abdominal pain and VAS distension scores at the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 24th hours after the procedure. The day after the colonoscopy, post test data were collected.</description>

    <description>PMR is a technique that provides relaxation in the whole body by voluntary and regular relaxation of large muscle groups in the human body, which is included in mind-body applications.</description>
