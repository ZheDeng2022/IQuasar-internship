    <textblock>
      Abdominal surgeries are those in which pain is felt severely due to the incision close to the&#xD;
      diaphragm and an intensive neural network in the abdominal area. If the patient's&#xD;
      post-operative pain is not controlled; Since it will restrict patient mobility, it can cause&#xD;
      problems on many systems such as the pulmonary, cardiovascular and neuroendocrine system, and&#xD;
      even suppress the immune system. Surgical intervention decision can cause anxiety in&#xD;
      individuals regardless of the type of surgical procedure. Fear of anesthesia, fear of death,&#xD;
      possibility of developing complications after surgery, pain, change in daily life activities,&#xD;
      loss of social life and loss of control can lead to anxiety. In addition to all these,&#xD;
      factors such as pain, fear, anxiety that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system can&#xD;
      increase the pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reiki, a complementary and alternative medicine (TAT) method, is a bioenergy based on the&#xD;
      energy use of the body and has been used in various cultures for centuries in preventing and&#xD;
      treating some diseases. Reiki is thought to help balance the body's natural energetic systems&#xD;
      and reduce anxiety by transferring the available energy through hands. During Reiki, the&#xD;
      activity of the parasympathetic system increases, pain and anxiety decrease. Thus, the&#xD;
      patient's complaints are reduced by providing early discharge with possible complications&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on the effectiveness of reiki, which is increasing worldwide use and recommended as a&#xD;
      treatment approach for health services, are insufficient. The aim of this study, which is&#xD;
      planned as a three-group interventional randomized control, is to examine the effect of reiki&#xD;
      application on patients' negative reflections on pain, anxiety, fear and vital signs, which&#xD;
      is the major surgery type in which patients experience the most pain.&#xD;

      In line with the results of the power analysis using the Gpower 3.1.9.2 program, it was&#xD;
      planned to include 31 patients in reiki, 31 patients in sham reiki and 31 patients in the&#xD;
      control group, and the simple randomization method was used to distribute the sample to the&#xD;
      study groups. Research data were collected in a quiet single room in the operating room&#xD;
      Pre-op Unit and in the patient rooms of General Surgery I and II Clinics between July 2020&#xD;
      and December 2020. In order to determine the clarity of the data collection form, after&#xD;
      obtaining permission from the ethics committee and pre-application with 12 patients who met&#xD;
      the study criteria, &quot;Personal Information Form&quot;, &quot;Patient Follow-up Form&quot; and Postoperative&#xD;
      Period Patient Analgesic Follow-up Form&quot; and &quot;Reiki-Related Feedback Form&quot; were prepared.&#xD;
      filled. Application&quot; Data were collected before and after reiki in the Pre-op unit on the 0th&#xD;
      day before the operation, and in the General Surgery I and II clinics on the 1st and 2nd days&#xD;
      after the operation. After obtaining the consent of the patient in the preoperative unit, the&#xD;
      Personal Information Form, the Surgical Fear Scale and the STAI-I State Anxiety Scale were&#xD;
      applied, and the results and vital findings after SPO2 were recorded in the Patient&#xD;
      Follow-up. Form. According to randomization, the patients in the reiki/sham reiki group were&#xD;
      taken to a quiet single room and reiki/sham reiki was applied for approximately 25-30&#xD;
      minutes. Done. Reiki application was applied by a researcher who received Reiki II level&#xD;
      training, and sham reiki was applied by a health professional who did not receive reiki&#xD;
      training. A written protocol is provided to both the Reiki practitioner and Sham Reiki&#xD;
      practitioner describing hand positions, areas of practice, sequence and times. 5 minutes&#xD;
      after the end of the application, the &quot;Surgical Fear Scale&quot; and the &quot;STAI-I State Anxiety&#xD;
      Scale&quot; were re-administered, the patient's SPO2 and vital signs were taken again. In the&#xD;
      control group according to randomization. The &quot;Surgical Fear Scale&quot; and the &quot;STAI-I State&#xD;
      Anxiety Scale&quot; were applied and the patient's vital signs and SPO2 were measured. 30 minutes&#xD;
      from assessment. Then, all measurements were repeated and recorded on the Patient Follow-up&#xD;
      Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 1st and 2nd postoperative days, 4 hours after the routine analgesic drug&#xD;
      administration, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure and SPO2 were measured and recorded&#xD;
      in the patient follow-up form. After assessing the severity of pain with the &quot;Visual&#xD;
      Comparison Scale&quot; and the anxiety with the &quot;STAI-I State Anxiety Inventory&quot;, the patient was&#xD;
      evaluated once a day for 25-30 minutes, depending on the group he was in. minute reiki/sham&#xD;
      reiki was applied. 5 minutes after the end of the application. Then, the patient's pulse,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, blood pressure and SPO2 were measured again and recorded in the Patient&#xD;
      Follow-up Form. The severity of pain was re-evaluated with the &quot;Visual Comparison Scale&quot; and&#xD;
      the state anxiety level with the &quot;STAI-I State Anxiety Inventory&quot;. The analgesic&#xD;
      doses/numbers used on the 1st and 2nd days were recorded in the &quot;Analgesic Usage Follow-up&#xD;
      Form&quot;. Routine postoperative care was given to the control group without any intervention,&#xD;
      and data collection tools were applied at the same time as the experimental group twice at&#xD;
      30-minute intervals. After the final evaluation on the 2nd day, Reiki and Sham Reiki were&#xD;
      applied to the group, and the &quot;Reiki Application Feedback Form&quot; was applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyzes were performed using a package program called SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      24). Frequency tables and descriptive statistics were used to interpret the findings.&#xD;
      Parametric methods were used for measurement values suitable for normal distribution. The&#xD;
      &quot;Independent Sample-t&quot; test (t-table value) was used and the &quot;ANOVA&quot; test (F-table value)&#xD;
      method was used to compare the measurement values of two independent groups in accordance&#xD;
      with parametric methods. Compare the measurement values of three or more independent groups.&#xD;
      The &quot;Paired Sample-t&quot; test (t-table value) method was used to compare the measurement values&#xD;
      of the two dependent groups. Non-parametric methods were used for the measurement values that&#xD;
      did not fit the normal distribution. &quot;Mann-Whitney U&quot; test (Z-table value) and&#xD;
      &quot;Kruskal-Wallis H&quot; test (Ï‡2-table value) were used to compare the measured values of two&#xD;
      independent groups in accordance with non-parametric methods. ) method was used to compare&#xD;
      the measurement values of three or more independent groups. . The &quot;Wilcoxon&quot; test (Z-table&#xD;
      value) method was used to compare the measurement values of the two dependent groups.&#xD;
