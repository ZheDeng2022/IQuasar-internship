  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The T790M mutation is highly sensitive to osimertinib, which is approved in this setting&#xD;
      following failure of gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib. In contrast to first- and&#xD;
      second-generation EGFR TKIs, no predominant resistance mechanism to first-line osimertinib&#xD;
      has been clearly defined yet. The most common mechanisms of resistance were c-MET&#xD;
      amplification only for 15% of patients and the emergence of the EGFR C797S mutation in 7%,&#xD;
      while &gt; 60% of patients were still with no identifiable mechanisms of resistance. As a&#xD;
      result, targeted treatment options following first-line osimertinib failure remain limited.&#xD;
      Thus, interest on sequential administration of EGFR TKIs in patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutation-positive NSCLC has been growing. So, here in this study, we intend to investigate&#xD;
      treatment outcome (TOT) along with the several treatment options starting from the first line&#xD;
      EGFR TKI treatment to various second line treatments including 3rd generation TKI and&#xD;
      chemotherapy and others.&#xD;

    <description>This is non-interventional, multi-center, multi-cohort study based on existing data from EGFR sensitizing mutation-positive NSCLC patients treated with afatinib as the first-line treatment. Enrolled patients will be categorized into four cohorts (cohort A, B, C and D) according to the type of second line treatment with biopsy results before start of second line treatment.</description>

          1. Age more than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Stage IIIB/IIIC/IV/IVA/IVB NSCLC patients treated with first-line afatinib for EGFR&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Afatinib treatment was started 13 month prior to data collection date to reduce&#xD;

          1. Patients who received drug(s) other than afatinib (GiotrifÂ®) as the first-line&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;

          2. Patients who received drug(s) other than 3rd-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib as the&#xD;
