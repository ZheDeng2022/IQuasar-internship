    <textblock>
      Obtain PSMA-PET imaging preoperatively and calculate performance for predicting&#xD;
      extra-prostatic extension based on whole-mount pathology (gold standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantify the frequency of proper treatment changes directed by PSMA-PET, focusing on&#xD;
      appropriate preservation of surrounding structures important for genito-urinary function&#xD;
      including: 1) Bladder neck, 2) Nerve bundles, 3) Urethral Sphincter (Figure 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directly compare PSMA-PET performance for predicting extra-prostatic extension to&#xD;
      standard-of-care assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess quality of life changes from preoperative baseline.&#xD;
