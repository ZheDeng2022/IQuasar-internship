  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SCALE-UP Utah is a community-academic partnership to address COVID-19 among Utah community&#xD;
      health centers. The long-term objective of the project is to increase the reach, acceptance,&#xD;
      and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among Utah's Community Health Center patient population. The&#xD;
      study will compare two practical, feasible, scalable interventions to increase COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine uptake in Utah Community Health Centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Text Messaging (TM): population health management (PHM) intervention that analyzes EHR&#xD;
           data to automatically identify patients eligible for COVID-19 vaccination and uses&#xD;
           bi-directional text messaging to help connect patients to a vaccination site;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Navigation (PN): PHM intervention to increase vaccination uptake among eligible&#xD;
           patients (identified via TM) using patient navigation (e.g., motivating patients,&#xD;
           addressing logistics and barriers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will employ a rapid cycle research approach in which interventions are tested on&#xD;
      a small scale, using short time frames (e.g., &lt;1 month) and cyclical evaluation cycles. The&#xD;
      process will entail implementing interventions in a small number of clinics/patients,&#xD;
      evaluating the results, and either adapting the intervention based on results (and&#xD;
      retesting), or disseminating the results to other clinics/patients. A critical aspect of&#xD;
      these rapid-research cycles is that change can be quickly tested on a small scale, and then&#xD;
      disseminated to other clinics/patients. Moreover, we are able to update and adapt the&#xD;
      interventions based on changes vaccine regulations, availability, and protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement and evaluate PHM interventions for increasing the uptake of COVID-19&#xD;
           vaccinations among CHC patients across Utah. Our primary outcome, Uptake-Eligible, is&#xD;
           defined as the proportion of patients who receive a COVID-19 vaccination out of those&#xD;
           who meet eligibility criteria for vaccination. Our study hypothesis is that patients in&#xD;
           the TM+PN cohort will have higher rates of uptake-eligible than those in the TM cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine implementation effectiveness outcomes, as well as characteristics of both&#xD;
           clinics and patients that may influence intervention effects and implementation&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SCALE-UP Utah is a patient-level intervention involving 12 Community Health Centers (39&#xD;
      individual clinics) across Utah. The study is designed to utilize Community Health Center&#xD;
      patient records to proactively reach patients for COVID-19 vaccinations. This intervention&#xD;
      includes a randomization component between two interventions, text messaging (TM) or text&#xD;
      messaging with patient navigation (TM+PN). These two intervention paths are occurring&#xD;
      simultaneously within the same clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text messaging (TM) and text messaging with patient navigation (TM+PN)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the TM condition will receive HIPAA-compliant bidirectional text messages.&#xD;
      These texts will include a brief message alerting patients that they are eligible to receive&#xD;
      the vaccine and asking participants if they would like to schedule a vaccine. Participants&#xD;
      who reply &quot;yes&quot; will receive an additional message with information about how and where to&#xD;
      register for the vaccine. This information will vary depending on local availability.&#xD;
      Participants who reply &quot;no&quot; will receive a text requesting they contact their local clinic&#xD;
      when they decide to receive the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the TM+PN condition will receive the same text message as the participants in&#xD;
      the TM condition. Texts will include a brief message alerting patients that they are eligible&#xD;
      to receive the vaccine and asking participants if they would like to schedule a vaccine.&#xD;
      Participants who reply &quot;yes&quot; will receive the same information about how and where to receive&#xD;
      a vaccine however, they will also receive a message alerting them that a Community Health&#xD;
      Worker will contact them to assist with this process, in case they need that. At this time&#xD;
      the participant has the option to opt-out of this follow up phone call. The patient&#xD;
      navigation from the Community Health Worker includes practical advice in addressing barriers&#xD;
      to vaccination such as logistics and transportation, as well as fear, skepticism, and&#xD;
      hesitancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step One: Primary Data Extraction To identify the cohort for the TM and TM+PN interventions,&#xD;
      a subset of EHR data will be manually extracted from the Community Health Centers as text&#xD;
      files generated by EHR reports. The first set of EHR reports will contain all patients seen&#xD;
      at each of the Community Health Centers in the last 3 years. Subsequent reports will be&#xD;
      obtained weekly, including all encounters in the previous week. Data fields will include risk&#xD;
      factors such as age, gender, body mass index, encounter diagnoses for medical co-morbidities,&#xD;
      patient demographics (e.g., zip code, insurance status, preferred language, race/ethnicity);&#xD;
      as well as cellphone number for text messaging and patient navigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step Two: Randomization &amp; Cohort Selection. Once the data are securely housed, all patients&#xD;
      will be assigned to either the TM or TM+PN arm of the intervention. This assignment will&#xD;
      remain consistent throughout the study. Cohort selection for the text messages will be based&#xD;
      on EHR data considering factors such as age, race/ethnicity, language, relevant medical&#xD;
      comorbidities, and residence in low-vaccination areas. These selection criteria are&#xD;
      consistent with recommendations from Utah Department of Health and the Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step Three: Implementation. SCALE-UP Utah will send HIPPA-compliant bidirectional texts,&#xD;
      which is a communication method routinely used by the Community Health Centers, to patients&#xD;
      who are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. Text messages will be designed by the research&#xD;
      team and sent using a HIPPA compliant text messaging service. The text messaging service will&#xD;
      retrieve the patient cohort from the study database to send the texts to the patients. The&#xD;
      text messages will appear to the patients as having originated from their Community Health&#xD;
      Center. As part of their general Community Health Center care, patients have agreed to be&#xD;
      contacted by their Community Health Center and text message communication is one of those&#xD;
      established contact methods. Text messages will be repeated bi-weekly to continuously prompt&#xD;
      vaccination update. This process will repeat until the participant indicates that they have&#xD;
      either scheduled or received their vaccination. Every text message will include the option to&#xD;
      reply STOP to opt-out of receiving text messages at any time.&#xD;
