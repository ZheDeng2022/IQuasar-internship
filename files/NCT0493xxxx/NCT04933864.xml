  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the epidemiological situation worldwide and the number of vaccinations made,&#xD;
      there is little success in the fight against COVID-19. For many reasons, methylene blue is a&#xD;
      promising drug for an active treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Since methylene&#xD;
      blue can work as a photosensitizer, photodynamic therapy as an antiviral treatment has great&#xD;
      potential in the treatment of COVID-19. This clinical study investigated the effectiveness of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infected people treatment using methylene blue and the following photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy on the base of the L.L. Levshin Institute of Cluster Oncology (Department of&#xD;
      Infectious Diseases â„–13) of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, parallel, single masking clinical study 60 participants aged 18-90 with&#xD;
      one positive COVID-19 quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction test and any severity of&#xD;
      pneumonia (checked by computer tomography scans) were recruited. The experimental and control&#xD;
      samples included 30 participants. Randomization was performed using the Random Number Table&#xD;
      generated in STATISTICA Advanced 13.3. The physiological parameters including oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, severity of pneumonia using computer tomography scans, heart rate, symptoms, and&#xD;
      physical examination were collected. Participants in the experimental sample received&#xD;
      methylthioninium chloride, Methylene Blue (SamaraMedProm, Russia, Registration number:&#xD;
      MP-001834, 13.09.2012) orally in concentration 1 mg/kg in addition to the current therapy of&#xD;
      the participant (e.g., azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, aminodihydrophthalazinedione sodium,&#xD;
      levofloxacin, etc.), if any. After 3 hours, photodynamic therapy of the participant's chest&#xD;
      by a 650 nm laser source (UFPh-675-01-BIOSPEC, BIOSPEC, Russia, Registration number:&#xD;
      2009/04648, 26.03.2009) with 18 J/cm^2 energy dose was performed for 50 minutes. If the&#xD;
      participant is in a critical state, inhalation by 0.2 mg Methylene Blue 10 ml water solution&#xD;
      and following photodynamic therapy of pharynx and nasal cavity using 650 nm laser source with&#xD;
      36 J/cm^2 energy dose during 10 minutes were performed. Participants in the control sample&#xD;
      received only standard medical supportive therapy (e.g., azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine,&#xD;
      aminodihydrophthalazinedione sodium, levofloxacin, etc.). All next steps were performed for p&#xD;
      participants from the experimental sample: 12 and 24 hours after photodynamic therapy, blood&#xD;
      saturation were measured. 2 days after - participants will take a quantitative polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction test. 14 days after - computer tomography Aquilion One 640 (Canon Medical&#xD;
      Systems Corporation, Registration Certificate FSZ 2008/01304, 02.07.2018) scans were&#xD;
      performed. The participant's status scale (EQ-5D-3L, SHOCS-COVID score, validated) was&#xD;
      checked on day 84. On 24 and 84 days all participants were checked whether they are alive or&#xD;
      not by phone call. For participants in the control sample continuous check of blood&#xD;
      saturation, quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction tests after 2 and 14 days of treatment,&#xD;
      and computer tomography scans were performed. The primary outcome of this study is to&#xD;
      calculate the percentage of participants with negative quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction&#xD;
      test on SARS-CoV-2 by 2 days after methylene blue administration and photodynamic therapy.&#xD;
      Experimental and control samples were comparable in gender, age, and severity of the disease.&#xD;
      Z-test was used to analyze results on quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction tests within&#xD;
      control and experimental samples. For each sample paired Student t-test was used to analyze&#xD;
      individual saturation changes. Wilcoxon criterion was used for data on severity of pneumonia&#xD;
      and status scale.&#xD;
