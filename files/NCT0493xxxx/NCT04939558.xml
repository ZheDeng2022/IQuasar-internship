  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a new breathing device called 'N-Tidal C' handset which measures breathing&#xD;
      patterns. Investigators have found that people with cardiac and respiratory illnesses breathe&#xD;
      out a gas, called carbon dioxide (CO2), in a different way to healthy people. The pattern of&#xD;
      breathed out CO2 (the waveform) varies according to the underlying health of the user's&#xD;
      lungs. Monitoring these changes may help doctors to more accurately diagnose and monitor the&#xD;
      most common and serious respiratory conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is among the most prevalent respiratory&#xD;
      conditions, and in the top five causes of death worldwide. However, mis-diagnosis rates are&#xD;
      high (both under- and over- diagnosis), owing to the lack of a simple, reliable and specific&#xD;
      diagnostic test. In addition, COPD is often diagnosed late in the natural history of the&#xD;
      disease, which misses the opportunity for early intervention, with early treatment and&#xD;
      health-behaviour changes (smoking cessation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry, the current gold standard for diagnosis, is unreliable (technique-dependent),&#xD;
      crude (measures airflow), and non-specific (multiple respiratory conditions can produce&#xD;
      similar patterns on spirometry). It also relies on proper administration by specially trained&#xD;
      members of staff. As a result, spirometry is often (a) not performed before a speculative&#xD;
      diagnosis of COPD is made, and (b) performed poorly, resulting in poor-quality information on&#xD;
      which to base a respiratory diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is therefore a need for a simple, reliable, robust and accurate test for diagnosing&#xD;
      COPD which is non-operator dependent, and non-technique dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, capnography is invasive, expensive and can only be recorded in specialist centres&#xD;
      via a nasal cannula and micro-stream sampling of expired carbon dioxide in the intensive care&#xD;
      setting. The N-Tidal C (NTC) handset, a new (CE-marked), hand-held, wireless device has been&#xD;
      developed to monitor the user's Tidal Breathing CO2 (TBCO2) waveforms at rest, during normal&#xD;
      tidal breathing. This device can be safely operated in the home environment, has a battery&#xD;
      life of weeks, and has an isolated, disposable, breath pathway that isolates an individual's&#xD;
      breath from the rest of the device, making it safe to reuse between patients after the outer&#xD;
      casing has been decontaminated using a 3-stage disinfection process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The N-Tidal technology has the potential to offer new insights into lung physiology (above&#xD;
      and beyond those currently available from spirometry and lung function testing), and early&#xD;
      evidence from CRI's previous clinical studies suggests that the TBCO2 data could be used to&#xD;
      fingerprint and diagnose COPD.&#xD;
