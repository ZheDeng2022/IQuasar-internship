    <textblock>
      Behavioral and emotional disorders adversely affect overall health and well-being. Prevalence&#xD;
      rates among children and adolescents classified with behavioral and emotional disorders or&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), as recently redefined in ICD-11, have steadily increased&#xD;
      over the past decade. In particular, prevalence rates among persons classified with Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorders (ASD), the fastest rising behavioral and emotional disorder, have sharply&#xD;
      risen over the past five years and is now estimated at 1 in 54. Shared symptoms within&#xD;
      behavioral and emotional disorders include persistent social, emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      functioning deficits that often impact self-management, social-awareness and metacognition&#xD;
      competences, in addition to adulthood health and wellness life course transition management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) stakeholder advocates have contributed meaningfully to&#xD;
      the strengthening of behavioral and emotional health through interventions that focus&#xD;
      primarily on physical and mental health outcomes of diagnosed individuals. However, focus on&#xD;
      spiritual health outcomes and the at-risk population remain largely underutilized. Research&#xD;
      that seeks to employ an integrative physical-mental-spiritual approach to strengthen social,&#xD;
      emotional and behavioral resilience, of at-risk school age populations where social stigma&#xD;
      and prohibitive treatment costs remain barriers to treatment is needed to help expand the&#xD;
      field's understanding of the reciprocal relationship between spiritual health and emotional&#xD;
      and behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RENEW (Resilience in Emotional and Behavioral Wellbeing) intervention will employ a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach of social and emotional learning competency training, gamification&#xD;
      principles and faith-centered values to strengthen social, behavioral and emotional&#xD;
      resilience and competencies of those at risk for behavioral and emotional disorders, via a&#xD;
      child-as co-researcher approach.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Emotional and Behavior Disorders (EBD) or neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) as recently&#xD;
      redefined are a collection of behavioral and cognitive disorder classifications that describe&#xD;
      a spectrum of deficits in social functioning, metacognition and self-management competencies,&#xD;
      in particular, among children and adolescence. The subcategories of NDDs as listed in World&#xD;
      Health Organization's 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of&#xD;
      Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) include Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),&#xD;
      Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Development of Learning Disorder and&#xD;
      Disorders of Intellectual Development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence rates among children and adolescents classified with EBDs or NDDs have steadily&#xD;
      increased over the past decade. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) or Autism Spectrum Conditions&#xD;
      (ASC) is the fastest growing NDD affecting approximately one percent (1%) of the world's&#xD;
      population. Prevalence rates among persons diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC)&#xD;
      have steadily risen over the past decade and are now estimated at 1 in 54. Autism's spectrum&#xD;
      of social, emotional and behavioral impairments often range in severity and impact poor&#xD;
      adulthood outcomes, primarily in health and wellness life course trajectories, of the&#xD;
      unclassified. Shared symptoms within EBDs/NDDs include persistent social and behavioral&#xD;
      functioning deficits that often impact self-management, social-awareness and metacognition&#xD;
      competences, in addition to adulthood health and wellness life course transition management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are three main ways to classify&#xD;
      health interventions, namely by target (the entity on which the action is carried out),&#xD;
      action (a deed done by an actor to a target), or means (the process and methods by which the&#xD;
      action is carried out). Empirical research has identified currently available social and&#xD;
      emotional learning (SEL) interventions that target the clinically diagnosed. However, an&#xD;
      issue with such interventions is that they provide no support to at-risk and/or undiagnosed&#xD;
      behavioral and emotional disorder (EBD) vulnerable populations. The SEL intervention&#xD;
      literature has also documented available psychosocial actions to support EBD children and&#xD;
      young persons, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and executive functioning skills&#xD;
      training. However, a vulnerability of these actions is that they are often secular or void of&#xD;
      a spiritual, religious or personal belief dimension to effect meaningful transformation as&#xD;
      well as not participatory of EBD youth in the research process. Lastly, the SEL intervention&#xD;
      literature has illuminated evidence on the available means/methods to support or deliver&#xD;
      actions to EBD youth, such as via commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, virtual reality&#xD;
      (VR) technologies, games and robot-based platforms. However, a drawback of such means or&#xD;
      methods is that they are often cost prohibitive, not conducive to facilitating citizen&#xD;
      development and lacking in gamification features to strengthen end user engagement. Thus,&#xD;
      there is a need to supplement the existing SEL intervention literature with programs that&#xD;
      support spiritual health outcomes of at-risk EBD youth in a manner that fosters co-researcher&#xD;
      opportunities and generates a social return on investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this paper, we describe a protocol for a pilot evaluation of a faith-centered,&#xD;
      non-medical, gamification assisted intervention, dubbed RENEW (Resilience in Emotional and&#xD;
      Behavioral Wellbeing), an innovative, culturally appropriate, cost effective and&#xD;
      participatory program developed to identify and strengthen social emotional behavioral&#xD;
      resilience among primary and middle age school children populations who are increasingly&#xD;
      exhibiting social emotional behavior symptoms. The research is situated at the intersection&#xD;
      of technology, spirituality and global health practice in effort to strengthen contributions&#xD;
      to health and wellness outputs, outcomes and impacts. The research endeavor will employ a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary blend of gamification principles, co-researcher participation and&#xD;
      faith-centered values to strengthen social, behavioral and emotional resilience competencies&#xD;
      in effort to enhance social and behavioral deficit management.&#xD;
