  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural therapy (iCBT) based ecological momentary intervention (EMI) for psychological&#xD;
      well-being in stroke family caregivers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many stroke patients require long-term care in the community. In Hong Kong (HK), most stroke&#xD;
      caregivers in the community are family members, and many require psychological support for&#xD;
      caregiver stress. However, these caregivers have difficulties accessing existing centre-based&#xD;
      services due to varying work and care responsibilities, and therefore require alternative&#xD;
      support services to meet their unique needs and schedules. Evidence shows that&#xD;
      internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) is effective in managing&#xD;
      psychological distress including depressive symptoms, especially when guided by healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. Ecological momentary intervention (EMI) is an innovative and cost-effective&#xD;
      intervention 'framework' that utilises mobile messages to deliver personalised psychological&#xD;
      interventions. The proposed trial aims to deliver iCBT-based EMI through instant messaging&#xD;
      applications (e.g. WhatsApp) to provide personalised and real-time psychological support led&#xD;
      by nurses. Screened stroke caregivers with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores&#xD;
      ranging from 5 to 19 (mild to moderately severe depressive symptoms) will be recruited from&#xD;
      community centres, rehabilitation centres and outpatient clinics in HK. They will then be&#xD;
      individually randomised into the Intervention group (n=128) or Control group (n=128). The&#xD;
      Intervention group will receive the iCBT-based EMI for 12 weeks, which includes instant&#xD;
      messages sent at the times and frequencies of the participants' choosing, and chat-based&#xD;
      psychological support led by nurses to enhance effects of iCBT through real-time counselling&#xD;
      and practical advice. The control group will only receive instant messages on general mental&#xD;
      health information and reminders to participate in follow-up surveys. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      PHQ-9 scores at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include anxiety, perceived stress,&#xD;
      caregiver burden, caring experience, spiritual well-being and quality-of-daily-life. We will&#xD;
      strictly follow the CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist. A post-trial qualitative study will be&#xD;
      conducted to understand the participants' experience of and compliance with the EMI. The&#xD;
      intervention will be highly applicable for all caregivers requiring psychological support and&#xD;
      will be one step further in meeting the World Health Organization's recommendations in&#xD;
      supporting caregivers in the context of global ageing populations.&#xD;
