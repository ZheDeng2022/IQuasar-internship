      This study is aiming to demonstrate the non-inferiority of AbobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A)&#xD;
      versus OnabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNT-A) as the primary safety endpoint, and the superiority of&#xD;
      aboBoNT-A over onaBoNT-A with respect to duration of response as the key secondary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint when used at optimal doses according to approved prescribing information of each&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
