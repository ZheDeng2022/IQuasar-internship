  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster-randomized trial designed to compare the effectiveness of the CombinADO&#xD;
      strategy versus optimized standard of care (SOC) on viral suppression, antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART) adherence and retention in HIV care among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) ages 10&#xD;
      to 24 years attending participating health facilities. Clinics are the units of intervention&#xD;
      allocation and randomization. The control condition will be implemented at all facilities&#xD;
      (n=12) participating in the trial. The enhanced intervention condition will be superadded to&#xD;
      this at a randomly selected half (n=6) of facilities. The goal of this study is to learn&#xD;
      whether an enhanced, tailored intervention helps AYAHIV do better with their HIV care (take&#xD;
      their medications, stay in care) than the usual care that they receive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV burden among adolescents and young people worldwide is substantial, with an estimated 1.7&#xD;
      million adolescents aged 10-19 years living with HIV in 2019, and 460,000 adolescents aged&#xD;
      15-24 newly infected reported in the same year. Adolescent girls continue to be&#xD;
      disproportionately affected, accounting for 56% of new infections worldwide. With increased&#xD;
      availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), pediatric mortality has decreased and&#xD;
      healthcare workers (HCW) are now challenged to meet the complex needs of the large number of&#xD;
      surviving youth who must cope with HIV as a chronic, highly stigmatized, and transmittable&#xD;
      illness. There are 1.8 billion people between ages 10 and 24 and it is projected that the&#xD;
      number of people &lt;20 years will double by 2030. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), youth aged 10-24&#xD;
      years comprise 30-35% of the countries' population. Failure to prevent new HIV infections&#xD;
      among adolescents will result in increased numbers of adolescents and young adults living&#xD;
      with HIV (AYAHIV) who will strain health and social service systems as they transition to&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months post intervention implementation</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported ART adherence among adolescents and young people living with HIV at intervention versus control sites will be measured using a three-item adherence scale. The three items include (1) an assessment of the number of days with missed ART doses in the preceding 30 days [0-30 days]; (2) a scale rating of how good a job you did taking your medicines in the preceding 30 days (never/rarely/sometimes/usually/almost always/always) and (3) a scale rating of how often you took your medicines the way you were supposed to in the preceding 30 days (very poor/poor/fair/good/very good/ excellent).&#xD;
For analyses using raw scores, item responses for the three adherence items will be linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale with zero being the worst adherence, and 100 representing perfect adherence. The mean of the three scores are then taken to get an equally weight aggregate scale score. An overall mean from the scores from all participants will be reported.</description>
