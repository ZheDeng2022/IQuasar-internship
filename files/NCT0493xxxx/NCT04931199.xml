  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to preliminarily evaluate a web-based app to improve provider&#xD;
      implementation and patient engagement in homework (i.e., between-session practice of skills&#xD;
      learned during therapy) during child mental health treatment by conducting a small-scale&#xD;
      feasibility trial in community practice settings comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      to CBT enhanced with the app.&#xD;
