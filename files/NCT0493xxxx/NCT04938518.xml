    <textblock>
      In 2014, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) issued treatment goals for&#xD;
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the 90-90-90 target. It is important to track success&#xD;
      results at each stage of the HIV continuum of care to evaluate progress towards the 90-90-90&#xD;
      target. Although ART can suppress HIV-1 infection to undetectable levels of plasma viremia,&#xD;
      HIV DNA integrate and persist in resting CD4+ T cells. Most of the HIV DNA in these cells is&#xD;
      defective and cannot cause infection. However, latent HIV-1 genomes that encode&#xD;
      replication-competent virus can resurface once ART is discontinued. This latent reservoir is&#xD;
      believed to be the largest impediment to a cure by ART alone. There is need for expansion of&#xD;
      research examining HIV latency in the context of sustained viral suppression with an eye&#xD;
      towards developing a possible cure regimen that could be used on a large scale. To date,&#xD;
      there have been no systematic studies to quantify the latent reservoir in virally suppressed&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients in Africa. Detecting how much of the inducible virus is left in the&#xD;
      human body after ART poses the greatest challenge to fully curing HIV. This study is designed&#xD;
      to enroll 222 virally suppressed HIV infected men and women, who will be prospectively&#xD;
      followed to document antiviral cocktail, viral suppression and incidences of rebound, measure&#xD;
      the size of the latent HIV reservoir and examine the immunological correlates of the latent&#xD;
      reservoir. Data generated through this study will provide a clear framework for high-burden&#xD;
      countries to reduce gaps at each stage of the HIV continuum of care, maximize linkage,&#xD;
      retention and health outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Based on the 2013 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey, 58% of people living with HIV/AIDS&#xD;
      (PLWHA) aged 15-64 years in Kenya were eligible for Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), but only&#xD;
      63% of them were found to have been initiated. Previous studies have shown that an estimated&#xD;
      33% to 40% of patients are expected to fail treatment in the first 12 months of second-line&#xD;
      ART. In many low and middle income countries (LMIC) with no third-line regimens available,&#xD;
      second-line ART is the last option for patients hence failure greatly impacts patients&#xD;
      management. A study in Kenyan national ART program suggests that about 27% of patients with&#xD;
      second-line failure are in need of a switch to third-line therapy, with 25% demonstrating&#xD;
      complete exhaustion of alternative first and second-line regimens. Although new drugs for HIV&#xD;
      treatment are being developed, HIV treatment options within national programmes remain&#xD;
      limited. Therefore, the durability of switch to second-line regimens as well as durability to&#xD;
      second-line regimens is critical for the long-term success of ART and ultimately patient&#xD;
      survival. Fortunately, virological (VL) failure on second-line ART does not necessarily&#xD;
      warrant a switch to a third-line regimen, as Protease Inhibitors (PIs) have a high genetic&#xD;
      barrier to resistance mutations, particularly among PI naïve patients. As failure on&#xD;
      second-line ART is more related to suboptimal adherence than drug resistance, the management&#xD;
      of VL failure on second-line typically involves intensified adherence counselling with drug&#xD;
      substitutions recommended in cases of documented resistance mutations, severe adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions (ADR) or drug interactions. While rates of drug substitutions and the durability of&#xD;
      first-line ART have been previously described, there is very little information on patterns&#xD;
      of drug substitutions for patients on second-line ART across ART national guideline-specific&#xD;
      periods. Additionally, little is known about the impact of ART guideline changes on the&#xD;
      durability of second-line ART and continuity of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While determining the durability of ART is critical in terms of monitoring success and&#xD;
      possible ART mutations, the desired outcome is eradication of HIV by 2030.The concept of&#xD;
      eradication of the HIV from infected patients has therefore gained much attention in the last&#xD;
      few years. ART has changed the dynamic of the HIV epidemic through suppression of HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      to undetectable plasma levels. As a sign of the seriousness of countries to achieve 90-90-90,&#xD;
      it is important to track success results at each stage of the HIV continuum of care and most&#xD;
      importantly the viral suppression. Although antiretroviral therapy can suppress HIV-1&#xD;
      infection to undetectable levels of plasma viremia, HIV DNA integrate and persist in resting&#xD;
      CD4+ T cells. Latent HIV infection of CD4+ T cells, established during the early stages of&#xD;
      infection, necessitates lifelong ART, and treatment failure can lead to the selection of drug&#xD;
      resistance mutations in the viral genome, which may be archived in the cellular reservoir.&#xD;
      Most of the HIV DNA in these cells is defective and cannot cause infection. However, latent&#xD;
      HIV-1 genomes that encode replication- competent virus can resurface once ART is&#xD;
      discontinued. This latent reservoir having replication- competent virus has a long half-life,&#xD;
      and is believed to be the largest impediment to a cure by ART alone. This justifies expansion&#xD;
      of research examining HIV latency in the context of sustained viral suppression with an eye&#xD;
      towards developing a possible cure regimen that could be used on a large scale. Recently,&#xD;
      pharmaceutical approaches have focused on the development of molecules able to reactivate HIV&#xD;
      from latently infected cells in order to render them susceptible to combined antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (c-ART), viral cytopathic effects and host immune responses. Obviously, exposing&#xD;
      latent virus and killing it with ART rests on an assumption that the activated virus will be&#xD;
      susceptible to the ART a person takes. As such, it is important to discern whether&#xD;
      reactivated HIV proviruses are susceptible to the ART regimen for maximum benefit to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of HIV-infected individuals currently live in sub-Saharan Africa where&#xD;
      fully suppressive ART is expanding rapidly. Due to this expansion, a large number of patients&#xD;
      are expected to achieve full viral suppression. There is need therefore to quantify and&#xD;
      document the size of latent HIV reservoir in virally suppressed patients in this region for&#xD;
      individualized treatment. To date, there have been no systematic studies to quantify the&#xD;
      latent reservoir in virally suppressed HIV-infected patients in Africa. Detecting how much of&#xD;
      the inducible virus is left in the human body after antiretroviral therapy poses the greatest&#xD;
      challenge to fully curing HIV. Stratifying virally suppressed patients base on the quantity&#xD;
      of latent HIV, ART regimens and immune status may inform eligible candidates for latency&#xD;
      reactivation care when one comes available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Archived proviruses in the latent reservoir are sustained in aviremic patients&#xD;
      and are an impediment to HIV cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective: Investigate the impact of inducible, replication-competent latent HIV-1 as&#xD;
      an impediment to HIV/AIDS cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document treatment cocktail and determine the rate of viral rebound in aviremic&#xD;
           patients; As a sign of the seriousness of countries to achieve 90-90-90, it is important&#xD;
           to track success results at each stage of the HIV continuum of care. The investigator&#xD;
           will conduct three analyses on patients: 1) Document antiviral cocktail; 2) Duration of&#xD;
           viral suppression; 3) Monitor incidences of viral rebound. This will provide a clear&#xD;
           framework for using data to maximize linkage, retention and health outcomes. It will&#xD;
           also help high-burden countries to use this data at a sub-national and county level to&#xD;
           improve service linkage and reduce gaps at each stage of the HIV continuum of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine and measure the size of latent HIV reservoirs in virally suppressed patients;&#xD;
           Once a patient achieves viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy, it becomes very&#xD;
           important to tell how much virus is still left, and whether it can replicate. Such data&#xD;
           may lead to an understanding of HIV pathogenesis and to adjust the therapy to improve&#xD;
           the quality of life of the HIV patient and inform HIV-1 eradication strategies. This&#xD;
           data will enable to identify patients who will be eligible candidates for cure treatment&#xD;
           when one comes available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the level of immune activation in virally suppressed HIV-infected patients in&#xD;
           correlation with the size of the reservoir; In addition to harboring HIV-1 in a&#xD;
           long-lived reservoir, individuals on ART have persistently elevated levels of&#xD;
           inflammation and T cell activation. Abnormal inflammation and immune activation may&#xD;
           contribute to HIV-1 persistence by driving proliferation and activation of&#xD;
           HIV-1-infected cells and by activating uninfected cells that can support low-level viral&#xD;
           replication. The investigator propose to evaluate sizes of HIV-1 reservoir in relation&#xD;
           to inflammation and T cell activation in HIV-1 in aviremic patients on therapy to inform&#xD;
           strategies aimed at reducing HIV-1 reservoirs, inflammation and activation that persist&#xD;
           despite ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study will utilize HIV-1 infected patients (18 to 70 years) attending&#xD;
      HIV care and treatment facilities in three counties of Meru, Kilifi, and Mombasa. Analysis of&#xD;
      medical records to document ART cocktail will be performed. Latent HIV will be determined in&#xD;
      patients with viral suppression, defined according to WHO guideline 2016, and followed for 24&#xD;
      months to monitor incidences of viral rebound. A viral load threshold of &lt;1000 copies/mL&#xD;
      defines treatment success according to the 2016 WHO consolidated guidelines on the use of&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection. Hence subjects with viral&#xD;
      load test results below the threshold will be considered as having suppressed viral loads and&#xD;
      included in the study. Subjects with complete suppression ( with viral loads below the limit&#xD;
      of detection) will also be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites: Participants (222) will be recruited from Tudor District Hospital in Mombasa,&#xD;
      Malindi District Hospital in Kilifi, Maua Methodist Hospital and Meru Level Five Hospital in&#xD;
      Meru Counties of Kenya. Sites were selected depending on volumes of HIV infected individuals&#xD;
      registered in the HIV comprehensive care centers who have been taking HAART for at least the&#xD;
      last 12 months and have shown virus suppression in at least one of the previous viral load&#xD;
      test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Hospitals will be purposively sampled from each of the three&#xD;
      counties of Meru, Kilifi and Mombasa due to the high HIV burden in those counties. Using the&#xD;
      reported HIV estimated prevalence in each of the three counties, the sample size will be&#xD;
      calculated for each county using the following formula by Armitage. Hence, sample size for;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mombasa County will be; 107 HIV infected individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Meru County will be; 43 HIV infected individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Kilifi County will be; 52 HIV infected individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a minimum sample size of 202 HIV infected individuals will be required for this&#xD;
      study. However, to account for potential non-response, non-compliance, and lost to follow-up&#xD;
      cases, 10% of the minimum sample size per county will be added hence 222 HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals in all the three counties will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration: Before commencement of the study, approval will be sought from the&#xD;
      Centre for Microbiology Research -KEMRI, Centre Scientific Committee (CSC) as well as the&#xD;
      KEMRI Scientific and Ethical Review Unit (SERU). Once the approval is obtained from KEMRI,&#xD;
      The investigator will pursue approval for the study from the respective county Director of&#xD;
      medical services where the study will be carried out. Thereafter approval from the sites&#xD;
      (hospitals) will be sought before commencement of the study. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from adult participants. Recruitment will be voluntary and volunteers will be&#xD;
      encouraged to ask questions concerning their rights. Study participants who, during the&#xD;
      course of the study are in any way incapacitated will have their consent sought afresh.&#xD;
      Participants will not incur any costs as a result of participating in the study and will be&#xD;
      free to withdraw from the study whenever they so wish. A coded identification number will be&#xD;
      assigned to each participant and used only for the purposes of sample tracking. Documents&#xD;
      linking personal identifiers and specimen results will be destroyed after the study. All&#xD;
      information will be kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and laboratory methods: Participant sociodemographic data, ART regimen, CD4+&#xD;
      cell count, opportunistic infections, World Health Organization (WHO) staging, and&#xD;
      physician-reported adherence will be retrospectively collected from patient folders. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 quantification at enrollment and after&#xD;
      every 6 months during follow up. Baseline viral load and CD4+ cell counts will be closest to&#xD;
      ART regimen start. All HIV-1 RNA levels obtained as part of the study, will be made&#xD;
      immediately available to the respective physician. The investigator will evaluate every&#xD;
      paired HIV-1 viral load (VL) and CD4 count performed to analyze the durability of viral&#xD;
      suppression and the risk of rebound among patients with virologic suppression. Time to&#xD;
      rebound will be computed using consecutive sequences of observations for subjects whose&#xD;
      initial two viral loads will be below the lower limit of quantification and had a viral load&#xD;
      measurement within the duration of follow up days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: A ratio paired test or equal variance two-sample t-test will be used to&#xD;
      calculate the significance while comparing sets of data whenever necessary. All statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using PRISM software. A P value of less or equal to 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered to be significant in each of the statistical analyses performed. Correlations&#xD;
      between two independent sets of data will be performed using the Pearson correlation&#xD;
      coefficient.&#xD;
