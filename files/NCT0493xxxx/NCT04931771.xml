      The FAST III is a randomized controlled, open-label, multicenter, international,&#xD;
      non-inferiority, strategy trial. A total of 2228 participants will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      fashion to either vFFR- or FFR guided revascularization. Patients will be consented prior to&#xD;
      the procedure and then followed up to 12 (+1) months after randomization. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is analyzed at 12 months after randomization. Approximately 35 sites in 7 European&#xD;
      countries (Netherlands, Ireland, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, and France).&#xD;

      The FAST III is a randomized controlled, open-label, multicenter, international,&#xD;
      non-inferiority, strategy trial of a vFFR guided strategy as compared to a FFR guided&#xD;
      strategy to guide coronary revascularization in 2228 subjects with intermediate coronary&#xD;
      artery lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria after the indication for coronary&#xD;
      catheterization is established. After providing informed consent, patients are enrolled.&#xD;
      Randomization is performed in the randomization module of the EDC system with an allocation&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1 and stratification by center. The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause&#xD;
      death, any myocardial infarction, or any revascularization at 1 year post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All deaths and major cardiovascular events, including the individual components of primary&#xD;
      and secondary endpoints are adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC),&#xD;
      using standardized definitions. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will&#xD;
      formally review the accumulating data to ensure there is no avoidable increased risk for harm&#xD;
      to participants. The FAST III trial is performed in accordance with the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), ISO 14155:2020, EC requirements and country specific&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;
