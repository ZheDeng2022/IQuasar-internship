  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, Phase 3, multicenter trial, which has been designed to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of T-Guard to ruxolitinib in patients with Grade III or IV&#xD;
      Steroid-Refractory acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (SR-aGVHD). The primary hypothesis is that&#xD;
      T-Guard treatment will improve the Day 28 complete response (CR) rate in patients with Grades&#xD;
      III and IV SR-aGVHD compared to ruxolitinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graft-vs-Host Disease (GVHD) is a complication that affects many hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HSCT) patients; it occurs when the new cells from a transplant attack the&#xD;
      recipient's body. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) typically develops within the first three months after&#xD;
      HSCT and is typically treated with steroid therapy. A significant fraction of the aGVHD&#xD;
      population (10-50%) fail to respond to treatment and are deemed steroid-refractory (SR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that develop Grade III or IV SR aGVHD will be randomized to receive T-Guard or&#xD;
      ruxolitinib and will be followed for approximately 180 days. Participants will be stratified&#xD;
      by center region (US vs. Europe) and age group (at least 55 years vs. under 55). Participants&#xD;
      randomized to the T-Guard arm will receive 4 doses administered intravenously as four 4-hour&#xD;
      infusions, and participants randomized to the ruxolitinib arm will receive one dose&#xD;
      administered orally twice a day. The primary analysis will include all participants that are&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
