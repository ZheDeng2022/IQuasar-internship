  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) might be more susceptible to infections and cancers&#xD;
      and chronic diseases than general population, not because of the presence of the disease&#xD;
      itself, but in relation to some specific therapies use or the degree of disability. Based on&#xD;
      the currently available knowledge, the use of many disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) requires&#xD;
      special attention to the possibility of infectious events or onset of cancer. In this&#xD;
      perspective, a still unmet clinical need in PwMS is the acquisition of a complete picture of&#xD;
      the immunization status against the main infectious diseases and the risk of cancer and other&#xD;
      chronic diseases. Adherence to preventive pathways can reduce screening time for access to&#xD;
      specific treatments, increase safety within complex therapies and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite of the relevance of preventive medicine in clinical decision making, there are no&#xD;
      studies in literature on the adherence of these patients to screening and vaccination&#xD;
      campaigns in Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study will be to describe the adherence to preventive medicine by PwMS,&#xD;
      investigating possible differences between PwMS and people without MS (PwoMS) in the access&#xD;
      to vaccinations and screenings. In addition, the investigators will try to identify, in both&#xD;
      groups, the potential variables correlated to preventive medicine adherence, including the&#xD;
      influence of the Covid(Coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 1-year project is conceived as a multicenter, observational and retrospective study,&#xD;
      divided in two parts. The first one is conceived as a cross-sectional study that will enrol&#xD;
      approximately 1250 patients from databases of Clinical Centers, Rehabilitation Units and&#xD;
      local branches of the Italian MS Society in Northern, Central and Southern Italy. Patients&#xD;
      over 25 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of MS will be enrolled. Data will be&#xD;
      collected through a questionnaire administered by telephone, upon written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part is designed as a case-control study, that will enrol a subgroup of 300 PwMS&#xD;
      (case group) and 300 PwoMS, matched by gender, age and residence area (control group) to&#xD;
      analyse the impact of disease and/or disability to access/adherence to preventive medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of immunization status and chronic diseases risk is critical for clinical practice&#xD;
      in the management of new DMDs but also for public health in determining the possible need for&#xD;
      integrated care pathways targeted to PwMS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease prevention is a set of &quot;specific, population-based and individual-based interventions&#xD;
      for primary and secondary (early detection) prevention, aiming to minimize the burden of&#xD;
      diseases and associated risk factors.&quot;. Depending on the objectives and the type of&#xD;
      intervention, three levels of prevention are distinguished:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Primary prevention: intervening before health effects occur, through measures such as&#xD;
           vaccinations, altering risky behaviours, and banning substances known to be associated&#xD;
           with a disease or health condition&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Secondary prevention: screening to identify diseases in the earliest stages, before the&#xD;
           onset of signs and symptoms&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Tertiary prevention: managing disease post diagnosis to slow or stop disease&#xD;
           progression through measures&quot; In this study the investigators will take in account&#xD;
           primary prevention, including vaccine, tobacco smoke, alcohol consumption and body mass&#xD;
           index, and secondary one, considering screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary prevention: Vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired&#xD;
      immunity to a particular pathogen and it represent &quot;a simple, safe, and effective way of&#xD;
      protecting people against harmful diseases, before they come into contact with them.&quot;.&#xD;
      Vaccination &quot;represent one of the most effective and cost-effective medical and public health&#xD;
      achievements of all time&quot; with the aim to protect not only the individuals but also the&#xD;
      population. According to WHO (world health organization), &quot;immunization is a key component of&#xD;
      primary health care and an indisputable human right&quot;. In Italy there is a lifetime&#xD;
      immunization schedule establishes the timing of mandatory and recommended vaccinations during&#xD;
      all life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Italian data on adult vaccination are available only for seasonal flu, reporting 15% of&#xD;
      subjects vaccinated (53% &gt;65, but only 9% in adults &lt;64 even if with chronic diseases (22%)),&#xD;
      and for rubella, showing that 39% of women of childbearing age are susceptible or unaware of&#xD;
      their immune status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering healthy lifestyle, most of Italian adults under 69 does not smoke (57%), but 18%&#xD;
      is an ex-smoker and 25% smokes. Considering alcohol consumption, 44% of Italian adults does&#xD;
      not consume alcohol, but 17% has a harmful use of it and 9% is a binge drinker. In addition,&#xD;
      more than one-third of the Italian population aged 18 and over (35%) is in overweight, while&#xD;
      just over one in ten is obese (11%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary prevention: Screening is defined as &quot;the presumptive identification of unrecognized&#xD;
      disease in an apparently healthy, asymptomatic population by means of tests, examinations or&#xD;
      other procedures that can be applied rapidly and easily to the target population. A screening&#xD;
      programme must include all the core components in the screening process from inviting the&#xD;
      target population to accessing effective treatment for individuals diagnosed with disease&quot;.&#xD;
      Mass screening involve the whole population, whereas the selective ones involve high-risk&#xD;
      groups of population (but in certain cases they can be in large-scale, such as oncologic&#xD;
      ones). Unlike diagnostic tests, used to make a diagnosis in symptomatic subjects, screening&#xD;
      tests are aimed at asymptomatic but potentially at-risk people, indicating a suspicion of&#xD;
      disease, and they can be repeated at regular interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening must be safe, simple and easy to administer, acceptable (with a minimal discomfort&#xD;
      for subjects), inexpensive, reliable and valid, distinguishing diseased and non-diseased&#xD;
      people. In Italy, organized screenings include tests for the detection of cervical, breast&#xD;
      and colorectal cancer. In addition to these, family doctors (GPs) can control blood pressure&#xD;
      and request diagnostic tests to control cholesterol, blood glucose, bone density and&#xD;
      dermatological visits to check moles. The measurement of prostate antigen levels is another&#xD;
      preventive investigation but is not currently considered a true screening because its&#xD;
      usefulness is still a topic of discussion because PSA (prostatic specific antigen) screening&#xD;
      could have more risks than benefits, especially. For this reason, the National centre for&#xD;
      screening monitoring (ONS) does not recommend population PSA screening, and it recommends the&#xD;
      test for diagnostic and non-preventive purposes only, especially for men&gt;70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy, organized screening campaigns, the only ones monitored by the ONS and by Italian&#xD;
      Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (PASSI), have an adhesion rate varying according&#xD;
      to geographical area. While coverage is almost complete in the Centre and the North, it&#xD;
      remains insufficient in the South due to the smaller extension of organized programs and to&#xD;
      the lower participation by citizens even with programs active. The coverage of mammography&#xD;
      screening, recommended for women between 50 and 69 ys (in some Regions extended also to the&#xD;
      age groups 45-49 and 70-74), reached 84% in the North, but only 62% in the South, although an&#xD;
      increase was recorded also in this area. Cervical screening, recommended for women between 25&#xD;
      and 64 ys, reached 88% in the North, and 69% in the South. The coverage of colorectal&#xD;
      screening, recommended for both sexes between 50 and 69 ys (in some Regions extended up to 74&#xD;
      ys), reached 69% in the North, while in the South still remained &lt;28%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, other variables can also affect the adherence to screening campaigns, such as&#xD;
      nationality, level of education and economic difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators have to consider that in the first 5 months of 2020, due to&#xD;
      pandemic of Covid-19, ONS registered a decrease of more than one million of screening exams&#xD;
      than the previous year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventive medicine among people with multiple sclerosis/disabilities: Studies in the USA&#xD;
      report a reduced access to preventive medicine for people with PwMS, especially for those&#xD;
      with severe disabilities. Studies on unhealthy lifestyle in PwMS report a higher prevalence&#xD;
      of smokers in PwMS than in general population, whereas for alcohol literature studies&#xD;
      published discordant results. Regarding BMI, a recent American case control study report no&#xD;
      difference on prevalence of overweight or obesity among PwMS and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Italy, however, there are no available study, and the American healthcare system differs&#xD;
      greatly from the Italian one (mainly private vs public).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding access to preventive medicine for subjects with various types of disabilities, the&#xD;
      Italian Health Observation Report analysed adherence to mammography, pap-test, colorectal and&#xD;
      flu vaccination campaigns (only for people over 65). The analysis showed that the number of&#xD;
      women with functional limitations who perform mammography and pap tests is reduced by more&#xD;
      than 15 percentage points than the general population. Regarding colorectal screening, men&#xD;
      with disabilities show no difference compared to the general population, while disabled women&#xD;
      adhere to the screening with a lower percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the access to vaccinations, the one against influenza appears to be carried out by&#xD;
      a higher percentage of men with disabilities than the Italian general population, but the&#xD;
      study presents the bias of having a different demographic composition in the two considered&#xD;
      cohorts since the one with functional limitation had more elders, for whom vaccination is&#xD;
      more recommended. Also American studies report conflicting results: Diab et al. showed higher&#xD;
      pneumococcal and seasonal flu vaccination rates in subjects with mild or medium disabilities&#xD;
      compared to those without disabilities or with severe disabilities, while a previous study&#xD;
      had found no difference between people with disabilities and the general population although&#xD;
      both vaccinations are more recommended in people with disabilities or chronic diseases due to&#xD;
      the greater risk of complications following infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and specific aims MS by itself do not increase the risk of other diseases, such as&#xD;
      cancer, cardiovascular or infectious ones. Although the risk of infection associated with&#xD;
      disability as well as the use of DMDs is well known, as well as their potential role in&#xD;
      causing cancer disease as an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment scenario, with the increase in available DMDs in recent years, requires&#xD;
      particular attention to tumour and infectious diseases both in the screening for therapy and&#xD;
      follow-up. This could improve the adherence to screening campaigns due to a specific request&#xD;
      of the neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the adherence to screening, it should be considered that PwMS with disabilities&#xD;
      might have difficulties to access to preventive medicine due to functional limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy there are no specific studies on PwMS, although knowing the prevalence of patients&#xD;
      who adhere to preventive medicine campaigns can be of great interest in public health&#xD;
      decision-making, to launch eventual ad hoc preventive pathways for these subjects. In&#xD;
      addition, having this information could help neurologists improving quality and timing in&#xD;
      decision making for treatment selection. Adherence to preventive pathways can reduce&#xD;
      screening time for access to specific treatments, increase safety within complex therapies&#xD;
      and reduce the risk of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Italian National Health Service guarantees integrated care pathways to people with&#xD;
      complex needs, and Tuscany, have set up care pathways for people with a severe disability or&#xD;
      special needs to promote fair access to health services, including prevention. This pathway&#xD;
      could be set up, if necessary, specifically for PwMS, in synergy with the neurologists of the&#xD;
      MS Centres and GPs who can play a strategic role in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study will be to describe the adherence to preventive medicine by PwMS,&#xD;
      investigating if there are differences between PwMS and people without MS (PwoMS) in the&#xD;
      access to vaccinations and screenings. In addition, the investigators will try to identify,&#xD;
      in both groups, the potential variables correlated to preventive medicine adherence,&#xD;
      including the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that at 18 years of age the subjects have already received the mandatory and&#xD;
      recommended vaccines provided by the vaccine calendar for childhood and adolescence, and that&#xD;
      the first institutional screening campaign (pap-test) starts from 25 years of age, the latter&#xD;
      was considered as the minimum age of enrolment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolment of patients will be carried out on all macro-areas considered by the ONS in&#xD;
      order to take into account the geographical differences present on the Italian Country. As&#xD;
      previously mentioned, in fact, the coverage of screening campaigns and the adherence to them&#xD;
      is lower in the South than in Central and Northern Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in two phases. A first phase consisting in a cross-sectional&#xD;
      study to describe the adherence to medicine preventive of PwMS and a second phase, where a&#xD;
      case-control study will be used to investigate differences in preventive medicine adherence&#xD;
      between PwMS and PwoMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Cross-sectional study Aim The specific aim will be to describe the adherence to&#xD;
      medicine preventive of PwMS. Moreover, the investigators will evaluate variables which could&#xD;
      affect the adherence to preventive medicine (screening and vaccines), such as sex, age,&#xD;
      residence, nationality, education level, occupation, socio-economic status, quality of life,&#xD;
      lifestyle (alcohol, smoke and BMI), MS forms, degree of MS-related disability and presence of&#xD;
      chronic comorbidities. The possible impact of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic will also be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Case-Control study Aim The specific aim will be to evaluate compliance rates for&#xD;
      main screening tests and vaccines between PwMS and PwoMS and to investigate any differences&#xD;
      in preventive medicine adherence between 2 groups. The investigators will use the same&#xD;
      variables considered in the first phase of the study to evaluate the real impact of MS and&#xD;
      disability level in the access/adherence of preventive measures, controlling for potentially&#xD;
      confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Cross-sectional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and sample The study design will be a multicentric cross-sectional. Participants will&#xD;
      be recruited in the study among PwMS attending the medium-large sized MS clinical centres,&#xD;
      rehabilitation units or among PwMS in contact with the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Association&#xD;
      (AISM). In the first two cases the subjects will be enrolled consecutively during ambulatory&#xD;
      activities and in the third case the subjects will be randomly selected from the list of&#xD;
      AISM's members. Healthcare workers/research assistants, trained for the purpose, will present&#xD;
      the project to patients during enrolment. Subjects who give their consent to participate will&#xD;
      be contacted by research assistants for a phone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Subjects will complete an anonymous questionnaire combining&#xD;
      socio-demographic, clinical and medicine preventive-related information and three scales&#xD;
      validated in Italian, as described above. Two questionnaire form will be developed to take in&#xD;
      account the sex difference (i.e. specific preventive screening such as mammography or&#xD;
      prostate screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, collected data will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-reported socio-demographic characteristics: age, sex, citizenship (if the&#xD;
           interviewees are not Italian, the investigators will ask when they moved to Italy),&#xD;
           province of birth, province of residence, level of education, marital status, employment&#xD;
           status, income;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-reported clinical characteristics and lifestyle: year of onset and diagnosis of MS,&#xD;
           type of course, presence of comorbidities, BMI, smoking and drinking use;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-reported preventive medicine-related information: main health screening&#xD;
           (mammography and cervical screening -only for women-, colorectal screening, control of&#xD;
           moles, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels, bone density); main vaccines&#xD;
           (dose booster of diphtheria/tetanus or diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis, the flu vaccine,&#xD;
           the immunization status against rubella and chickenpox, the vaccine against HPV (Human&#xD;
           papillomavirus, hepatitis B, meningococcus B, C and ACYW135, measles, pneumococcus and&#xD;
           Herpes Zoster);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  level of disability: Self-Expanded Disability Status Scale (self-EDSS) will be used to&#xD;
           measure subjects' level of disability. It is a descriptive scale derived from the&#xD;
           original EDSS and also from the patient-assessed Patient Determined Disease Steps&#xD;
           (PDDS). A recent evaluation of the feasibility and reliability of self-assessed EDSS has&#xD;
           found it acceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  level of independence in daily activities: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Katz scale&#xD;
           measures the ability of an individual to perform activities required in daily living.&#xD;
           ADL scale consists of following six items: (1) bathing, (2) dressing, (3) transferring,&#xD;
           (4) going to the toilet, (5) continence and (6) feeding. The total Katz ADL score&#xD;
           indicates the degree of dependency. The range of the total score per item level is 1-4,&#xD;
           with higher scores indicating a higher level of dependency: (1) independent, (2)&#xD;
           requires some assistance, (3) requires full assistance and (4) completely dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life: Eq-5D-3L will be used to measure the quality of life. The&#xD;
           EQ(EuroQol)-5D-3L consists of two sections. In the first part, the descriptive system&#xD;
           includes five single item dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities,&#xD;
           pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is measured on a 3-point scale,&#xD;
           and a single weighted score -the utility index- is obtained from these five questions.&#xD;
           This score lies on a scale in which full health has a value of 1 and death has a value&#xD;
           of 0, although negative values are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, specific questions will ask if the MS disease or pandemic impact on access on&#xD;
      preventive medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent Eligible subjects will consent to participate after reading information&#xD;
      about the study and what participation would entail and after providing written informed&#xD;
      consent, by personally signing and dating the document. It will not be possible to proceed&#xD;
      with the compilation of the questionnaire if consent is not provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The participation in the study is anonymous. The investigators must assure&#xD;
      anonymity to enrolled subjects. For this reason, the documents sent to the coordinating&#xD;
      Centre will be associated only with a number code identifying the patient and a letter code&#xD;
      identifying the Center. However, the investigators of each Center must archive the listing of&#xD;
      the identities of patients involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Calculation of the sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation will be based on the prevalence of colorectal screening. A sample&#xD;
      size will be estimated to ensure the recruitment of a sufficiently large number of&#xD;
      participants stratified by geographical areas, to obtain statistically significant data.&#xD;
      Assuming that the prevalence of colorectal screening in MS population is similar to that&#xD;
      observed in a disable population given the chosen of margin error (5%), confidence interval&#xD;
      (95%), assuming a 20% drop-out rate, it will be necessary an approximate population size of&#xD;
      1250 individuals. In particular sample size will consist of 460 persons resident in North,&#xD;
      460 in Centre and 330 in South Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Descriptive statistics including means, frequencies and percentages will be used to&#xD;
      analyze data. Frequencies will be used to describe screenings and/or vaccinations performed.&#xD;
      To evaluate the variables correlated to probability to carry out preventive medicine,&#xD;
      Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests will be used to assess for significance between&#xD;
      categorical variables, whereas continuous ones will be analyzed using independent t-tests and&#xD;
      ANOVA. Independent variables, resulting as significant (p &lt;0.20) in the univariate analyses,&#xD;
      will be included in multivariate models to determine the association between potential&#xD;
      predictors and preventive medicine related outcomes (screening or vaccines). Preventive&#xD;
      medicine related outcome will be dichotomized taking the value of 1 for receipt of the&#xD;
      service and 0 for not having received the service. Separate multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
      models will be built to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for&#xD;
      each preventive health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Phase 2 - Case-Control study (phase 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and sample The study design will be a multicentric matched case-control study (phase&#xD;
      1). The case and control subjects will be 1:1 matched to age, sex and residence area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case subjects will be PwMS enrolled consecutively among the subjects participating in phase 1&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects will be PwoMS volunteers. Control subjects will be enrolled among friends or&#xD;
      neighbours of the cases. According to DL 15.07.1997, art 1.61, the enrolment of controls will&#xD;
      not include vulnerable subjects, whose decision to volunteer in this project may be&#xD;
      improperly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated&#xD;
      with participation, or of possible retaliatory action by hierarchically superior individuals&#xD;
      if they refuse to participate. Examples include members of hierarchically structured groups,&#xD;
      such as medical, pharmacy, dental or nursing school students, subordinate hospital and&#xD;
      laboratory staff, employees of a pharmaceutical industry, members of the armed forces, and&#xD;
      prisoners. Other vulnerable individuals may include: patients with incurable diseases,&#xD;
      persons housed in nursing homes, indigent persons, patients in emergency situations, ethnic&#xD;
      minorities, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, minors, and persons incapable of giving&#xD;
      consent. In addition, according to DL 24.0.2003 n 211, art 1, it is forbidden to offer, give&#xD;
      or request financial incentives or benefits for the participation of the subjects in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Control subjects will complete the same anonymous questionnaire combining&#xD;
      socio-demographic, clinical (i.e. presence of comorbidity), lifestyle and medicine&#xD;
      preventive-related information and some validated scales in Italian (see section Data&#xD;
      collection in Phase 1 of the protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same way as the cases, data regarding control subjects will be collected using a&#xD;
      questionnaire that will completed during a telephone interview conducted by a research&#xD;
      assistant trained ad hoc for the purpose.&#xD;

      Ethical considerations Informed consent Eligible case and control subjects may only be&#xD;
      included in the study after providing written informed consent, by personally signing and&#xD;
      dating the written informed consent document. Informed consent must be obtained before any&#xD;
      data collection. In particular, case patient's willingness to participate upon informed&#xD;
      consent will be subsequently followed by a request for names and contact information of two&#xD;
      friends/neighbours. Control subjects have to be similar in age (within 5 years), sex and city&#xD;
      of residence to the case patient. Case patients will be asked to contact their respective&#xD;
      controls first and then to provide the potential controls' name and contact information once&#xD;
      the potential control will have given their permission in study participation. The&#xD;
      investigators will attempt to recruit and interview each friend/neighbour for whom the&#xD;
      investigators will obtain contact information and written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The participation in the study is anonymous. The investigators must assure&#xD;
      anonymity to enrolled subjects. For this reason, the documents sent to the coordinating&#xD;
      Centre will be associated only with a number code identifying the patient and a letter code&#xD;
      identifying the Center. However, the investigators of each Center must archive the listing of&#xD;
      the identities of patients involved in the study. Controls' questionnaire will have the same&#xD;
      case code followed by the letter C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Calculation of the sample size For the case-control study, the sample&#xD;
      size will be calculated using the method described by Dupont. The sample size will be&#xD;
      calculated with a power of 80% and two-sided confidence level of 95%. The expected compliance&#xD;
      rates for screening of colorectal cancer will be considered as approximately 45% and 33%&#xD;
      respectively in control and case group. The sample size was calculated to detect a minimum OR&#xD;
      of 0.60. For a matched case-control study at a case to control ratio of 1:1, the required&#xD;
      sample size will be 256 pairs of cases and controls. Assuming a 15% drop-out rate, 300 cases&#xD;
      and 300 matched controls will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Descriptive statistics including means, frequencies and percentages will be used to&#xD;
      analyze the data. Success of matching will be tested by comparing data between groups. For&#xD;
      this purpose and to identify differences between groups in medicine preventive-related data,&#xD;
      tests for matched pairs were used. Paired t- or Wilcoxon signed rank sum test (as&#xD;
      appropriate) will be used for continuous data, while McNemar's or the Stuart-Maxwell test (as&#xD;
      appropriate) for categorical data. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models,&#xD;
      controlling for potentially confounding factors, will be used to compare preventive medicine&#xD;
      adherence between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be 2-sided, and p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. Analyses will be performed using Stata software, Version 15 (Stata Corp, College&#xD;
      Station, Texas).&#xD;

        Participants will be recruited in the study among PwMS attending the medium-large sized MS&#xD;
        clinical centres, rehabilitation units or among PwMS in contact with the Italian Multiple&#xD;
        Sclerosis Association (AISM). In the first two cases the subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
        consecutively during ambulatory activities and in the third case the subjects will be&#xD;
        randomly selected from the list of AISM's members. Healthcare workers/research assistants,&#xD;
        trained for the purpose, will present the project to patients during enrolment. Subjects&#xD;
        who give their consent to participate will be contacted by research assistants for a phone&#xD;
        interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control subjects will be PwoMS volunteers.&#xD;
