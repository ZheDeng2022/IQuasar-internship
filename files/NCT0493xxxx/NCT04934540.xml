      The study aims to collect data on ERBT globally in order to clarify its role in the&#xD;
      management of bladder cancer over a 5-year observation period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is a prevalent disease globally, and it is the 9th most commonly diagnosed&#xD;
      cancer in men worldwide. It has a standardized incidence rate of 9.0 per 100,000 person-years&#xD;
      for men and 2.2 per 100,000 person-years for women. This disease represents a significant&#xD;
      burden to the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder cancer is classified into non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and&#xD;
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) according to its depth of invasion. Conceptually, NMIBC&#xD;
      is amenable to complete resection by transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) alone,&#xD;
      while MIBC requires more aggressive treatment in the form of radical cystectomy. The gold&#xD;
      standard in local staging is by histology, and this can be achieved by TURBT. However,&#xD;
      conventional TURBT creates charred tissue chips in a piecemeal manner which may hinder&#xD;
      pathologists' judgment of the tumour base clearance. Second-look TURBT has been shown to&#xD;
      detect residual disease in 33-55% of the patients, and upstaging of disease in 4-45% of the&#xD;
      patients following the first TURBT; it has also been shown to improve recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival in patients with T1 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. In addition, tumour&#xD;
      fragmentation and reimplantation may lead to early disease recurrence. All these highlighted&#xD;
      the limitations of the conventional TURBT procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transurethral en bloc resection of bladder tumour (ERBT) represents a novel surgical&#xD;
      technique in which the bladder tumour is resected in one piece. Theoretically, ERBT may&#xD;
      prevent recurrence by minimizing the risk of tumour reimplantation and ensuring complete&#xD;
      resection based on proper histological assessment. Although ERBT has been practised in many&#xD;
      centres worldwide, there is a lack of high quality evidence in proving its superiority over&#xD;
      conventional TURBT. Also, the optimal indications, best energy modality, the need for routine&#xD;
      tumour base biopsy, intravesical chemotherapy, second-look TURBT and the optimal follow-up&#xD;
      protocol remain uncertain for this technique. Therefore, there is a need for a well-planned&#xD;
      prospective multi-centre study to evaluate the role of ERBT in the management of bladder&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose to conduct a prospective, multi-centre, registry study to expedite&#xD;
      understanding of ERBT and to establish its role in management of bladder cancer.&#xD;
