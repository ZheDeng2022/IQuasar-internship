    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the effects of Ipilimumab when it is given alone or in combination&#xD;
      with Nivolumab to patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-cohort, multi-center, phase II study of ipilimumab with or&#xD;
      without nivolumab for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) classic Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (cHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is a drug which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for the treatment of adult patients experiencing relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have&#xD;
      received at least two prior systemic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma (a type of&#xD;
      skin cancer), and specific types of previously treated advanced kidney cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drugs have not been approved in combination for cHL by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two cohorts based on prior response to PD-1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (mAb) therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 is for participants who are receiving a PD-1 mAb and have achieved either&#xD;
           stable disease or a partial response after approximately 6 months of PD-1 mAb therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 is for participants who previously had progressive disease when receiving a&#xD;
           PD-1 mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in cohort 1 will receive 4 cycles of nivolumab and ipilimumab followed by 15&#xD;
      cycles of nivolumab maintenance therapy (up to ~18 months of total treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in cohort 2 will receive 4 cycles of ipilimumab monotherapy and then undergo&#xD;
      restaging imaging. Patients who achieved an objective response will continue treatment with&#xD;
      ipilimumab maintenance. Other patients will receive 4 cycles of nivolumab and ipilimumab&#xD;
      followed by ipilimumab maintenance treatment. Participants in cohort 2 will receive up to ~&#xD;
      24 months of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of therapy (in either cohort), participants will be followed every 3 months&#xD;
      for 2 years and then every 6 months for the next 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 32 people will participate in this research study, including&#xD;
      approximately 20 people in cohort 1 and 10-15 people in cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) is supporting this research study by providing the study drugs and&#xD;
      funding for the study.&#xD;
