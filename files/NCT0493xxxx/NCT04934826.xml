  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastric bypass can reduce the bioavailability of food proteins. The bioavailability of&#xD;
      hydrolyzed proteins may be higher than intact proteins. Thus, the use of hydrolyzed proteins&#xD;
      could compensate for the decrease in protein bioavailability observed after gastric By-pass&#xD;
      in morbidly obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of a hydrolyzed protein intake may be higher than that of an intact protein&#xD;
      intake to improve the status of a By-pass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis would be that the use of hydrolyzed proteins would compensate for the decrease&#xD;
      in bioavailability of food proteins caused by gastric By-pass.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is beneficial in terms of weight loss, correction of comorbidities and life&#xD;
      expectancy but adverse effects can occur among which various nutritional deficiencies. Thus,&#xD;
      in some cases, more or less marked protein undernutrition may be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome this protein undernutrition, protein supplements can be proposed. However, their&#xD;
      effectiveness has not been satisfactorily assessed in this situation to date. Indeed, the&#xD;
      protein malabsorption potentially induced by the By-pass limits its impact. The value of&#xD;
      protein supplementation must also be considered in terms of overall efficacy, taking into&#xD;
      account a possible decrease in spontaneous intake related to supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the bioavailability studies, milk proteins will be presented in two different forms of&#xD;
      the same origin: intact or hydrolyzed proteins. The proteins of the test meal are marked with&#xD;
      15N nitrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the three months daily supplementation period, the supplements will be intact proteins&#xD;
      not marked with 15N nitrogen, provided to patients in the form of individual sachets. The&#xD;
      purpose of this supplementation is to help the patient achieve the protein recommendations,&#xD;
      which is 60 g/d.&#xD;
