  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare quality of life, adherence, insulin resistance, body&#xD;
      composition and efficacy of long-acting growth hormone (LAGH) to daily growth hormone (DGH)&#xD;
      in children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). These objectives will be evaluated every 6&#xD;
      months for subjects prior to switch from DGH to LAGH, and 6 months after.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant human growth hormone (GH) is the standard of&#xD;
      care therapy for children with GH deficiency (GHD). A potential impediment to long-term&#xD;
      efficacy of daily GH (DGH) is a lack of adherence and persistence. Multiple Long-Acting&#xD;
      Growth Hormone (LAGH) molecules are being developed with the expectation that reduced&#xD;
      frequency of injections will improve the patient and caregiver experience leading to improved&#xD;
      adherence and, ultimately, improve efficacy. However, the connection between reduced&#xD;
      injection frequency, improved adherence and improved efficacy have not yet been demonstrated.&#xD;
      GH has metabolic effects that impact insulin resistance, body composition and lipid levels.&#xD;
      There is concern that persistently elevated levels of GH provided by LAGH may have a negative&#xD;
      effect on metabolism. There is also concern that the larger size of the LAGH molecules in&#xD;
      development may limit their access to the target tissues leading to an imbalance of the&#xD;
      linear growth and metabolic effects. The purpose of the study is to compare quality of life,&#xD;
      adherence, insulin resistance, body composition and efficacy of long-acting growth hormone&#xD;
      (LAGH) to daily growth hormone (DGH) in children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). These&#xD;
      objectives will be evaluated every 6 months for subjects prior to switch from DGH to LAGH,&#xD;
      and 6 months after.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insulin Resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six months for approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting glucose and insulin will be measured using standard laboratory tests in order to calculate homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The equation is as follows, fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l) multiplied by fasting serum insulin (mU/l) divided by 22.5. HOMA-IR is a unitless measure with no defined range. Higher scores indicate lower insulin sensitivity/higher insulin resistance. Insulin resistance will be assessed at baseline, 6 months prior to beginning LAGH treatment, and 6 months following the start of LAGH treatment, or every 6 months for two years for those who do not switch to LAGH. Change in values will be reported, for participants on Daily Growth Hormone who never switch to LAGH, from baseline to values obtained at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months. For participants who switch to LAGH, baseline values pre-LAGH treatment will be compared to those obtained 6 months following the start of LAGH treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Every six months for approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL Questionnaire contains 23 items rated on a 3- or 5-point Likert scale. Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Total score is calculated as the unweighted average of item scores. Higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life.

    <description>The Diabetes Injection Device - Preference Questionnaire (DID-EQ) contains 10 items on a 5-point Likert scale (-2 to 2), with a total range of -20 to 20. Scores on each end of the scale equal a more positive perception of the device. A higher score indicates a stronger preference for LAGH device and a lower (negative) score indicates a preference for daily growth hormone device. Results will be reported descriptively and categorically as the frequency and percentage of patients reporting each response to each item. DID-EQ will be assessed at baseline, 6 months prior to beginning LAGH treatment, and 6 months following the start of LAGH treatment, or every 6 months for two years for those who do not switch to LAGH. Change in values will be reported, for participants on Daily Growth Hormone who never switch to LAGH, from baseline to values obtained at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months.

    <measure>Change in Adherence Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six months for approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An adherence survey will be administered and medication possession ratio (MPR) data will be obtained. Likert scale items will be measured with a range of 26 to 121, with a higher score indicating a greater burden to growth hormone treatment. Non-Likert scale items (2 items with percent report and 2 items with Yes/No responses) will not be added to a total score but will be reported descriptively. Adherence will be assessed at baseline, 6 months prior to beginning LAGH treatment, and 6 months following the start of LAGH treatment, or every 6 months for two years for those who do not switch to LAGH. Change in values will be reported, for participants on Daily Growth Hormone who never switch to LAGH, from baseline to values obtained at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months. For participants who switch to LAGH, baseline values pre-LAGH treatment will be compared to those obtained 6 months following the start of LAGH treatment.</description>
