    <textblock>
      In the early stage, the preliminary study found that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)&#xD;
      intervention aimed at Nourishing kidney and regulating blood circulation in freeze-all IVF&#xD;
      cycles can improve the clinical pregnancy rate. In order to further study the role of TCM in&#xD;
      improving the pregnancy outcome of IVF-ET in infertility. A randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial will be used in this study. 90 infertile patients are randomly divided into two groups.&#xD;
      The control group will be treated with conventional modern medicine, and the treatment group&#xD;
      will be treated with traditional Chinese herbs on the basis of conventional modern medicine.&#xD;
      The intervention starts from the 5th day of the menstrual cycle and lasts until the day&#xD;
      before IVF-ET. After the transplantation, the TCM treatment continues for 14 days. The number&#xD;
      of oocytes, antral follicles, AMH, serum FSH, and clinical pregnancy rate will be observed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of TCM herbs on the improvement of pregnancy outcomes. In addition, all&#xD;
      the participants will be asked to complete the self-evaluation of the anxiety/depression&#xD;
      scale on the 7th day of the menstrual cycle, before and after transplantation, to analyze the&#xD;
      emotional changes of the subjects during the study. The study will also observe the safety&#xD;
      and health economic indicators of TCM treatment, so as to improve the overall efficacy of TCM&#xD;
      Combined Application in assisted reproductive technology in the future.&#xD;

      The trial is designed as a randomized, controlled clinical trial with two groups established&#xD;
      by 1:1 equal allocation, a treatment group with interventions using herbs to tonify the&#xD;
      kidneys and regulate blood and a control group treated using conventional Western medicine.&#xD;
      Random numbers will be prepared by an independent third-party statistician who prepared a&#xD;
      list of random group codes for this study. Enrolled subjects will be given a subject number&#xD;
      during the screening process and, upon formal enrolment, will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the test or control group with a corresponding random number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Treatment method Phase 1: The control group will be treated with conventional&#xD;
      Western medicine, whereas the treatment group will receive treatment with the Chinese herbal&#xD;
      formula. Treatment with the Chinese herbal formula will start on the 5th day of menstruation&#xD;
      cycle. The medicines used will be Er Zhi Wan combined with Si Wu Tang (Radix et Rhizoma&#xD;
      Ligustrum 15 g, Radix Morindae Sinensis 12 g, Fructus Lycii 15 g, Semen Cuscutae 20 g, Radix&#xD;
      Rehmanniae 15 g, Radix Angelicae Sinensis 10 g, Radix Paeoniae Alba 10 g, Ligusticum&#xD;
      wallichii 6 g, Poria cocos 15g,Polygonatum 15g,eclipta 10g); which will be taken for&#xD;
      10-15days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: After ET, the control group will be treated conventionally with no TCM intervention,&#xD;
      and the treatment group will continue to take Chinese herbal medicine, changing to Shou Tai&#xD;
      pills ( Morinda officinalis 15 g, Teasel 15g，Cuscutae 20 g, Eucommia ulmoides 15 g, Rehmannia&#xD;
      15 g, Cornus officinalis 15 g, loranthus parasiticus 20 g, Ligustrum lucidum 15g, Salvia&#xD;
      miltiorrhiza 10g, Scutellaria baicalensis 10g, Atractylodes macrocephala 15g); which will be&#xD;
      taken for 14days. The hospital will be responsible for the decoction of 200 mL per dose, 1&#xD;
      dose per day, divided into 2 doses in the morning and in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) will be measured, and an hCG&gt;30 IU will be&#xD;
      considered to indicate biochemical pregnancy. Ultrasound monitoring will be performed 30 days&#xD;
      after ET to calculate the clinical pregnancy rate.&#xD;
