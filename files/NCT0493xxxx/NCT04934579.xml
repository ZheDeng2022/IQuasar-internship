      It is a single arm, multicenter, phase 2 study to explore the efficacy and safety study of&#xD;
      R2-MTX chemotherapy（Lenalidomide, Rituximab and Methotrexate）as first-line regimens in the&#xD;

      This is a single arm, multicenter, phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of rituximab, methotrexate and lenalidomide as first-line regimens in the treatment of newly&#xD;
      primary central nervous system lymphoma. A total of 40 patients plan to participate in this&#xD;
      study to receive a total 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by 4 cycles of&#xD;
      maintenance chemotherapy. Follow-ups should be taken up to the first 3 years. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoint includes Progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events.&#xD;
