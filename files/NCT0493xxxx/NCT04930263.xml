  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 6-month individualized walking&#xD;
      intervention program on memory and subjective cognitive complaints, and BDNF for&#xD;
      postmenopausal hypertensive women. Participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental&#xD;
      group and the control group. The intervention group will last for 24 weeks. The measurements&#xD;
      include, global cognitive function, memory function, subjective cognitive complaints, and&#xD;
      BDNF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore an individualized walking program on memory function,&#xD;
      subjective cognitive complaints, and BDNF, and cognitive and exercise experiences for&#xD;
      postmenopausal hypertensive women using mix methods. This study will include a qualitative&#xD;
      study with in depth interview of the subjects who attend the pilot study in our research&#xD;
      team. Their experience about cognitive decline and exercise will be explored and be used to&#xD;
      modify intervention program. The qualitative results will be analyzed using content analysis.&#xD;
      In quantitative study with experimental design, qualified subjects will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to experimental or control group. Experimental subjects will perform six-month walking&#xD;
      exercise program and control group receive routine care. The measures include assessment of&#xD;
      memory function, serum BDNF, and questionnaires. Data will be collected at baseline, the end&#xD;
      of the six-month intervention. Data will be analyzed using Generalized Estimation Equation&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the intervention program. The method will strengthen the effectiveness&#xD;
      of six-month walking exercise program and may provide comprehensive understanding if the&#xD;
      trajectory of behavior changes among postmenopausal women with hypertension.&#xD;

    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test will be administered to measure verbal learning and memory. The score is a sum of correct responses in each of three learning trial (encoding) (possible score 0 to 36 for summed recall of trials) and a delayed recall trial (possible score 0 to 12). Higher scores mean a better memory.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Failures Questionnaire will be used to assess subjective cognitive impairment. Each item is rated from 0 to 4 with the total score calculated as the sum of all items ranging from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating higher levels of cognitive failures.</description>

    <description>Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale is used to measure depressive symptoms. The maximum score is 60, and higher scores are associated with depression. The scores of 16 or higher have generally been thought to indicate clinically relevant depressive symptoms.</description>
