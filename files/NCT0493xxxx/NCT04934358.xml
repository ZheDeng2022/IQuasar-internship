  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a fragility fracture are twice as likely to have future fractures compared to&#xD;
      their non-fractured peers. Furthermore, the 30% who suffer a fragility fracture do not regain&#xD;
      the level of functioning in terms of activities of daily living after one year. A recent&#xD;
      ecological study, in several European countries, estimates that if fracture patients were&#xD;
      enrolled in fracture follow-up services, at least 19,000 fractures could be prevented each&#xD;
      year. Clinical trials carried out in the research group have shown that the prescription of&#xD;
      physical exercise in severe underlying pathologies is effective in improving physical&#xD;
      function, quality of life and long-term results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The implementation of a motivational intervention and physical exercise program,&#xD;
      in a staggered manner, taking into account the basic exercise capacity, improves the&#xD;
      functional status of the patient (basic activities of daily life), adherence to interventions&#xD;
      and the level of physical activity, and therefore reduces the number of hospital admissions,&#xD;
      refractures and other associated complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the effect of a rehabilitation intervention based on physical exercise&#xD;
      and motivation, applied in a staggered manner and according to the functional capacity of&#xD;
      patients with fragility fracture.&#xD;

      Method: Single-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study, with 2 parallel arms and&#xD;
      single-center. Study subjects: Patients who underwent surgery for a fragility hip fracture&#xD;
      between September 2021 and September 2022 in a tertiary hospital in southern Spain. A&#xD;
      progressive physical exercise and motivational intervention adjusted for functional capacity&#xD;
      will be compared versus usual rehabilitation care. Follow-up of patients for 3 months and a&#xD;
      final visit at 6 months. The primary outcome variables will be functional status for the&#xD;
      development of activities of daily living (individual ability to care for himself) and number&#xD;
      of hospital readmissions (reasons and consequences). Variables related to quality of life,&#xD;
      cognitive status, laboratory markers and densitometry will also be analyzed.&#xD;
