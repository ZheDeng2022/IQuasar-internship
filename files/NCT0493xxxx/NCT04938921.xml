  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the percentage of pulmonary venous stenosis after&#xD;
      TAPVC repair with sutureless closure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents of patients with TAPVC after repairing by sutureless technique will be informed about&#xD;
      the study. If parents agree to participant in the study and sign the informed consent, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect information of patients and echocardiography results at 1 month, 6&#xD;
      month, 12 month and 18 month after the operation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The investigators assess the PVS at the time of 12 month after the operation.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators calculate pulmonary venous score (PVS) based on the mean gradient through each pulmonary vein. Then we sum all the score of each pulmonary vein, range from 0 to 12, and classify to 4 levels. Score 0 if the mean gradient is less than 2mmHg, 1 if it is from 2 to 6,9mmHg, 2 if it is from 7 mmHg and above, and 3 if the vein is occluded. The degree of obstruction is classified as follow: none (0 to 1), mild (2 to 3), moderate (4 to 7), and severe (from 8 and above).</description>
