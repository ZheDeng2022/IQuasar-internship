  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/IIa study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      IAH0968 in patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors who have failed standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase Ia/Ib study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety, PK,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and preliminary anti-tumor activity of IAH0968 in Chinese subjects. Phase Ia&#xD;
      is a dose escalation, and it is planned to recruit about 10-19 subjects with HER2-positive&#xD;
      advanced malignancies who have failed standard treatment. Phase Ib is a dose expansion, and&#xD;
      it is planned to recruit approximately 18 subjects with HER2-positive advanced malignancies&#xD;
      who have failed standard treatment. Phase IIa mainly investigates the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of IAH0968 in HER2-positive subjects with advanced biliary system tumors.&#xD;
