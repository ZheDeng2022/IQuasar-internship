    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the effectiveness of Curodont Repair&#xD;
      Fluoride Plus (CRFP) compared to other tooth-specific treatments (silver diamine fluoride&#xD;
      (SDF), sealants, or other FDA-approved treatments) in preventing progression to cavitation in&#xD;
      patients with at least one early non-cavitated dental caries lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate the effectiveness of CRFP in comparison to no tooth-specific&#xD;
      treatment control groups, including whole mouth treatments such as: 2.26% fluoride varnish,&#xD;
      1.23% fluoride foam, and 5000 ppm fluoride prescription toothpaste; and no treatment, on&#xD;
      caries arrest and in preventing progression to cavitation in patients with at least one early&#xD;
      non-cavitated dental lesion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be enrolled upon diagnosis of at least one ADA Caries Classification&#xD;
      system &quot;initial&quot; caries lesion. Subjects will be further sorted into study cohorts based on&#xD;
      the non-invasive treatment option they select. The early lesions will be followed for 24&#xD;
      months after the date of the initial caries lesion diagnosis or the date of the first&#xD;
      non-invasive treatment applied to the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who choose CRFP will serve as the primary variable of interest. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the effectiveness of CRFP compared to other tooth specific treatments&#xD;
      (SDF, sealants, or other FDA-approved treatments) in preventing progression to cavitation in&#xD;
      initial dental lesions. The primary endpoint will be measured by the percentage of patients&#xD;
      that require operative treatment for at least one early lesion noted at baseline during the&#xD;
      following 24 months of observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess the effectiveness of CRFP compared to no&#xD;
      tooth-specific treatment (including whole mouth treatments such as: fluoride varnish,&#xD;
      fluoride foam, prescription toothpaste; other FDA-approved treatments; and no treatment) on&#xD;
      1.) caries arrest and 2.) preventing progression to cavitation in patients with at least one&#xD;
      early dental lesion. The secondary endpoints will be measured by 1.) the percentage of&#xD;
      patients that have caries arrest for at least one early lesion noted at baseline during the&#xD;
      following 24 months of observation and 2.) the percentage of patients that require operative&#xD;
      treatment for at least one early lesion noted at baseline during the following 24 months of&#xD;
      observation.&#xD;

    <description>The effectiveness of Curodont treatment in this group will be compared to other treatment options and cohorts. Curodont will be professionally applied in the dental clinic. The treatment time takes about 5 minutes. Patients receive one professional dose application and be provided with homecare instructions and will be instructed to return for regular dental visits and exams according to the frequency determined by their dental team, usually every 6 months.</description>

    <description>If a patient or their caregivers choose no tooth-specific treatment, they will be included in the control cohort. This group includes patients who chose to receive no treatment at all, as well as those who choose whole mouth treatments such as: 2.26% fluoride varnish, 1.23% fluoride foam, and 5000 ppm fluoride prescription toothpaste.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Orthodontic cohort</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients in active orthodontic care will be analyzed separately from other patients to account for the impact of orthodontic appliances on treatment outcomes. Orthodontic appliances are recognized by the American Dental Association Caries Risk Assessment as a risk factor for caries because they create dental plaque stagnation areas that are difficult to clean. Initial caries lesions are very frequently seen immediately surrounding orthodontic brackets (braces), yet continued plaque stagnation over the treated areas may heavily influence the success of any treatment. All groups/cohorts above will be represented in the orthodontic cohort in parallel.</description>
