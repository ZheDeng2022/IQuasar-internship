  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current balance and stability interventions have been shown to improve balance through&#xD;
      targeting balance impairments and retraining effects. However, there are key facilitators and&#xD;
      barriers 'that older adults may face to participate in such interventions'. Additionally,&#xD;
      physical activity interventions fail to integrate older adults into the co-design and&#xD;
      co-production of PA interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to identify the impact and practicalities of an exercise intervention in&#xD;
      older adults by performing pre selected exercises with an elastic resistance band attached at&#xD;
      the hip and chest region to challenge balance. Researcher led interviews will focus on the&#xD;
      participants perceptions of the activities and decision making of exercise selection by&#xD;
      selecting components that they are confident to perform which is a key element to creating a&#xD;
      practical and enjoyable exercise programme for the older population. This will co-create an&#xD;
      intervention that is accessible, acceptable, and appropriate for older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will establish the accessibility, acceptability and appropriateness of an elastic&#xD;
      band exercise intervention with older adults by performing selected activities followed by&#xD;
      researcher led interviews that will focus on the participants influences, perceptions and&#xD;
      psycho-social factors related the intervention activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outline of study design The following study will be designed as a single exposure,&#xD;
      qualitative (one-to-one interviews using a semi-structured interview guide) and quantitative&#xD;
      (heart rate and rate of perceived exertion ratings) study. A convenience sample of&#xD;
      adults/older adults will be recruited through PA networks in the Derbyshire community.&#xD;
      Participants will take part in one experimental session: performing exercises with an elastic&#xD;
      resistance band placed at the hip and chest region. The session order of band placement will&#xD;
      be randomized for each participant to counter-balance the outcome which emerge from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant preparation Following a detailed briefing using a pre-prepared participant&#xD;
      information sheet, a signed informed consent form and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living&#xD;
      form, participants will be required to complete 2 supervised visits to the laboratory at the&#xD;
      University of Derby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a general health screening questionnaire. Specific instructions&#xD;
      will be provided for participants to abstain from alcohol and caffeine for a minimum of 12/24&#xD;
      hours respectively and avoidance of strenuous exercise for at least 72 hours prior to&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline of study methods Participants will be required to attend the University Laboratory&#xD;
      (Kblock) to take part in the study. Due to COVID-19 participants will be required to adhere&#xD;
      to the latest government guidance and guidance from the University to consider this&#xD;
      assessment to be safe (Risk assessments in place).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini Balance Evaluation (MINI BESTest)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Falls Efficacy Scale (Short FES-I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a briefing, participants will be required to perform a 10 minute supervised warm up&#xD;
      and mobility session prior to exercise. Participants will be required to perform a selection&#xD;
      of 8 pre-selected exercises whilst wearing the elastic band around the hip or chest region&#xD;
      (randomized) with a 20 minute rest in between each condition). Participants will perform the&#xD;
      exercises with the lowest resistance of 2-15lb aimed at low/moderate intensity. Heart rate&#xD;
      (HR) on a heart rate strap and watch, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) (Borg scale) will be&#xD;
      measured to assess exercise intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sessions will be closely supervised by the lead researcher -a qualified postural&#xD;
      stability instructor, (level 4 reps Postural Stability Instructor trained by Later Life&#xD;
      Training), that will provide prompts on form of the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastic band placement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip region:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be required to perform the series of exercises whilst attached to an&#xD;
      elastic resistance band. The elastic band will be attached from ground level which will be&#xD;
      attached to the participant over the hip region with padding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest region Each participant will be required to perform a series of exercises whilst&#xD;
      attached to an elastic resistance band. The elastic band will be attached from ground level&#xD;
      and to the participant over the chest region (under arms) , using Velcro on a chest&#xD;
      harness/training vest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the single-session exercise intervention, participants will be required&#xD;
      to attend a one-on-one, face to face semi-structured interview with the researcher to&#xD;
      identify the impact and practicalities of the exercise intervention. The information will be&#xD;
      used in the development of an evaluation process with key consideration of the planning phase&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>A one-on-one, face to face semi-structured interview with the researcher to identify the impact and practicalities of the exercise intervention. The information will be used in the development of an evaluation process with key consideration of the planning phase of the intervention. A semi-structured interview schedule developed by the lead researcher will investigate the acceptability, accessibility, appropriateness and usability of the protocol. Participants will be asked a series of open and closed questions and likert scales to provide perceptions of the exercise selection such as likes/dislikes, safety, confidence, difficulty, enjoyment and band placement. This will help to build insights into the participant preferences which is an important element of the intervention design.</description>

    <measure>Mini Balance Evaluation Test (MINI-BESTest)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completeion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment will require participants to perform a series of physical performance tasks. Following each task, the researcher will record the scores to sum a total score for the MINI BESTest. Scoring: The test has a maximum score of 28 points from 14 items that are each scored from 0-2. &quot;0&quot; = lowest level of function and &quot;2&quot; = highest level of function.&#xD;
If a subject must use an assistive device for an item, score that item one category lower.&#xD;
If a subject requires physical assistance to perform an item, score &quot;0&quot; for that item.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Falls efficacy scale</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire will require the participant to answer 7 questions on their own perceptions on concerns of falling during a series of activities. The scale for each questions is measured from a value of 1-4. 1 = not concerned at all about falling and a 4 =very concerned about falling for each item. A higher score on the FES-l will represent a greater concern for falls from a participant (lowest score 7 and highest score 28).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living form (IADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To identify how a person is functioning at the present time to determine any differences in participation recruitment. The IADL has 8 categories which the participant is required to select one out of four options that have a score assigned to their level of functioning (either 1 or 0). Scoring Interpretation: In some activities and categories, only the highest level of function receives a 1; in others, two or more levels have scores of 1 because each describes competence that represents some minimal level of function.&#xD;
These screens are useful for indicating specifically how a person is performing at the present time. Therefore a higher score on the IADL would represent a higher functioning level. Highest score= 8 (high functioning), lowest score =0 (low functioning).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be male and females over 50 years old. Although ageing is an&#xD;
             individual and qualitative perspective rather than solely a chronological perspective,&#xD;
             adults are transitioning to older adulthood in their 5th decade of life. Older adults&#xD;
             may benefit from preparing at an earlier stage of ageing from the age of 50 years&#xD;
             compared to beginning at the age of 65 years where falls are a high risk factor. PA&#xD;
             guidelines recommend that adults will benefit from preparing physical attributes such&#xD;
             as strength and balance at an earlier stage of the ageing process, therefore, this age&#xD;
             group of 50 years and over has been selected as the most appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderately Physically active (this will be determined by the International Physical&#xD;

             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to walk without a walking aid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide consent. This will be determined by using the Mini-Mental State&#xD;
             Examination (MMSE) a score of under 23. The MMSE will assess cognitive function using&#xD;
             scoring to ensure that participants are not cognitively impaired&#xD;
