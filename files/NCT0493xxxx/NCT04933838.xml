  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of atelocollagen in&#xD;
      the management of chronic low back pain with sarcopenia due to degenerative changes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic low back pain are enrolled and divided into group A (atelocollagen) and&#xD;
      group B (control) through randomization after obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators record tender points for the multifidus, erector spinae, and quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      muscles by physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators evaluate each muscle using ultrasound according to the assignment of each&#xD;
      group, and apply atelocollagen mixture (atelocollagen 3 mL + 1% lidocaine 3 mL) or local&#xD;
      anesthetics only (normal saline 3 mL + 1% lidocaine 3 mL) to each muscle on both sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject of the study performs a total of 3 injections at intervals of 2 weeks, and each&#xD;
      measurement variable is collected by visiting 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the last injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changing medications or additive interventions are not allowed before 4 weeks after last&#xD;
      injection. Only acetaminophen is allowed as a rescue drug.&#xD;

Patients with chronic low back pain are randomized after obtaining informed consent for the study.&#xD;
Participants are divided into group A (atelocollagen) and group B (control). A physical examination for lumbar pain was performed and evaluated trigger points in multifidus, erector spinae, and quadratus lumborum muscles.&#xD;
After physical exam, cross sectional area of each muscle is measured by ultrasound in both gorup.&#xD;
Group A will receive atelocollagen mixture (atelocollagen 3 mL + 1% lidocaine 3 mL) and group B will receive local anesthetics only (Normal saline 3 mL + 1% lidocaine 3 mL).&#xD;
Each participants will be injected 1 mL of injectate into each muscle on both sides (total 6 mL).</description>
