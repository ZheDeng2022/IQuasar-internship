  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-alanine supplementation is highly efficient in increasing intramuscular carnosine content,&#xD;
      leading to improved physical performance, especially in high-intensity exercises (HIIE). It&#xD;
      seems that exercise per se can modulate carnosine content; however, it remains uncertain&#xD;
      whether physical training or training status can influence B-alanine supplementation&#xD;
      responses. Thus, this work aims to assess whether HIIE can increase B-alanine uptake by&#xD;
      peripheral tissues and, more specifically, skeletal muscle and increase intramuscular&#xD;
      carnosine synthesis. The volunteers will be evaluated in two conditions: intake of B-alanine&#xD;
      + exercise (B-EX) and B-alanine intake only (B-Ala). This process will be divided into two&#xD;
      blocks of six days (Thursday to Thursday - without the weekend) with a 4-6 weeks washout. In&#xD;
      the B-EX block, a 20-minute HIIE session will be held. In the B-Ala block, the same&#xD;
      procedures will be adopted for the B-EX block, with the replacement of the HIIE for 20&#xD;
      minutes of rest sitting on the cycle ergometer. We will evaluate the determination of muscle&#xD;
      B-alanine, plasma, and urine, the gene expression of carnosine-related enzymes and&#xD;
      transporters, the enzymes Carnosine Synthase 1 (CARNS1), carnosine dipeptidase 2 (CN2),&#xD;
      taurine transporter (TauT), PAT1, and phosphorylated Na + / K + / ATPase. The hypotheses are:&#xD;
      1) acute physical exercise increases the uptake of B-alanine by the skeletal muscle; 2) this&#xD;
      effect is mediated by the increased activity of the Na + / K + / ATPase pump; 3) this effect,&#xD;
      when repeated over five training sessions, results in observable increases in β-alanine →&#xD;
      carnosine conversion in skeletal muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B-alanine is a non-essential, non-proteinogenic amino acid found in deficient skeletal muscle&#xD;
      concentrations. This deficiency makes B-alanine a rate-limiting factor for carnosine&#xD;
      synthesis. B-alanine supplementation is highly efficient in increasing intramuscular&#xD;
      carnosine content, leading to improved physical performance, especially in high-intensity&#xD;
      exercises (HIIE). It seems that exercise per se can modulate carnosine content; however, it&#xD;
      remains uncertain whether physical training or training status can influence B-alanine&#xD;
      supplementation responses. Thus, this work aims to assess whether HIIE can increase B-alanine&#xD;
      uptake by peripheral tissues and, more specifically, skeletal muscle and increase&#xD;
      intramuscular carnosine synthesis. A crossover counterbalanced study will be conducted. The&#xD;
      volunteers will be evaluated in two conditions: intake of B-alanine + exercise (B-EX) and&#xD;
      B-alanine intake only (B-Ala). The dosage will be 20 mg · kg-1 (powder diluted in water).&#xD;
      This process will be divided into two blocks of six days (Thursday to Thursday - without the&#xD;
      weekend) with a 4-6 weeks washout. In the B-EX block, a 20-minute HIIE session will be held.&#xD;
      Next, B-alanine supplementation will be administered. Immediately after exercise, in a&#xD;
      150-minute rest, collections of venous blood samples will be performed, and the muscle biopsy&#xD;
      and urine collection will be collected pre-test and post-test. In the next three days&#xD;
      (Thursday to Wednesday), this same protocol will be repeated without blood, muscle, or urine&#xD;
      collections. On these days, the B-alanine supplementation will be administrated before and&#xD;
      after the protocol (B-EX and B-Ala), in the same dosage of 20mg.kg-1. On the 6th day&#xD;
      (Thursday), the complete protocol will be carried out, including the collection of biological&#xD;
      materials. In the B-Ala block, the same procedures will be adopted for the B-EX block, with&#xD;
      the replacement of the HIIE for 20 minutes of rest sitting on the cycle ergometer. The&#xD;
      nutritional parameters will be evaluated during the two blocks by dietary diaries in software&#xD;
      (Dietbox) that includes images and the description of all the volunteer food in the day. It&#xD;
      will be determined that during the blocks (B-EX and B-ala), the Beta-alanine intake by food&#xD;
      is limited to 300mg per day. The analysis of the determination of muscle B-alanine, plasma,&#xD;
      and urine, muscle carnosine will be performed by HPLC-ESI + -MS / MS. The gene expression of&#xD;
      carnosine-related enzymes and transporters will be analyzed using the real-time PCR&#xD;
      technique. The enzymes CARNS1, CN2, TauT, PAT1, and phosphorylated Na + / K + / ATPase will&#xD;
      be analyzed using the Western Blot technique. Carnosine synthase activity will be carried out&#xD;
      by incorporating [3H] B-alanine acid in the corresponding dipeptide. The analysis of&#xD;
      paresthesia's presence and intensity will be through a scale adapted from LINGJÆRDE et al.,&#xD;
      1987. The statistical analysis will be performed in the RStudio software and SAS software,&#xD;
      using the mixed model to compare muscle, plasma, and urinary variables. Condition (B-Ex vs.&#xD;
      B-ala) and time of collection (time) will be fixed factors, while the subjects will be random&#xD;
      factors. Data sets containing values obtained at only 2 points in time (e.g., area below the&#xD;
      plasma B-alanine curve) will be analyzed using Student's t-test for dependent samples if the&#xD;
      data distribution is normal. If the data distribution is not normal, we will use the Wilcoxon&#xD;
      sign test for pairs. The normality of data distribution will be assessed qualitatively using&#xD;
      Q-Q Plot. Four different covariance matrix structures will be tested for each data set. The&#xD;
      Schwarz-Bayesian criterion (lowest BIC value) will be used to select the matrix that best&#xD;
      fits each data set. Hypothesis-guided contrast analysis of a single degree of freedom will&#xD;
      test specific effects within and between conditions. The size of the Cohen effect (D) will be&#xD;
      calculated for all variables. Significance will be accepted if p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
