  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators will use a novel approach to measure what people&#xD;
      eat. The goal is to find out whether stable isotopes that can be measured in blood, hair, and&#xD;
      fingernails are better at measuring what people eat than the surveys that are currently used.&#xD;
      To meet the goal, the investigators will do three things. First, the investigators will feed&#xD;
      study participants known amounts of foods and nutrients. Second, after study participants&#xD;
      have eaten the food, the investigators will measure stable isotopes in samples of study&#xD;
      participants' blood, hair, and fingernails. Third, the investigators will determine how well&#xD;
      these samples reflect what was eaten. The investigators will also give surveys to study&#xD;
      participants to determine how well the surveys reflect what was eaten. This will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to do a relative comparison of the measurements from isotopes and surveys.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled feeding study in which the relative validity of stable carbon and&#xD;
      nitrogen isotope ratio analysis as a biomarker of dietary intake is compared to controlled&#xD;
      feedings and multiple 24-hour recalls. Participants will be randomly assigned to a sequence&#xD;
      of diets to be fed on four occasions. Participants will undergo 24 hours of controlled&#xD;
      feeding on four non-consecutive days over a month-long period. On the day after feeding,&#xD;
      participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls, and provide blood, hair, and fingernail&#xD;
      samples for isotope ratio analyses. The investigators will use a crossover design and the&#xD;
      diets will be either high or low in C4 plants (i.e., corn and cane products). A 24-hour urine&#xD;
      collection will be done at home during each 24-hour feeding period. Participants will have&#xD;
      height and weight measured at the screening visit. Weight will also be measured at each study&#xD;
      visit. Additionally, data will be collected via questionnaires administered at each study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
