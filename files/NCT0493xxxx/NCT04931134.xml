  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives: The primary objective is to ascertain if trigeminal nerve stimulation is&#xD;
      an effective treatment with high tolerability for patients with panic disorder, generalized&#xD;
      anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: The secondary objective is to find out if heart rate variability can&#xD;
      predict response to treatment with trigeminal nerve stimulation.&#xD;

    <description>Active or sham TNS treatment will be performed at the patients' home for approximately 8 hours per night 7 days a week for 8 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
Trigeminal nerve stimulation will occur by placement of electrodes (1.25&quot; silver electrodes Bio-Flex BF4, Biotens/Vermed, Buffalo, NY, USA) bilaterally on the V1 branches of the trigeminal nerve (CNV) located on the forehead. Current will be generated from the EMS 7500 stimulator (TENS Products, Inc., Granby, CO) (Class II medical device) and will be set to a level that is clearly perceptible by each patient (i.e. tingling sensation) but not uncomfortable or painful. Current level will be determined for each patient at baseline and will likely be between 4-6 mA. Active stimulation will occur at 120 Hz with a 250 Âµs pulse width and with a duty cycle of 30 seconds on to 30 seconds off.</description>

Sham stimulation will use the same parameters of active stimulation, but after 60 seconds the stimulator will turn off.</description>
