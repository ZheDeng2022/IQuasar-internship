      intravenously in cycles of 3 weekly doses with 1 week rest (1 cycle = 4 weeks) in adult&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors. The second part of the study will further evaluate the&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of&#xD;
      CPO-100 administered intravenously in cycles of 3 weekly doses with 1 week rest (1 cycle = 4&#xD;
      weeks) in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two parts. Part A is a dose-escalation phase with a modified &quot;3+3&quot; design in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or unresectable advanced solid tumors to determine the recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule, and to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK as a single&#xD;
      agent. Two patients will be enrolled at each of the first 2 dose levels and observed for&#xD;
      safety during the first cycle. If there are no ≥Grade 2 treatment emergent adverse events&#xD;
      (TEAE) that may be attributed to the study drug during Cycle 1 for any of the patients in the&#xD;
      first two dose levels, the 3rd dose level and beyond will follow the traditional 3+3 design.&#xD;
      Dose escalation during the &quot;3+3&quot; period for each subsequent cohort of patients will be guided&#xD;
      by the incidence of CPO-100-related adverse events (AE) as graded by National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) CTCAE v5.0 in the&#xD;
      first 4 weeks of dosing [the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) evaluation period].&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of weekly dosing schedule has been established, a&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose will be selected based on evaluation of the PK, and safety and&#xD;
      tolerability profile by the Safety Review Committee (SRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B expansion phase will further evaluate the safety and tolerability as well as the&#xD;
      preliminary antitumor activity at the selected RP2D. Four cohorts of patients are included in&#xD;
      Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: patients with taxane naïve advanced solid tumors of gastric, head and neck,&#xD;
           lung, and ovarian&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: patients with taxane naïve advanced breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: patients with taxane naïve advanced prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: patients with either ovarian or/and breast cancer who have failed prior taxane&#xD;
           treatment (ie, either progressed on a taxane regimen or within 6 months of receiving a&#xD;
           taxane regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The taxane naïve patient population is defined as patients who have not received taxane or&#xD;
      taxane based therapies for their metastatic diseases or patients who had suboptimal taxane&#xD;
      exposure defined as having received less than 2 cycles of taxane or taxane based therapies&#xD;
      due to intolerability for their metastatic diseases. Patients who have received taxane or&#xD;
      taxane based therapies for their neoadjuvant treatment or patients who have received taxane&#xD;
      or taxane based therapies for their adjuvant treatment without disease progression during&#xD;
      treatment are also considered taxane naïve, as long as they have not received taxane or&#xD;
      taxane based therapies to treat the metastatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that up to 42 patients can be enrolled in Part A. The exact number of&#xD;
      patients will depend on the number of dose levels tested. A total of 60 patients, 15 patients&#xD;
      in each cohort will be enrolled in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is estimated to be approximately 4 years. Patients may&#xD;
      continue receiving CPO-100 until criteria for withdrawal are met. Patients deriving clinical&#xD;
      benefit may continue to receive study medication for as long as they are benefiting from&#xD;
      treatment. In the event the study closes or terminates while patients are still benefiting&#xD;
      from and receiving CPO-100, every effort will be made to continue drug supply.&#xD;

             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Serious active infection at the time of treatment, or another serious underlying&#xD;
             medical condition that that in the judgment of the investigator would impair the&#xD;
             ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of seropositive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at any time&#xD;
             before the start of treatment as determined by presence of anti-HIV-1 or anti-HIV-2&#xD;
             antibodies. Testing for seropositive status during Screening will be at the discretion&#xD;
             of the investigator in patients without previously reported results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Active hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients will be tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#xD;
                  at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with hepatitis B (HepBsAg+) who have controlled infection (serum&#xD;
                  hepatitis B virus DNA level is below the limit of detection by PCR) may be&#xD;
                  enrolled into the study. Subjects with controlled infections must undergo&#xD;
                  periodic monitoring of HBV DNA per treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with hepatitis C (HCV Ab+) who have controlled infection (undetectable&#xD;
                  HCV RNA by PCR either spontaneously or in response to a successful prior course&#xD;
                  of anti-HCV therapy) may be enrolled into the study. Patients with controlled&#xD;
                  infections must undergo periodic monitoring of HCV RNA per treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Presence of other active cancers, or history of treatment for invasive cancer ≤3&#xD;
             years. Patients with Stage I cancer who have received definitive local treatment and&#xD;
             are considered unlikely to recur are eligible. All patients with previously treated in&#xD;
             situ carcinoma (ie, non-invasive) are eligible, as are patients with history of&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Routine use of corticosteroids or erythrocyte-stimulating factors as well as&#xD;
             prophylactic use of colony-stimulating factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Use of any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer drug ≤28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             shorter) prior to the first dose of CPO-100. For CYP3A4 drugs for which 5 half-lives&#xD;
             is ≤28 days, a minimum of 14 days between discontinuation of the drug and&#xD;
             administration of CPO-100 is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Use of herbal preparations/medications including, but are not limited to: St. John's&#xD;
             wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe,&#xD;
             saw palmetto, and ginseng. A minimum of 14 days between discontinuation of the herbal&#xD;
             preparation/medications and administration of CPO-100 is required.&#xD;
