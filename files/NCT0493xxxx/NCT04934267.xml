  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) and its effect&#xD;
      on delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and recovery time. The hypothesis is that people with&#xD;
      JHS will experience increased DOMS when compared to non-hypermobile people. The results this&#xD;
      study may assist and add to the body of knowledge when treating and exercising patients with&#xD;
      JHS, as considerations can possibly be made when treating this population. Subjects with JHS&#xD;
      may experience greater DOMS and require more time to recover between treatment sessions.&#xD;

      The research design will be a 2x5 factorial design. There will be two groups, an experimental&#xD;
      group with hypermobile individuals, and a control group with individuals that are not&#xD;
      hypermobile with normal ranges of motion. All participants will take part in an exercise&#xD;
      session with eccentric bicep curls based on their 1 repetition maximum (1-RM), which is the&#xD;
      highest amount of weight that they can lift concentrically once. The independent variables&#xD;
      are the two groups and the dependent variables are girth, resting arm angle (RANG), Pain 1-10&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), McGill Pain Questionnaire, and pressure pain threshold using an&#xD;
      algometer. The proposed study will include 20 participants between the ages of 18-35 years&#xD;
      old, who exercise recreationally. Both groups will perform 1 set of standing eccentric bicep&#xD;
      curls based on their 1RM to failure in order to induce DOMS.7 Each rep will include a timed 5&#xD;
      second long eccentric component with a metronome and without an concentric component, as the&#xD;
      research conductors will lift the weight up or concentrically for the participant. The&#xD;
      exercise will stop when the participant cannot volitionally keep up with the 5 second count&#xD;
      lowering the weight. Prior to exercise, baseline measurements will be taken for all dependent&#xD;
      variables. These measures will be taken every day at the same time of day,for the next 4&#xD;
      days. Girth is the measurement of the circumference of a limb measuring swelling, which&#xD;
      commonly occurs during DOMS.7 Resting Arm Angle (RANG) is a range of motion (ROM) measurement&#xD;
      of the arm while resting.The VAS is a simple pain scale ranging from 0-10, 0 being no pain&#xD;
      and 10 being the worst pain the participant has felt..The McGill Pain Questionnaire is a&#xD;
      questionnaire that allows the participant to rate their pain'.7 Lastly, the pressure pain&#xD;
      threshold using an algometer is done by applying continuous ascending pressure at a constant&#xD;
      rate in order to quantify the individuals pain pressure threshold.The change in measurements&#xD;
      from baseline to post exercise will be recorded for subsequent data analysis.&#xD;
