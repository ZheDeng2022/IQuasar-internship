  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research project provides a novel approach to screening, early assessment, and&#xD;
      preventive interventions for high-risk youth in racial/ethnic/linguistically (REL)-diverse&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators assess a health promotion intervention as a way of reducing treatment&#xD;
           disparities in REL-minority youth. This population is underrepresented in child&#xD;
           psychiatry research. It is often excluded from clinical trials of medication or therapy&#xD;
           because of challenges with transportation, literacy, resources or other issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will take place during or following a health care crisis and economic&#xD;
           recession, making findings relevant to understanding the mechanisms by which hardship&#xD;
           translates into youth mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The innovative integration of online screening into school-based clinics in REL-minority&#xD;
           communities is made possible by the combination of access to a new technology (CAT) in&#xD;
           the context of a learning health community serving an REL-minority population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Empirical research on the impact of a resilience-based prevention intervention in youth&#xD;
           and youth at risk is both innovative and much needed during this period of health,&#xD;
           social and economic crisis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four hundred students will be screened for psychiatric symptoms and functional impairment&#xD;
      using the Kiddie Computerized Adaptive Testing (K-CAT) and the Weiss Functional Impairment&#xD;
      Rating Scale - Self Report (WFIRS-S) at the school-based teen health centers in Cambridge,&#xD;
      Everett, and Somerville. Students will be classified into three tiers: normal, at risk, and&#xD;
      clinical . The cut off scores that differentiate the tiers are drawn from the ROC values&#xD;
      generated by the psychometrics of the measures themselves as follows: Normal: K-CAT normal&#xD;
      and WFIRS-S &lt; .8 (T&lt;1SD); At risk: K-CAT mild and WFIRS-S .8 - 1.0 (T between 1 and 1.5 SD);&#xD;
      Clinical: K-CAT moderate or severe and WFIRS-S &gt; 1.0 (T&gt;1.5 SD). If patients are symptomatic&#xD;
      but not functionally impaired, status is determined by function because symptoms without&#xD;
      impairment do not necessarily warrant intervention. If the patient is impaired but not&#xD;
      symptomatic, the threshold is determined by symptoms because the patient may be impaired from&#xD;
      factors other than the diagnosis. These scores are based on the results of the most severe&#xD;
      module of either the K-CAT or the WFIRS. Tier 1 will receive usual school services as needed.&#xD;
      Tier 2 students will be given the option to participate in the resilience-building&#xD;
      COPE2THRIVE (C2T) intervention. Tier 3 will be informed that they have informed us of&#xD;
      symptoms with impairment that might benefit from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stepped wedge design with 9 clusters of 12-Tier 2 students each will be used to group&#xD;
      students into clusters based on school and grade level. The stepped wedge design assigns a&#xD;
      random cluster to be switched from the control group to the C2T intervention group at 1-month&#xD;
      intervals starting in January 2022.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months or time to completion of the C2T intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The K-CAT-S is a computerized adaptive test for assessment of DSM 5 conditions in youth. Adaptive testing allows the assessment to be done in less than 10 minutes with high validity compared against diagnostic interviews. High scores indicate greater psychopathology. The minimum score is 0, a score between 45-64 is moderate, a score greater than 65 is severe, and the maximum score is 100. Change in the numeric level of these symptoms will be the primary outcome of the testing of the preliminary effectiveness of the Cope2Thrive intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale - Self Report (WFIRS-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months or time to completion of the C2T intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Weiss Functional Impairment Scale Self Report (WFIRS-S) is an assessment of the student's perception of their functional impairment over the past month, across six domains including family, school, life skills, child's self-concept, social activities, and risky activities. Higher mean item scores indicate greater functional impairment. The minimum mean item score is 0, the maximum mean item score is 3, and the ROC population cut-off is 0.65. A mean change score of 0.25 is the minimal clinical important difference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kiddie Computerized Adaptive Testing Parent Report(K-CAT-P)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months or time to completion of the C2T intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Kiddie Computerized Adaptive Testing (K-CAT-P) will be administered to parents to obtain collateral parent report of youth symptoms. The scoring metrics of this testing are identical to the Kiddie Computerized Adaptive Testing Student Report (K-CAT-S) reported above. The Kiddie Computerized Adaptive Testing Parent Report (K-CAT-P) screener provides a combined numeric score for each module based on validated quantitative comparisons. Higher scores indicate higher levels of symptoms. The minimum score for any module is 0, a numeric score between 45-64 for any module is considered moderate, a numeric score of 65 or above for any module is considered severe, and the maximum score for any module is 100.The K-CAT-P includes a total of 6 modules, so the maximum total score for the assessment is 600.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months or time to completion of the C2T intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Weiss Functional Impairment Scale Parent Report (WFIRS-P) is an assessment of the parent's perception of their child's functional impairment over the past month, across six domains including family, school learning and behavior, life skills, child's self-concept, social activities, and risky activities. Higher mean item scores indicate greater functional impairment. The minimum mean item score is 0, the maximum mean item score is 3, and the ROC population cut-off is 0.65. A mean change score of 0.25 is the minimal clinical important difference.</description>
