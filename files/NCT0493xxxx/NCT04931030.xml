  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current population of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide is over 200 million and&#xD;
      Malaysia contributes to 1.2% of that number. The prevalence of T2DM in Malaysia has&#xD;
      approximately tripled over the last three decades from 6.3% in 1986 to 17.5% of the adult&#xD;
      population in 2015.T2DM is a progressive disease associated with debilitating microvascular&#xD;
      and macrovascular complications. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Peninsular&#xD;
      Malaysia was high at 9.1% of the adult population in 2011. T2DM is the leading cause of renal&#xD;
      failure for patients commencing dialysis, increasing from 53% of new dialysis patients in&#xD;
      2004 to 61% in 2013. Therefore, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a debilitating complication&#xD;
      which not only imposes significant health problems but also confers financial burden on&#xD;
      affected patients. There has been increasing amount of understanding in the complexity of the&#xD;
      relationship between T2DM and obesity. As the prevalence of both conditions continue to&#xD;
      demonstrate a parallel rise, the influence of obesity on T2DM is further marked. Thus, this&#xD;
      has led to greater emphasis on weight loss in the management of T2DM. More recent&#xD;
      anti-diabetic medications including SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP1 agonists demonstrated greater&#xD;
      efficacy in improving glycaemic control and their ability to produce weight reduction. In&#xD;
      addition, there has been more interest in the effects of these drugs on retardation of renal&#xD;
      disease progression. The mechanism is unclear, either attributed by direct drug effects on&#xD;
      renal glomerular-tubular structures, through the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System (RAAS),&#xD;
      or other pathways. Another pausible explanation is the significant weight loss, which has&#xD;
      been shown to have a significant effect of attenuation of renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight reduction programs have long been a complex and tedious treatment plan which has&#xD;
      inconsistent, non-duplicable and unpredictable outcomes. Most programs emphasized on medical&#xD;
      nutrition therapy and lifestyle changes. There has been many different dietary plans which&#xD;
      share a common goal ie to reduce calori intake whilst increasing energy expenditure. Few have&#xD;
      been successfully reproducible, limited by either patient adherence or modest outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low carbohydrate diet is a diet plan which stresses on reducing carbohydrate intake to less&#xD;
      than 20g daily. Numerous studies have shown that weight loss could be obtained by reduction&#xD;
      of calori intake in either the form of carbohydrate or fat. CKD patients are recommended to&#xD;
      consume low protein diet of less than 0.6-0.7g/kg/day with little emphasis on calori or&#xD;
      carbohydrate intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, thus, aims to evaluate the effects of low carbohydrate and moderate fat (LCBD) in&#xD;
      addition to low protein diet on renal disease in patients with DKD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, single center, randomized, controlled, clinical trial in&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, comparing 16-weeks of LCBD compared to standard medical&#xD;
      therapy in patients with DKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be recruited from the Endocrinology and Nephrology clinics in UiTM Medical&#xD;
      Specialist Center. Inclusion criteria would include patients aged between 40-75 years old,&#xD;
      diagnosis with Type 2 DM of more than 5 years with stable CKD stage 2 and 3 of more than 6&#xD;
      months, HbA1c of 7% - 10.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria include patients with Type 1 DM, experiencing frequent hypoglycaemia,&#xD;
      abnormal liver function tests, heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class&#xD;
      III-IV), active systemic inflammatory disease, chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis,&#xD;
      active hepatic disease and collagen disease, malignancy, recent hospital admission within the&#xD;
      past 3 months, pregnant women, breastfeeding or planning to conceive within the next year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, patients would be randomised to either LCBD or low protein Diet&#xD;
      (LPD) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruited patients will be given the standard dietary and exercise advice which will&#xD;
      include low protein of 0.6-0.7g/kg/day and low salt diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients within the LCBD will be given a prescription diet of 20g of&#xD;
      carbohydrate daily. This will be supplemented by visual aids on carbohydrate counts of&#xD;
      various local food. Patients would be given the option to choose their most appropriate food&#xD;
      types which will amount to the carbohydrate count given. Patients on oral anti-diabetic&#xD;
      treatment including insulin will advised on titrations of their medications to avoid&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm will not be given any additional advice. All patients will be required to&#xD;
      fill in a 3-day food diary during their scheduled visits which will be at 8 weeks and 16&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments include blood sampling of approximately 8 ml which will be done at&#xD;
      baseline and at study end.&#xD;
