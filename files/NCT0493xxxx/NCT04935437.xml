  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implementation of a supervised rehabilitation program in patients recovering from&#xD;
      COVID-19-infection who suffer from limitations and symptoms due to the disease at least 1&#xD;
      month after discharge from hospital. Patients who have been seriously ill and have been&#xD;
      admitted to the ward with high oxygen mixtures or have been admitted to the ICU will be&#xD;
      selected primarily. The program includes supervised rehabilitation sessions 2 times a week&#xD;
      for 2 months. Patients will be evaluated during recruitment and at the end of the program.&#xD;
      Patients who can not or do not want to attend the program will be re-evaluated in 2 months&#xD;
      and constitute the control population. Investigators hypothesis is that post COVID-19&#xD;
      patients who have persistent symptoms following a supervised rehabilitation program will have&#xD;
      fewer symptoms after the end of the program compared to similar patients who do not attend a&#xD;
      rehabilitation program.&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of quality of life using SF-36 questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of depression with Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, BDI-1A, BDI-II), is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory for measuring the severity of depression.&#xD;
When the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-off scores were as follows:&#xD;
0-9: indicates minimal depression 10-18: indicates mild depression 19-29: indicates moderate depression 30-63: indicates severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of quality of life using EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <description>The Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) is designed as a measure of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. It's a 22-item self report measure that assesses subjective distress caused by traumatic events. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88) and subscale scores can also be calculated for the Intrusion, Avoidance, and Hyperarousal subscales.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of functional capacity with Short Physical Performance Battery.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short Physical Performance Battery is a simple test to measure lower extremity function using tasks that mimic daily activities.

    <description>The one minute sit to stand test assesses functional lower extremity strength, transitional movements, balance, and fall risk.The 1-minute STS test is performed with a chair of standard height of 46 cm without arm rests. The patient is ensured to be seated upright on the chair positioned against a wall. The patient sits with the knees and hips flexed to 90°, feet placed flat on the floor hip-width apart, and the hands placed on the hips. Every get up from the chair is validated to check if complete sit-to-stand-to-sit sequence is achieved. The number of repetitions is measured.</description>
