  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac involvement has been described in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus-2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although there are no approved drugs to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection at present time, several medications used have the potential to increase QT&#xD;
      interval and eventually provoke torsades de pointe. The investigators therefore create a&#xD;
      study that include all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection having an electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
      The investigators evaluate the percentage of patients with ECG abnormalities, describe the&#xD;
      abnormalities and evaluate the occurrence of syncope, ventricular arrhythmia and corrected QT&#xD;
      (cQT) interval modification in patients receiving treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the investigators analyze baseline ECG as well as&#xD;
      follow-up ECG. Patients followed by Bordeaux University Hospital for COVID-19 can be&#xD;
      included. ECG are digitized in the computerized patient file (DxCARE) for further analysis.&#xD;
