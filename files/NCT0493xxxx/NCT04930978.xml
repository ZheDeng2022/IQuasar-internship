  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the&#xD;
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Tuberculosis (TB) is the foremost cause of infectious deaths&#xD;
      globally. In 2025, an additional 1.4 million TB deaths could occur as direct consequence of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. It is postulated that individuals with latent or active TB are more&#xD;
      susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 disease and that COVID-19 disease rate is high in patients with&#xD;
      active TB, although the evidence is still scarce. TB and SARS-CoV-2 are both infectious&#xD;
      diseases which primarily attack the alveolar region of the lungs and share common symptoms.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 disease can induce innate and adaptive immunity, but uncontrolled inflammatory&#xD;
      innate immunity and impaired adaptive immune responses may be associated with severe tissue&#xD;
      damage, both locally and systemically. People with coinfection (COVID-19 and TB disease)&#xD;
      might potentially have impaired protective immune responses and treatment outcomes,&#xD;
      specifically as far as anti-tuberculosis treatment is concerned. However, very little is&#xD;
      known about the immunological underpinnings in this interface between TB and COVID-19 on the&#xD;
      effect of SARS-CoV-2 disease on disease severity, response to treatment and treatment&#xD;
      outcomes in pulmonary tuberculosis. Investigators hypothesize that altered immunity due to&#xD;
      prior or present asymptomatic disease with SARS-CoV-2 virus can lead to altered immune&#xD;
      responses and systems biology, increased severity and altered treatment outcomes in TB&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study would be to evaluate the baseline differences in immune cells&#xD;
      populations immune cell responses at baseline and at the time of treatment (2nd month) and&#xD;
      end of treatment. Further, Investigators would be evaluating the changes in proteomic&#xD;
      profiles in a subset of these individuals. In addition, immunological assays examining&#xD;
      differences in T cell populations, measuring levels of various cytokines and by&#xD;
      immunophenotyping as well as other immune parameters related to innate and adaptive responses&#xD;
      will be performed to enhance the understanding of the immunological cross-talk between active&#xD;
      TB patients with or without SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective would be to study the&#xD;
      clinical features, disease severity, mycobacterial burden and treatment outcomes in a cohort&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 infected (asymptomatic PCR or Antibody+) and non-infected patients with active&#xD;
      pulmonary TB.&#xD;

      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to the family coronaviridae&#xD;
      with wide spreading in humans and animals. This virus is enveloped and contains&#xD;
      positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with approximately 31 kb of genome size and so far, is&#xD;
      considered as the largest known RNA viruses. The COVID-19 infected individuals exhibit low to&#xD;
      modest symptoms (cough, fever, and respiratory distress) and transmitted mainly by&#xD;
      respiratory droplets. However, around 15% of infected individuals proceed to severe pneumonia&#xD;
      and approximately 5% of them progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic&#xD;
      shock and/or multiple organ failure. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs through the means of&#xD;
      coughing and sneezing, touching the mouth, nose, eyes, close personal contact and touching a&#xD;
      virus-contaminated object. SARS-CoV-2 disease can induce both the arms of innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immunity, but uncontrolled inflammatory innate immunity and weakened adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses might be associated with destructive tissue damage, both locally and systemically.&#xD;
      Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-10 and C-reactive protein. The SARS-CoV-2 is a global pandemic threat. Currently, as on&#xD;
      August 5, the total number of COVID-19 cases is approximately 18,354,342 with 696147 deaths&#xD;
      were reported worldwide and 216 countries are affected. In India, approximately 1,908,254&#xD;
      individuals were infected and 39795 deaths occurred due to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 disease is&#xD;
      often associated with unconstrained immune response, caused by the hyperactivation of&#xD;
      monocytes, macrophages and elevated neutrophils. Both, humoral (production of IgG, IgM,&#xD;
      neutralising antibodies and reduced memory B cells) and cell mediated (CD4+, CD8+ and&#xD;
      cytotoxic markers) immunity is required for defense against COVID-19. In addition, the&#xD;
      activation of Th1 / Th17 cells might induce the exacerbation of the inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most important infectious diseases around the world.&#xD;
      Tuberculosis (TB), although largely a curable disease, still remains a major cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality worldwide. According to the Global Tuberculosis Report 2019, there&#xD;
      are an estimated 10 million incident cases of tuberculosis and killed 1.2 million in 2018&#xD;
      globally. India accounts for 27% of all estimated incident cases worldwide. M. tuberculosis&#xD;
      (M.tb) infection could result in the activation of innate (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic&#xD;
      cells, neutrophils, mast cells) and adaptive (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic markers)&#xD;
      immune response which are necessary for protection. Protective immunity against M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis is not completely understood but depends on a wide range of innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immune mechanisms. T cell-mediated immune responses are important in the host control of M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis infection. The ability of CD4+ T cells to produce gamma interferon, which&#xD;
      activates phagocytes to contain the intracellular pathogen, is central in protection. Indeed,&#xD;
      T helper 1 (Th1) cells and the gamma IFN that they produce are crucial for protection against&#xD;
      disease. This is evident from the increased risk of tuberculosis in individuals with&#xD;
      deficiencies in their IFNγ and interleukin 12 (IL 12; which promotes Th1 cell&#xD;
      differentiation) signalling pathways. Many other CD4+ T cell subsets, in addition to gamma&#xD;
      IFN producing Th1 cells, may also have a role; for example, IL 17-producing CD4+ T cells were&#xD;
      shown to mediate the recruitment of protective Th1 cells to the lung upon M. tuberculosis&#xD;
      challenge. Furthermore, increased frequencies of regulatory CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) cells&#xD;
      during active disease may ensure that the Th1 cell response is not excessive, and this would&#xD;
      help minimize lung damage in tuberculosis. The CD8+ T cell response to M. tuberculosis is&#xD;
      normally of a lower magnitude than the CD4+ T cell response; however, CD8+ T cells may&#xD;
      modulate phago¬cyte activity or produce molecules such as granulysin that may be directly&#xD;
      cytotoxic to the mycobacteria. Similarly, other cytokines, in addition to gamma IFN, may also&#xD;
      be crucial; for example, Tumour necrosis factor-alpha is important for establishing the&#xD;
      granuloma, which is a well-organized collection of innate and adaptive cells that forms to&#xD;
      contain the pathogen. Development of TB disease results from interactions among the&#xD;
      environment, the host, and the pathogen, and known risk factors include HIV coinfection,&#xD;
      immunodeficiency, diabetes mellitus, overcrowding, malnutrition, and general poverty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between TB and COVID-19 is likely to be bi-directional. The temporary&#xD;
      immunosuppression induced by tuberculosis may increase the susceptibility of patients to&#xD;
      COVID-19, and COVID may, in turn, also increase susceptibility to TB. In 2025, an additional&#xD;
      1.4 million TB deaths could be occurred as direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease rate was high in patients with active TB. TB and SARS-CoV-2 are both&#xD;
      infectious diseases which primarily attack the alveolar region of the lungs and share common&#xD;
      symptom patterns. Both CD4 and CD8 counts were severely reduced, and the surviving T cells&#xD;
      appeared to demonstrate &quot;functional exhaustion&quot;. This T cell depletion and dysfunction may&#xD;
      exacerbate active TB. Published studies have reported that patients with TB and other viral&#xD;
      infections impede the host immune responses like induction of type I interferons by influenza&#xD;
      infection, lower mean of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased viral elimination in sputum,&#xD;
      stool and suppression of cellular immunity. Recent studies have reported that cytokines seem&#xD;
      to play an important role in COVID-19 and TB, and their plasma levels associated with disease&#xD;
      severity. It is predicted that people with coinfection have impaired protective immune&#xD;
      responses and treatment outcomes, specifically in terms of anti-tuberculosis treatment.&#xD;
      Studies showed that SARS-CoV2 coexistent with TB resulted in a decreased absolute number of&#xD;
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and reduced antibody levels following SARS-CoV-2 recovery. SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      with TB patients exhibited prolonged viral elimination from stools and sputum in comparison&#xD;
      without TB. Studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 disease stimulates increased cytokine&#xD;
      secretion, like interleukin-1 , gamma interferon, tumour necrosis factor- alpha,&#xD;
      interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10), that ultimately leads to&#xD;
      severe inflammation and their plasma levels were linked with disease severity. However, only&#xD;
      limited information is available on the function of antigen-specific T cell-mediated immune&#xD;
      response to COVID-19 specifically upon coinfection with tuberculosis, since both the disease&#xD;
      primarily affects the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited studies have shown that influenza induces immune system hyperactivity and exacerbates&#xD;
      pulmonary tuberculosis, leading to worsening of pulmonary function. Respiratory viral&#xD;
      infections coexistent with TB delay the host immune responses and lead to more serious&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Coinfection most probably exacerbates inflammation through heightened&#xD;
      secretion of cytokines and accelerates the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      and also worsen the TB disease and its outcome. Hence, Investigators propose that&#xD;
      understanding mechanisms of immune regulation during SARS-CoV-2 disease may lead to the&#xD;
      development of better therapeutic strategies and the results of our fundamental studies may&#xD;
      inform future plans for clinical interventional studies. The main fundamental research&#xD;
      component of this study might identify clinical parameters and treatment methods and to&#xD;
      understand the immunological mechanism for the severity in coinfected SARS-CoV-2 and TB&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Investigators hypothesize that altered immunity due to present or prior&#xD;
      asymptomatic disease with SARS-CoV-2 virus could lead to altered immune responses and systems&#xD;
      biology, increased severity and altered treatment outcomes in TB disease.&#xD;
