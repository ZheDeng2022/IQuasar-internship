  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prehospital management after road traffic crashes(RTC) is a predicting factor to patient&#xD;
      outcomes especially in Low-Income Countries where emergency medical services are lacking.&#xD;
      This may explain the high mortality related to RTC in Rwanda for instance, where the delay to&#xD;
      reach the hospital of these victims was found as an independent factor to death . For that&#xD;
      reason, this study hypothesizes that the training of non -professionals as commercial&#xD;
      motorcyclists could help to reduce trauma-related mortality and morbidity in Rwanda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol general objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of road traffic crashes first&#xD;
      -aid education on knowledge, attitudes, and practice among commercial motorcyclists in&#xD;
      Kigali-City, Rwanda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a difference in the baseline level of knowledge, attitudes, and practice on&#xD;
           road crashes' first aid between the intervention and control groups of commercial&#xD;
           motorcyclists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is a relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and knowledge,&#xD;
           attitudes, and practice' levels on first aid among commercial motorcyclists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is a relationship between the education intervention and Knowledge, attitudes, and&#xD;
           practice' level on first aid among commercial motorcyclists&#xD;

      Specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To differentiate the baseline level of knowledge, attitudes, and practice on road&#xD;
           crashes' first aid on the intervention and control groups of commercial motorcyclists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the relationship between socio-demographic characteristics of commercial&#xD;
           motorcyclists and their level of knowledge, attitudes, and practice on first-aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of road traffic crashes' first-aid education on knowledge,&#xD;
           attitudes, and practice of commercial motorcyclists after the intervention, within and&#xD;
           between the intervention and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Population: is the total number of commercial motorcyclists working in Kigali-&#xD;
                City.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample size: The sample of 100 participants per group, i.e. intervention and&#xD;
                control was estimated based on similar studies and using the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = {[z(1-α/2) *√2 P̄ (1- P̄)] + [z(1-β)*√P1(1-P1) + P2 (1-P2)]}2 (P1-P2)2 The total number&#xD;
      of participants is 200.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study instrument:self-administered questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention group will receive road traffic crashes' first aid education module&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group will get the Tuberculosis prevention in working place as an education&#xD;
           module&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the questionnaire, a pre-test on first aid will be done to the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups before education intervention to measure the baseline level of knowledge attitudes and&#xD;
      reported practice. In addition, a post-test immediately after education intervention will&#xD;
      follow to assess the effectiveness of the educational intervention provided. The same&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted after four months of this training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Data analysis: SPSS version 25 will be used to analyze data. The first objective will be&#xD;
      analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square. For the second objective, multiple&#xD;
      logistic regression will be used to determine the relationship between socio-demographic&#xD;
      characteristics and level of knowledge, attitude, and practice among commercial&#xD;
      motorcyclists. Lastly, One way repeated ANOVA will be used to evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between first aid education intervention and level of knowledge, attitudes, and practice of&#xD;
      commercial motorcyclists between pre and post-test scores. A P-value less than 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Sensitivity analysis: Intention -to- treat( ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses will be used&#xD;
      to determine the effect of dropout and non-response. The differences between the coefficients&#xD;
      found from these two analyses will then calculated and stated as percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I got ethical approval from JKEUPM from Malaysia and IRB from Rwanda&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All study participants will provide informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
           Data will be kept confidential and access will be restricted to the research team only.&#xD;
           No participants' names will be required during data collection, only codes will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Years of driving experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous training on first aid: will be measured by answering yes or no&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First aid education: refers to recognize the emergency, call for help, scene safety,&#xD;
           airway, and breathing, hemorrhage control, first aid kit, immobilization of fractures,&#xD;
           and transport of injured people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge: will be categorized into correct incorrect responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attitudes: will be stratified into two groups: Strongly agree and agree will represent&#xD;
           positive attitudes whereas unsure, disagree, and strongly disagree will stand for&#xD;
           negative attitudes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practice: will refer to two clusters for correct and incorrect reported practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention group: refers to a group of commercial motorcyclists that will receive road&#xD;
           traffic crashes first aid education program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: is a group of commercial motorcyclists that will receive a placebo&#xD;
           program concerning tuberculosis prevention in the working place&#xD;
