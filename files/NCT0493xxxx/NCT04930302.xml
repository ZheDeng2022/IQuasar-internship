  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to assess the impact of pharmaceutical care in collaboration with&#xD;
      physicians on prevalence of DRPs at hospital admission, discharge and at post-discharge&#xD;
      check-up (4 - 8 weeks after patient's discharge from hospital) in patients with carotid&#xD;
      artery disease hospitalized at the Department of Vascular Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key focus area of this project will be the identification of DRPs, their occurrence and&#xD;
      type. As a part of further research, the investigators want to analyze the degree of&#xD;
      acceptance of the proposed changes in pharmacotherapy by physicians, ATC groups of drugs with&#xD;
      the highest incidence of DRPs and identify patients at highest risk for DRPs taking in&#xD;
      consideration their personal and health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Pharmaceutical care provided at hospital admission and at hospital discharge&#xD;
      does not reduce prevalence rates of DRPs in patients with carotid artery disease hospitalized&#xD;
      at the Department of Vascular Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: Pharmaceutical care provided at hospital admission and at hospital&#xD;
      discharge reduces prevalence rates of DRPs in patients with carotid artery disease&#xD;
      hospitalized at the Department of Vascular Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in the prevalence rate of DRPs at a) hospital admission vs. hospital discharge, b)&#xD;
      hospital discharge vs. post-discharge check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. acceptance rate of pharmaceutical intervention by physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identification of factors that increase patients' odds for DRPs at hospital admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. score that expresses patients´ knowledge of his pharmacotherapy&#xD;

      Medication reconciliation, medication review and patient education performed by a trained&#xD;
      pharmacist in three timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All comments with a proposal from the pharmacist will be recorded in written together with a&#xD;
      record of the therapy, entered in the patient's medical record and communicated with the&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timepoints for intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At hospital admission&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient is normally admitted to the planned hospitalization by the physician in&#xD;
           cooperation with the nurse as described above. If the patient is over 18 years of age,&#xD;
           takes more than three medicines, speaks and understands Slovak language and has signed&#xD;
           an informed consent to participate in biomedical research, after being placed in a bed,&#xD;
           a pharmacist comes to the patient and performs MR. During MR, the pharmacist creates a&#xD;
           record of the patient's therapy (MR form for admission - attachment No. 2), the original&#xD;
           of which is placed in the patient's medical record, and a copy is placed to pharmacist´s&#xD;
           records.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Steps in MR:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. As part of the invitation to hospitalization (by telephone, in writing), the&#xD;
                patient will be asked to bring all their medications and a complete medication&#xD;
                list, which will be used in consultation with the pharmacist regarding their proper&#xD;
                use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Completion of BPMH&#xD;
&#xD;
                BPMH is a treatment overview obtained by a healthcare professional that contains&#xD;
                all the medicines (prescription medicines and over-the-counter drugs) that the&#xD;
                patient is taking, using various sources of information. The source of information&#xD;
                can be a drug record, an admission report and a course, historical records from the&#xD;
                HIS, information from the patient or his family member. BPMH is different and more&#xD;
                complex than the routine history of primary treatment (which is often a rapid&#xD;
                history of patient treatment). The BPMH includes the name of the medicine, the&#xD;
                dose, the frequency and the route of the medicines that the patient is currently&#xD;
                taking, although it may differ from what was actually written in the drug list.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The types of drugs that need to be recorded for BPMH include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  prescription drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  over-the-counter drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  nutritional supplements&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  herbal medicines, medicinal teas&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  recreational drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  regular consumption of certain foods (e.g. grapefruit)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  special emphasis should be placed on specific forms of medicines such as&#xD;
                     inhalers, eye drops, topical semi-solid medicines, or medicines taken every&#xD;
                     few weeks (bisphosphonates)&#xD;
&#xD;
                One of the recorded parameters is patient understanding. It is evaluated in three&#xD;
                steps - the patient knows / does not know the name of the drug (1/0), the patient&#xD;
                knows / does not know the indication of the drug (1/0) and the patient knows / does&#xD;
                not know the dosage of the drug (1/0).&#xD;
&#xD;
                If the patient is unable to attend the interview, other sources may be used to&#xD;
                obtain a medical history or to clarify conflicting information. Other resources&#xD;
                should never be a substitute for a thorough conversation with the patient and / or&#xD;
                family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Verification and documentation of BPMH&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medicinal product information should be verified by more than one other source. Sources&#xD;
           for the initial acquisition of an overview of pharmacotherapy are the admission report,&#xD;
           the history of hospitalization, outpatient reports, HIS, the course at admission. The&#xD;
           investigators verify the information obtained by speaking with a patient or his family&#xD;
           member, the provided drug list or drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within the WHO SOP, the investigators chose a retroactive MR model at admission for our&#xD;
           biomedical research. In a retroactive model, in accordance with the method described&#xD;
           above, the patient is admitted by a physician in cooperation with a nurse by default,&#xD;
           and a drug course is created, a daily prescription of drugs for the patient. In this&#xD;
           case, the BPMH is determined after admission by a physician / nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The result of Part b) is a comparison of prescribed and actually used medicines to&#xD;
           patients (BMPH) with marked discrepancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medication review with pharmaceutical intervention at patient admission The basis for&#xD;
           performing patient therapy optimization is the acquisition of BPMH and patient factors&#xD;
           such as the reason for hospitalization, current health status, comorbidities, height,&#xD;
           weight, heart rate, blood pressure and the results of examinations of biochemical and&#xD;
           hematological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The detected BPMH is written to the case report form (CRF) (attachment No. 4) . It is&#xD;
           then analyzed in the context of the patient's overall health condition and DRPs are&#xD;
           identified. Each detected discrepancy is assigned an alphanumeric code according to the&#xD;
           PCNE V9.00 classification. The patient's personal data is anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Discrepancies in therapy should be consulted with the treating physician within 24 hours&#xD;
           of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation of therapy based on DRPs and PCNE classification After receiving BPMH and a&#xD;
           detailed study of the reason for hospitalization, current medical condition, and any&#xD;
           comorbidities of the patient, the pharmacist draws information about the patient's&#xD;
           weight, height, heart rate, and blood pressure from the admission report. Subsequently,&#xD;
           he/she studies the results of biochemical and hematological examinations. The pharmacist&#xD;
           focuses on the results of examinations related to pharmacotherapy and the determination&#xD;
           of the function of elimination organs. These are mainly the serum potassium, serum&#xD;
           creatinine, serum uric acid, liver transaminases, lipidogram, C-reactive protein. Renal&#xD;
           function is calculated based on the Cockcroft and Gault creatinine clearance estimate&#xD;
           and the CKD-EPI glomerular filtration rate estimate. From the hematological results, the&#xD;
           pharmacist focuses on INR, aPTT-R, anti Xa activity, platelet count and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pharmacist controls duplication in the drugs used; the indications of the drugs used&#xD;
           according to the patient's comorbidities; compliance with the maximum recommended doses&#xD;
           of drugs according to the SPC; the suitability of the choice of dosage form; drug&#xD;
           interactions using the computerized interaction database, the LexiComp℗, SPC,&#xD;
           pharmacological findings, published scientific papers and case reports; newly manifested&#xD;
           adverse drug reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pharmacist performs a MR when discharging a patient from the hospital, similar to&#xD;
           the admission. MR form for discharge is used (attachment No. 5). When evaluating a&#xD;
           patient's pharmacotherapy on discharge from hospital, the BPMH obtained at the patient's&#xD;
           admission will be used as a source of information. The BPMH is then compared with the&#xD;
           list of medicines that are recorded in the release report. The pharmacist will compare&#xD;
           the two lists of medicines, focusing on the identification of DRPs with special regard&#xD;
           to the re-introduction of the chronic therapy which the patient was taking before coming&#xD;
           to the hospital. As part of this research, the pharmacist will meet with the patient&#xD;
           during his discharge from the hospital and discuss with him the management of his&#xD;
           further pharmacotherapy. Pharmacists provide an understandable summary list of patient's&#xD;
           medicines explaining importance and the correct use of medicine (attachment No. 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medication review with pharmaceutical intervention at patient discharge The pharmacist&#xD;
           analyzes pharmacotherapy in the context of the patient's state of health and the results&#xD;
           of laboratory tests, similar to the patient's admission as described above. Detected&#xD;
           DRPs are then consulted with the treating physician and recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The result of the pharmacist's intervention at discharge is the completion of the MR&#xD;
           form for discharge and the writing of all comments on pharmacotherapy in the form of a&#xD;
           summary report. Discrepancies and comments are consulted with the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the first ambulatory check-up (approximately after 4 - 8 weeks after discharge)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacist performs a MR by obtaining BPMH, similar to the previous admission of the&#xD;
      patient to the hospital. MR form for patient's post-discharge check-up is used (attachment&#xD;
      No. 8). When evaluating a current patient's pharmacotherapy, the list of patient's&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy at discharge will be used as a source of information. The pharmacist will&#xD;
      compare the lists of medicines, focusing on the identification of DRPs in current treatment&#xD;
      compared to the pharmacotherapy at the time of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose health condition is not controlled at the National Institute of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases will be contacted and investigated by phone.&#xD;
