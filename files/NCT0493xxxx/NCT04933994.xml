      To explore the different clinical and CT features distinguishing COVID-19 from H1N1 influenza&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pneumonia patients showed less proportions of underlying diseases, fever and&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms than those of H1N1 pneumonia patients (p&lt;0.01). White blood cell count,&#xD;
      neutrophilic granulocyte percentage, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-Dimer and lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase in H1N1 pneumonia patients were higher than those of COVID-19 pneumonia&#xD;
      patients (p&lt;0.05). H1N1 pneumonia were often symmetrically located in the dorsal part of lung&#xD;
      inferior lobes, while COVID-19 pneumonia were unsually showed a peripheral but non-specific&#xD;
      lobe distributions. Ground glass opacity was more common in COVID-19 pneumonia and&#xD;
      consolidation lesions was more common in H1N1 pneumonia (p&lt;0.01). COVID-19 pneumonia lesions&#xD;
      showed a relative clear margin compared with H1N1 pneumonia. Crazy-paving pattern, thickening&#xD;
      vessels, reversed halo sign and early fibrotic leisions were more common in COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia than H1N1 pneumonia (p&lt;0.05). Pleural effusion in COVID-19 pneumonia was&#xD;
      significantly less common than H1N1 pneumonia (p&lt;0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with H1N1 pneumonia in Zhejiang, China, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia was more concealed with less underlying diseases and slighter respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
      The more common CT manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia included ground glass opacity with a&#xD;
      relative clear margin, crazy-paving pattern, thickening vessels, reversed halo sign and early&#xD;
      fibrotic leisions, while the less common CT manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia included&#xD;
      consolidation and pleural effusion.&#xD;

    <description>two independent cohorts of COVID-19 pneumonia (n=405) and H1N1 influenza pneumonia (n=78) retrospectively, all patients were confirmed by RT-PCR. Four hundred and five cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were confirmed in nine hospitals of Zhejiang province, China from January 21 to February 20, 2020. Seventy-eight cases of H1N1 influenza pneumonia were confirmed in our hospital from January 1, 2017 to February 29, 2020.</description>
