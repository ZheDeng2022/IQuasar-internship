  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common metabolic disorders complicating the course of&#xD;
      pregnancy, which concerns pre-pregnancy diabetes (PGDM) - most often type 1 or type 2; and&#xD;
      gestational diabetes (GDM) - treated with diet (G1) or insulin (G2). Currently, in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of diabetes and the regulation of glucose metabolism, the role of tissue&#xD;
      hormones, including adipokines, e.g., omentin-1, visfatin, have been considered. Adipokines&#xD;
      might also affect the development of the fetus - mainly fetal adipose tissue gain. Their&#xD;
      concentrations and activity depend on the maternal visceral fat content and concomitant&#xD;
      metabolic disorders. It is known that adipokines are excreted in human milk during the&#xD;
      lactation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to assess the impact of diabetes during pregnancy, requiring&#xD;
      treatment with diet or insulin, on the nutritional status of the newborn.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The detailed aim of the study was to analyze the relationship between the concentration of&#xD;
      selected adipokines, visfatin and omentin-1 in the mother, and the nutritional status of the&#xD;
      newborn (expressed as body composition and anthropometric measurements), as well as the&#xD;
      composition of breast milk, and clinical data on the course of pregnancy, childbirth,&#xD;
      puerperium (interview from mother) and the postnatal stay of the child in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research was going to be conducted twice, that is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. in the period of postnatal hospitalization of the newborn, before discharge from the&#xD;
           hospital (up to 7 days of age) in the Neonatology Clinic,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. in the 4th - 6th week of the child's life, after visiting the Neonatology Outpatient&#xD;
           Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the clinical examination, anthropometric measurements and body composition&#xD;
      measurements, the results of laboratory tests performed on a child during hospitalization up&#xD;
      to the 7th day of life and at the 4-6 week of life were collected. The interview&#xD;
      questionnaire was carried out twice with the child's mother. From the mother, at the same&#xD;
      time, milk (colostrum and mature) and blood was collected for laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further changes in the protocol (accepted by Bioethical Comitte):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Extending the project with further study visits, i.e. 6-12 weeks and if the mother&#xD;
           wishes to continue participation, 13 weeks - 6 months after delivery, in the case of&#xD;
           sustained lactation and further breastfeeding, before introducing solid food into the&#xD;
           child's diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Substantiation: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the second project visit was abandoned.&#xD;
           Based on telephone calls, the patients were still interested in participating, the more&#xD;
           so as they had not completed the prescribed postpartum check-ups, their scheduled visits&#xD;
           to specialists were canceled, and the infant vaccinations had been postponed. Patients&#xD;
           also reported the need for lactation advice. Additional dates (6-12 weeks after&#xD;
           childbirth and 13 weeks to 6 months after childbirth) would enable inviting mothers and&#xD;
           their babies, providing medical or lactation advice according to their needs, as well as&#xD;
           continuing the project among patients and their children who had been included in the&#xD;
           study so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cooperation with Biobank of Wroc≈Çaw Medical University was established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substantiation: Possibility of collecting and storing biological material for further&#xD;
      research in safe and controlled conditions.&#xD;

    <description>In order to ensure reproducible results, breast milk samples were collected using a breast pump. Samples were taken in the morning, after the newborn was breastfed. The entire breast was emptied. In order to ensure the stability of the microbiological and nutritional composition, the milk samples were cooled immediately after collection, and then divided into test tubes and frozen (-80 C) until the laboratory tests were made.&#xD;
The concentrations of macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrate) in breast milk were determined using a Human Milk Analyzer (HMA; Miris, Uppsala). Tissue hormones, e.g. adipokines: visfatin, omentin-1 were determined by ELISA method using commercial reagent kits.</description>

        gestational diabetes, both treated with diet and treated with insulin - each group was&#xD;
        supposed to include at least 20 patients. Additionally, if possible, women diagnosed with&#xD;
        type 1 and type 2 pre-pregnancy diabetes or insulin resistance might have been included in&#xD;
        the study. The control group consisted of 20 healthy women and their newborns.&#xD;
