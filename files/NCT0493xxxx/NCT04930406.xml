  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will investigate the effect of physical therapy intervention on the&#xD;
      function of the foot and ankle in children and adolescents with cancer not involving the&#xD;
      brain or spinal cord. Children undergoing treatment for cancer can suffer from decreased&#xD;
      flexibility, strength, balance and endurance from the cancer and from direct effects of the&#xD;
      chemotherapy agents. These deficits have been shown to continue years after treatment end&#xD;
      with adult survivors of cancer being less physically active then their siblings. Children,&#xD;
      whose chemotherapy includes neurotoxic agents such as vincristine, can develop damage to&#xD;
      their peripheral nervous system affecting the strength, sensation, and flexibility in their&#xD;
      hands and feet. This can then lead to a change in their walking pattern and likely&#xD;
      contributes to decreased physical activity level and fatigue. The principal investigator is&#xD;
      currently involved in research with Dr. Laura Gilchrist and Dr. Mary C. Hooke establishing&#xD;
      the reliability and validity of a measurement tool to quantify peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
      identifying physical impairments of children with cancer during treatment, and comparing&#xD;
      physical performance in children after treatment completion with and without physical therapy&#xD;
      intervention. The principal investigator is also completing data analysis on a pilot study&#xD;
      investigating the use of ankle foot orthotics in children and adolescents with non-CNS&#xD;
      cancer. In this study, the investigators will further the research by measuring the effect of&#xD;
      physical therapy intervention on measurements involving the function and structure of the&#xD;
      ankle and foot. The investigators will compare participants who have and have not received&#xD;
      physical therapy intervention during cancer treatment by administering measurements detailing&#xD;
      the function of the foot and ankle in order to further evaluate the benefit of physical&#xD;
      therapy for children with cancer. Physical therapy intervention involving children and&#xD;
      adolescents with cancer focuses on minimizing the physical impairments caused by chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiation treatment, as well as promoting normal development of motor skills typically&#xD;
      obtained by a child in their age group. In the oncology population, physical therapy often&#xD;
      targets the foot and ankle as this is most affected by peripheral neuropathy. Interventions&#xD;
      include strengthening, balance training, stretching, and orthotic use to allow normal motor&#xD;
      skills. Families are instructed in exercises that can be completed at home to further improve&#xD;
      their function. This study will examine the difference in the function of the foot and ankle&#xD;
      years after intervention in participants who have and have not received these interventions.&#xD;
      The investigators will measure neuropathy, ankle flexibility, ankle strength, foot posture,&#xD;
      gait mechanics, and endurance in order to fully examine the foot and ankle as well as&#xD;
      evaluate relationships between the variables in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer.&#xD;
