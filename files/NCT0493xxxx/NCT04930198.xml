  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PEERNaija application will feature routine medication reminders, along with individual&#xD;
      adherence monitoring with adherence scores, anonymized peer adherence scores (from peers&#xD;
      attending the same clinic; social incentive), and a monthly lottery-based prize for youth&#xD;
      with the highest adherence scores (financial incentive). The Investigators will recruit a&#xD;
      cohort of 50 HIV-infected adolescents and young adults (AYA) to pilot the app and assess&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, adoption, and preliminary efficacy of important clinical measures&#xD;
      (including adherence and virologic suppression). The proposed study will provide important&#xD;
      preliminary data for the role of mobile health (mHealth) platforms to harness and deliver&#xD;
      social and financial incentives to promote adherence efforts, especially for vulnerable&#xD;
      youth, and for a larger intervention trial evaluating this app among HIV-infected AYA in&#xD;
      Nigeria.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of digital health solutions, especially medication reminders delivered via mHealth&#xD;
      platforms, have shown promise as adherence support tools in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).&#xD;
      Importantly, the proliferation of mobile phones in resource-limited settings and the early&#xD;
      adoption of communication technologies by young people make mHealth technologies an ideal&#xD;
      platform for this age group. The Investigators propose to pilot a novel, mHealth peer-based&#xD;
      intervention for AYA living with HIV in Nigeria that will utilize social and financial&#xD;
      incentives to promote medication adherence. In addition to medication reminders and peer&#xD;
      support, the proposed intervention will innovate within the mHealth arena to leverage the&#xD;
      currency of social incentives through daily adherence monitoring with the provision of&#xD;
      adherence scores for individual users in relation to their peers, and financial incentives&#xD;
      through a monthly lottery for youth with the highest adherence scores with the prize&#xD;
      delivered through the mHealth application itself. This proposal builds on the Investigator's&#xD;
      successful research collaborations in Nigeria with APIN Public Health Initiatives, (APIN, a&#xD;
      multi-site non-governmental organization with solid President's Emergency Plan For AIDS&#xD;
      Relief-funded HIV infrastructure), the investigators expertise in building capacity for&#xD;
      implementation research, and proficiency in developing and deploying mHealth-based&#xD;
      interventions in SSA. This will be accomplished through the following specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of PEERNaija, an&#xD;
      mHealth intervention designed to harness peer influence as an incentive to promote medication&#xD;
      adherence among a pilot cohort of 50 AYA living with HIV in Nigeria. Hypothesis: PEERNaija&#xD;
      will be feasible, acceptable, and show preliminary efficacy in improving antiretroviral (ART)&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;

    <description>For the social incentive, the mHealth application will track the participant's individual adherence score (% of doses taken), track the top scorers (leaderboard), and provide a figure highlighting the proportion of their peers with poor (&lt;80%), medium (80-94%), or high (&gt;94%) adherence scores. The display of the individual's adherence score relative to peer scores is considered a descriptive norm and is meant to portray &quot;what most people are doing,&quot; as young people often inaccurately estimate behaviors for their peer groups. Participants will also receive an injunctive norm, or an indication of what they ought to be doing. This will come in the form of an emoji or congratulatory vs. motivating text for those with high or low adherence scores, respectively. When coupled with descriptive norms, injunctive norms have counteracted regression to the mean for individuals who demonstrate desirable behaviors relative to their peers.</description>

    <description>For the financial incentive, the top 5 scorers in the PEER+ arm will be eligible win a lottery prize each month of the 24 week pilot of 1000 Nigerian Naira (NGN) of &quot;data&quot; that can be directly loaded onto the winner's phone. Behavioral economics theory tells us that individuals are more averse to losses than rewarded by gains, so that even incentives/prizes should be framed in terms of losses. Accordingly, participants in the financial incentive arm will receive weekly motivating messages such as &quot;take your dose today or you lose the chance of winning the lottery.&quot;</description>
