  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SISTER study is a randomized trial, looking at various modalities of social support for&#xD;
      Black patients undergoing treatment for endometrial cancer. There are three study arms: group&#xD;
      support, 1:1 peer support, and enhanced usual care. The primary outcome is treatment&#xD;
      completion, and the secondary outcome is social isolation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SISTER is a prospective, open randomized controlled trial of U.S. Black/African-American&#xD;
      people with high-risk endometrial cancer requiring treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, or&#xD;
      immunotherapy. We will compare social support interventions of enhanced usual care, weekly&#xD;
      group-based support, and 1:1 peer support to determine the most effective option to improve&#xD;
      treatment completion and decrease social isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SISTER study comparators are based on multiple systematic reviews of peer support&#xD;
      literature, input from the multi-stakeholder Steering Group of the Endometrial Cancer Action&#xD;
      Network for African Americans (ECANA), two focus groups of Black women with EC, and cancer&#xD;
      center leadership at selected enrollment sites. The core function of each comparator is to&#xD;
      decrease social isolation for women on active treatment. Of the peer support intervention&#xD;
      options available, the SISTER study includes the two that have the most data collected among&#xD;
      Black women with cancer, have been most efficacious with regard to social isolation9 and&#xD;
      treatment completion, and were enthusiastically supported by ECANA patient partners and focus&#xD;
      group data.&#xD;
