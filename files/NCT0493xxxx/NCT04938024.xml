      Investigators seek to quantify the impact of vitamin C on patient outcomes, including serum&#xD;
      urate level, gout-related symptoms, and obesity (measured by BMI) in both healthy Hmong&#xD;
      adults and in Hmong patients with hyperuricemia (HU) and/or gout; identify associations&#xD;
      between individuals' taxonomic and functional patterns of gut microbiota and its impact on&#xD;
      the serum urate-lowering effect of vitamin C; compare taxonomic and functional patterns of&#xD;
      gut microbiota between people with HU and/or gout and people without HU and gout; and&#xD;
      identify associations between individuals' taxonomic and functional patterns of gut&#xD;
      microbiota and self-reported acute gout trigger foods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gout, caused by chronic elevation of serum urate (SU), is the most common form of&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis worldwide. About 3.9% of adults in the U.S. suffer from gout and&#xD;
      prevalence is even higher in certain ethnicities. Factors that may influence SU include&#xD;
      patients' characteristics (gender, weight, renal function, etc.), genetics, and diet. Foods&#xD;
      and beverages that have shown positive association with HU and gout are alcohol (particularly&#xD;
      beer), purine-rich foods, red meat, seafood, and sugar-sweetened drinks, while inverse&#xD;
      association has been found with dairy intake such as skimmed milk and low-calorie yoghurt,&#xD;
      coffee and vitamin C. The gut microbiota composition and function have been linked to common&#xD;
      chronic human disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis. Intestinal microbiota of gout patients were also found highly distinct&#xD;
      from healthy individuals in both organismal and functional structures from a small study&#xD;
      conducted in China. Strategies to use personal microbiome features to predict glucose&#xD;
      response to specific food have been proposed. However, little is known about the impact of&#xD;
      microbiota on food and urate-lowering therapy (ULT). The translational significance of a&#xD;
      microbiota-guided approach to select appropriate foods and medications that could prevent the&#xD;
      elevation of SU for individuals with gout or at high risk for gout is significant. The Hmong&#xD;
      are a unique Asian sub-population. Hmong men exhibit a 2-fold higher prevalence of gout,&#xD;
      manifesting it earlier in life and experiencing up to 5-fold increased risk of&#xD;
      gout-associated complications, compared to non-Hmong in the US. This could lead to higher&#xD;
      rates of cardiometabolic diseases (e.g. hypertension, renal disease, type 2 diabetes [T2DM]),&#xD;
      which significantly impact morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to quantify the impact of vitamin C on patient outcomes, including serum&#xD;
      urate level, gout-related symptoms, and obesity (measured by BMI) in both healthy Hmong&#xD;
      adults and in Hmong patients with hyperuricemia (HU) and/or gout; identify associations&#xD;
      between individuals' taxonomic and functional patterns of gut microbiota and its impact on&#xD;
      the serum urate-lowering effect of vitamin C; compare taxonomic and functional patterns of&#xD;
      gut microbiota between people with HU and/or gout and people without HU and gout; and&#xD;
      identify associations between individuals' taxonomic and functional patterns of gut&#xD;
      microbiota and self-reported acute gout trigger foods.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Gout Assessment Questionnaire 2.0 (GAQ2.0) contains 25 items covering the following domains: gout overall concern, medication side effects, perception of unmet needs, wellbeing during acute gout attack, and concerns during gout attack. Items are rated on a 5-point likert scale. Total scores range from 25 to 125 with higher scores indicating more gout symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in body mass index (BMI) from baseline to end. BMI is calculated as body weight (in kg) divided by height (in cm) squared. BMI is reported in kg/m^2, and the change will be reported as an absolute value.</description>
