      The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1701 combined with&#xD;
      fluzopar as a maintenance therapy after first-line treatment of advanced lung squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. Patients with advanced or metastatic (stage IV) lung squamous cell carcinoma have&#xD;
      not received systemic chemotherapy and have measurable lesions (RECIST 1.1) ECOG PS 0-1. The&#xD;
      patient received SHR1701 +fluzoparib&#xD;
