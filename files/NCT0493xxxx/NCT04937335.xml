    <textblock>
      Clinical data of 185 consecutive patients receiving resective operation with a pathological&#xD;
      diagnosis of craniopharyngioma in our hospital between January 2013 and February 2021 were&#xD;
      collected. Among these patients, 18 of them were recognized as craniopharyngioma with tumoral&#xD;
      hemorrhage during the operation.&#xD;

      For each case, age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, past history, symptoms, blood&#xD;
      pressure, blood cell count, blood biochemical tests, coagulation tests, hormone tests,&#xD;
      radiological results, surgical treatment and the outcome at discharge were collected. The&#xD;
      first test result after admission and before the operation was taken for the items of blood&#xD;
      tests with multiple times in the analysis.&#xD;
