  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung emphysema is often associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and&#xD;
      without any cure. Dyspnea is the main, debilitating symptom and is relieved by inhaled&#xD;
      bronchodilators and rehabilitation. However, a substantial number of patients continue to&#xD;
      suffer from dyspnea and among these, many patients have severely hyperinflated lungs due to&#xD;
      predominant emphysema. For selected patients, lung transplantation or lung volume reduction&#xD;
      by surgical removal (LVRS) of the most emphysematous parts of the lung can improve symptoms&#xD;
      and survival. However, LVRS is related to complications and not all patients are suitable for&#xD;
      surgery. An alternative to LVRS is bronchial lung volume reduction with endobronchial valves&#xD;
      (EBV). One-way valves are inserted in the bronchial system using a bronchoscope and it has&#xD;
      emerged as a valid treatment option with similar effects as LVRS with reduction of&#xD;
      hyperinflation and increasing pulmonary function, quality of life, and exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal lung is colonized with several types of bacteria, and together this is called the&#xD;
      microbiome. Some bacteria are potentially beneficial, while others are potentially harmful.&#xD;
      After the insertion EBV, some patients develop chronic infections. The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      microbiome can affect the risk of this chronic infection, and therefore the objective of this&#xD;
      study is to access the microbiome during the insertion of the EBV, and afterwards observe&#xD;
      which patients develop chronic infection and if these patients are harbouring specific types&#xD;
      of bacteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is primarily to investigate the significance of the lung&#xD;
      microbiome on the outcome and morbidity after EBV treatment. Second, to investigate the&#xD;
      evolution of the lung microbiome in patients later requiring valve removal or clean-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the insertion of the EBV, but during the procedure, the patient will undergo a&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). BAL fluid will undergo bacterial profiling through&#xD;
      S16-ribosomal analysis and ordinary bacterial culturing. Number of infections and need for&#xD;
      clean-up or valve removal will be registered during the following 24 months, where the&#xD;
      patient follows the ordinary follow-up programme. As a secondary part of the study, during&#xD;
      the potential clean-up or valve removal, the removed material will again undergo&#xD;
      S16-ribosomal analysis and bacterial culturing to investigate shift in microbiome.&#xD;
