    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial of a video decision aid in the Emergency Department setting&#xD;
      shown to patients followed by a brief advance care planning discussion and then relay that&#xD;
      discussion to the patient's primary care provider and/or admitting clinical team and look at&#xD;
      rates of advance care planning documentation in the electronic health record over time.&#xD;
      Primary outcome is advance care planning documentation in the EHR at 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>We will look at ACP documentation in the intervention and control arms to see if there are differential intervention effects based on race and ethnicity. We will look at the ACP documentation rate in Whites in both arms, and compare them to African Americans and Latinx populations. We will be able to see if the intervention had a greater or lesser effect on ACP rates in sub groups of our population by race and ethnicity.</description>
