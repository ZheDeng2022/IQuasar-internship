      Project Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent management training (PMT), which focuses on teaching parents about effective&#xD;
      discipline technique using a behavioral approach, has strong evidence base for promoting&#xD;
      parent-child relationship, and reducing parental stress and children behavioural problem.&#xD;
      Many PMTs, such as the Incredible Years and Triple P program, have been rated as&#xD;
      well-established interventions for behavior problems in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the application of mindfulness in the parenting context is emerging.&#xD;
      Parental mindfulness was found to have positive effects on parent-child relationship quality&#xD;
      and parenting stress. In particular, preliminary evidence of the eight-week mindfulness based&#xD;
      intervention for parents, the Mindful Parenting (MP) program was found to reduce parental&#xD;
      stress, and to decrease externalizing and internalizing problems in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two lines of parenting intervention have different theoretical background but they yield&#xD;
      similar positive effect in parents and children. The current study has the following&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the similarities and differences of PMT and MP in terms treatment outcome.&#xD;
           Outcome measures include parenting knowledge, parent's mindful awareness, parents'&#xD;
           emotional competence, positive and negative parenting practice, parental&#xD;
           stress,parent-child relationship, and parents' mental health, including parental stress,&#xD;
           parents' sense of competence, as well as child behavioural problem&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the underlying mechanisms for the effectiveness of PMT and MP, including&#xD;
           their similarities and differences, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine for whom are PMT and MP more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of treatment outcome, it is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1a) When compared to the waitlist control group, both PMT and MP programmes are similarly&#xD;
      effective in reducing negative parenting behaviours and behavioural problems in children,&#xD;
      promoting positive parenting behaviours, and enhancing parent-child relationship and parents'&#xD;
      mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1b) Looking into the different aspects of parenting behaviours, however, PMT has stronger&#xD;
      effects than the MP programme on increasing proactive parenting and the use of positive&#xD;
      reinforcement, and reducing lax control. By contrast, the MP programme has stronger effects&#xD;
      than the PMT on enhancing warmth and supportiveness and reducing parental hostility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of mechanisms of change, it is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2a) The PMT and MP programmes both have positive effects on parents' mental health by way of&#xD;
      improved parenting practices, and such effect is mediated by the reduction in child&#xD;
      behavioural problems and improvement in parent-child relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2b) The PMT and MP programmes are different in how they bring about improved parenting&#xD;
      practices. Parenting knowledge is the mediator between the PMT programme and improved&#xD;
      parenting practices, whereas parent's emotional competence is the mediator between MP&#xD;
      programme and improved parenting practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, in terms of the effectiveness for particular target participants, it is hypothesized&#xD;
      that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3) PMT is less effective for parents with low emotional competence whereas the MP programme&#xD;
      is more effective for parents with low emotional competence.&#xD;

      Parental Influence on Child Development&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not surprising that parents, who set the climate in the home environment, have large&#xD;
      impact on the behavioural and emotional development in children. Numerous studies have shown&#xD;
      that children of parents who are warm and responsive are more likely to experience optimal&#xD;
      child development outcomes. On the contrary, timid, permissive and reactive parenting is&#xD;
      found to be associated with emotional and behavioural difficulties in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent Management Training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the significant role that parents play, how to support parents become a matter of&#xD;
      concern. Parent Management Trainings (PMT) have been demonstrated to be an effective form of&#xD;
      parental support. Traditional PMTs are generally based on a behavioural approach, with a&#xD;
      primary focus on educating parents on effective behavioural management strategies so as to&#xD;
      induce changes in child behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past research has proven that PMT is particularly effective for addressing emotional and&#xD;
      behavioural difficulties in children. In a review of evidence-based treatment, PMT was found&#xD;
      to gain the strongest empirical support and yield the largest effect size among all other&#xD;
      treatment approaches for disruptive behaviours in children and adolescents. Programmes of&#xD;
      this type include the Incredible Years (IY) Parent Programme, and Positive Parenting&#xD;
      Programme (Triple P), which are both classified as 'Well-supported' programme in California&#xD;
      Evidence-based Clearinghouse (https://www.cebc4cw.org/) and proven to be clinically effective&#xD;
      and cost effective for training parents of children with significant behavioural problems.&#xD;
      Outcome evaluation of PMT suggests that PMT yields the following positive results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase in positive parenting behaviours, including more child-directed play, coaching&#xD;
           and praise and reduced use of criticism and negative commands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase in the use of effective limit-setting and replacing spanking and harsh&#xD;
           discipline with proactive discipline techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase in parental sense of competence and improve parent-child relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reduction in parental stress and child behavioural problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of Parent Management Training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the effectiveness of PMT is well documented, the underlying mechanism of change for&#xD;
      PMT is somewhat unclear. The effectiveness of PMT is likely accounted for by changes in&#xD;
      parenting skills and behaviours, and associated with changes in parental self-efficacy,&#xD;
      confidence, and attributions. Theoretically, it is assumed that parental behavioural change&#xD;
      is itself a product of the knowledge of effective parenting practices acquired during PMT.&#xD;
      For instance, knowledge of effective parenting strategies has been shown to be predictive of&#xD;
      parenting competence, parent psychopathology, and child behavioural problems in a&#xD;
      non-clinical sample. However, it could also be argued that while parents may understand what&#xD;
      they &quot;should&quot; and what they &quot;could&quot; do, this knowledge may not necessarily translate into&#xD;
      behaviour because of other factors, such as parental stress and parent's sense of competence.&#xD;
      Overall, there is relatively little research examining the mechanism underlying the&#xD;
      effectiveness of PMT and the role of parenting knowledge in these interventions. Further&#xD;
      research is needed to examine the limitations and processes through which parenting knowledge&#xD;
      may lead to the positive outcomes yielded by PMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of Parent Management Training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the well-documented benefits of PMT programme, it was found that parents' capacity to&#xD;
      regulate their own emotional arousal may influence the efficacy of the training. Others also&#xD;
      argued that parents' ability in managing negative emotions plays a prominent role in&#xD;
      parenting, but this is often not directly addressed in parent training programmes. Parent's&#xD;
      own emotional competence, which broadly encompasses the ability to become aware of,&#xD;
      recognize, accept, interpret, and respond constructively to one's own emotion, is central to&#xD;
      the effective use of parenting skills because it affects the parent's capacity to respond to&#xD;
      their child's behaviours in containing and sensitive ways, and reduces their hostile and&#xD;
      coercive reactions. Parents with poor emotional competence, even after they have been&#xD;
      equipped with effective parenting strategies, may have difficulty executing the strategies in&#xD;
      the heat of the moment. Some researchers also posited that in times of high affective&#xD;
      arousal, parents may have more difficulties in applying the newly acquired skills and&#xD;
      therefore return to use the less skillful approach to manage their children. Moreover,&#xD;
      anecdotal evidence of the author as a frontline service provider also confirms the above.&#xD;
      Participants in PMT groups often reported that they were more confident in being parents upon&#xD;
      programme completion because they had acquired effective parenting strategies. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      some participants indicated that whether or not they could apply what they have learnt&#xD;
      depends heavily on their ability to regulate their emotions. In other words, whether they&#xD;
      could stay calm in times of parent-child conflict is a key factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, there is a need to address parents' emotional processes in parental intervention and&#xD;
      improving parental emotion regulation could be one avenue to help more parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness and Parenting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness is 'the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the&#xD;
      present moment, and non-judgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment'. It can&#xD;
      improve one's attention, promote tolerance to unpleasant sensations, feelings and thoughts;&#xD;
      and can facilitate cognitive changes. It can also enhance the ability to cope with life&#xD;
      challenges, through relaxation and facing difficulties with openness, and better management&#xD;
      of caregiving duties. In the parenting context, high level of parental mindfulness is found&#xD;
      to be associated with lower levels of parental stress and negative parenting behaviours (i.e.&#xD;
      laxness, overreactivity, and verbosity) and increased adaptive parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the numerous research which indicated that the practice of mindfulness could enhance&#xD;
      resilience to emotional disturbances, and reduce emotional reactivity, mindfulness offers a&#xD;
      promising direction for improving parental emotional competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various researchers have proposed how mindfulness could be incorporated into the parenting&#xD;
      context. For instance, it was suggested that parents can use mindfulness techniques to listen&#xD;
      more openly to their children, develop emotional awareness, and better regulate their own&#xD;
      emotions before reacting. Others also stated that in times of intense conflict, the practice&#xD;
      of mindfulness could increase parents' parasympathetic tone so that they could be more&#xD;
      focused and remain calm. The calmer and more mindful state of the parents could then&#xD;
      facilitate parents to make wise choice in managing their children. Simply put, the practice&#xD;
      of mindfulness may help transform reactive parenting to responsive parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research that investigates the effectiveness of mindfulnesss-based parenting programme&#xD;
      yields positive results in general, supporting the utility of mindfulness in parenting. To&#xD;
      date, mindfulness-based parenting programmes are reported to be effective in various&#xD;
      populations, from parents of children with developmental delays, parents of children with&#xD;
      special needs, to parents of early adolescents. Treatment effects include reducing negative&#xD;
      mother-child interactions, decreasing mothers' emotional reactivity, and increasing parents'&#xD;
      awareness of own emotions. In a local study, parents reported reduction in parental stress&#xD;
      and depression, and improvement in emotion management after completion of a mindful parenting&#xD;
      prorgamme. In general, teaching mindfulness practices to parents was effective in reducing&#xD;
      child behavioural problems, enhancing parent-child relationship and enhances parents'&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mindful Parenting (MP) Program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature reveals that the 'Mindful Parenting' (MP) programme, developed by Prof Susan&#xD;
      Bögels in the Netherland, is one of the most extensively researched mindful parenting&#xD;
      training to date. It is a new application of mindfulness which aims to improve parenting by&#xD;
      improving the quality of parental attention, increasing awareness of parental stress,&#xD;
      reducing parental reactivity, and decreasing the intergenerational transmission of&#xD;
      dysfunctional parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MP programme is an eight-week mindfulness training for parents. It is an adaptation of&#xD;
      the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for depression, and the Mindfulness-Based&#xD;
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme. The programme retains the basic structure and mindfulness&#xD;
      practices of the MBCT and MBSR programs, but with a focus on the parenting context.&#xD;
      Components specific to MP programme include automatic pilot parenting, parental&#xD;
      self-compassion, and beginners mind parenting. Parents are also invited to apply mindfulness&#xD;
      to interactions with their children, other family members, and the everyday tasks associated&#xD;
      with parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research of the MP programme yields encouraging results. Parents who completed the programme&#xD;
      reported an increase in mindful parenting, a reduction in negative parenting behaviours&#xD;
      (including control, overreactivity, overprotection, and rejection), and an increase in&#xD;
      positive parenting behaviours (including autonomy granting behaviour. Benefits to parental&#xD;
      psychopathology and well-being include decreased stress and decreased internalizing and&#xD;
      externalizing problems. In addition, the programme also brings positive impact to child's&#xD;
      psychopathology, including decreased externalizing and internalizing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of the Mindful Parenting (MP) Programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the encouraging preliminary evidence of the MP programme, how exactly does Mindful&#xD;
      Parenting (MP) training work? What are the possible underlying mechanisms? There are six&#xD;
      mechanisms of change through which the MP programme may improve parenting. They include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reducing parental stress and reactivity under stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Helping parents to embrace experiences with openness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improving parents' executive functioning in stressful and impulsive situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recognizing and breaking cycle of intergenerational transmission of dysfunctional&#xD;
           parenting schemas and habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Promoting attention that can increase care and compassion of self and the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Improving marital functioning and co-parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence was found to support that the MP works through 1) reducing parental&#xD;
      stress and the assumed effect on parental reactivity and 2) improving marital functioning and&#xD;
      co-parenting. In a more recent study, it was found that the programme made improvement in the&#xD;
      area of parental stress, parenting, and co-parenting, but not on marital functioning. Putting&#xD;
      together the above research results, the first pathway (i.e., reducing parental stress and&#xD;
      the reactivity under stress) appeared to be the most strongly supported mechanism of change&#xD;
      in the MP programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The well documented positive impact of mindfulness-based interventions on emotion regulation&#xD;
      also supports this mechanism of change. With lowered emotion reactivity and improved&#xD;
      functioning in stressful and emotionally charged situations, parents will have an increased&#xD;
      capacity to tackle the parenting difficulties more skilfully, and thus reduce the use of&#xD;
      negative parenting practice. Overall, it is probable that MP works through enhancing parental&#xD;
      emotional competence, by reducing parent's reactivity and improving their functioning in&#xD;
      stressful situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Current Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described above, while there has been extensive research on the effectiveness and&#xD;
      development of PMT, the MP programme is relatively less explored. The two lines of approaches&#xD;
      are entirely different. For instance, while PMT primarily focuses on parent child interaction&#xD;
      processes, the MP programme primarily focuses on changing parent's own emotional processes.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, research evidence shows that the two lines of intervention yield similar&#xD;
      treatment effects. In particular, they are both effective in improving parent's mental health&#xD;
      (e.g., parental stress), reducing child behavioural problems, and improving parent-child&#xD;
      relationship. Questions arise. How are the two programmes similar and different from each&#xD;
      other in terms of treatment effects? What are the similarities and differences in their&#xD;
      mechanisms of change? For whom are PMT and the MP programme more effective, or is there a&#xD;
      difference?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are limited studies comparing the PMT and the MP programme. The current study&#xD;
      sets out to address the above research gaps. In short, the current study intends to 1)&#xD;
      explore the similarities and differences of PMT and the MP programme in terms of treatment&#xD;
      outcomes, 2) explore the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of PMT and the MP programme,&#xD;
      and 3) examine for whom PMT and the MP programme are more effective. The hypotheses in the&#xD;
      current study are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of treatment outcome, it is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1a. When compared to the waitlist-control group, both PMT and MP programmes are similarly&#xD;
      effective in reducing negative parenting behaviours and behavioural problems in children,&#xD;
      promoting positive parenting behaviours, and enhancing parent-child relationship and parents'&#xD;
      mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1b. Looking into the different aspects of parenting behaviours, however, PMT has stronger&#xD;
      effects than the MP programme on increasing proactive parenting and the use of positive&#xD;
      reinforcement, and reducing lax control. By contrast, the MP programme has stronger effects&#xD;
      than the PMT on enhancing warmth and supportiveness and reducing parental hostility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of mechanisms of change, it is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2a. The PMT and MP programmes both have positive effects on parents' mental health by way of&#xD;
      improved parenting practices, and such effect is mediated by the reduction in child&#xD;
      behavioural problems and improvement in parent-child relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2b. The PMT and MP programmes are different in how they bring about improved parenting&#xD;
      practices. Parenting knowledge is the mediator between the PMT programme and improved&#xD;
      parenting practices, whereas parent's emotional competence is the mediator between MP&#xD;
      programme and improved parenting practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, in terms of the effectiveness for particular target participants, it is hypothesized&#xD;
      that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. PMT is less effective for parents with low emotional competence whereas the MP programme&#xD;
      is more effective for parents with low emotional competence.&#xD;
