      This study investigates whether, compared to standard treatment, immediate restoration of&#xD;
      blood flow (revascularization) can reduce complications and improve diabetic foot ulcer&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In approximately 80% of diabetes-related lower extremity amputations, patients&#xD;
      suffer from a foot ulcer, often caused by lower extremity arterial disease. Due to lower&#xD;
      extremity arterial disease (LEAD), diabetic patients with foot ulcers often require lower&#xD;
      limb amputation. Achieving arterial supply (revascularization) to the ulcer is the most&#xD;
      important factor in healing the diabetic foot ulcer and reduces the risk of amputation. The&#xD;
      current standard of care recommends revascularization after six weeks in patients with&#xD;
      low-grade arterial disease of the lower extremities and nonhealing foot ulcer. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to demonstrate that in patients with low grade arterial disease of the lower&#xD;
      extremities and diabetic foot ulcers, immediate revascularization results in fewer&#xD;
      cardiovascular problems and amputations, as well as improved ulcer healing, compared to the&#xD;
      current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure: After inclusion in the study, participants will be randomized into the&#xD;
      control arm or the active arm. In the control arm standard wound care will be performed. In&#xD;
      the active arm, revascularization will be performed on top of standard wound care within 7&#xD;
      days after randomization. Post-revascularization analysis on ankle- and toe pressure,&#xD;
      laboratory analysis, and wound care team assessment and therapy will be performed 24 h post&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will be on 45, 90, 180 and 365 day for patients of both arms, where ankle- and toe&#xD;
      pressure, laboratory analysis, and wound care team assessment and therapy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants: 240 participants in total, 120 per treatment arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 4 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Centre(s): International multi-centre study with approximately 8-12 centres&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating countries: Switzerland, Germany&#xD;
