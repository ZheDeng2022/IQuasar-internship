  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item scale with seven items each for anxiety and depression subscales. Scoring for each item ranges from zero to three. A subscale score &gt;8 denotes anxiety or depression. Changes from the Baseline will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ) is a self-administered, 21-item disease-specific instrument for patients with heart failure. MLHFQ is an instrument which has been widely used to assess quality of life among heart failure patients. Each item is scored in a 6-point Likert Scale (0 to 5), thus the total score could range from 0 to 105, with higher scores indicating more significant impairment in health-related quality of life. The MLHFQ has two domains; physical domain (eight items, score range from 0 to 40) and emotional domain (five items, score range from 0 to 25). Changes from the Baseline will be measured</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Min walk test (Distance in meters)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, 6 Min Walk Distance (6 MWD) was used to measure Functional capacity. It is a sub maximal exercise test which can aid in assessing functional capacity of patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, in this test we find out the maximum distance in meters which an individual covers in 6 min without any support.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak VO2 with formula</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>A generalized equation can be used to determined Peak rate of oxygen consumption (peak VO2). The generalized equation can be used to accurately estimate mean peak VO2 from mean 6 MWD, among groups of patients with diverse diseases without the need for cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The equation is:&#xD;
Mean peak VO2(ml/kg/mins) = 4.948 + 0.023*Mean 6 MWD (meter) Changes From the Baseline will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate/Pulse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline, Pulse rate was measured per minute through pulse oximeter. Crossly it was measure by Chest belt (Polar Heart Rate monitors). Changes from the Baseline will be measure.</description>
