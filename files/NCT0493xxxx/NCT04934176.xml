    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who have undergone facial paralysis surgery will be asked to&#xD;
      participate. The goal of this study is to compare the facial disability and perception&#xD;
      outcomes of facial reanimation surgeries in patients with extensive and permanent, unilateral&#xD;
      paralysis using 3D analysis, and compare patient-centered outcomes of facial appearance,&#xD;
      well-being, and satisfaction using validated questionnaires. The focus point of this study&#xD;
      will be on outcomes of mid-facial reanimation surgeries in patients with more extensive and&#xD;
      permanent, unilateral, paralysis of varied etiology and presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are as follows. Specific Aim 1. To quantitatively determine&#xD;
      the surgical effects/impact on facial disability (facial impairment and disfigurement) among&#xD;
      four surgically treated groups of patients with unilateral facial paralysis who undergo free&#xD;
      gracilis muscle transfer driven by (1) a trigeminal nerve (nV) graft, (2) a crossface nerve&#xD;
      graft (nVII), (3) dual innervation comprising both nerves, and (4) midfacial modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will compare the changes in facial disability among the groups before and after&#xD;
           surgery, and the differences in facial disability between each surgery group and the&#xD;
           controls before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific Aim 2. To compare among the surgery groups the changes in self-perceptions of&#xD;
           facial appearance and well-being that occur due to facial reanimation surgery, and to&#xD;
           compare the surgery groups before and at 18 months to historical controls recruited&#xD;
           during the tenure of the R21 grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specific Aim 3. In patients with facial paralysis, to compare surgeons' current&#xD;
           qualitative assessment and 2D, quantitative assessment of facial impairment and&#xD;
           disfigurement with the objective, 3D, quantitative assessments in order to determine the&#xD;
           clinical utility of the 3D assessment approach as an outcome measure and relevance for&#xD;
           dissemination to the surgical community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This, prospective, observational study has two goals which are to determine outcomes of (1)&#xD;
      facial impairment and disfigurement, and (2) self-perceptions of facial appearance and&#xD;
      well-being in patients who undergo facial reanimation surgery to address unilateral,&#xD;
      mid-facial paralysis: one of the most frequent forms of paralysis. These goals are&#xD;
      represented by the three Specific Aims as previously stated. The study participants will be&#xD;
      patients unilateral with facial paralysis who are slated for facial muscle reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery using a free gracilis muscle transfer with one of four innervations: (1) Trigeminal&#xD;
      nerve (nV), (2) cross-face nerve graft (nVII), (3) dual using both the trigeminal nerve and a&#xD;
      cross-face nerve graft, and (4) midfacial modification. All patients will be recruited from a&#xD;
      single treatment Center, the Facial Nerve Center (FNC) at MEEI. Dr. Tessa Hadlock will be the&#xD;
      attending for all the patients and will perform the surgeries. The age range for the patients&#xD;
      will be 18 to 68 years. The patients will attend TUSDM, where Dr. Trotman maintains her&#xD;
      Facial Animation laboratory, for all testing and data collection. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed longitudinally and tested at three separate visits: At baseline immediately before&#xD;
      surgery, then at five and 18 months after surgery. The 18 month post-surgery testing time is&#xD;
      important to track changes related to the regenerative process.13 The specific data to be&#xD;
      obtained from each subject will include 3D static facial photographs, video data of different&#xD;
      facial animations, 3D objective facial movements/animations, and patient-centered&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess condition-specific and general QOL. Dr. Hadlock, the operating&#xD;
      surgeon, will be masked to the patients' pre-surgery and outcome data-this study does not&#xD;
      involve an Intervention. Patients who are potentially eligible for participation in the study&#xD;
      will be identified and recruited based on the selection criteria. Enrolled patients with&#xD;
      facial paralysis will continue to receive all other services routinely provided during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of subjects needed to complete study goal is 96 (n=24 per group). Up to 125&#xD;
      subjects will be screened in order to enroll and complete 96 subjects. All patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Facial Nerve Center at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed longitudinally and tested at three separate visits: prior to&#xD;
      surgery at MEEI (baseline visit), then at 5 and 18 months after surgery. The longitudinal&#xD;
      testing times concur with their recall visits during treatment and are important to track&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 study visits, each include the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The psychosocial tests will occur first (estimated 20 minutes): We will use three&#xD;
           psychosocial scales/questionnaires for this patient population to gauge patients'&#xD;
           perceptions of the impact of their paralysis and their recovery. The questionnaires will&#xD;
           be completed by the patients at baseline, and 18 months after surgery. Moreover, we also&#xD;
           will compare patient perceptions to the patient-related responses with clinical scoring&#xD;
           made by the surgeons using the eFACE,6 Face-Gram/Emotrics12 software, and the 3D dynamic&#xD;
           measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3D dynamic (objective) facial movement data will be collected next (estimated time 1&#xD;
           hour): The gold standard for tracking facial soft tissue movement (a Motion Analysis TM&#xD;
           system) to measure the facial movements of each patient according to the methods and&#xD;
           analyses of Trotman and co-workers. The system tracks retro-reflective markers secured&#xD;
           to specific facial soft tissue landmarks during facial animations. Ten replications of&#xD;
           each of 12 animations will be obtained to include brow raise, gentle eye closure, tight&#xD;
           eye closure, &quot;ee&quot; sound, &quot;oo&quot; sound, gentle smile, maximum smile, grimace, lip purse,&#xD;
           check puff, mouth opening, and natural smile. Non-landmark based data also will be&#xD;
           collected using a 3dMDdynamic Face Systemâ„¢.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Static 3D photographic data (estimated time 15 minutes): 3D static facial&#xD;
           images/photographs will be recorded for each patient using 3dMD Face System. The system&#xD;
           has four digital cameras to be used for the geometry reconstruction and two color&#xD;
           digital cameras for the texture overlay. The system uses a combination of white light&#xD;
           for the texture cameras and a random pattern projector for the geometry cameras. The&#xD;
           system has a field of view of 220 by 300 millimeters with a stated accuracy rating of&#xD;
           500 microns, and captures both 3-D surface data (x, y, z coordinates) and high&#xD;
           resolution (~ 2 megapixels) 2D image texture data (color overlay). The patient will be&#xD;
           seated comfortably in front of the camera and the camera adjusted to focus on the face.&#xD;
           In order to capture the subject in natural head position, the patient will focus on his&#xD;
           or her own image in a mirror placed at an appropriate distance. Two repetitions of each&#xD;
           position will be captured. The raw data from each of the 24 images per patient then will&#xD;
           be exported and stored for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Video data of the different facial animations (estimated time 15 minutes): A&#xD;
           standardized set of simultaneous frontal, and right and left video images of patients&#xD;
           will be recorded during each of the series of facial animations/movements. Three video&#xD;
           cameras positioned at right angles to each other will record images of each patient.&#xD;
           These images will be displayed on a split-screen color television and recorded using a&#xD;
           standard video-recorder. The images for patients will be compiled and saved for viewing.&#xD;
