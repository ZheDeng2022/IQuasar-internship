    <textblock>
      This study will investigate if a medication (metformin) widely used in the treatment of&#xD;
      diabetes could be re-purposed for the treatment of patients with a diagnosis of early stage&#xD;
      ADPKD to slow the growth of kidney cysts, thereby slowing the rate of kidney function&#xD;
      decline, reducing morbidity and mortality and improving the quality of life for ADPKD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) affects 12.5 million people worldwide&#xD;
      and is the 4th leading cause of kidney failure. Cyst growth begins in childhood, and over&#xD;
      decades leads to painful kidneys, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. ADPKD patients&#xD;
      also have a high prevalence of anxiety, depression and poor quality of life. Despite this&#xD;
      enormous burden, there is a lack of evidence for therapies and affordable, effective&#xD;
      treatment options. To date, only one disease modifying therapy is licensed for use in ADPKD&#xD;
      (tolvaptan), but it is limited by its restricted availability, side effects and high cost.&#xD;
      Metformin, an inexpensive and familiar drug, has been shown in previous studies to target&#xD;
      cyst-forming signals, thereby slowing the cyst growth rate. IMPEDE-PKD is an Australian-led&#xD;
      global Phase III randomised controlled trial to investigate the effect of metformin on ADPKD&#xD;
      disease progression. The study will recruit a total of 1,164 adult ADPKD patients from around&#xD;
      the world (250 from Australia). The outcomes of this research will identify effective and&#xD;
      targeted therapies for ADPKD that will slow kidney function decline, reduce the impact of the&#xD;
      illness and likelihood of death, and improve the quality of life for ADPKD patients and&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
