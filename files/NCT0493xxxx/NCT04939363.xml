  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Richter's syndrome (RS) is a life-threatening complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
      (CLL). It is associated with a switch in histopathology and biology, generally with a&#xD;
      transformation of the original CLL clone to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The&#xD;
      development of RS is accompanied by the onset of B symptoms, rapid growth of lymphadenopathy,&#xD;
      extra-nodal disease, significant elevations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and associated&#xD;
      multi-organ dysfunction from invasive or obstructive processes RS occurs in 2-10% of CLL&#xD;
      patients with an incidence rate of 0.5% per year. The molecular pathogenesis of RS involves&#xD;
      inactivation of the tumor protein p53 (TP53) tumor suppressor gene in 50-60% of cases and&#xD;
      activating aberrations of NOTCH1 and myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC) in about 30% of cases. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      These distinct molecular footprints of RS are chemoresistance leading to an aggressive&#xD;
      clinical course with low response rates and poor outcomes.Taking into consideration that in&#xD;
      addition to the underlying aggressive disease, most RS patients are often at an advanced age&#xD;
      and suffer from numerous other comorbidities. Additionally, intensive chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      are highly toxic to this population group and lead to excessive treatment-related morbidity.&#xD;
      Enrolling DLBCL-RS patients in clinical trials is therefore justifiable, particularly those&#xD;
      with RS that is clonally related to the predisposed underlining CLL disease. Due to the poor&#xD;
      activity of immunochemotherapy, the possibility of using novel agents in the treatment of RS&#xD;
      is of great interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The toxicity and the efficacy of the combination of cluster of anti differentiation antigen&#xD;
      20 (anti-CD20) antibody (e.g. Obinutuzumab or Rituximab) with Ibrutinib and/or Venetoclax&#xD;
      have been already reported in both relapsed and naïve patients with CLL. The use of these&#xD;
      three agents in combination is highly active in CLL and has manageable side effects. In&#xD;
      addition, recent reports showed that treatment with Ibrutinib or Venetoclax as a single drug&#xD;
      are active in RS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein the investigators propose a phase 2, open-label, non-randomized, single arm,&#xD;
      multi-center study aiming to assess the safety and efficacy with the combination of&#xD;
      Ibrutinib, Venetoclax and Obinutuzumab in patients with RS&#xD;

      Richter's syndrome (RS) is a life-threatening complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
      (CLL). It is associated with a switch in histopathology and biology, generally with a&#xD;
      transformation of the original CLL clone to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The&#xD;
      development of RS is accompanied by the onset of B symptoms, rapid growth of lymphadenopathy,&#xD;
      extra-nodal disease, significant elevations of LDH, and associated multi-organ dysfunction&#xD;
      from invasive or obstructive processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has increased general knowledge on the distinct evolutionary patterns of RS&#xD;
      and provided a deeper understanding of the risk factors and molecular events predisposing to&#xD;
      transformation. However, currently there're main few targetable aberrations and treatment is&#xD;
      largely ineffective with a dismal prognosis leaving these patients with a high unmet medical&#xD;
      need for better treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RS occurs in 2-10% of CLL patients with an incidence rate of 0.5% per year. The molecular&#xD;
      pathogenesis of RS involves inactivation of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene in 50-60% of cases&#xD;
      and activating aberrations of NOTCH1 and MYC in about 30% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These distinct molecular footprints of RS are chemoresistance leading to an aggressive&#xD;
      clinical course with low response rates and poor outcomes. Patients with RS are usually&#xD;
      excluded from clinical trials and there is no established standard of care in the treatment&#xD;
      of RS today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of chemotherapy regimens have been evaluated in the treatment of DLBCL-RS resulting&#xD;
      in overall responses ranging between 40%-60% which are short lived with disappointing&#xD;
      Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) ranging between 3 - 10 and 6 - 21&#xD;
      months, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Israel the current treatment strategy used for newly diagnosed DLBCL-RS is an&#xD;
      anthracycline-based regimen, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and&#xD;
      prednisone (R-CHOP). This treatment regimen has shown poor efficacy in a cohort study of 15&#xD;
      DLBCL-RS patients prospectively evaluated by a German CLL study group trial. The ORR was 67%&#xD;
      with only 7% Complete Response (CR). The median PFS and median OS were 10 and 21 months,&#xD;
      respectively in these patients. In terms of the safety profile of R-CHOP for patients with&#xD;
      DLBCL-RS or CLL patients, 15 of the 60 (25%) patients enrolled in this study had therapy&#xD;
      discontinued earlier than planned because of the treatment-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into consideration that in addition to the underlying aggressive disease, most RS&#xD;
      patients are often at an advanced age and suffer from numerous other comorbidities, therefore&#xD;
      only 10%-15% of patient scan undergo the potentially curative allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem&#xD;
      Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Additionally, intensive chemotherapy regimens are highly toxic&#xD;
      to this population group and lead to excessive treatment-related morbidity. Enrolling&#xD;
      DLBCL-RS patients in clinical trials is therefore justifiable, particularly those with RS&#xD;
      that is clonally related to the predisposed underlining CLL disease. Due to the poor activity&#xD;
      of immunochemotherapy, the possibility of using novel agents in the treatment of RS is of&#xD;
      great interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The toxicity and the efficacy of the combination of anti-CD20 antibody (e.g. Obinutuzumab or&#xD;
      Rituximab) with Ibrutinib and/or Venetoclax have been already reported in both relapsed and&#xD;
      naïve patients with CLL. The use of these three agents in combination is highly active in CLL&#xD;
      and has manageable side effects. In addition, recent reports showed that treatment with&#xD;
