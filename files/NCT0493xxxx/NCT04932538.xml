      BACKGROUND: Walking and balance problems are among the most common problems in individuals&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy (CP). Hip abduction and extension muscle function insufficiencies are&#xD;
      common in children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the immediate and long-term effects of&#xD;
      Kinesio® Taping (KT) applied on the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles on walking,&#xD;
      functionality, balance, and participation in children with unilateral spastic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The study included 20&#xD;
      children with unilateral spastic CP: 11 in the taping group and 9 in the control group. KT&#xD;
      was applied in the taping group for 4 weeks in addition to a physiotherapy program. The&#xD;
      control group received only the physiotherapy program. Body structure and functions were&#xD;
      evaluated with the Pediatric Berg Balance Scale (PBBS). Activity was evaluated with the Timed&#xD;
      Up and Go Test (TUG), Functional Mobility Scale (FMS), Gross Motor Function Scale (GMFM-88),&#xD;
      the BTS G-Walk Spatiotemporal Gait Analysis System. Participation was evaluated with the&#xD;
      Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). Evaluations were made at the beginning of&#xD;
      the study and 30 minutes after the first tape application, and at the end of 4 weeks in the&#xD;
      taping group. The level of significance was accepted as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Walking and balance problems are frequently seen in individuals with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy (CP). In individuals with CP, co-contraction of the distal and proximal muscles&#xD;
      increase and muscle activation patterns are not fluent. Spasticity causes a decrease in&#xD;
      muscle strength and length and a reduction in muscular coordination. Secondary to all this,&#xD;
      decreases are seen in the energy production of the muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insufficiencies in hip abduction and extension muscle function are common in CP. Excessive&#xD;
      muscles tonus in the hip adductors and flexors and a loss of reciprocal inhibition cause a&#xD;
      weakness in the gluteus medius and maximus. This weakness negatively affects the movement&#xD;
      patterns of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and hip region, and also causes incorrect loadings in&#xD;
      hip joint and abnormalities in hip biomechanics. Gait anomalies occur and pelvis&#xD;
      stabilization is impaired. In particular, negative impacts on participation are a concern.&#xD;
      With the physiotherapy and rehabilitation approaches, these negative effects may be minimized&#xD;
      by facilitating the gluteal muscles. Gait training and exercises to strengthen the gluteal&#xD;
      muscles are routinely used in the rehabilitation of CP. With these approaches, it is aimed to&#xD;
      maximize the gait function and promote independence and participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The somatosensory system may be affected in unilateral spastic CP. These children often&#xD;
      suffer sensory impairments that could affect the development of future motor skills. Kinesio&#xD;
      Taping® (KT) is used for pediatric rehabilitation to reduce pain, facilitate or inhibit&#xD;
      muscle activity, prevent injuries, reposition joints, aid the lymphatic system, support&#xD;
      postural alignment, and improve proprioception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yasukawa et al. stated that the use of KT for children with CP might influence the cutaneous&#xD;
      receptors of the sensory motor system, resulting in an improvement in voluntary control and&#xD;
      coordination via a physiotherapy program. Therefore, facilitating the gluteal muscles by KT&#xD;
      may affect walking and balance positively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, the clinical use of KT techniques in children with CP is generally at the&#xD;
      upper extremity. In studies in which KT is applied to the lower extremity, it is generally&#xD;
      applied to the distal part of extremity. In addition, most of the studies have investigated&#xD;
      the immediate effect. There are few studies investigating the effects of KT applied to the&#xD;
      gluteus medius and gluteus maximus muscles, which are located in the proximal hip with&#xD;
      important contributions in stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the immediate and long-term effects of KT applied to&#xD;
      the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles on walking, functionality, balance, and&#xD;
      participation in children with unilateral spastic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS The permission of the University Ethics Committee was received&#xD;
      (91610558-302.08.01) and written informed consent was obtained from each participant and/or&#xD;
      guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were: having unilateral spastic CP; being in an age between 6 years&#xD;
      and 12 years; being classified in levels I or II of the Gross Motor Function Classification&#xD;
      System (GMFCS); having spasticity at lower extremity 2 or less according to Modified Ashworth&#xD;
      Scale, and being able to follow and accept verbal instructions. The exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      having any orthopedic surgery or botulinum toxin injection in the past 6 months and having&#xD;
      allergic reactions to the adhesive compound of KT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. Twenty children (10 girls, 10 boys)&#xD;
      were included in the study. The children were divided into two randomized groups using a&#xD;
      computer program. Of the 20 participants, 11 were randomized to the taping group and 9 to the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements In the taping group, measurements were made at the beginning of the study, 30&#xD;
      minutes after the first tape was applied, and at the end of the 4th week. In the control&#xD;
      group, measurements were made at the beginning of the study and at the end of the 4th week.&#xD;
      The BTS G-Walk Spatiotemporal Gait Analysis System was administered by the third author (S.&#xD;
      Ö.). All other measurements were administered by the same physiotherapist (S. N. K.). Gross&#xD;
      motor function was classified using the GMFCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Structures and Functions Body composition was evaluated by body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      calculated with the following formula: weight in kilograms divided by the square of the&#xD;
      height in meters. Balance was evaluated with the Pediatric Berg Balance Scale (PBBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity functioning Functionality was assessed using the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and the&#xD;
      Functional Mobility Scale (FMS). The TUG measures various components such as walking speed,&#xD;
      postural control, functional mobility, and balance . The walking ability of the participants&#xD;
      was evaluated with the Functional Mobility Scale at 3 different distances (5 meters-indoor,&#xD;
      50 meters-school, 500 meters-community). Inter-observer reliability of the FMS, which can&#xD;
      reveal changes that cannot be detected with the GMFCS, was also demonstrated. Gross motor&#xD;
      function was assessed using dimensions D and E of the Gross Motor Function Measurement&#xD;
      (GMFM), which consists of standing, walking, running, and jumping. The GMFM is a valid,&#xD;
      reliable, and sensitive method, which demonstrates the change in motor functions in children&#xD;
      with CP and other disabilities via videotape recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait parameters were assessed using the BTS G-Walk Spatiotemporal Gait Analysis System. In&#xD;
      this system, the analysis results of the sensor attached to the L5-S1 level of the patient&#xD;
      was transferred to a computer via Bluetooth. This system allows gait analysis by comparing&#xD;
      the left and right extremities with normal values, and it also enables a 3-dimensional&#xD;
      kinematic analysis of the pelvis. The track length was preset as 10 meters. The children with&#xD;
      CP were asked to walk the 10-meter track three times. Three measurements were averaged in the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation Participation was assessed using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure&#xD;
      (COPM). The COPM is a client-centered outcome measure to identify and prioritize everyday&#xD;
      issues that restrict individuals' participation in everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every group received routine traditional physiotherapy twice a week over the period of 4&#xD;
      weeks. This routine traditional treatment consisted of stretching, weight bearing, functional&#xD;
      reaching, walking, and electrotherapy. Sessions were 40 minutes. The children in the taping&#xD;
      group were taped 6 days per week for 4 weeks. The children were checked for allergies before&#xD;
      applying the tape. A 5-cm tape was applied and kept in position for 3 days, and the region&#xD;
      was then left to rest for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KT was applied to the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles. The KT muscle facilitation&#xD;
      technique was used to support and facilitate the function of the muscles. For the gluteus&#xD;
      maximus, a &quot;Y&quot; tape was used. The child was placed in a side lying position and the beginning&#xD;
      of the tape was applied to the origin of the muscle (center of the sacrum). The leg flexed&#xD;
      and adducted, and the first tail was applied to enclose the lower part of the gluteus maximus&#xD;
      muscle. The second tail was applied diagonally from the sacrum to the greater trochanter. For&#xD;
      the gluteus medius muscle, 2 &quot;I&quot; tapes were applied. The first tape was applied from the&#xD;
      spina iliaca anterior superior to the greater trochanter, the second tape was applied from&#xD;
      the spina iliaca posterior superior to the greater trochanter. During the applications, the&#xD;
      hip was adducted and extended, and all tape ends were applied without tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Post-hoc power analysis was performed when 20 participants (11 in the&#xD;
      taping group, 9 in the control group) were enrolled in our study. Power analysis was&#xD;
      conducted using G*Power (version 3.0.10 Universitat Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany) to&#xD;
      compare pairs of independent sample means. In the post-hoc power analysis, when the&#xD;
      statistical significance of alpha was 5% and the confidence interval was 95%, the power of&#xD;
      the study (1-β) was found to be 99%. The study was completed by deciding that a sufficient&#xD;
      sample size was reached. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26&#xD;
      was used to analyze the obtained data. The level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
      One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Tests were used to evaluate distribution of variables before&#xD;
      test selection. Descriptive analyses are presented using medians and the interquartile ranges&#xD;
      for the non-normally distributed and ordinal variables. In the comparison of two independent&#xD;
      nominal variables, while the Chi-Square Test was used, the Fisher Test was preferred&#xD;
      according to the expected values in the table cells. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to&#xD;
      compare non-normally distributed ordinal data in independent groups. The Wilcoxon Signed&#xD;
      Ranks Test or the Friedman was used in dependent groups. The Student's t-test was used to&#xD;
      compare normally distributed numerical data. Repeated Measures Anova was used to compare&#xD;
      normally distributed numerical data in more than two dependent groups. Groups were compared&#xD;
      with each other using the paired T test.&#xD;
