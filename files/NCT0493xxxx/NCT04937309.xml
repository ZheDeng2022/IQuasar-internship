  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite pharmaceutical innovations, chemotherapy induced nausea is frequent and largely&#xD;
      participating to alter our patients quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non invasive vagal stimulation is approved in other health issues, for example in headache or&#xD;
      gastroparesis, with a reported benefit on nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to analyse if a non invasive vagal stimulation could better prevent&#xD;
      chemotherapy induced nausea, in addition to standard treatment, in breast cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with cyclophosphamide and anthracycline.&#xD;
