      This study will compare two available, evidence-based, digital pain treatment programs that&#xD;
      patients can use at home. The goal is to see if one approach is better than the other, and&#xD;
      whether certain patients respond to one more than the other. Study participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive one of two treatment programs: Skills-Based VR or painTRAINER. Study&#xD;
      devices will be delivered to the participant's home with instructions for use via FedEx;&#xD;
      participants will receive remote technical support. They will be followed for 60 days and&#xD;
      complete Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) questionnaires to assess functional status, pain&#xD;
      levels, and use of pain medications (including opioids). Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      provide consent/authorization to access medical records from their treating facility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. For people from the rural&#xD;
      America with chronic diseases, particularly those who experience pain, the pandemic can not&#xD;
      only worsen pain, but also it can trigger anxiety,depression, trouble sleeping, and substance&#xD;
      use. This psychological distress is exacerbated by physical and social isolation, fear of&#xD;
      seeking in-person visits, and diminished ability to access clinical care during the&#xD;
      pandemic.One way doctors and health systems are reaching out is by video visits, where&#xD;
      patients and their providers communicate online via the Internet. However, video visits still&#xD;
      have limits. Therefore, we can help support them with other techniques.Beyond video visits,&#xD;
      there are home-based programs that patients can administer themselves to help manage their&#xD;
      pain. These proven programs can overcome staffing shortfalls, be used across long distance to&#xD;
      reach anyone in the world and can be used at the time and place of the patients' choosing.In&#xD;
      this study, we will compare two available, evidence-based, digital treatment programs that&#xD;
      patients can use at home. The goal is to see if one approach is better than the other,and&#xD;
      whether certain patients respond to one more than the other.The first program is an app that&#xD;
      can run on any smartphone or computer. The program offers an 8-week, at-home curriculum to&#xD;
      learn and practice new skills that can help manage pain. The program runs on a standard&#xD;
      screen on your phone or computer.The second program is also a proven, 8-week program, but it&#xD;
      uses a technology called virtual reality,or VR. VR involves wearing specialized goggles that&#xD;
      create a sensation of being in a 3D world. Evidence shows that virtual worlds can help people&#xD;
      learn and retain new skills that help reduce pain.The study will recruit 300 people from&#xD;
      rural communities in California, Louisiana, and Alabama and randomize them into either the 2D&#xD;
      or 3D programs. We will then follow patients for 8 weeks days and measure their pain levels.&#xD;
      We will also measure signs of distress, including Coronavirus-related anxiety, along with&#xD;
      measuring medications used for pain, such as opioids, and the impact of pain on overall&#xD;
      quality of life. To conduct the study, we will ask patients to periodically complete short&#xD;
      surveys online and allow permission for the research team to collect information from the&#xD;
      electronic health record. We developed this study working with patient partners from the&#xD;
      American Chronic Pain Association (ACPA), and they will be part of the research team&#xD;
      throughout the conduct, analysis, and reporting of the study. The results will help patients,&#xD;
      doctors,and health system decide how best to administer home-based, patient-administered,&#xD;
      digital treatment programs for pain, and will offer recommendation on how to select the right&#xD;
      treatment for the right patient.&#xD;

    <measure>Daily Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the 60 days from the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The change from study baseline to Week 8 in monthly pain intensity as measured by the standard 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) scale is the primary endpoint (0-10, where 0 means no pain and 10 means the worst pain imaginable). We will measure daily pain NRS for 7-days during baseline week 0, and again during the final week of the study (week 8).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Coronavirus Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the 60 days from the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The change from study baseline to Week 8 in coronavirus anxiety as measured by the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) is a secondary endpoint (0-20, higher the worse). It is a recently developed 5-item scale designed to measure anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis. Originally validated in a cohort of 775 adults with pandemic-related anxiety, the CAS has evidence for both reliably and validity and discriminates between those with vs. without anxiety based on criterion anchors. The scale is rendered using a T-statistic, where a score of 50 represents the population mean and 10 points is a standard deviation (SD). Scoring of the instrument will occur in a SAS/STATA environment in which study statisticians are blinded to the study arm.</description>

    <description>Participants will use the Pico G2 4K VR audio and visual head-mounted device. The Pico G2 4K is a standalone VR headset that comes with an orientation-tracked controller. It does not require a smartphone or personal computer to operate. The device supports 3 degrees of freedom (3DOF) head tracking, has best-in-class optics, and a wide field-of-view.</description>

    <description>PainTRAINER is among the most widely validated mHealth interventions for pain management.18-25 Originally developed by members of our team at Duke and Northwestern University under NIH funding, the app teaches evidence-based pain coping skills using a self-administered, home-based software program. The system delivers eight sessions via any web-connected platform, including Android or iOS smartphones, tablets, or personal computers. The digital curriculum covers progressive muscle relaxation, activity/rest cycling, pleasant activity scheduling, recognizing negative automatic thoughts, pleasant imagery/distraction, problem solving, and monitoring for maintenance. Patients complete one session per week in a pre-determined order. The program can be completed in a flexible manner to accommodate life and medical events.</description>

    <description>Prior research has shown that daily use of VR for 10 to 15 minutes is effective in managing pain, plus use as needed for breakthrough flares of pain. The skills-based VR therapy program, EaseVRx, is a standardized 56-day program consisting of scheduled daily virtual experiences. Each VR treatment experience lasts between 2-16 minutes, with an average duration of 6 minutes. To minimize the risk of cybersickness, participants are instructed to complete one VR treatment experience at a time. Given the low-risk nature of VR, they also may repeat experiences such as relaxation, breathing exercises, and games at other times during the day, in response to their pain. After the 56-day program is completed, participants in this arm are instructed to continue daily use, choosing from among the treatment experiences.</description>
