  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of 2020, a major pandemic due to the new emerging coronavirus&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading around the world. Today, the hope to contain this pandemic&#xD;
      lies in the development and use of vaccines directed against this virus. Different strategies&#xD;
      aim to maximize the early impact of vaccination in a context where few doses are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In early January 2021, large-scale vaccination began in France, first for populations at risk&#xD;
      of severe COVID-19, but also for healthcare workers over 50 years of age or with an&#xD;
      underlying pathology, and then for all voluntary healthcare workers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The question of vaccination of patients with a history of recent or late SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      has rapidly become a major issue. Currently, French recommendations call for a single dose in&#xD;
      the cohort that has been cured of COVID-19 for six months. In addition, the use of&#xD;
      anti-SARS-Cov2 serology may be of interest because the presence of antibodies indicates&#xD;
      recent or past contact with SARS-CoV-2. However, serological testing is not included in the&#xD;
      vaccination decision strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the investigators is to provide data on the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      vaccines in a real-world setting to support this choice. Given the absence of recommendations&#xD;
      concerning the realization of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology, it will be proposed to all the&#xD;
      nursing staff of the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint Joseph at the time of their vaccination,&#xD;
      a serological screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the dynamics of antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      Spike protein after the first and second dose of vaccine (conventional prime-boost strategy&#xD;
      recommended) in healthcare workers with or without a history of COVID-19.&#xD;
