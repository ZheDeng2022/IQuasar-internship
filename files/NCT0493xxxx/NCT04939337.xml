      The purpose of this study is to asses the efficacy and Safety of Allogeneic Umbilical&#xD;
      Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Complex Perianal Fistula in Perianal&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn´s disease (CD) can affect any part of the digestive system and symptoms of this chronic&#xD;
      illness include abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. CD also causes bowel&#xD;
      wall ulcers, strictures and fistulas (abnormal passages from the intestines to another organ&#xD;
      or the skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an unmet need for effective medical therapy in CD patients with perianal fistulas,&#xD;
      not responding to the conventional strategies, including biological therapies. The current&#xD;
      study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord-derived&#xD;
      Mesenchymal Stem cells from healthy donors for the treatment of perianal fistulas in patients&#xD;
      presenting CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To assess the safety (incidence of treatment emergent adverse-events) of&#xD;
      TH-SC01&#xD;

    <description>Combined remission is defined as the closure of all treated external openings that were draining at baseline despite gentle finger compression, and absence of abscess(es) &gt;2 cm (in at least 2 dimensions) of the treated perianal fistula(s) confirmed by central magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment or transrectal ultrasonography(TRUS)</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as closure of at least 50% of all treated external openings that were draining at baseline despite gentle finger compression.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who decrease in PDAI</measure>
    <time_frame>0、4、8、16、24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PDAI is a scoring system for assessing the severity of perianal lesions associated with Crohn's disease.It consists of the following five items :(a) perianal secretions;(b) Pain and movement;(c) Sexual life;(d) Perianal manifestations;(e) Sclerosing.Each item is rated on a five-point scale from asymptomatic (0) to severe (4), with an overall score of 0 to 20.The higher the score, the more severe the disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who decrease in IBDQ</measure>
    <time_frame>0、4、8、16、24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IBDQ questionnaire score is used to investigate the quality of life of patients. There are 32 questions in total, and each question has 1 to 7 answers of different degrees, with 1 representing the most severe degree and 7 representing the least severe degree</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who decrease in VAS scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0、4、8、16、24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VAS scale was used to evaluate the pain. 0 points indicated no pain, less than 3 points indicated mild pain, 4-6 points indicated pain affecting sleep but tolerable, 7-10 points indicated pain and discomfort, affecting appetite and sleep. The higher number, the pain was more obvious.</description>
