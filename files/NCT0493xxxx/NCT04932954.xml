      This is a hospital-based retrospective cohort study and the Immunohematologic characteristics&#xD;
      of COVID-19 patients will be investigated systematically. In this study, we will seek to&#xD;
      understand the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and blood groups and explore the&#xD;
      Anti-A and Anti-B effects in COVID-19 patients with graded severity. We will analyze the&#xD;
      transfusion requirement and the clinical recurrences of COVID-19 patients. The discrepancy of&#xD;
      blood group phenotypes in COVID-19 patients with graded severity will be also analyzed on the&#xD;
      molecular level. This retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic health&#xD;
      recording data in Tongji Hospital. The clinical characteristics for all eligible patients&#xD;
      will be retrieved. The records will be verified to avoid possible bias. Data collection was&#xD;
      carried out independently by two investigators and reviewed by two different investigators.&#xD;
