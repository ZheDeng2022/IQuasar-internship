  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occlusal splints are employed in the treatment of sleep bruxism. These appliances decrease&#xD;
      sleep-related actions and damages bruxism, like grinding, tooth-wear, headache, and&#xD;
      temporomandibular joint disorders. Occlusal splints are produced both in hard and soft forms&#xD;
      according to the used material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of occlusal splint type on the sleep&#xD;
      quality parameters of patients with sleep bruxism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various splint designs have been used for the treatment of sleep bruxism that is made up of&#xD;
      different materials: Hard and soft splints. Although, these splints have slightly different&#xD;
      appearances and properties, in fact, scientific evidence supports both the use of hard and&#xD;
      soft occlusal splints. Hard splints are more preferred when compared to soft ones, thus, oft&#xD;
      appliances have been less documented in the scientific literature. However, some studies&#xD;
      suggested the use of soft-resin splints that are easily fabricated and may be inserted at an&#xD;
      initial appointment, dental clinicians may desire the use of soft appliances. One of the&#xD;
      advantages of these appliances is they are easy to tolerable to the patient and comfortable.&#xD;
      Additionally, these splints fit tightly and provide a flat plane during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering these advantages, the present study designed to examine the effect of the use of&#xD;
      different types of occlusal splints on the sleep quality of patients with sleep bruxism. For&#xD;
      this purpose, the effect of two splints basically fabricated from two different materials&#xD;
      were evaluated and compared. The null hypothesis was that the use of both occlusal splints&#xD;
      would change the values of sleep quality of the patients with sleep bruxism.&#xD;
