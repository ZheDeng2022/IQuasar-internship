    <textblock>
      -  Improving patient comfort and implementing the protocols required to minimize the risk&#xD;
           of RAO must be part of quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several procedural parameters are related to the risk of RAO but hemostasis is a&#xD;
           critical period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite the fact that non-occlusive hemostasis of the radial artery is a recognized and&#xD;
           effective technique for reducing the risk of RAO, it is rarely practiced because it is&#xD;
           tedious, involves additional care and is not always effective with current hemostasis&#xD;
           systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylactic compression of the cubital artery during radial artery hemostasis has been&#xD;
           shown to be effective in maintaining non-occlusive hemostasis but requires 2 devices and&#xD;
           does not simplify care procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Terry2™ band is a new dual device that offers effortless non-occlusive radial&#xD;
           hemostasis and does not require repeated intervention by nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this observational study are to demonstrate the benefits, safety&#xD;
      and impact on care of using Terry2™ band in patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional&#xD;
      catheterization by radial (or ulnar) approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radial Artery Occlusion (RAO) is the most common peri-procedural complication after a&#xD;
      trans-radial catheterization,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although usually asymptomatic, RAO may prevent the use of radial artery access in future&#xD;
      catheterization should the patient need one; the use And the artery cannot be used as an&#xD;
      alternate graft in case the patient is referred for aorto-coronary bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data has demonstrated a clinical benefit for the use of radial artery over a venous&#xD;
      graft for patients requiring artery bypass grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current international recommendations suggest limiting the risk of RAO to less than 5% upon&#xD;
      discharge from hospital. To do this a change of method, ie performing a non-occlusive&#xD;
      hemostasis of the radial artery is the most effective method to limit the risk of RAO.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this method takes time and requires repeated interventions by nurses, which&#xD;
      has limited its application worldwide. In addition, simple hemostasis systems (on radial&#xD;
      artery alone) can only achieve non-occlusive hemostasis in 60-75% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, it has been shown that by applying simultaneous pressure to the two&#xD;
      arteries of the wrist (the radial artery and the cubital artery), one could obtain a&#xD;
      non-occlusive hemostasis of the radial artery in more than 95% of cases and the level of RAO&#xD;
      was reduced &lt; 2%. However, the handling of 2 separate hemostasis systems again requires&#xD;
      repeated intervention by the nursing staff and therefore burdens the monitoring procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device Terry2™ band applies simultaneous differential compression to the radial artery&#xD;
      and the cubital artery. Its mechanism of action aims to accelerate the time of hemostasis,&#xD;
      reduce nursing work, improve patient comfort and minimize the risk of radial artery occlusion&#xD;
      during and after hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Terry2™ band provides fast and safe non-occlusive radial hemostasis that limits the&#xD;
           risk of RAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Terry2™ band is associated with increased patient comfort, reduced staff work and a&#xD;
           minimized risk of RAO after radial catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the radial approach procedure, patients will have a Terry2 band installed™&#xD;
      according to the instructions for use. Staff will be trained on the use of the device by&#xD;
      means of an educational video. Once the device is installed, a check for the presence of&#xD;
      non-occlusive hemostasis will be done before the patient has returned to their room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the hemostasis is completed, the permeability of the radial artery is again checked by&#xD;
      pulse oximetry. In case of doubt about the permeability of the instrumented artery, it is&#xD;
      recommended to validate with an ultrasound-doppler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of RAO and other access site complications, total nursing time involved and patient&#xD;
      comfort will be evaluated.&#xD;
