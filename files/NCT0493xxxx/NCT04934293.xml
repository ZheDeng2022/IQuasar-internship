  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a young patient, the conditions of proton therapy treatment can be stressful. Adjusting&#xD;
      the environment can be a source of avoiding this physical and psychological discomfort&#xD;
      impacting the quality of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fixed, long, uncomfortable position is the main cause of stress, already present due to the&#xD;
      cancerous therapeutic course. It extends the positioning time. For the patient and the&#xD;
      optimization of his treatment, solutions must be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relaxation in virtual reality is efficient, simple and non-medicinal and could reduce stress&#xD;
      in children and allow irradiation in very good conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess the effectiveness of the virtual reality session using objective (placement&#xD;
      time, helmet tolerance) and subjective (perceived anxiety via a dedicated questionnaire)&#xD;
      criteria. This is the first pediatric virtual reality study, supported by the French Group of&#xD;
      Pediatric Radiotherapists, to reduce anxiety in radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple benefits from this pilot study are expected, such as improved reception conditions,&#xD;
      treatment parameters and better acceptance of proton therapy sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of certain pediatric cancers requires irradiation. These treatments are&#xD;
      stressful in children because it is necessary to keep a fixed position that is often&#xD;
      uncomfortable. The more the stress increases, the longer the positioning, which again&#xD;
      generates stress making the treatment position more and more uncomfortable. This irradiation&#xD;
      can be carried out by various conventional techniques, tomotherapy, proton therapy. In all&#xD;
      cases, the precise positioning, essential for the successful completion of the treatment,&#xD;
      under the treatment machine is an iterative process, requiring long and tedious checks. This&#xD;
      positioning step on the treatment table takes about 15 minutes, but depending on the&#xD;
      technical difficulty can be extended up to 45 minutes in the most complex cases and depending&#xD;
      on the patient's apprehension. This positioning is then checked by placement verification&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Antoine LACASSAGNE Center, the investigators have a new generation proton therapy&#xD;
      device. This device allows radiotherapy doses to be delivered extremely precisely, subject to&#xD;
      very rigorous positioning, and is therefore particularly suitable for pediatric treatment by&#xD;
      protecting organs near the radiation. In addition, proton therapy requires longer sessions&#xD;
      than conventional radiotherapy; which generates even more anxiety for the children for whom&#xD;
      it is the treatment of choice. Non-drug solutions to reduce this stress are therefore&#xD;
      necessary to allow the irradiation to be carried out under optimal conditions in order to&#xD;
      ensure the effectiveness and safety of the treatment. In this context, virtual reality (VR)&#xD;
      headsets, using relaxation techniques in virtual reality or digital sedation, are presented&#xD;
      as a simple solution to reduce the anxiety of children regarding the treatment and would&#xD;
      therefore be tested mainly on this modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow us to assess the effectiveness of this technique on anxiety, the investigators will&#xD;
      therefore measure the positioning time necessary before carrying out a treatment session and&#xD;
      its reduction via its impact on perceived anxiety thanks to a dedicated questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strength of our study is that it uses simple and reproductive measurement systems such as&#xD;
      the measurement of placement time and a validated anxiety scale during Marie POURCHET's&#xD;
      science thesis. This is the easy EVAN (Anxiety Assessment) scale adapted to several age&#xD;
      groups and developed in pediatric wards.&#xD;

The measurement of this parameter will make it possible to compare the difference in positioning time with and without digital sedation during the first 5 proton therapy sessions.</description>
