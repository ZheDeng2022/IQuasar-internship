    <textblock>
      The objective of this registry is to collect and evaluate various clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      parameters in patients with transplanted donor lung that were preserved and transported&#xD;
      within the LUNGguard system, as well as retrospective standard of care patients&#xD;

      GUARDIAN-Lung is a post-market, observational registry of adult and pediatric lung transplant&#xD;
      recipient patients whose donor lungs was preserved and transported within the LUNGguard. The&#xD;
      data is being collected retrospectively from medical records of patients already transplanted&#xD;
      before the initiation of the registry and any new patients who meet the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 500 male and female subjects (including pediatric patients) meeting the study inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study at about 5 clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates that fit the eligibility criteria and have had their donor lungs transported with&#xD;
      a Paragonix product or a standard of care method can be enrolled. The baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and outcomes of the two groups will be compared.&#xD;
