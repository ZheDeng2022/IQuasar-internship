    <textblock>
      Non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS) such as transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS)&#xD;
      has been reported to be effective in improving motor performance and safe in participants&#xD;
      with cerebral infarction. However, few studies have been done in participants with acute&#xD;
      cerebral infarction. In this study, the investigators want to see the effect of tDCS in acute&#xD;
      cerebral infarction. the investigators perform tDCS in participants with acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke within 48 hours after stroke onset and the investigators measure motor weakness and&#xD;
      function at early phase as well as at 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral infarction is a major cause of death, a disease that is socially and nationally&#xD;
      burdensome, leaving disabilities and dementia behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In participants with cerebral infarction, non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS) such as&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) has been reported to be effective in improving&#xD;
      motor performance and safe. However, few studies have been done in participants with acute&#xD;
      cerebral infarction, and previous studies in participants with acute cerebral infarction have&#xD;
      not verified the effect in mild cerebral infarction, and previous studies in acute cerebral&#xD;
      infarction mainly stimulate lesions to anode. So in this study, the investigators want to see&#xD;
      the effect of stimulating tDCS to both hemispheres in acute cerebral infarction against this&#xD;
      backdrop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective: To see if tDCS is effective in improving motor paralysis in participants&#xD;
      with acute cerebral infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected effectiveness: stability of tDCS has already been demonstrated in many studies.&#xD;
      Since tDCS itself is a non-invasive treatment, if the efficacy of the tDCS prove to be&#xD;
      effective in patients with acute cerebral infarction, it can be widely implemented without&#xD;
      significant risk to many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention : In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators perform tDCS in&#xD;
      patients with acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours after stroke onset with sham control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome : the investigators measure motor weakness and function at early phase as well as at&#xD;
      3 months.&#xD;
