  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to test the safety of 2 doses of a T-cell priming specific cocktail of Dengue&#xD;
      viruses peptides representing all 4 DENV serotypes and mounted on a gold nanoparticle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: This is the master protocol of a prospective 2-stage adaptive trial, which aims to add&#xD;
      and test a Coronavirus vaccine candidate as well, in an identical trial design.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A critical limitation for Dengue vaccines is their association with antibody-dependent&#xD;
      enhancement, where poorly formed immune responses predispose the individual to severe disease&#xD;
      during a second infection. Thus, a more targeted vaccine (inducing / priming T cells and not&#xD;
      producing antibodies) could be the best alternative and most successful preventive method in&#xD;
      the fight against severe manifestations of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nanoparticle antigen delivery systems have been developed to enrich specific targeting of&#xD;
      immune receptors. These carrier systems are designed to facilitate antigen uptake and&#xD;
      processing by antigen presenting cells (APCs), as well as to control antigen release and&#xD;
      protect them from premature proteolytic degradation. This more targeted response also allows&#xD;
      us to reduce the effective antigen dose (to nanomoles) and mimic a replicating infection with&#xD;
      zero risk of developing the infectious disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dengue virus disease is likely to cause significant&#xD;
           diagnostic confusion and it risks further progression due to disrupted control measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic devastates the world, the need for highly efficient and&#xD;
           scalable vaccines is desperately required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Peptide vaccines have high potential as a rapidly scalable modular platform for emerging&#xD;
           diseases requiring targeted immunological responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dengue viruses and Coronaviruses (e.g. COVID-19 causing viruses) are particularly well&#xD;
           suited to this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this initial naNO-DENGUE part of the trial, the objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of two intradermal injections of two different&#xD;
      doses of the investigational Dengue peptide T cell inducing vaccine (PepGNP-Dengue)&#xD;
      administered to healthy volunteers as a:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. candidate vaccine for the prevention of severe Dengue disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. proof-of-concept for a rapidly scalable modular peptide vaccine platform, which will be&#xD;
           followed by a Coronavirus construct after interim analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the evidence of a T-cell mediated immune response as a surrogate of protection&#xD;
           against severe dengue disease using a novel peptide set-point vaccine in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To check the absence of an antibody mediated response&#xD;
&#xD;
      For naNO-DENGUE, a total of 26 eligible participants will be randomized into the following&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (n=13): 10 Low Dose (LD) PepGNP-Dengue (2.5 nmol) + 3 Comparator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (n=13): 10 High Dose (HD) PepGNP-Dengue (7.5 nmol) + 3 Comparator, Thus, 20/26&#xD;
           vaccine vera and 6/26 Comparator controls. Allocations of vaccine vera vs Comparator for&#xD;
           each group are double-blinded. Each arm will be staggered into a &quot;Pioneer&quot; group (3/13&#xD;
           participants) followed a week later after a safety review by the remaining 10/13&#xD;
           &quot;Followers&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the master protocol for a 2-stage study investigating the safety of 2 vaccines from a&#xD;
      T Cell priming vaccine platform for emerging diseases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: naNO-DENGUE A Phase-I study of a peptide T cell vaccine against Dengue virus (Master&#xD;
      protocol) Stage 2: naNO-COVID A Phase-I study of a peptide T cell vaccine against Coronavirus&#xD;
      (Sub-protocol)&#xD;

    <masking_description>This trial is double-blinded (blinded to investigators and participants)&#xD;
Blinding will be maintained for the duration of the study&#xD;
All allocations will remain coded to all volunteers and investigators. An independent pharmacy team at CHUV will label the Vaccine and Comparator doses with coded participant numbers but will not have access to the identifier list linking the code to the participant identity. All Vaccine and Comparator doses will be prepared and labelled away form investigators and stored in identical conditions.&#xD;
The appearance of the comparators and doses will be identical. The solutions of both are indistinguishable within the dosage group and this no shielding of the solution colour is needed.</masking_description>
