      The investigators aim to use a repeated measures observational study utilising a battery of&#xD;
      multimodal assessment tools (symptom, cognitive, visual, motor). The investigators aim to&#xD;
      recruit 200 rugby players (male and female) from University Rugby Union teams and local&#xD;
      amateur rugby clubs in the North East of England. The multimodal battery assessment used in&#xD;
      this study will compare metrics between digital methods and against traditional assessment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pragmatic challenges remain in the monitoring and return to play (RTP) decisions following&#xD;
      suspected Sports Related Concussion (SRC). Reliance on traditional approaches (pen and paper)&#xD;
      means players readiness for RTP is often based on self-reported symptom recognition as a&#xD;
      marker for full physiological recovery. Non-digital approaches also limit opportunity for&#xD;
      robust data analysis which may hinder understanding of the interconnected nature and&#xD;
      relationships in deficit recovery. Digital approaches may provide more objectivity to measure&#xD;
      and monitor impairments in SRC. Crucially, there is dearth of protocols for SRC assessment&#xD;
      and digital devices have yet to be tested concurrently (multimodal) in SRC rugby union&#xD;
      assessment. Here the investigators propose a multimodal protocol for digital assessment in&#xD;
      SRC, which could be used to enhance traditional sports concussion assessment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to use a repeated measures observational study utilising a battery of&#xD;
      multimodal assessment tools (symptom, cognitive, visual, motor). The investigators aim to&#xD;
      recruit 200 rugby players (male and female) from University Rugby Union teams and local&#xD;
      amateur rugby clubs in the North East of England. The multimodal battery assessment used in&#xD;
      this study will compare metrics between digital methods and against traditional assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: This paper outlines a protocol for a multimodal approach for the use of digital&#xD;
      technologies to augment traditional approaches to SRC, which may better inform RTP in rugby&#xD;
      union. Findings may shed light on the new ways of working with digital tools in SRC.&#xD;
      Multimodal approaches may enhance understanding of the interconnected nature of impairments&#xD;
      and provide scalable, more objective assessment and RTP in SRC.&#xD;
