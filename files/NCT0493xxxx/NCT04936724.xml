  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of cigarette pictorial warning label&#xD;
      content (lesser-known vs well-known risks) on visual engagement, recall, and knowledge of&#xD;
      tobacco use harms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This laboratory-based study will aim to enroll 120 current cigarette users to complete a&#xD;
      1-day cross-sectional, randomized, parallel design protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized to one of two conditions, pictorial warning labels (PWLs)&#xD;
      with well-known or lesser-known tobacco harms. After completing a baseline questionnaire, the&#xD;
      participants will view 4 warning labels from the assigned group and complete a follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaire. Eye-tracking will provide data on visual processing of the warning labels and&#xD;
      the effect of these labels on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about smoking will be&#xD;
      supplemented by self-report.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>It is a 2 x 2 factorial design experimental study using objective measures and self-report survey. We will recruit 120 daily smokers (60 young adults and 60 adults) to participate in a single-session laboratory-based study. The participants will be assigned to either the lesser-known or well-known PWL group. After completing a baseline questionnaire, the participants will view 4 warning labels in a randomized order from their assigned group followed by a follow-up questionnaire. Primary outcomes will be eye-tracking measures, label recall and recognition, and knowledge of tobacco harms.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eye Tracking Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will view the warning labels on a computer screen with an eye movement tracker. The eye-tracking device will provide key measures such as latency, latency duration and fixation duration for text as well as image areas of interest.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>After completing the eye-tracking task, the participants will provide answers to an open-ended recall question. For the recognition task, the participants will view 11 warning label images and text statements, and would be required to identify the warning labels and text statements they saw earlier.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>All participants will select harms caused by tobacco from a list of health issues and diseases, before as well as after viewing the warning labels on the screen.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Effectiveness Warning Label Ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide subjective ratings of all the warning labels released by the FDA on measures of most and least avoidant, believable and informative.</description>
