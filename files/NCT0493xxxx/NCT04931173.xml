  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following colon surgery, surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common complication and&#xD;
      leads to longer recovery time for patients and increased health care costs. Currently, there&#xD;
      is high quality evidence to show that the combination of intravenous antibiotics (IVA),&#xD;
      mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) and oral antibiotics (OA) is the most effective bowel&#xD;
      preparation to reduce SSI. However, there are no studies comparing IVA+MBP+OA and IVA+OA.&#xD;
      This is an important question because if IVA+OA works the same as IVA+MBP+OA, then MBP may be&#xD;
      safely omitted as part of the bowel preparation to reduce SSI and patients would avoid the&#xD;
      side effects of MBP prior to their surgery. Therefore, the objective is to perform a trial to&#xD;
      determine if IVA+OA works the same as IVA+MBP+OA to reduce SSI following colon surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Colon surgery includes surgery for colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and&#xD;
      other benign disease such as diverticulitis. In Canada, approximately 21,000 colon surgeries&#xD;
      are performed annually. Following colon surgery, the most common complication is surgical&#xD;
      site infection (SSI) and rates of up to 25% have been reported. The high volume of colon&#xD;
      cancer surgery, coupled with high rates of SSI lead to considerably worse health care&#xD;
      outcomes for patients including increased recovery time, length of stay and readmission.&#xD;
      Currently, several different bowel preparations to reduce SSI are being used in Canada and&#xD;
      there is significant practice variation due to lack of RCTs and conflicting practice&#xD;
      guidelines. More recently, several large observational studies and a network meta-analysis&#xD;
      have shown that a combination of intravenous antibiotics, mechanical bowel preparation and&#xD;
      oral antibiotics (IVA+MBP+OA) is superior to IVA+MBP and IVA alone. Interestingly, these&#xD;
      studies also showed that SSI rates for IVA+OA are comparable to IVA+MBP+OA. These data&#xD;
      provide a strong rationale to conduct a RCT comparing IVA+OA versus IVA+MBP+OA to determine&#xD;
      if MBP is a necessary part of the bowel preparation or if MBP can be safely omitted and the&#xD;
      side effects of MBP avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Therefore, the objectives are to conduct a multi-centre, parallel, two arm,&#xD;
      non-inferiority RCT comparing IVA+MBP+OA versus IVA+OA to reduce SSI following colon surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The inclusion criteria are any patient (i) undergoing elective colon surgery, (ii)&#xD;
      over the age of 18 years and (3) provides informed consent. Eligible patients at 4 centres&#xD;
      across Canada will be randomized to one of two groups: IVA+OA+MBP or IVA+OA. The primary&#xD;
      outcome for the trial is the overall rate of SSI at 30 days following surgery. Assuming an&#xD;
      overall SSI rate of 7% with IVA+MBP+OA and a non-inferiority margin of 4.0%, 1062 patients&#xD;
      will be required with a one sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%. This non-inferiority&#xD;
      margin was unanimously accepted as clinically meaningful by all of the Site Leads at&#xD;
      participating centres. Primary analyses will be performed per-protocol in patients who&#xD;
      received treatment as allocated and underwent colon surgery. Overall SSI rates at 30 days&#xD;
      following surgery will be compared using a general linear model and non-inferiority will be&#xD;
      declared if the upper limit of the one sided 95% confidence interval of the absolute risk&#xD;
      difference of overall SSI following surgery does not include 4.0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: This trial will be highly relevant to both patients and physicians as the results&#xD;
      will provide definitive, high quality, patient-centred evidence about whether MBP is a&#xD;
      necessary part of the optimal bowel preparation to reduce SSI and improve both patient&#xD;
      experience and outcomes. These results will have significant potential to change practice in&#xD;
      Canada and world-wide.&#xD;
