  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait disturbances and movement restrictions occur frequently in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      Patient-centered monitoring with objective aids in the patient's daily life, supports and&#xD;
      promotes therapy decisions made by physicians and patients. Technical, sensor-based&#xD;
      monitoring has the potential to generate objective target parameters at any point in time&#xD;
      during therapy (patient journey), representing the state of health and its progression, and&#xD;
      to make this information available to physicians and patients via telemedical data&#xD;
      management. In this study, the gait analysis system &quot;Mobile GaitLab Home 2.0&quot;, consisting of&#xD;
      sensors for gait data acquisition, a smartphone application for study participants (Mobile&#xD;
      GaitLab app) and a web portal for physicians (Mobile GaitLab portal) is used for data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is divided into three sub-objectives: First, the study explores and&#xD;
      tests how technically generated parameters of sensor-based gait analysis can map the symptom&#xD;
      &quot;bradykinesis&quot;. The second goal is the explorative investigation of how a tele-health service&#xD;
      support with low-threshold access to medical professionals, can be integrated into the care&#xD;
      process. The third goal is the implementation evaluation of the technological developments.&#xD;
      Here, it is examined to determine the extent to which the implementation of gait data and&#xD;
      patient feedback (PROMs) in the patient-centered care process within the framework of&#xD;
      clinical decision support contributes to early gait-associated therapy optimization and thus&#xD;
      improves the general health of patients and how initial indications of positive care effects&#xD;
      for patients can be derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a 60-day observation phase, study participants use the gait analysis system, which&#xD;
      records their gait pattern throughout the day and collects data via the Mobile GaitLab app.&#xD;
      Study participants are asked to perform standardized gait tests in the home environment&#xD;
      several times a day, in addition to continuous measurements during the awake phase. Frequency&#xD;
      of data collection is controlled by Mobile GaitLab Home 2.0 and can be flexibly adjusted to&#xD;
      the study participant's health status and therapy. The Mobile GaitLab app uses questionnaires&#xD;
      to record data on gait safety, activity, general well-being, and events relevant to the&#xD;
      disease. An evaluation of these data (PROMs) and the results from the gait analyses, are&#xD;
      visualized for the study participants via the Mobile GaitLab app.&#xD;

    <description>Enrolled patients receive a medical device which monitors gait quality and collects information about the patients health status. Possible changes of intervention (drug or physical therapy) within the observational phase (8 weeks) are initiated and prescribed by physicians as a result of routine care process or patient contact based on their (deteriorated) health status. With the chosen endpoints, changes of patients empowerment, gait quality and system usability by using a monitoring device are monitored.</description>
