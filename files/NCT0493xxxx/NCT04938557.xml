      Evaluation of the biomedical and psychosocial impact of automated Closed-Loop (Artificial&#xD;
      Pancreas) insulin delivery in women with type 1 diabetes during pregnancy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, multi-centre, randomized, two-arm parallel group trial comparing automated&#xD;
      closed-loop and standard insulin delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      124 pregnant women between 18 and 45 years of age with Type 1 Diabetes of at least 12 months'&#xD;
      duration on standard insulin delivery (CSII or MDI) will be recruited through outpatient&#xD;
      antenatal diabetes clinics. Women fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be randomized to&#xD;
      automated insulin delivery (AiD) or to continue standard patient-directed insulin delivery&#xD;
      (CSII or MDI) without AiD. The study will take place within the home and NHS antenatal&#xD;
      clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional blood samples for the research will be obtained at the 24th and 34th week of&#xD;
      pregnancy and questionnaires will also be completed by the participant at the 34th week of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Following this we will collect information on the birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 of the woman randomised to the closed loop insulin delivery system will also be&#xD;
      interviewed to gain more information on, among other things, their existing diabetes&#xD;
      management practices, everyday work and family lives and their experience with the device.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention being evaluated in this trial is automated closed-loop insulin delivery (AiD). The closed-loop system comprises of three components: an insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and a computer-based model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to compute information from the CGM into a recommended insulin dose.</description>
