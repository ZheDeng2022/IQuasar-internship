  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to test the hypotheses that wheelchair-related health,&#xD;
      wheelchair skills, wheelchair use, poverty probability, and quality of life would improve;&#xD;
      and that the number of wheelchair repairs required, adverse events, caregiver burden and the&#xD;
      level of assistance provided would decrease after the delivery of manual wheelchairs&#xD;
      following the World Health Organization (WHO) 8-step service-delivery process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a longitudinal, within-subject study design including 247 manual wheelchair users in&#xD;
      El Salvador. The intervention consisted of the WHO 8-step process as well as maintenance&#xD;
      reminders. Outcome assessments on wheelchair-related health, wheelchair skills, wheelchair&#xD;
      repairs required, adverse events, caregiver burden and the level of assistance, poverty&#xD;
      probability, and quality of life were performed via structured interviews at the initial&#xD;
      assessment, at wheelchair delivery, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Wheelchair use was&#xD;
      measured with dataloggers at assessment, delivery and 3-month follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ethics approval was granted from the National Committee on Research Ethics for Health in El&#xD;
      Salvador (CNEIS/2018/043) and the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh&#xD;
      (number PRO18010578). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before&#xD;
      implementing study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures of the study were conducted at 11 different rehabilitation centers, that&#xD;
      served as wheelchair service delivery centers, in El Salvador.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consecutive sampling method was used to select participants using the waitlists at the 11&#xD;
      rehabilitation centers. The investigators recruited wheelchair users and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial assessment, all participants were placed on a waiting list until&#xD;
      wheelchairs and services were available. All study participants were provided with a new&#xD;
      wheelchair (standard, active, or all-terrain model), a wheelchair cushion, and wheelchair&#xD;
      services, delivered by trained wheelchair service providers, according to the WHO 8-step&#xD;
      wheelchair service delivery process including assessment, fitting, and a 30-minute individual&#xD;
      or group training on 7 wheelchair skills, device care, and pressure injury prevention&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, all wheelchairs were provided with a basic contour cushion made of polyurethane&#xD;
      foam. However, whenever a risk of pressure injury was identified for a study participant,&#xD;
      wheelchair providers fabricated a pressure-relief cushion based on the WHO basic wheelchair&#xD;
      service guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected between January and November 2019, by a group of eight data collectors&#xD;
      from the University of El Salvador.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants were interviewed during the wheelchair assessment (about 2 months before&#xD;
      wheelchair delivery), at the wheelchair delivery visit, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      visits after wheelchair delivery. Participants who were not able to attend a follow-up visit&#xD;
      were interviewed by phone. Data were collected using the following questionnaires and tools&#xD;
      translated into Spanish which included demographic, clinical and wheelchair-related&#xD;
      questions, wheelchair skills, maintenance patterns, poverty probability, quality of life, and&#xD;
      all their health related questions. Data loggers (DLs) were also used to assess number of&#xD;
      days of wheelchair use, daily distance traveled, and speed. Caregivers were interviewed to&#xD;
      measure caregiver burden at baseline, at 3-month follow-up, and at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire - Brief version</measure>
    <time_frame>At month 0 (baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire - Brief version (WHOQOL-BREF) was developed to measure the quality of life of people. Its design is suitable to be used in different cultural environments with research objectives, policy making, health practices and auditing. WHOQOL-BREF is the reduced version of WHOQOL-100 and allows a complete evaluation when analyzing four fundamental domains, such as: physical, psychological, social relations and environment. It is designed in such a way that it can be answered by the participant with or without assistance. According to the information provided by the WHO, this tool has been shown to have good discriminating validity, content and reliability.&#xD;
The WHOQOL-BREF consists of 26 questions, but a question related to sexual activity was eliminated, because it was considered culturally inappropriate.&#xD;
The WHOQOL-BREF domains scores ranges from 4 to 20. A lower a score represents a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Zarit Caregiver Burden Questionnaire - short version, or better known as ZBI-12 (Zarit Burden Interview), consists of 12 questions that evaluate the burden of caregivers of people with senile dementia and people with disabilities. The ZBI assesses the caregiver's burden taking into account aspects of the caregiver's life such as family, free time and social activities. This questionnaire can be self-administered, has high content validity, high internal consistency, and great confidence of repetition. The ZBI is available in Spanish, so it can was used in El Salvador as an instrument to measure caregiver burden. ZBI Score range: 0 to 48. The higher the score, the greater the burden of care.</description>
