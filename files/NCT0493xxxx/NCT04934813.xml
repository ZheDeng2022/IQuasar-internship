    <textblock>
      The aim of the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      different alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) techniques on hard tissue dimensional alterations&#xD;
      after tooth extraction, based on clinical measurements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thrirty-six patients were randomly assigned in four treatment groups: A) freeze-dried bone&#xD;
      allograft (FDBA) covered with collagen sponge (CS), B) FDBA covered with free gingival graft&#xD;
      (FGG), C) demineralized bovine bone mineral xenograft (DBBM) covered with FGG and D) FGG&#xD;
      without socket grafting. Clinical measurements were performed immediately after tooth&#xD;
      extraction and 4 months later. The related outcomes pertained to both vertical and horizontal&#xD;
      assessment of bone loss&#xD;
