  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research, the development of an innovative robotic hand orthosis with&#xD;
      intelligent grasping control, is relevant to public health as it will restore a large measure&#xD;
      of functionality to the paralyzed hand of a person who has suffered a brachial plexus injury.&#xD;
      The proposed orthosis will utilize novel technology that will result in a device that is&#xD;
      compact, portable, dexterous, and intuitively controllable while overcoming the disadvantages&#xD;
      of previously developed orthoses that rendered them difficult to use. The restoration of&#xD;
      functionality to ones hands will significantly improve their quality of life as well as their&#xD;
      ability to again participate in the workforce and complete dexterous activities in their&#xD;
      daily lives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this research is to design, fabricate, integrate, and test a&#xD;
      lightweight and portable robotic hand orthosis intended to restore hand functionality through&#xD;
      fully controllable individual finger actuation. This objective is based on the hypothesis&#xD;
      that use of such a robotic hand orthosis will result in significant improvement of hand&#xD;
      ability for adults with brachial plexus injury, as evaluated through the Southampton Hand&#xD;
      Assessment Procedure (SHAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, several novel design aspects are incorporated. The use of miniature linear&#xD;
      actuators and lightweight materials allows for the motors and sensors to all mount atop the&#xD;
      dorsum of the hand, and eliminate the need for bulky external actuation units. In addition,&#xD;
      the actuators have inbuilt force sensing capabilities to provide feedback on the force being&#xD;
      applied to each individual finger, even before contact is made with a grasped object.&#xD;
      Furthermore, wrist flexion/extension is powered, resulting in a more realistic grasping&#xD;
      paradigm than is commonly found in robotic orthoses. Moreover, an intuitive control system&#xD;
      will be designed in order to fully capitalize on the controllability of each finger, allowing&#xD;
      for varied grasp geometries and motions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A summary of the specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and prototype the robotic hand orthosis with the goal of creating a uniquely&#xD;
      dexterous, lightweight and portable device. In addition, the control methodologies required&#xD;
      to exploit the full capabilities of the orthosis will be designed. This will result in the&#xD;
      development of an experimental research platform to determine the viability of the design and&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perform a feasibility trial of the robotic orthosis device by providing it to a small cohort&#xD;
      of adult patients suffering from paralysis due to a brachial plexus injury. The patients will&#xD;
      be assessed via the SHAP, and their respective scores both with and without the orthosis will&#xD;
      be evaluated to determine their level of improvement in dexterity and function.&#xD;

    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire is a 30- item questionnaire that looks at the ability of a patient to perform certain upper extremity activities. This questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire that patients can rate difficulty and interference with daily life on a 5 point Likert scale. The QuickDASH is an abbreviated version of the original DASH outcome measure in comparison to the original 30 item DASH outcome measure, the QuickDASH only contains 11 items. It is a questionnaire that measures an individual's ability to complete tasks, absorb forces, and severity of symptoms.</description>
