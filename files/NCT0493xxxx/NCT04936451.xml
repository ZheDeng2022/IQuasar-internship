  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial syndrome is defined as &quot;musculoskeletal pain characterized by local and referred&#xD;
      pain perceived to be deep and constant, and by the presence of myofascial trigger points in&#xD;
      any part of the body&quot; Post-breast surgery myofascial syndrome affects up to 44.7% of operated&#xD;
      women, mainly on the muscles of the greater shoulder girdle. The repercussions are&#xD;
      significant, functional, somatic, psychological and socio-professional affecting the quality&#xD;
      of life. The treatments offered may or may not be medicinal. Transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (TENS) is a therapy that uses low voltage electrical current to provide pain&#xD;
      relief. A TENS unit consists of a battery-powered device that delivers electrical impulses&#xD;
      through electrodes placed on the surface of your skin. The electrodes are placed at or near&#xD;
      nerves where the pain is located or at trigger points.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will benefit from screening for refractory pain, neuropathic or not, with myofascial syndrome, between 3 and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
The healthcare professional will determine 4 trigger points. TENS is applied twice 45 min every day for 2 months. Pain treatment will be done by using the P6 program in alternative mode: 2hz / 100Hz.&#xD;
The time between 2 electrostimulations will be a minimum of 4 hours and a maximum of 15 hours.</description>

    <description>TENS ECOMODYN® is applied to 4 treatment points, 5 minutes per point 2 times a day for 2 months.&#xD;
A minimum rest period of 4 hours between 2 sessions on the same point must be respected Stimulation is performed directly with the bipolar probe of the TENS ECOMODYN® device on the painful area by fixed stimulation of 4 active pain points in 77Hz mode.</description>
