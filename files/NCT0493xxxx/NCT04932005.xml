  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study in healthy participants. The purpose of this study is to see how&#xD;
      safe the study drug is and how well it is tolerated after dosing. The study will also&#xD;
      investigate how the study drug is taken up, broken down, distributed through the body and&#xD;
      excreted. A further aim is to look at how the above processed could change by giving the&#xD;
      study drug with food. The study will also measure biomarkers such as pCREB in the blood.&#xD;
