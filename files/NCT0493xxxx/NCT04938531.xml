  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, pilot study. Patients in the LHSC adult ICU (Critical Care Trauma&#xD;
      Centre) (1200 patients/annum) are screened daily for severe sepsis by the Clinical Research&#xD;
      Assistants. Severe sepsis is defined as infection, systemic inflammation and sepsis-induced&#xD;
      dysfunction of at least one organ system. Study consent is obtained from the patient or&#xD;
      substitute decision maker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective in this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of delivering a regular&#xD;
      passive exercise intervention, and collecting relevant outcome data early in the course of&#xD;
      severe sepsis in critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that early passive exercise in septic patients will reduce inflammation,&#xD;
      endothelial cell injury, microvascular hypoperfusion and mortality. Our goal is to provide&#xD;
      the evidence from comprehensive analysis of biochemical, physiologic and patient outcomes to&#xD;
      develop a definitive multi-centre clinical trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will perform an entry passive exercise test within 48 hours of onset of severe&#xD;
      sepsis. Patients then will perform 30-60 min supine passive cycle ergometry exercise 5&#xD;
      days/week. Details of frequency and duration of each training session will be recorded along&#xD;
      with measures of heart rate, hemoglobin oxygen saturation and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise tests will consist of baseline, 30 minutes of supine passive leg cycle&#xD;
      ergometry, and a subsequent 60 minute recovery period. Arterial and venous blood samples&#xD;
      obtained during the three protocol phases will be analyzed for metabolic factors (blood&#xD;
      gases, oxygen content, pH, lactate, glucose). On day 0, 1, and 7, an additional blood tube is&#xD;
      immediately transferred on ice to the Translational Research Centre Biohazard Level 2&#xD;
      Laboratory for processing and aliquoting using a standard operating procedure. Plasma will be&#xD;
      stored at -80C and thawed immediately before use in biochemical analyses or in vitro&#xD;
      experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will include inflammatory mediator levels, blood vessel permeability in leg muscle&#xD;
      and leg muscle perfusion as described below. Additional measures of central and peripheral&#xD;
      hemodynamics will include ultrasound-based measures of cardiac stroke volume, carotid blood&#xD;
      flow, and carotid artery compliance. Continuous analog measures of the electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      central venous pressure, blood pressure, end tidal carbon dioxide and electromyography&#xD;
      (quadriceps) will be monitored during the exercise and stored online for subsequent analysis&#xD;
      of heart and respiratory rate variability, blood pressure variability and baroreflex&#xD;
      sensitivity. We will also record length of ICU stay, in-hospital mortality and hospital&#xD;
      health care costs. Length of ICU and hospital stay will be used as surrogates for hospital&#xD;
      costs. Physiotherapy time will also be recorded for each patient (time on the intervention&#xD;
      and total time with each enrolled patient). Energy requirements will be assessed by metabolic&#xD;
      measurements; nitrogen balance and serum prealbumin will be measured to monitor nutritional&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanistic basis of the observed hemodynamics during and following passive leg exercise&#xD;
      will be explored using a comprehensive translational model that incorporates 1) venous blood&#xD;
      analysis, 2) in vitro human-derived cell culture models, and 3) in vivo skeletal muscle&#xD;
      measures of capillary blood flow. This panel will be evaluated on day 0, 7 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Venous Blood Analysis: Patient inflammatory profiles will be determined by assaying&#xD;
           stored plasma samples for inflammatory biomarkers and inflammatory-inducing actions. We&#xD;
           will measure a previously established list of 20+ inflammatory biomarkers elevated in&#xD;
           sepsis, including cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases, collagen breakdown&#xD;
           products, neurotrophins and stress hormones (cortisol). The innate immune response will&#xD;
           also be evaluated. HIF1alpha, a subunit of the transcription factor HIF1, is a key&#xD;
           regulator of the innate immune response to inflammation. Exercise results in increased&#xD;
           free DNA in the plasma which leads to induced HIF1alpha expression. Thus, HIF1alpha is a&#xD;
           potential candidate to orchestrate gene expression changes that initiate adaptations of&#xD;
           the innate immune response after exercise. HIF-1alpha, downstream target genes and&#xD;
           plasma free DNA levels in blood samples will be measured to determine the effects of&#xD;
           exercise on the innate immune response during sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In vitro cell culture: Human plasma will be applied to human-derived endothelial cells&#xD;
           representing various vascular beds (e.g. cerebral and dermal microvasculature, and large&#xD;
           blood vessels such as aorta and veins) to assess inflammatory potential: measurable&#xD;
           targets include reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, NF-kB, MAP kinases, leukocyte&#xD;
           adhesion assays, and permeability. Plasma will also be applied to erythrocytes to&#xD;
           determine inflammatory-induced changes in morphology, an assay critical to understanding&#xD;
           oxygen carrying capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In vivo capillary blood flow: The occurrence of muscle hypoperfusion and increased&#xD;
           vascular permeability will be assessed using an in-house-developed near-infrared&#xD;
           spectroscopy (NIRS) method that monitors the uptake of a light-absorbing dye in the&#xD;
           muscle. The dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used clinically for over 30 years and&#xD;
           has a high safety record. Muscle perfusion and vascular permeability are determined by&#xD;
           using a mathematical model to characterize the dynamics of the ICG distribution in&#xD;
           muscle following an intravenous injection. This approach is analogous to&#xD;
           contrast-enhanced imaging methods (CT and MRI), but with the advantage that the&#xD;
           portability of NIRS enables bedside measurements.&#xD;
