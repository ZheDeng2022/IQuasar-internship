  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a severe delayed radiation-induced injury that can occur in&#xD;
      patients whom have been subjected to radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
      treatment (HBO) is one treatment option. In Sweden it is used in some locations in&#xD;
      combination to standard treatment which includes for example antibiotics, pain medication and&#xD;
      surgery. There is still not sufficient evidence that this treatment is effective in this&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate HBO as a treatment for osteoradionecrosis&#xD;
      in terms of slowing the progression of the disease, or at the best, cure the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT) is frequently used for treatment of head and neck cancer, in combination&#xD;
      with surgery and chemotherapy. Although RT can improve the survival rate among head and&#xD;
      neck-cancer patients, it has negative effects on the healthy tissue surrounding the tumour.&#xD;
      Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a severe delayed radiation-induced injury that can occur in&#xD;
      patients whom have been subjected to RT for head and neck cancer. ORN can occur within months&#xD;
      to several years after radiotherapy. Symptoms can include pain, dysesthesia, halitosis (bad&#xD;
      breath) exposed necrotic bone, infection, orocutaneous fistula and pathologic fractures. The&#xD;
      mandible is the most common site affected by ORN, but other bones can be affected as well.&#xD;
      ORN has earlier been treated with long-term antibiotics and surgery. Today the treatment is&#xD;
      multidisciplinary and also includes local wound care, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and new&#xD;
      medications for example Pentoxifylline, a vasodilator that also inhibits fibrosis, Tocopherol&#xD;
      (Vitamin E), that reduces damage by free radicals, and Clodronate, a bisphosphonate that&#xD;
      inhibits bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBO) is an intervention in which the individual breathes near&#xD;
      100% oxygen intermittently while inside a hyperbaric chamber that is pressurized to above sea&#xD;
      level pressure. By increasing the inspired partial pressure of oxygen (PO₂), with an&#xD;
      increased O₂ fraction inspired and increased pressure, the amount of oxygen in blood can be&#xD;
      increased. This also increases the distance that oxygen can diffuse from the capillaries into&#xD;
      the tissues. HBO increase production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. This leads to&#xD;
      neovascularisation by two processes: blood vessel growth by local endothelial cells&#xD;
      (angiogenesis) and recruitment and differentiation of stem cells to form vessels &quot;de novo&quot;&#xD;
      (vasculogenesis). HBO has also been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and enhances&#xD;
      collagen synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate HBO as a treatment for osteoradionecrosis&#xD;
      in terms of slowing the progression of the disease, or at the best, cure the disease. As&#xD;
      secondary aims for this study, the effect of HBO on pain, infection, mouth-opening capacity&#xD;
      and quality of life will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective study with matched controls evaluating the effect of HBO in&#xD;
      comparison to standard care in patients with ORN stage 1-2b according to classification of&#xD;
      Kagan and Schwartz. A total of 60 patients in each group will be included, which should be&#xD;
      sufficient for statistical significance according to power calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled into two groups. The first group of patients will receive HBO&#xD;
      treatment. The treatment will be given in a multi or monoplace chamber pressurized to 2,4-2,5&#xD;
      ATA, 90 minutes from start to decompression, and the patients will be breathing 100 % oxygen.&#xD;
      Treatment will be given once daily, five days a week. All patients will receive 30 treatments&#xD;
      and if surgery is needed the patient will receive an additional 10 treatments&#xD;
      postoperatively. All according to local routines for treatment of ORN with HBO. The control&#xD;
      group will consist of a group of patients with the same diagnosis and same stage of ORN.&#xD;
      These will be patients from a maxillofacial unit in Sweden not using HBO treatment or&#xD;
      patients who decline the treatment. The controls will be matched based on sex, age,&#xD;
      tumour-stage and RT. These patients will be treated with standard care and be subjected to&#xD;
      surgery if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit will include clinical examination by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon and&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires developed and validated for head-and-neck cancer patients&#xD;
      (EORTC QLQ C30 and H&amp;N35). The patients in the HBO group will also be examined by a doctor at&#xD;
      the hyperbaric unit. Follow-up will be performed every third month during the first year. In&#xD;
      total the patients will be followed for a period of four years, every sixth months the second&#xD;
      and third year and then on a yearly basis from the third year and on if no need for more&#xD;
      frequent controls exist. The follow-up will include clinical examination by an oral and&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgeon, radiographies including CT-scan and quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
      This is according to established care program. Blood samples, and if the patient undergoes&#xD;
      surgery, tissue samples, will also be collected to look at biomarkers for inflammation and&#xD;
      bone turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point of the study is changes in the bone as well as the soft tissue surrounding&#xD;
      the necrotic bone. Secondary end-points are improvements regarding pain, infection,&#xD;
      mouth-opening capacity and quality of life scorings.&#xD;
