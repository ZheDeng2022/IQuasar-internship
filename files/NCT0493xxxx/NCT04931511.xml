    <textblock>
      This study aim to compare the efficacy of guteal muscle injection and subacromial ultrasound&#xD;
      guided injection to treat frozen shoulder. Firstly, in order to calculate the sample size&#xD;
      correctly, we start the preliminary study. Besides, in order to propose clinical new&#xD;
      technology which combines the advantages of the two therapies, improve the efficacy ratio of&#xD;
      frozen shoulder therapy, and provide a frozen shoulder treatment plan according to health&#xD;
      economics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there have been studies suggesting that small doses of corticosteroid&#xD;
      systemic medication and joint local injection to treat shoulder sleeve disease is equivalent,&#xD;
      frozen shoulder is clinically in addition to shoulder sleeve disease another common cause of&#xD;
      shoulder pain disease, local injection of small dose of corticosteroid is a clinically&#xD;
      commonly used treatment of frozen shoulder mature therapy, however, because of the risk of&#xD;
      joint infection and other serious complications, and it's personnel experience depended and&#xD;
      high qualification requirements, resulting in higher treatment costs. However, it has not&#xD;
      been widely used in clinical applications and is generally used as a second-line therapy for&#xD;
      the treatment of frozen shoulders. There are studies suggesting that joint cavity hormone&#xD;
      injection may be mainly effective through its systemic effect, however, there is currently no&#xD;
      random blind control study comparing small doses of hormone systemic injection with local&#xD;
      injection of shoulder joints to freeze shoulder, if the equivalence of the two can be&#xD;
      confirmed through such studies will greatly change the clinical treatment of frozen&#xD;
      shoulders, with hip injection and other systemic medication will provide great health&#xD;
      economic advantages, and can avoid the inherent risk of joint cavity injection, reduce the&#xD;
      social cost of frozen shoulder treatment.&#xD;
