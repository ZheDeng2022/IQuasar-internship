  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C)&#xD;
      is a transdiagnostic and emotion-focused cognitive-behavioral group intervention for children&#xD;
      aged 6-12 years old with emotion disorders (i.e., anxious and/or mood disorders) and their&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UP-C consists of 15 weekly group sessions and unifies cognitive-behavioral, contextual (e.g.,&#xD;
      mindfulness) and parental training techniques, for parents and children, aimed at reducing&#xD;
      the intensity and frequency of strong and aversive emotional experiences in children and&#xD;
      their clinical symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of the UP-C in&#xD;
      the Portuguese population in reducing children's anxiety/depression symptoms. It also aims to&#xD;
      investigate which mechanisms explain the therapeutic change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited at child mental health services and schools from Central&#xD;
      Portugal and also through online dissemination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in a sample of children aged 6-12 years&#xD;
      old with emotional disorders and their parents in order to answer the critical question of&#xD;
      whether the UP-C is more efficacious in reducing children's symptomatology than a&#xD;
      psychoeducational group intervention (active control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the eligibility criteria are met (assessed by the project researchers) parents and&#xD;
      children will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. experimental group (i.e., children and parents who benefit from the UP-C program).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. control group (i.e., children who benefit from a psychoeducational intervention program,&#xD;
           named &quot;ABC of Emotions&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and children from both groups will complete several psychometrically robust and&#xD;
      developmentally appropriate measures at baseline (T0), mid-treatment (only at week 7 of the&#xD;
      UP-C; T1), post treatment (T2) and at 3 months follow-up (T3).&#xD;

    <description>UP-C is a transdiagnostic and emotion-focused cognitive-behavioral group intervention for children aged 6-12 years old with emotions disorders (i.e., anxious and/or mood disorders) and their parents. UP-C unifies cognitive-behavioral, contextual (eg. mindfulness) and parental training techniques aiming to reduce the intensity and frequency of children's clinical symptomatology.&#xD;
The intervention consists of 15 weekly group sessions (90 minutes per session; 5-8 children and parents per group) conducted by at least two clinical psychologists trained in the UP-C. The sessions start with the parents and children together (15 minutes); then, one psychologist conduct the session with the group of children while the other psychologist conduct the session with the group of parents, simultaneously (60 minutes); finally, the session ends with the group together (15 minutes). This is a structured and manualized intervention with a manual for the therapist and a workbook for the child and parents.</description>

    <description>ABC of Emotions is a psychoeducational group intervention for children with anxiety and/or mood disorders, aged between 6 to 12 years. ABC of Emotions consists of 5 group psychoeducation sessions (about 90 minutes per session; 5-8 children per group). This is a structured and manualized intervention, with a manual for the therapist and a workbook for the child.&#xD;
The contents of the sessions were developed by the researchers of this study and are based on classic psychoeducational cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) strategies. Since anxiety disorders are more frequent in childhood than mood disorders (e.g., Merikangas et al., 2009), this program is essentially based on psychoeducation materials focused on emotions such as anxiety and fear. However, the same materials are available in an attachment, adapted for use with children to whom the main emotion is not fear/anxiety, but sadness (as in mood disorders).</description>
