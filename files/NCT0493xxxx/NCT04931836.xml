  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a 100-participant randomized controlled 2-arm parallel trial that&#xD;
      employs a metagenomic approach to examine how 8 weeks of supervised moderate-intensity&#xD;
      treadmill walking exercise (MWE) for 30-45 min 3 times/week alters the gut microbiome, serum&#xD;
      short chain fatty acids, and the cardiometabolic profile, body weight, and body composition&#xD;
      of individuals 30-64 years old who have overweight or obesity and have prediabetes.&#xD;

      All eligible and consented participants will complete a 3-week run-in phase during which&#xD;
      baseline outcome assessments will be performed. During run-in weeks 1 and 2, participants&#xD;
      will wear a Fitbit Inspire 2 smartwatch and complete three unannounced dietary recalls.&#xD;
      During the run-in week 3 (see table below), participants will consume their 3-day&#xD;
      standardized meal plan on days three through five, obtain a fecal sample, complete a study&#xD;
      questionnaire, and complete a study assessment visit. To quantify compliance with the 3-day&#xD;
      meal plan, participants will be provided with a paper checklist of all foods to be consumed,&#xD;
      and will be asked to indicate which foods were consumed and to document any deviation. The&#xD;
      study assessment visit will include a fasting blood draw (at baseline and week eight only),&#xD;
      blood pressure in triplicate, weight measure and body fat assessment in duplicate, and a&#xD;
      saliva sample.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes to the gut microbiome will be assessed via metagenomic sequencing, from pre- to post-intervention. The Shannon Index-a measure of microbial community diversity-will be the primary indicator for changes in gut microbiota composition, and will be assessed at baseline, and following the 4th and 8th weeks. Index values are unitless and range from 0 to 1. Lower values indicate more diversity while higher values indicate less diversity. Outcome will be reported at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks and as the change from baseline to 4 weeks and baseline to 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo fasted blood draws to assess serum SCFA levels. This work will be performed using the Metabolon pipeline. Outcome is reported as the serum concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate individually and sum of all SCFAs in units of ng/ml.</description>
