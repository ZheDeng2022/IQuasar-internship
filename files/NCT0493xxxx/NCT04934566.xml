  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal veno-arterial membrane oxygenation&quot; (ECMO-VA), are used to manage refractory&#xD;
      cardiogenic shocks by replacing the failed &quot;heart-lung&quot; block. The Extracorporeal Life&#xD;
      Support Organisation guidelines considers that the effectiveness of these techniques must be&#xD;
      evaluated on the adequacy of tissue perfusion biomarker, of which is O2 saturation of venous&#xD;
      blood found in the pulmonary artery using a Swan-Ganz catheter (SVO2) or in the superior vena&#xD;
      cava/right atrium using a central venous catheter (ScVO2). During ECMO support, it can be&#xD;
      also measured directly in the venous ECMO cannula (SmVO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, due to the difference in tips locations of the venous cannula of ECMO-VA, the&#xD;
      central venous catheter and the Swan-Ganz catheter, and rheological issues, the SmVO2, SVO2&#xD;
      and ScVO2 values obtained may be different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further we hypothesised that the level of admission flow may also affect the correlation&#xD;
      between these different variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this experimental study is to investigate the concordance of the saturation of&#xD;
      venous blood collected from these 3 measurement sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives is to compare the concordance of ScVO2 and the SmVO2, the two more&#xD;
      easily and systematically available variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives were :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the concordance of the 3 variables describing oxygen saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to analyse the primary objectives during prespecified and calibrated flow changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. analyse the association between these 3 variables with prognosis variables (Perfusion&#xD;
           index, lactatemia, CO2 veno-arterial differences, SOFA score, SAPS II, successful&#xD;
           weaning from the ECMO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. analyse in an ancilary study the concordance between SmVO2 measured using blood sample&#xD;
           and the value obtained using a continuous monitoring of SVO2 through the circuit.&#xD;
