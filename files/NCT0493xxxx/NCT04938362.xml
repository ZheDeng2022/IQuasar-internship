      Brain abscess is a focal bacterial or fungal infection of the brain. Treatment is&#xD;
      neurosurgical drainage of pus followed by long-term antibiotic treatment. In spite of&#xD;
      successful treatment of the infection, long-term cognitive problems or mental fatigue may&#xD;
      ensue. The reason for this dysfunction may be a continuing inflammatory state or damage to&#xD;
      brain tissue caused by the abscess. The investigators will evaluate these possibilities with&#xD;
      the use of [18F]deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in patients who have been&#xD;
      treated for brain abscess and who experience cognitive problems and/or fatigue. FDG-PET may&#xD;
      identify both inflammation and altered neuronal activity (the latter indicating damage to&#xD;
      brain tissue).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain abscess is a focal bacterial or fungal infection of the brain, which results in a&#xD;
      pus-filled cavity within the brain parenchyma. The incidence is approximately 1/100 000 per&#xD;
      year, and all age groups are affected. Treatment is neurosurgical drainage of pus followed by&#xD;
      long-term antibiotic treatment. Previously, the capsule that surrounds the pus was removed&#xD;
      surgically; this is not usually done anymore. In spite of successful treatment of the&#xD;
      infection, patients may experience long-lasting cognitive problems or mental fatigue. The&#xD;
      reason for this brain dysfunction is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators formulated two hypotheses to explain why some patients experience&#xD;
      long-lasting cognitive problems and/or fatigue: 1) The brain abscess caused damage to brain&#xD;
      tissue, interrupting neuronal networks underlying cognition or 2) The abscess or the&#xD;
      remaining capsule causes a long-lasting inflammatory state of the brain, affecting&#xD;
      neurotransmission and cerebral function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, the investigators evaluate brain abscess patients by cognitive&#xD;
      examination by a neuropsychologist at 2 and 12 months after treatment. Participants then&#xD;
      undergo [18F]deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). An inflammatory state in&#xD;
      the abscess area would be identified by the FDG-PET signal. Likewise, a change in neuronal&#xD;
      (neocortical) function would be detectable from a change in the FDG-PET signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, brain damage caused by the abscess may be irreversible and functional&#xD;
      improvement of the patient would probably have to rely on compensatory strategies, whereas an&#xD;
      inflammatory state could probably be modified by anti-inflammatory treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the prognosis for the patients' cognitive problems and fatigue is probably different&#xD;
      if the underlying cause is inflammation rather than tissue damage.&#xD;

The answer &quot;Better than before&quot; gives a score of 0, &quot;Same as before&quot; gives a score of 1, &quot;Worse than before&quot; gives a score of 2, and &quot;Much worse than before&quot; gives a score of 3.
