  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether chemotherapy regimens guided by organoid drug&#xD;
      sensitivity test can improve the outcomes of advanced pancreatic cancer. At the same time,&#xD;
      this study will evaluate the successful stablishment rate of organoid from biopsy tissue ,&#xD;
      and explore the concordance between drug sensitivity test results and patients' treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer is not just because of the high malignancy of the&#xD;
      tumor itself, but also its poor response to chemotherapy. At present, patient's&#xD;
      drug-sensitivity is assessed by progression time after treatment. Therefore, it is difficult&#xD;
      to judge a patient's sensitivity to a drug before chemotherapy. Organoid is a new tumor&#xD;
      model, which has the potential to test the drug sensitivity before chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our center's previous experience has shown that the success rate of pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      organoid culture is 77.6%. The previous research has confirmed that pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      organoid was highly consistent with the original tissue in terms of genomics and&#xD;
      histomorphology. More importantly, the investigators have tested the five first-line&#xD;
      drug-sensitivity in 39 pancreatic cancer organoids, and compared the test results with the&#xD;
      clinical treatment response of these patients, confirming that organoid can accurately&#xD;
      evaluate the chemotherapy drug-sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial,&#xD;
      designed to explore whether chemotherapy regimens guided by organoid drug sensitivity test&#xD;
      can improve outcomes in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. At the same time, the&#xD;
      consistency between the drug sensitivity test results and the treatment response of patients&#xD;
      will be analyzed. Also, the radiosensitivity of organoids will be tested, and be compared&#xD;
      with the patients' response to radiotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>The pancreatic cancer specimens are obtained from biopsy to be cultured for organoids. Then drug sensitivity is tested using organoid to obtain the sensitivity to the first-line drugs for pancreatic cancer (Gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, Paclitaxel, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan). Patients will receive relatively sensitive chemotherapy regimen based on the test results. Chemotherapy should start within 1 months after biopsy, and be given at least 1 cycle.</description>

Then drug sensitivity is tested using organoid to obtain the sensitivity to the first-line drugs for pancreatic cancer (Gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, Paclitaxel, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan). Physician will decide the the adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. And they don't know the drug sensitivity test results. Chemotherapy should start within 1 months after biopsy, and be given at least 1 cycle.</description>
