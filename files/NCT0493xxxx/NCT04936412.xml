  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on human anatomical data and uses computer-aided engineering (CAE)&#xD;
      software such as biomedical image processing software, reverse engineering software, CAD&#xD;
      software, and finite element analysis software to create a three-dimensional bracing model.&#xD;
      With the help of 3D printing technology, we have developed personalized brace, completed the&#xD;
      personalized rapid design and optimization of the three series of support equipment products&#xD;
      such as the posterior cruciate ligament brace, ankle ankle brace, and shoulder brace.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The traditional brace mainly includes small splints or gypsums. The manufacturing process is&#xD;
      rough, and the flexibility is poor. In recent years, with the development of orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery, rehabilitation concept, modern polymer materials, and biomechanics, great progress&#xD;
      has been made in R&amp;D, production, and assembly of orthoses. In developed countries, orthoses&#xD;
      is not only widely used after orthopedic surgery and the department of rehabilitation, but it&#xD;
      has become the main auxiliary device for sports trauma surgery, immobilization, treatment,&#xD;
      and rehabilitation training. Leading bracing company such as DJO has developed multi-brand&#xD;
      correction devices such as Aircast®, Chattanooga, CMF, COMPEX®, DonJoy®, Empi® and ProCare®.&#xD;
      However, these braces are not designed and manufactured based on patients. Individually&#xD;
      designed products for anatomical structures still have many problems in clinical&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
