      Rationale: Ivermectin, an inexpensive and available antiparasitic drug, with favourable&#xD;
      safety profile, showed inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV2 viral replication in-vitro and in&#xD;
      animal models. Several research groups investigated Ivermectin in COVID-19, particularly in&#xD;
      mild symptomatic disease. There is high degree of uncertainty on its effects on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and larger studies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Plan to study the effect of Ivermectin versus standard treatment in patients with&#xD;
      confirmed mild COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multi-centre prospective cohort study Settings: Assiut University Hospital&#xD;
      (Assiut University), Aswan and others, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients with confirmed mild COVID-19. Intervention: Patients with mild&#xD;
      symptomatic COVID-19 attending the participating out-patient clinics in different centers&#xD;
      will receive either Ivermectin + Standard treatment or Standard treatment only. All new mild&#xD;
      symptomatic COVID-19 patients will receive Ivermectin + Standard treatment for the first two&#xD;
      weeks of the study. During the following four weeks, all new patients will receive standard&#xD;
      treatment only. These cycles will be repeated until 822 patients are recruited in each arm.&#xD;
      Patients assigned to Ivermectin + Standard treatment or standard treatment only will remain&#xD;
      as such throughout the study and during the follow- up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures: The primary outcome will be rate of intensive care admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: Secondary outcomes will be time to clinical improvement, the&#xD;
      clinical state using 7-point ordinal scale at different time points, need for home&#xD;
      oxygenation, hospitalization, hospital supplemental oxygen &gt;24 hours, Non- invasive&#xD;
      ventilation ( High- flow nasal cannula, High- velocity nasal insufflation or BiPAP), duration&#xD;
      of hospitalization, duration of ICU stay and deaths within 21 days,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a prospective cohort design, a sample size of 822 cases per group is estimated (1644 for&#xD;
      the whole study). This calculation depends on a rate of ICU admission in mild symptomatic&#xD;
      COVID-19 cases of 8.5%, an assumption that Ivermectin can reduce this rate by 50%, at a study&#xD;
      power of 80%, and confidence limit of 0.95.&#xD;

      1. Introduction and rationale: An outbreak of atypical pneumonia of unknown cause erupted in&#xD;
      Wuhan, China in December 2019. The symptoms ranged from mild symptoms to severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, with multi-organ affection leading to patients' death. Within&#xD;
      few weeks, genetic sequence of the causative virus was identified to be close to Severe Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Distress Virus (SARS-CoV) (Zhou et al, 2020). The newly identified virus was&#xD;
      named Novel Coronavirus or SARS-CoV2, and the clinical disease as COVID-19 (Chung et al,&#xD;
      2021). The disease spread rapidly with travel movements around the world and the World Health&#xD;
      organization announced the COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 (Cucinotta and Vanelli,&#xD;
      2020). The worldwide disease toll approached more the 165 million confirmed cases including&#xD;
      more than 3.5 million deaths as of May 21st, 2021, making it the worst pandemic in the last&#xD;
      100 years [WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempting to find therapeutic options for COVID-19, viral inhibitor drugs that have been&#xD;
      used against influenza and HIV, were repurposed to be tested against SARS-CoV2. These include&#xD;
      Chloroquine/ Hydroxychloroquine which inhibit viral entry and endocytosis in vitro, protease&#xD;
      inhibitors Lopinavir-Ritonavir which disrupt viral replication in-vitro, and RNA dependent&#xD;
      polymerase inhibitors including Ribavirin, Favipiravir and Remdesivir (Wiersinga et al,&#xD;
      2020). Only Remdesivir showed initial promising results in a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (Beigel et al, 2020), however, currently the World Health Organization recommends against its&#xD;
      use in any disease severity (Lamontage et al, 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivermectin is an inexpensive and available antiparasitic drug, with favourable safety&#xD;
      profile. It showed inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV2 viral replication in vitro and in animal&#xD;
      models (Formiga et al, 2021). Several research groups investigated Ivermectin in COVID-19,&#xD;
      particularly early in mild disease where viral replication is more active (Kory et al, 2021).&#xD;
      In its living guideline on drugs used to treat COVID-19, the WHO recommended against the use&#xD;
      of Ivermectin in COVID-19, regardless of duration of symptoms or disease severity, except in&#xD;
      the contest of clinical trials. The reason was high degree of uncertainty about clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of importance to the patients like time to clinical improvement, hospital admission,&#xD;
      duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and mortality. The WHO recommends larger&#xD;
      and well-designed studies to solve this uncertainty (Lamontage et al, 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study protocol, the investigators plan to study the effect of Ivermectin&#xD;
      versus standard treatment in patients with confirmed mild symptomatic COVID-19. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be rate of intensive care admission. Secondary outcomes will be time to clinical&#xD;
      improvement, patient's clinical state using 7-point ordinal scale at different time points,&#xD;
      proportion of subjects needing hospitalization, supplemental oxygen &gt;24 hours, duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization, duration of ICU stay or death within 21 days.&#xD;
