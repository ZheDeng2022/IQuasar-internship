      This study used Mini Nutrition Assessment (MNA) , Nutrition risk screening 2002(NRS-2002) and&#xD;
      Non-motor Symptom Quest (NMSquest) to investigate the nutritional status of patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, to analyze the correlation between non-motor symptoms and malnutrition&#xD;
      in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) , and to provide evidence for clinical treatment&#xD;
      and early nutritional intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) score. This scale is used to evaluate the nutritional status .MNA consists of 18 subjects, covering four aspects: anthropometric assessment, general state assessment, recent diet assessment and subjective self-assessment. The total score is 30. Malnutrition is defined as score &lt; 17, critical state of malnutrition is defined as score 17-24, and good nutrition is defined as score &gt; 24.</description>
