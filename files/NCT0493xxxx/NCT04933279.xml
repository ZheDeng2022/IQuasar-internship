  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodine is an essential micronutrient for the production of thyroid hormones and its&#xD;
      deficiecny remains a global problem impairing health. The primary source of iodine is the&#xD;
      diet via consumption of foods, including cooked foods with iodized salt, dairy products, or&#xD;
      naturally abundant seafood. Currently, the recommendation of dietary iodine intake is 150 μg&#xD;
      per day in adults who are not pregnant or lactating. The ingestion of iodine or exposure&#xD;
      above this threshold is well-tolerated and nearly no health problems are observed. The diets&#xD;
      processed and cooked with iodized salt are generally important iodine sources, however, high&#xD;
      iodine intake is a result of routine consumption of several kinds of edible algae in coastal&#xD;
      regions, with varying contributions depending on the amount of seafood consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine absorption mainly depends on the iodine species in foods and possibly on the iodine&#xD;
      status of the individual. Further, there was little available data on iodine absorption or&#xD;
      bioavailability from different dietary sources, such as natutal kelp and fortified food with&#xD;
      potassium iodide. To our knowledge, inorganic iodide is thought to be absorbed almost&#xD;
      completely (over 90%). However, only about two-thirds of some forms of organically-bound&#xD;
      iodine are absorbed. The different sources of iodine absorption have not been accurately&#xD;
      quantified and compared in humans. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to quantify the&#xD;
      iodine absorption of natural kelp in male and female adults and compare with the&#xD;
      bioavailability from an iodine water solution (potassium iodide). This stduy will obtain the&#xD;
      actual iodine bioavailability and the difference for different source of foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, cross-over design and aims to evaluate the iodine bioavailability&#xD;
      (measured using excretion in urine and fece) from different source and administered dose of&#xD;
      iodine, such as natural kelp and potassium iodide delivering a dialy iodine intake about 600&#xD;
      µg and 1200 µg. This study will compare and measure to the ingestion of natural kelp and&#xD;
      potassium iodide within one subject by three stages: (1) normal iodine intake stage (iodine&#xD;
      intake &gt;150 µg/day); (2) intervention stage, a bowl of soup with an extrinsic iodine dose of&#xD;
      about 600 µg; or a bowl of natural kelp with a certain iodine content of about 1200 µg&#xD;
      potassium iodide.&#xD;

The natural kelp will be approximately produced in an experimental barn feeding supplementary iodine to reach a final iodine intake of ≈ 600 µg or 1200 µg. The iodine intake of natural kelp will be adjusted to the required dose by determing iodine content in the natural kelp.</description>
