  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant racial disparities in health outcomes, racial minority groups in the&#xD;
      United States are not adequately represented in clinical trials, and clinical trial results&#xD;
      published in major medical journals often underreport racial demographic data of&#xD;
      participants. Lack of diversity in clinical trials threatens the generalizability of study&#xD;
      results and reduces the ability of minority groups to benefit from medical advancement and&#xD;
      innovation. Prior studies show that Black men are more likely to engage in preventive&#xD;
      services when there is racial concordance with their healthcare provider. There is minimal&#xD;
      literature about how racial concordance or diversity in clinical trial leadership impacts&#xD;
      study enrollment. This project examines whether patients' willingness to participate in&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials differs based on the characteristics of the investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
      This project examines whether patients' willingness to participate in randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials differs based on the characteristics of the investigator. We plan to recruit subjects&#xD;
      and randomly assign them to one of four treatments. In each treatment arm, the subject will&#xD;
      view a photo of a male actor. We experimentally vary treatment along two dimensions: whether&#xD;
      the actor is wearing expert vs. layperson attire and whether the actor is white vs. black.&#xD;
      Our outcomes of interest are subjects' willingness to participate in randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials differs based on racial concordance with the actor, and whether that is conditional on&#xD;
      their source of funding or their perceived level of expertise, signaled by their publication&#xD;
      history.&#xD;

    <description>We plan to recruit subjects and randomly assign them to one of four treatments. In each treatment arm, the subject will view a photo of a man. We experimentally vary treatment along two dimensions: whether the man is wearing expert vs. layperson attire and whether the man is white vs. black. We will survey participants' willingness to participate in a vaccine clinical trial or research study and how their initial response is impacted by other characteristics such as employment by the pharmaceutical industry or publication history.</description>
