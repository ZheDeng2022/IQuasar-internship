  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common comorbidity among adolescents with migraine. This randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial aims to determine efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia,&#xD;
      as well as the combined effect of CBT insomnia and pain interventions, on reducing insomnia&#xD;
      symptoms and headache-related disability in adolescents with migraine. The long-term goal is&#xD;
      to offer effective, tailored self-management interventions that can address migraine and&#xD;
      co-morbid sleep problems in adolescence and disrupt a cycle of persistent, disabling migraine&#xD;
      from continuing into adulthood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This aims of this study are to: 1) test efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      insomnia intervention for youth with migraine and comorbid insomnia, and 2) investigate how&#xD;
      changes in sleep may modify response to CBT pain intervention. Participants will include 180&#xD;
      youth and their parents. Youth will be ages 11-17 years, with migraine (with or without aura,&#xD;
      chronic migraine) and comorbid insomnia. In Phase 1, participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive access to internet-delivered CBT insomnia intervention or internet-delivered sleep&#xD;
      education control over 6 weeks. In Phase 2, all participants will receive access to&#xD;
      internet-delivered CBT pain intervention over 6 weeks. Assessments will occur at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately after Phase 1 intervention, immediately after Phase 2 intervention, and 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
