  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, observational, multicenter study to collect Real-World Evidence&#xD;
      (RWE) data on systemic AL-AMY patients in Europe. Data from paper/electronic medical records&#xD;
      and/or electronic databases from key reference centers in Europe will be used. Data will&#xD;
      either be entered by the site staff in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) or, where&#xD;
      feasible, transferred directly, always in accordance to local regulations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lack of regulatory approved treatment options for AL amyloidosis (AL-AMY) justifies the&#xD;
      need to understand the current treatment practice and outcomes of this disease. There is a&#xD;
      need for objective Real-World Evidence (RWE) that reflects how treatments are initiated,&#xD;
      combined and sequenced, and how their relative effectiveness and safety profiles emerge&#xD;
      outside a clinical trial setting. Therefore, the aim is to generate RWE on systemic AL-AMY&#xD;
      patients in Europe, including patient characteristics, resource use, treatments and&#xD;
      associated patient outcomes.&#xD;

        The study will include adult (male and female) patients diagnosed with systemic AL-AMY and&#xD;
        symptomatic organ involvement who have initiated first line treatment in the period&#xD;
        2004-2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have received treatment for AL-AMY as part of an interventional Clinical Trial&#xD;
        will be identified but will not be included in the analysis due to the controlled&#xD;
        environment of a clinical trial (not RWE data).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with comorbid multiple myeloma will not be excluded.&#xD;
