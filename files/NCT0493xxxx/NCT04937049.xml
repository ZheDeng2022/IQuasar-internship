  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research team has designed, and will test, a web tool to support traditional Maternal&#xD;
      Education (EM). This tool is organized into 4 areas: 1) Information área; 2) Communication&#xD;
      área (with peers and with professionals) 3) Self-management health area(instruments to check&#xD;
      or reflect on their own health needs, as well as decision algorithms to detect the time of&#xD;
      delivery and postpartum alarm symptoms); 4) Clinical data área (the woman can have her&#xD;
      clinical data, include it and share it with other professionals) The objective of the study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the EMAeHealth tool and also its implementation&#xD;
      in the real world (its usability and acceptability, by women and professionals).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The usefulness of Maternal Education, as it is currently being developed, is being questioned&#xD;
      due to the obvious changes that have arisen in access to information by mothers and fathers,&#xD;
      and due to the changes that have occurred in childbirth care and in the attitude towards the&#xD;
      process of motherhood and fatherhood. There is no doubt, however, about the need to advise,&#xD;
      care for and accompany couples in this stage of physical, family and social change. To&#xD;
      respond to these new needs, the evidence indicates that a digital format may be the most&#xD;
      appropriate. So, the research team has designed, and intends to test, a web tool, which is&#xD;
      organized into 4 areas: 1) Information area: which will have information based on evidence,&#xD;
      permanently updated by health services professionals ; 2) Communication area: allows women to&#xD;
      contact other women in similar circumstances, through forums or conversations, or consult&#xD;
      with professionals 3) Self-management health area : who have valid and reliable&#xD;
      self-assessment instruments to check their own health needs, as well as decision algorithms&#xD;
      to detect the time of delivery and postpartum alarm symptoms; 4) Clinical data area: in which&#xD;
      the woman can collect clinical data, include the most recent and share it with other&#xD;
      professionals if she so wishes. The first area is open access, but not the other three, which&#xD;
      require a password. The objective is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the EMAeHealth&#xD;
      tool, and also its implementation in the real world (its usability and acceptability, by&#xD;
      women and professionals). Methods: The research team propose a hybrid&#xD;
      implementation-effectiveness design, which allows us to evaluate aspects related to the&#xD;
      context while evaluating the clinical efficacy of the tool. Discussion: A tool like the one&#xD;
      described is of interest to women, to professionals and also to the health system. Note-&#xD;
      Clinical Trials submision correspond to clinical effectiveness part of the study. Usability&#xD;
      and acceptability is not included because it use qualitative methods.&#xD;

    <measure>The primary outcome is change from baseline in Health-related quality of life, measured with the Spanish version of the Short Form 36 Health Survey</measure>

    <description>The Spanish version of the SF-36 questionnaire assess the health-related quality of life.It´s made up of 8 domains, of which 4 are oriented towards physical aspects and another 4 towards mental aspects of health-related quality of life. Two summaries are made of this physical and mental component, which explain between 80 and 85% of the variance. The scores of the questionnaire are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 points; the higher the score, the better the perception of health-related quality of life. A difference of 5 points in the domain score, or between 2 and 3 points in the summary score is considered clinically relevant. Vilagut G, 2005. doi:10.1157/13074369</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Self-efficacy for labor and childbirth, measured with the Spanish version of Lowe's Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory scales.</measure>
    <time_frame>29 weeks. Measurements alt 8th(baseline) and 37th of pregnancy.</time_frame>
    <description>The Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory (CBSEI) was developed by Nancy K Lowe in USA.The inventory is a self-report instrument that includes 62- items. It is divided into four subscales measuring both outcome expectancies, i.e. what behavior they think would be useful during labour as well as self-efficacy expectancies, i.e. how they think they will be able to conduct themselves during labour. The instrument measures these two dimensions of the self-efficacy construct, during both the first and the second stage of the labour process. The responses are distributed by a 15-item scale for the outcome expectancy scales and a 16-item scale for the self-efficacy expectancy scales. The response rates for all four scales range from 1 to 10; higher scores indicate a higher degree of childbirth self-efficacy. (Cunqueiro MJ, et al Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory: psychometric testing of the Spanish version. J Adv Nurs. 2009;65(12):2710-2718. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05161.x)</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Self-efficacy for breasfeeding, measured with The Spanish version of the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks. Measurements: at 1th(baseline), 6th and 16 weeks of portpartum period.</time_frame>
    <description>The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF) was developed to measure a mother's confidence in her ability to breastfeed her new infant. The BSES-SF is a 14-item, unidimensional, self-report instrument developed to measure a mother's confidence in her ability to breastfeed. All items are presented positively and anchored with a 5-point Likert-type scale where 1 indicates not at all confident and 5 indicates always confident. Higher scores indicate higher levels of breastfeeding self-efficacy. The translated Spanish version of BSES-SF scale can be considered a valid and reliable measure of maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy in Spain.

    <description>This team has designed a digital tool called EMAeHealth involving healthcare professionals. It is organized into 4 areas: 1) an Information area, 2) a Communication area, 3) a Health Self-management area, 4) a Clinical data area, The tool is conceived as a complement that can reinforce maternal health education with resources that facilitate its accessibility, and rapid remote response, which will also improve its results. It will be incorporated into the Osakidetza-Basque Health Service corporate Website.</description>
