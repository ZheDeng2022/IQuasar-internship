    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the utility of a newly developed clinician competence scale for those&#xD;
      delivering Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy for Eating Disorders (CBT-ED), specifically assessing&#xD;
      the inter-rater reliability of the measure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive-behavioural therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED) is currently one of the NICE&#xD;
      (2017) recommended treatments for anorexia nervosa and the only treatment recommended for&#xD;
      bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder and other specified feeing and eating disorders. When&#xD;
      clinicians adhere to evidence-based CBT-ED treatment manuals, CBT-ED has shown demonstrable&#xD;
      levels of effectiveness in a range of eating disorders, comparable to outcomes in controlled&#xD;
      research settings. A key component of CBT-ED found so effective in the treatment of eating&#xD;
      disorders is a stronger focus on behavioural change tasks which is key for changing biased&#xD;
      thinking. However, clinicians often drift from using behavioural change components and&#xD;
      instead focus more on the cognitive aspects of therapy, or indeed drift away from treatment&#xD;
      manuals substantially. Therefore, a suitable measure that can accurately assess how well a&#xD;
      clinician is delivering the therapeutic competences that ensures patients are receiving&#xD;
      evidence-based CBT-ED thus providing them with the best chance of reaching maximum recovery&#xD;
      is important. Whilst numerous scales have been developed, none have yet been found suitable&#xD;
      for eating disorders, as they do not have a strong focus on the key behavioural aspects of&#xD;
      CBT-ED. Therefore, a team of clinical researchers developed the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy&#xD;
      Scale for Eating Disorders (CBTS-ED). This pilot study will use CBT-ED therapy session&#xD;
      audio-recordings, and different expert and non-expert raters to a) assess the inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability of the CBTS-ED and b) assess whether the CBTS-ED can accurately detect&#xD;
      improvement in competence among clinicians currently undergoing post-graduate diploma&#xD;
      training in CBT-ED. The findings from this study will provide information about the&#xD;
      reliability of the CBTS-ED scale and its possible future uses in predicting patient outcomes.&#xD;

        Clinicians delivering Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Eating Disorders (CBT-ED) will be&#xD;
        assessed by independent raters using the Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy Scale for Eating&#xD;
        Disorders (CBTS-ED). Clinicians will be delivering therapy in either NHS or Non-NHS&#xD;
        organisations. A number of clinicians will be undergoing post-graduate diploma training in&#xD;
        CBT-ED at either the University of Sheffield or UCL.&#xD;
