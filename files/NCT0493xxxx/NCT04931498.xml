  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of cardiovascular disease is determined by the complex interplay between an&#xD;
      individual's genetic make-up, lifestyle, and the environment. The researchers in this&#xD;
      observational, cross-sectional, recall-by-genotype study are investigating two potential&#xD;
      genetic risk factors; the SWAP70 gene is thought to play a role in the immune response&#xD;
      modulating cardiovascular disease risk and the GMPR gene plays a role in red blood cell&#xD;
      formation. The investigators hope to identify and characterise distinct molecular and&#xD;
      cellular mechanisms underlying candidate functional variants identified in genetic studies of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and immune-related human traits and diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers who are part of the NIHR BioResource and have already been genotyped will&#xD;
      be invited to the study based on their genotype of the candidate functional variants of&#xD;
      interest. Volunteers will attend a single study visit, during which they will complete&#xD;
      procedures including a medical, demographic and lifestyle factors questionnaire; height,&#xD;
      weight and body fat assessments; in addition to blood pressure/heart rate measurements. A&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedure of a venepuncture will be performed to assess the primary&#xD;
      objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obtained data may (1) improve understanding of biological and disease mechanisms; (2)&#xD;
      identify potential drug targets; and (3) improve insight into the therapeutic potential and&#xD;
      limitations of existing and emerging therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is funded by the UK Medical Research Council, British Heart Foundation and NIHR&#xD;
      Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.&#xD;

        The study will only recruit healthy volunteers who have previously consented to being&#xD;
        contacted for future studies by the NIHR Cambridge BioResource, which is a panel of around&#xD;
        20,000 volunteers, both with and without health conditions, who are willing to be&#xD;
        approached to participate in research studies investigating the links between genes, the&#xD;
        environment, health and disease. Volunteers who join the NIHR BioResource have donated&#xD;
        their DNA via a blood or saliva sample that is used together with other information, such&#xD;
        as sex and ethnicity, to match them to specific research studies. Participants for this&#xD;
        study are identified by having the appropriate genetic sequence in one of the two genetic&#xD;
        loci we are investigating (SWAP70, GMPR).&#xD;
