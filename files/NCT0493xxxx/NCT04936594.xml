  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study proposal aims to modulate craving and attentional bias towards smoking cues&#xD;
      in 40 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI) brain correlates. TMS is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation and&#xD;
      modulates neural activity using tiny doses of focused electricity. For the study,&#xD;
      participants would perform two cognitive tasks and neuroimaging before and after the TMS and&#xD;
      investigators would compare changes in these paradigms with TMS. The investigators will also&#xD;
      get a point of contact urine drug screen before study initiation. The investigators will aim&#xD;
      to recruit 20 subjects in each arm of our trial (total of 40) from the BlueGrass HIV Clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) smoke at nearly three times the rate of the general&#xD;
      population. These extraordinary smoking rates are associated with greater AIDS-related&#xD;
      cancer, non-AIDS related morbidity including non-AIDS-defining cancer, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, pulmonary disease, and mortality. Smoking significantly impacts the progression and&#xD;
      outcome of HIV disease and has been identified as the leading contributor to premature&#xD;
      mortality in PLWHA. Suboptimal results with current smoking cessation strategies makes&#xD;
      identifying new adjunct strategies an area of need. The pilot study proposal aims to modulate&#xD;
      craving and attentional bias towards smoking cues in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)&#xD;
      using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with functional MRI (fMRI) brain correlates.&#xD;
      TMS is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation and modulates neural activity using tiny doses&#xD;
      of focused electricity. The TMS paradigm we would be performing is called theta burst&#xD;
      stimulation (TBS), which is potent, short, and efficient. It has shown to cause&#xD;
      neuroplasticity even with a single session and was approved by the FDA for treatment of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder in 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by using MNI coordinates&#xD;
      (-44,40,29) via Brainsight Neuronavigation will modulate craving and attentional bias that is&#xD;
      closely associated with craving. For this pilot study, 40 participants will perform the&#xD;
      attentional bias task, craving scale and neuroimaging before and after the TBS/ sham TMS&#xD;
      session, to compare changes in these paradigms between these interventions. Attentional bias&#xD;
      would be measured with eye tracking, craving will be assessed with tobacco craving&#xD;
      questionnaire (TCQ-SF). The investigators will aim to recruit 20 subjects in each arm of the&#xD;
      trial (total of 40) from the BlueGrass HIV Clinic, who have an established pipeline for&#xD;
      enrolling PLWHA patients in clinical trials. Although there is limited data on TMS in&#xD;
      smoking, there have been no TMS studies done in PLWHA&#xD;
