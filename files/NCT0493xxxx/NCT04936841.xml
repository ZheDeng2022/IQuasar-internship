  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate safety and efficacy of the combination of anti-PD1, NKTR-214, and&#xD;
      palliative radiation therapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      of the head and neck. Twenty-four participants will be enrolled to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      this combination.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following an informed consent process, participants will receive anti-PD-1 therapy with 200&#xD;
      mg of pembrolizumab and NKTR-214 at 0.006 mg/kg. Palliative radiation therapy will then be&#xD;
      delivered to tumor sites causing or felt by the treating physician to have a high potential&#xD;
      for causing symptoms with either 8 Gy X 3 or 4 Gy X 5 completed 3 to 7 days prior to cycle 2&#xD;
      of anti-PD1 and NKTR-214. Combined anti-PD-1 and NKTR-214 will then be delivered each&#xD;
      subsequent cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be measured by overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS),&#xD;
      overall survival (OS), clinical benefit (CB), and duration of response with ORR the primary&#xD;
      outcome being compared to historical control data. Toxicity will be evaluated prior to&#xD;
      administration of each 21-day cycle, while receiving NKTR-214 followed by every four months&#xD;
      after the participant is off trial. Health related quality of life questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed with cycle 1 and 2 and then every 4 cycles thereafter.&#xD;

             physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a diagnosed auto-immune disease (exceptions: subjects with controlled&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus type I, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo and alopecia&#xD;
             areata not requiring treatment with immunosuppressants are eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with a history of diabetes mellitus requiring systemic therapy within&#xD;
                  the past 3 months (i.e. either oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin) must have a&#xD;
                  documented Hemoglobin A1c &lt; 8.0 % within 90 days of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known genetic conditions causing pre-disposition to radiotherapy (RT)&#xD;
             toxicity (i.e.: Li-Fraumeni, ATM deficiency, active scleroderma, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack (TIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the&#xD;
             mother is being treated on study)&#xD;

             least three years prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prolonged Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt; 450 ms for men and &gt; 470 ms for&#xD;
             women at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with symptoms of ischemic cardiac disease, congestive heart failure, or&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within 6 months of registration and/or uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
             rhythm disturbance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or prior clinically&#xD;
             significant venous or non-CVA/TIA arterial thromboembolic event (e.g., internal&#xD;
             jugular vein thrombosis) within 3 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a history of a venous or arterial thromboembolic event must be&#xD;
                  asymptomatic prior to enrollment and must be receiving a stable regimen of&#xD;
                  therapeutic anticoagulation (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral&#xD;
                  anticoagulation (DOAC)). Use of coumadin is permitted; however, therapeutic&#xD;
                  dosing should target a specific international normalized ratio (INR) stable for&#xD;
                  at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. NKTR-214 has the potential to down-regulate&#xD;
                  metabolizing enzymes for coumadin for approximately 1 week after administration&#xD;
                  of each dose of NKTR-214. Due to the possibility of drug-drug interactions&#xD;
                  between coumadin and NKTR-214, frequent monitoring of INR and ongoing&#xD;
                  consideration of dose adjustments are warranted throughout the patient's&#xD;
                  participation on study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require, or are likely to require, systemic treatment doses of&#xD;
             corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive drugs, or have used them within 2 weeks of&#xD;
             registration (clarification: subjects receiving physiologic maintenance or replacement&#xD;
             doses of systemic steroids or inhaled steroids are eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active or chronic&#xD;
             hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, or with clinical evidence of hepatitis 15.&#xD;
             Subjects with known hypersensitivity to IL2 or those who experienced significant&#xD;
             immune-related AEs requiring treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressant&#xD;
             therapy during prior treatment with ipilimumab, or anti- PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint&#xD;
