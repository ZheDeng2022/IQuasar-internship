  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Superficial heat therapy is mainly used to relieve menstrual pain, but it does not penetrate&#xD;
      deeper than the skin tissue. In order to penetrate deep into the deep layers and promote&#xD;
      tissue relaxation, deep heat therapy can be effective. The treatment time for deep heat&#xD;
      treatment is controversial, and there is no study on deep heat treatment using radio&#xD;
      frequency for dysmenorrhea. Therefore, in this study, by applying radiofrequency waves at&#xD;
      different times to the lower abdomen for patients with primary dysmenorrhea, the pain and&#xD;
      changes in the autonomic nervous system were compared with thermotherapy to suggest&#xD;
      appropriate therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
