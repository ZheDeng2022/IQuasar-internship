      Gender dysphoria is manifested by an internal tension between biological sex and gender, that&#xD;
      is, by a non-congruence, in the subjects who suffer from it, between their sex of birth and&#xD;
      their social gender identity. Gender dysphoria is accompanied by the often overwhelming need&#xD;
      for a hormonal or even hormone-surgical transition. Gender dysphoria is very often&#xD;
      characterized by fluctuating mood sadness, irritability, obsessionality. An improvement in&#xD;
      the quality of life after medical treatment (hormone therapy) and gender reassignment surgery&#xD;
      has been described in the literature. Morphological similarities have been found between the&#xD;
      brains of women and the brains of so-called transgender women, as well as between the brains&#xD;
      of transgender men and men. These morphological data are only very fragmentary and have not&#xD;
      been supported by neuro-functional data. Self-awareness, which refers to the awareness that&#xD;
      an individual has of his body, his image and his own identity, is partly underpinned, at the&#xD;
      brain level, by the activation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) at rest, in non-pathological&#xD;
      conditions. The conflict between the internal perception of the own body and its objective&#xD;
      representation could result in a change in brain connectivity within the DMN, due in&#xD;
      particular to changes in the activation of the temporo parietal junction.&#xD;
