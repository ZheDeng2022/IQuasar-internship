  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort study was conducted to :1. explore the effective of diet intervention on&#xD;
      blood glucose control; 2. observe the changeable composition of microbiota; 3. seek the&#xD;
      possible microbiome intervened to prevent GDM.&#xD;

      1. Gestational diabetes mellitus（GDM） is one of the most complications during pregnancy and&#xD;
           it is associated with many adverse outcomes for both mother and children in short or&#xD;
           long term. Appropriate nutritional intervention is beneficial for the control of blood&#xD;
           glucose. However, the strategy of intervention and mechanism remain uncertain. Previous&#xD;
           studies have shown that diet maybe influence blood glucose via effecting the composition&#xD;
           of gut microbiome. Recently, most studies collect only one sample and combine with the&#xD;
           diet review, which have some limitations in revealing the effect of diet on gut&#xD;
           microbiota and the process of change in blood glucose. This study aims to achieve the&#xD;
           target of controlling blood glucose via diet intervention, which includes staple food&#xD;
           distribution, food list and nutritional advice, describe the change of gut microbiota in&#xD;
           women with GDM before and after the intervention via amplicon sequencing, estimate the&#xD;
           effectiveness of diet intervention on controlling blood glucose and explore the&#xD;
           correlation between the level of blood glucose and transition of bacterial diversity by&#xD;
           monitoring blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Furthermore, explore the mechanism of&#xD;
           &quot;diet-bacterial diversity-blood glucose&quot;. Investigators hope deeply understand the&#xD;
           mechanism of controlling blood glucose via diet intervention and find the effective diet&#xD;
           control, probable bacterial intervention, which may be applied in clinical practice.This&#xD;
           project is a prospective cohort study designed to explore the effect of diet to control&#xD;
           blood glucose on the composition of gut microbiota in women with GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study aims to enroll 50 participants with GDM and 20 participants with non-GDM. They&#xD;
           will be provided with medical nutritional intervention and need to collect stool samples&#xD;
           before and after intervention, separately. Nutritional professionals provide nutritional&#xD;
           suggestions to manage blood glucose via examining food diary . All participants need&#xD;
           exam glycated hemoglobin every two weeks and monitor fast blood glucose and 2 hour&#xD;
           postprandial blood glucose in a one day. Total times of monitoring blood glucose is at&#xD;
           least three times every week. Researchers record the situation of blood glucose both&#xD;
           groups. Besides, participants need collect stool sample at 28 weeks (before the&#xD;
           intervention) and 32 weeks (after the intervention), respectively. Samples will be&#xD;
           sequenced by amplicon to describe the effects of diet intervention on the gut&#xD;
           microbiome.&#xD;
