      Assess the subject acceptance of MPT, using therapy parameters that have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in terminating episodes of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

      A prospective non-randomized feasibility study involving acute testing of MPT in subjects&#xD;
      having a history of AF during clinically indicated acute electrophysiology procedures&#xD;
      including AF ablation, SVT ablation or diagnostic EP procedures (indicated procedure). The&#xD;
      primary outcome of the study is the subject response to questions regarding perception and&#xD;
      acceptability following MPT delivery.&#xD;

    <description>Question: &quot;Now I want you to think about your experiences with Atrial Fibrillation. Think about how it makes you feel, your daily life while in atrial fibrillation and your experience with in-clinic treatments for atrial fibrillation. If you could use the stimulation you just felt at home and under your control, would you use this stimulation therapy to stop your atrial fibrillation? Please answer yes or no.&quot;</description>

    <description>The study will be conducted using the venous cannulations that are standard of care for the indicated procedure. Additional access points may be necessary if access to coronary sinus is difficult from existing femoral venous cannulations. Sterile study leads or EP catheters will be temporarily placed into the RA, CS, and RV (for R-wave sensing using intracardiac electrograms - optional) which will be connected to the investigational device (CESS).&#xD;
Up to two MPTs will be delivered and subject responses following each MPT regarding perception and acceptability of MPT to treat AF will be obtained. MPT voltages will not exceed 100V.</description>
