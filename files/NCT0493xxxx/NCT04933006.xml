  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular events are still the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with&#xD;
      ESRD including hemodialysis patients . Although the conventional risk factors of CVD are&#xD;
      relatively recognized in general population, an inverse epidemiologic relationship has been&#xD;
      reported for many CV risk factors in CKD patients, including hypertension, BMI and lipid&#xD;
      profile .Therefore, a comprehensive investigation is necessary to be able to do effective&#xD;
      risk management strategies in this population and some surrogate markers are required to be&#xD;
      determined for illustrating the net effect of the risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While several mechanisms have been attributed to hypertension in hemodialysis (HD) patients,&#xD;
      the exact pathogenesis, impact, monitoring and control of hypertension in HD patients are&#xD;
      still challenging subjects in clinical nephrology. Both low and high BP associate with higher&#xD;
      mortality in HD. But a reliable marker for defining an optimal BP in HD is still an important&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems that arterial stiffness play an axial role in the cardiovascular and renal adverse&#xD;
      outcomes in CKD and HD, as it is in several other populations , Arterial stiffness has been&#xD;
      demonstrated as an independent predictor of mortality in hemodialysis patients . However,&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients experience a fluctuating hemodynamic state and there are several&#xD;
      limitations for consecutive measurement of arterial stiffness indices such as pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity (PWV). Furthermore, the expensive measurement devices and expert operators might not&#xD;
      be available in every dialysis center.&#xD;

      From 60 patients who were on a HD program in a HD center in a referral hospital, fifty one&#xD;
      individuals were included into the study. Patients on maintenance hemodialysis, for at least&#xD;
      12 hours per weeks were included into the study. But, patients with symptomatic CVD, AV&#xD;
      fistula on both arms, acute deteriorating states and any recent major trauma or patients who&#xD;
      refused measurements were excluded. No change in their current medication was administered.&#xD;
      All patients were on maintenance HD for at least 12 months and were assumed as good volume&#xD;
      controlled. Dialysis protocol with a mean sp KT/V = 1.4/ session, using Bicarbonate&#xD;
      dialysate, dialysate flow rate = 500cc /min was applied by Fresenius B 4008machine. BP was&#xD;
      measured using a validated automated device (Omron-HBP1300). Pulse wave analysis was&#xD;
      performed using the SphygmoCor (Sydney, Atcor Medical®,2005) to assess Augmentation Index&#xD;
      (AIx) as a surrogate for arterial stiffness, as well as several hemodynamic measures at the&#xD;
      recruitment and repeated in alive individuals after 5 years of follow-up. Similarly&#xD;
      Echocardiography was employed at the beginnings and repeated at the end of the study by EKO 7&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Ultrasound System (Samsung Medison©). A single observerwas responsible for&#xD;
      each series of measurements, double checked.&#xD;
