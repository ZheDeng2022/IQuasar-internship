  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blepharospasm (BSP) is a chronic, idiopathic, recurrent and progressive disease, which mostly&#xD;
      occurs in both eyes. It is mainly manifested as involuntary spasm of muscles around the eyes,&#xD;
      leading to uncontrollable narrowing or even closure of blepharospasm. Although there is no&#xD;
      pain in BSP patients, it can cause social or psychological dysfunction, make patients feel&#xD;
      difficult in driving, reading and working, and seriously affect the social, work and life of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression and anxiety are common and harmful mental disorders. At present, less than 40% of&#xD;
      patients with depression can get effective treatment. Using simple and effective screening&#xD;
      tools can effectively improve the detection rate of depression, so that patients can get&#xD;
      timely and effective treatment. It is also an effective measure to prevent suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has achieved gratifying results in the treatment of&#xD;
      dyskinesia. It has been confirmed that BTX-A has a significant effect on BSP. The effective&#xD;
      rate is 70% - 90%. About 50% of the patients can regain normal or near normal visual&#xD;
      function. At present, no prospective studies have explored this association between&#xD;
      blepharospasm and depression / anxiety, and whether BTX-A can improve this mood disorder.&#xD;
      Therefore, our research goal is to further study the relationship between blepharospasm and&#xD;
      depression / anxiety, sleep in a prospective way, and to determine whether BTX-A treatment&#xD;
      will affect depression / anxiety symptoms, so as to provide more theoretical basis for&#xD;
      clinical treatment.&#xD;
