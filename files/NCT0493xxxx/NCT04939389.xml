    <textblock>
      Eight parameters measurable by the sensor &quot;Orthelligent Pro&quot; are compared with traditional&#xD;
      measurements based on a goniometer or video taping. The aim is to inform potential users&#xD;
      about the distribution of the differences they have to expect when moving from traditional&#xD;
      measurement methods to the new sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will perform eight corresponding movement exercises at a single study visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients suffering from musculo-skeletal disorders, the restoration of full functioning is&#xD;
      an important goal of many interventions. Assessment of functioning is often based on&#xD;
      corresponding tests. If functioning is related to specific movement patterns, accelerometers&#xD;
      and similar sensors are promising to allow a simple and objective assessment, and may replace&#xD;
      traditional assessment methods, e.g. based on measurements with the goniometer. Corresponding&#xD;
      products tend to enter the market and face clinicians and patients with the question, to&#xD;
      which degree they are reliable and comparable with the traditional assessment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a sensor named &quot;Orthelligent Pro&quot; has been released by the medical device company&#xD;
      OPED and is today commercially available. The sensor - to be attached to the knee of a&#xD;
      subject - offers the opportunity to assess several parameters related to movement patterns in&#xD;
      the lower extremities that are of relevance in the rehabilitation process of orthopedic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current project is to inform potential users of this sensor about the&#xD;
      difference they have to expect when compared to traditional assessment techniques of the same&#xD;
      parameters and about the reproducibility of the measurements both based on the sensor and&#xD;
      based on traditional assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of a single clinic will be offered participation. The patients will perform the&#xD;
      eight exercises at a single study visit arranged as an addition to a routine follow up visit.&#xD;
