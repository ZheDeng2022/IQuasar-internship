  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site single arm feasibility study of single-fraction Stereotactic MRI-guided&#xD;
      Adaptive Radiation Therapy (SMART) for primary or metastatic carcinoma involving the lung,&#xD;
      liver, adrenal gland, abdominal/pelvic lymph node, pancreas, and/or kidney. Stereotactic&#xD;
      ablative body radiation therapy (SABR) is a highly-focused radiation treatment that gives an&#xD;
      intense dose of radiation concentrated on a tumor, while limiting the dose to the surrounding&#xD;
      organs.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion of participants with a change in acute and late toxicity results who experience acute grade 3 or higher toxicity attributable to SABR will be determined along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. For patients receiving SABR to multiple lesions, acute toxicity will be determined from the date of the initiation of SABR.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, up to 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported quality of life will be determined using the FACT-G survey instrument. Fact-G is a 27-item questionnaire that covers four HR-QOL sub-domains: physical, social, emotional, and function well being. Each question will be scored from a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) using a manual scoring template in which some items are reverse.</description>

             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has received prior radiation therapy that directly overlaps any radiation&#xD;
             therapy given in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has received radiation therapy that could lead to an unacceptably high risk of&#xD;
             clinically significant normal tissue injury due to high cumulative normal tissue dose&#xD;
             as determined by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
