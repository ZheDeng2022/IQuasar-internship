  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Priapism is a urological emergency that is defined as a prolonged penile erection lasting&#xD;
      more than 4 h, remaining despite orgasm and in the absence of sexual stimulation. There are&#xD;
      three sub-types of priapism: Ischaemic, non- ischaemic and stuttering. The most common (95%&#xD;
      cases) of these is ischaemic priapism (IP), which represents a compartment syndrome of the&#xD;
      corpus cavernosa with minimal or no arterial flow into the penis. It causes time-dependent&#xD;
      smooth muscle damage that can result in significant morbidity (including, permanent erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction (ED), penile shortening, penile curvature and loss of girth) with- out prompt&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike ischemic priapism, non-ischemic priapism is not a urologic emergency, both the&#xD;
      American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) recommend&#xD;
      conservative, non-operative, management for the treatment of NIP. Spontaneous resolution has&#xD;
      been documented to occur in 62% of patients [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the very high burden of priapism and its time-dependent adverse effect on erectile&#xD;
      function, few studies have comprehensively defined the clinical epidemiology of this&#xD;
      complication nor have any compared sexual dysfunction in men with SCD with that in those&#xD;
      without it. Evidence-based treatment strategies for priapism are currently lacking,&#xD;
      especially in terms of sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the various publications in the literature, even today the published studies&#xD;
      show considerable bias, in terms of sample size, evaluation of reproducible outcomes, use of&#xD;
      internationally validated questionnaires, well-defined follow-up evaluation, as well as the&#xD;
      evaluation of outcome after medical or surgical treatment. For this reason, the purpose of&#xD;
      this international register is precisely to shed light on what may be the responses to&#xD;
      medical surgical treatment in patients with priapism, but in particular to set up a rational&#xD;
      data collection that has solid scientific bases.&#xD;

      Aims and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous premises, the aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      management of priapism from a sexual and clinical long-term outcomes point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual outcomes will be assessed by measured questionnaire (e.g. IIEF-15) at 3-6 months after&#xD;
      priapism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes will be registered as rates of resolution of acute priapism within 30'&#xD;
      after the onset of treatment (defined as no need for further non-surgical/surgical&#xD;
      interventions to resolve priapism episode), corporal injury (fibrosis or necrosis), adverse&#xD;
      events including erectile dysfunction, penile curvature/Peyronie's disease, requirement for&#xD;
      surgical management of priapism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study is designed as a prospective data collection through a registry, and since&#xD;
      there are no comparative analyses between different groups, it is not possible to identify a&#xD;
      priori sample size. However, considering that the largest case history on the field of&#xD;
      priapism amounts to a total of 112 patients [3], we believe that collecting data from a total&#xD;
      of 200 patients is sufficient in order to obtain scientifically reliable results with a high&#xD;
      scientific profile.&#xD;
