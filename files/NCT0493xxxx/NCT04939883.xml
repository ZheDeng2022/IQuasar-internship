  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoplasia is the main cause of general death in the Brazilian population. In 2016, they were&#xD;
      responsible for approximately 211,343 (16%) deaths, followed by cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      (12.6%). Despite the high mortality rate of neoplasia, oncological treatment have advanced&#xD;
      substantially in recent decades improving the prognosis of patients. However, growing&#xD;
      evidence suggest that some oncological agents may induce significant toxicity that may play a&#xD;
      major role in the quality of life, morbidity and mortality. The cardiovascular system is&#xD;
      often negatively affected with cancer therapy, predisposing several patients to stop&#xD;
      appropriate treatments or to have cardiovascular events related to the cardiotoxicity. The&#xD;
      most typical manifestation of cardiotoxicity and related consequences (heart failure) are&#xD;
      related to the use of anthracyclines. Anthracyclines are part of the chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
      solid tumors and hematological neoplasms in children and adults, and are associated with an&#xD;
      increase in life expectancy. Carvedilol is an α and β-blocker that also has antioxidant&#xD;
      properties. Preliminary studies have shown that carvedilol and its metabolites prevent lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation, inhibit the formation and inactivate free radicals, in addition to preventing&#xD;
      the depletion of endogenous antioxidants, such as vitamin E. These effects would potentially&#xD;
      prevent anthracycline injury but definitive evidence is still needed. This is a multi-center,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that aims to establish the efficacy of&#xD;
      carvedilol for the primary prevention of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in cancer&#xD;
      patients obtained with anthracycline chemotherapy, in different schedules and doses.&#xD;
