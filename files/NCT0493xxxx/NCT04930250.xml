  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whilst a cause-and-effect relationship between consumption of oat ß-glucans and reduction in&#xD;
      PPGR has been demonstrated, little is understood about its:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Application to liquid matrices: There are few studies which looked into the effect of a&#xD;
           dose of ß-glucan applicable to beverages. Previous studies have explored oat ß-glucan&#xD;
           doses between 2g to 13g per serving of test product (Note: the oat ß-glucan dose for the&#xD;
           proposed trial is &lt;2g).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact following processing: Collectively, oat processing, ß-glucan structure and its&#xD;
           physiological impact on PPGR are closely linked. Some studies have investigated the&#xD;
           effect of oat processing or dosage on PPGR, but to our knowledge, no study has&#xD;
           systematically characterised the effect of processing on oat structure, and clinically&#xD;
           measured its subsequent impact on PPGR.&#xD;

      The proposed study is a randomised, double blind, controlled, crossover trial to investigate&#xD;
      the postprandial effects on glycemic response and related biomarkers/biological surrogates in&#xD;
      five test product beverages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the post-prandial effects of five test products, including two&#xD;
      controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Beverage powder with 12% oat bran processed with method A (Test Product: TP-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Beverage powder with 12% oat bran processed with method B (Test Product: TP-2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Beverage powder with 12% oat bran processed with method C (Test Product: TP-3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Beverage powder with 12% unprocessed oat bran (Positive Control) (Test Product: TP-PC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Beverage powder without oat bran (Negative Control) (Test Product: TP-NC)&#xD;
