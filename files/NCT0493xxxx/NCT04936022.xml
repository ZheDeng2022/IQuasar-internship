  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure affects many people in the United Kingdom. People with raised blood&#xD;
      pressure (140-159/90-99 mmHg) are recommended to make changes in their lifestyle (e.g.&#xD;
      smoking/alcohol/diet/exercise) and/or medication in order to reduce their blood pressure.&#xD;
      Current knowledge suggests that a particular type of exercise - isometric exercise - can&#xD;
      lower blood pressure. Isometric exercise involves holding a fixed body position for a short&#xD;
      period of time. As most of the information about the benefits of this type of exercise comes&#xD;
      from laboratory-based studies, researchers want to find out if it is possible for GP&#xD;
      practices to offer NHS patients with clinically high blood pressure an isometric exercise&#xD;
      plan to do at home and how it might affect their blood pressure over 6 months. They will also&#xD;
      find out the experiences of those doing this type of exercise and whether it can be done&#xD;
      consistently at home over time.&#xD;
