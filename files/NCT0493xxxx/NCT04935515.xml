  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the peak of the second COVID -19 wave, the hospitals were over-crowded. Many COVID -19&#xD;
      positive patients had to stay at home and reach out to their family physicians for guidance.&#xD;
      Medical follow-up for these patients was a daunting challenge. As in - patient hospital&#xD;
      facilities were not readily accessible due to over crowding, early objective tests to&#xD;
      identify home quarantined patients prone to deterioration and timely medical intervention to&#xD;
      avoid hospitalization were required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on early assessment of inflammatory markers like CRP and clinical signs like persistent&#xD;
      high-grade fever, need-based early medical intervention was initiated in home quarantined&#xD;
      COVID -19 patients prior to the onset of hypoxia, in order to avoid complications and&#xD;
      hospitalization&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      25 home quarantined COVID -19 patients who contacted online for medical guidance underwent&#xD;
      clinical and biochemical evaluation. Radiological evaluation was done only if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on early objective biochemical tests like elevated CRP and clinical signs like&#xD;
      persistent high-grade fever on the third or fourth day after onset of symptoms, early medical&#xD;
      treatment was initiated prior to onset of hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the 25 patients recovered without any complications and did not require hospitalization.&#xD;
