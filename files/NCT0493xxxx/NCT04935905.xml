  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the agreement of MIE devices measurement of MIE&#xD;
      assisted peak cough flow (PCF) compared with a pneumotachographs during usual MIE care. This&#xD;
      will be the first study to do this through range of MIE pressures and include patients who&#xD;
      are receiving MIE via a tracheostomy. It will also aim to evaluate the intra-subject&#xD;
      repeatability of measures for patients who receive more than one MIE cycle as part of their&#xD;
      usual care. It will be the first to measure MIE assisted PCF contemporaneously during&#xD;
      intervention using the gold standard pneumotachograph. This will inform treatment effect size&#xD;
      and the efficacy of usual practice MIE in augmenting PCF measurements above critical cut off&#xD;
      values for effective cough and secretion clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally the study will also aim to understand how patients perceive the impact of MIE in&#xD;
      clearing secretions from their chest by asking them to rate presence of chest secretions pre&#xD;
      and post intervention using a visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with a neuromuscular disease (NMD) lose strength in their breathing muscles which&#xD;
      leads to an inability to generate an effective cough. Peak Cough Flow (PCF) is a simple&#xD;
      objective measure of cough and is the recommended measure in patients with NMD. Critical peak&#xD;
      cough flow values are used to evaluate cough, these include PCF less than 160 L/min to&#xD;
      indicate an ineffective cough, PCF between 161- 270 to indicate an impaired cough and PCF&#xD;
      greater than 270 L/min to indicate an effective cough. Mechanical insufflator- exsufflator&#xD;
      (MIE) devices more commonly known as 'cough assist' devices have an inbuilt measure of PCF&#xD;
      however they aren't currently recommended for use to due to limited information available&#xD;
      regarding their accuracy. This will be a single centre prospective observational study. Once&#xD;
      patients have consented to participate in the study, they will be visited once on the unit&#xD;
      during their admission by the researcher with the visit lasting approximately an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visit they will receive their usual care MIE with a pneumotachograph fitted into&#xD;
      the circuit. The primary outcome is the agreement of MIE assisted PCF measures between the&#xD;
      MIE device and pneumotachograph. Before and after the intervention the patient will be asked&#xD;
      to rate the presence of mucous in their lungs using a visual analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
