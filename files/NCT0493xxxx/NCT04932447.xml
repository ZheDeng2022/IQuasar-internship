    <textblock>
      This clinical research study will investigate the effects of respiratory strength training on&#xD;
      blood pressure and cardiovascular health in adults who are between the ages of 50-80 and have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has well-documented benefits for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and cardiovascular&#xD;
      health. Whereas current guidelines advocate ~150 min moderate intensity exercise/week, our&#xD;
      preliminary data show ~5 min/day of inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) for 6 weeks&#xD;
      lowers casual (resting) SBP by ~12 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This simple approach to lowering BP could be applied to almost any population however we are&#xD;
      studying IMST in older adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is an ideal population&#xD;
      to target because OSA prevalence is growing and because snoring and apneas result in chronic&#xD;
      intermittent hypoxemia that drives sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity,&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. These substantive risks for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      are compounded by poor adherence to the mainstay treatment continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (&lt;50%), obesity, fatigue and a robust intolerance for exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our findings in healthy young adults (n=50) show IMST-related reductions in BP are mediated&#xD;
      by decreases in systemic vascular resistance, suggesting changes in vascular tone and&#xD;
      function. Consistent with this hypothesis, our results from a pilot clinical trial in adults&#xD;
      with OSA (n=24) show IMST-related reductions in plasma norepinephrine levels (PNE) and muscle&#xD;
      sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), both markers of SNS activity. Our preliminary mechanistic&#xD;
      assessments indicate IMST may lower circulating concentrations of other vasoconstrictor&#xD;
      factors and increase nitric oxide (NO)-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation. And, findings&#xD;
      in a novel endothelial cell culture model, point to increases in NO and declines in reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. However, it is unknown if: 1) IMST lowers casual&#xD;
      and 24-h (ambulatory) SBP in older adults with OSA; 2) the reductions in SBP are&#xD;
      long-lasting; 3) arterial stiffness, NO-mediated endothelial dilation and/or oxidative stress&#xD;
      are improved; and 4) if adherence in this population is high long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we will establish the efficacy of&#xD;
      high-intensity IMST (75% maximum inspiratory pressure, [PImax]) 5 days/week for 24 weeks vs.&#xD;
      low-intensity IMST (15%PImax) (n=61/group) for lowering SBP in adults (&gt;50 years) with above&#xD;
      normal BP and OSA. We hypothesize that IMST will lower SBP via reductions in SNS activity and&#xD;
      circulating vasoconstrictor factors, improvements in vascular function, and reductions in&#xD;
      oxidative stress/inflammation and that reductions in SBP will be sustained 4 and 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline casual Systolic Blood Pressure at 24 weeks, 28 weeks, and 36 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, Week 24, Week 28, and Week 36 to establish the intermediate and long-lasting effects of IMST</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is casual (resting) systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured by both relative and absolute changes from baseline. SBP will be assessed in accordance with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Measurements will be taken using an automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer and will be performed in triplicate over the brachial artery of the non-dominant arm after 5 minutes of quiet rest, with 1 minute of recovery between measures. SBP will be defined as the average of the 3 pressures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline 24-hour Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure at 24 weeks, 28 weeks, and 36 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, Week 24, Week 28, and Week 36 to establish the intermediate and long-lasting effects of IMST</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint is 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure measured by both relative and absolute changes from baseline. We will obtain continuous measures of systolic and diastolic blood pressure over a 24-h period with an FDA approved and European Society of Hypertension validated Non-Invasive Ambulatory Blood Pressure monitor. Blood pressure data will be broken into daytime (16 hour) and nighttime (8 hour) segments according to participants' individual sleep-wake cycles. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mmHg) will be calculated for the daytime and nighttime periods to evaluate circadian systolic and diastolic blood pressure profiles.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Plasma Norepinephrine at 24 weeks, 28 weeks, and 36 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, Week 24, Week 28, and Week 36 to establish the intermediate and long-lasting effects of IMST</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint is Plasma Norepinephrine (PNE), a marker of sympathetic activity, measured by both relative and absolute changes from baseline. PNE will be determined from venous (antecubital area) blood samples and quantified via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). PNE will be measured following a fasting blood draw collected between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 am, preceded by 30 minutes supine rest in a quiet, temperature-controlled room.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Nitric Oxide-mediated Endothelial Dependent Dilation (EDD) and suppression of EDD by oxidative stress at 24 weeks, 28 weeks, and 36 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, Week 24, Week 28, and Week 36 to establish the intermediate and long-lasting effects of IMST</time_frame>
    <description>Brachial artery Flow Mediated Dilation (BA-FMD), a well-established measure of NO-mediated endothelial function, will be measured by both relative and absolute changes from baseline. BA-FMD will be determined using high-resolution ultrasonography and analyzed with a commercially available software package. An ultrasound probe will be placed 3-6 cm proximal to the antecubital crease on the right arm and a baseline image of the right brachial artery will be obtained. Following baseline, reactive hyperemia will be produced by inflating a rapid-inflating blood pressure cuff. Brachial artery diameter change will be measured for 2 minutes following 5-min of forearm blood flow occlusion. To determine tonic oxidative stress-mediated suppression of BA-FMD the difference in BA-FMD observed with and without supraphysiological infusion of vitamin C will be measured.</description>

    <description>Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (CFPWV) will be will be measured by both relative and absolute changes from baseline. CFPWV determined via transcutaneous tonometry of the carotid and femoral arteries will be recorded consecutively.

    <description>We asses the influence of circulating factors on endothelial NO and ROS by measuring both relative and absolute changes from baseline. We will expose cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, American Type Culture Collection) ex vivo, to media conditioned with serum drawn from participants' blood samples to determine if IMST improves endothelial function via changes in circulating factors that increase endothelial cell NO production and/or reduce endothelial ROS production.</description>

    <description>Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity (MSNA) will be measured by both relative and absolute changes from baseline. MSNA recorded via microelectrode inserted into the common peroneal nerve immediately posterior to the fibular head. Electrode placement will be confirmed via electrical stimulation.

    <description>A six-minute walk test will be performed in a 30-meter hallway with cones to mark the ends of the track. The subject will be instructed to walk as quickly as they can, without running, for six minutes. They will start at the first cone and walk down the hallway, rounding the second cone, and returning up the hallway toward the first cone. They will continue to walk up and down the hallway, completing as many laps as possible in six minutes. Subjects will be told how much time is remaining every minute of the test, and with 30 seconds and 10 seconds remaining, and encouraged to walk as quickly as possible each time. Distance covered in six minutes will be recorded.</description>
