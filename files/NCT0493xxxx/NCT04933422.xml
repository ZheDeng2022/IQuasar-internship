  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study of CM93, an oral investigational drug, in adults with&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-modified glioblastoma. The study is designed in three parts&#xD;
      consisting of a dose-escalation phase, a dose-expansion phase and a window-of-opportunity&#xD;
      surgical trial. The trial objectives are to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and clinical effects of CM93 in this patient population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CM93 is a third-generation, covalent/irreversible, brain penetrant small molecule Epidermal&#xD;
      Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is not a substrate of&#xD;
      p-glycoprotein or breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) and is a mild inhibitor of bcrp. It&#xD;
      is a potent inhibitor of EGFR mutations but also has activity against wild type EGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first-in-human phase I trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of CM93 and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further&#xD;
      evaluation using a 3+3 design (Part 1). Once the RP2D has been determined 12 additional&#xD;
      patients will be treated in a dose expansion cohort to confirm the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the selected dose (Part 2). Subsequent to the phase I trial a window-of-opportunity surgical&#xD;
      trial will initiate. Tumor from both contrast enhancing and non-contrast enhancing areas of&#xD;
      patients who received CM93 before surgery will be resected and evaluated to determine if&#xD;
      therapeutic concentrations of the drug are achieved. Pharmacodynamic studies will be&#xD;
      conducted in tumor tissue from patients who received CM93 before surgery and the patients who&#xD;
      did not receive drug before surgery to determine if there is adequate inhibition of EGFR.&#xD;
      After recovery from surgery all 30 patients will receive CM93 until progression, development&#xD;
      of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent and preliminary evidence of activity will&#xD;
      be obtained.&#xD;

&#xD;
             2. Participants who have had prior treatment with any EGFR inhibitor, or VEGF or VEGFR&#xD;
             inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Participants who have had temozolomide less than 23 days from study initiation,&#xD;
             treatment with CCNU or BCNU less than 42 days from study initiation, or treatment with&#xD;
             any cancer-directed systemic therapy less than 4 weeks or 5 half-lives from study&#xD;
             initiation, whichever is shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;

             patients in the window-of-opportunity surgical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Participants who received radiation therapy within 12 weeks prior to registration,&#xD;

&#xD;
             10. Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, azole antifungals, protease inhibitors, nefazadone,&#xD;
             grapefruit juice) or those metabolized by CYP 3A4/3A5 are ineligible. Caution is&#xD;
             advised for participants taking dexamethasone as well as strong inducer(s) of its&#xD;
             metabolism. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important&#xD;
             to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant will be counseled on the risk&#xD;
             of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the participant is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. Participants with known human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency&#xD;

             study drug: uncontrolled congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association&#xD;
             Classification 3 or 4), angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident,&#xD;
             coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft surgery, transient ischemic attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
             13. Pulmonary embolism within 1 month prior to initiation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             14. Unstable cardiac dysrhythmias or persistent prolongation of the QTc (Fridericia)&#xD;
             interval to &gt;450msec for males or &gt;470msec for females.&#xD;
&#xD;
             15. Any contraindication to contrast-enhanced MRI examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             16. Evidence of Grade ≥ 2 intracranial hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
             17. Participants with any severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition,&#xD;
             or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study drug administration, may interfere with the informed consent&#xD;
             process and/or with compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere&#xD;
             with the interpretation of study results and, in the Investigator's opinion, would&#xD;
             make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             18. Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including active or&#xD;
             clinically unstable bacterial, viral or fungal infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             19. Pregnant women are excluded from this study; there are no reproductive toxicity&#xD;
             data at the stage of development in animals. CM93 may have potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CM93,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with CM93.&#xD;
&#xD;
             20. Previous malignancy, except for non-squamous cell cancer of the skin or carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ of the uterine or cervix, unless the natural history or treatment of the tumor&#xD;
             does not interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational&#xD;
             regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             21. Participants with difficulty swallowing/unable to swallow pills; malabsorption&#xD;
             syndrome; refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease or&#xD;
             previous significant bowel resection with clinically significant sequelae that would&#xD;
             preclude adequate absorption of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional criteria for window-of-opportunity surgical cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        22. Participants with &gt;2 prior relapses of glioblastoma.&#xD;
