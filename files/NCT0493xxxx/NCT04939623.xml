  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will address the problem of opioid withdrawal. Opioids are&#xD;
      essential for pain-relief in the short term, but their continued use is associated with a&#xD;
      host of adverse effects. People living with chronic pain who were initiated on opioid therapy&#xD;
      now find themselves with a major life-changing problem - dependence on opioid medications.&#xD;
      Opioid withdrawal symptoms are a key barrier to decreasing or stopping their opioid&#xD;
      medication. Currently, there are few medications that ameliorate the symptoms of opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal. This problem is a major part of the opioid crisis in Canada, and impacts people&#xD;
      across all demographics and socioeconomic status. A misconception is that only individuals&#xD;
      with opioid use disorder are susceptible to opioid withdrawal; on the contrary, appropriate&#xD;
      use of prescription opioids to manage pain can lead to significant symptoms of opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal when it is reduced or stopped. Patients in Alberta who are at risk for opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal, either from prescribed use or misuse will be primarily impacted by this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently explored the underlying causes of opioid withdrawal and&#xD;
      identified an important target in the spinal cord that is responsible for producing&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms in rats and mice. The target, a protein called pannexin-1 (Panx1), is&#xD;
      located throughout the body, specifically in the brain and spinal cord. Using sophisticated&#xD;
      biochemical, genetic, and pharmacological techniques, the investigators demonstrated how&#xD;
      Panx1 on immune cells is implicated in the production of opioid withdrawal symptoms after&#xD;
      cessation of fentanyl and morphine in opioid dependent rodents. The investigators then&#xD;
      attenuated these symptoms of withdrawal using probenecid, a drug which inherently blocks&#xD;
      Panx1 activity. Because probenecid is a safe and clinically available drug, the findings&#xD;
      could be immediately translated into clinical therapy to support people who are struggling&#xD;
      with the symptoms of opioid withdrawal and provide clinicians with a safe and effective&#xD;
      option for caring for this population.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Our team has recently explored the underlying causes of opioid withdrawal and identified an&#xD;
      important target in the spinal cord that is responsible for producing withdrawal symptoms in&#xD;
      rats and mice. The target, a protein called pannexin-1 (Panx1), is located throughout the&#xD;
      body, specifically in the brain and spinal cord. Using sophisticated biochemical, genetic,&#xD;
      and pharmacological techniques, the investigators demonstrated how Panx1 on immune cells is&#xD;
      implicated in the production of opioid withdrawal symptoms after cessation of fentanyl and&#xD;
      morphine in opioid dependent rodents. The investigators then attenuated these symptoms of&#xD;
      withdrawal using probenecid, a drug which inherently blocks Panx1 activity. Because&#xD;
      probenecid is a safe and clinically available drug, the findings could be immediately&#xD;
      translated into clinical therapy to support people who are struggling with the symptoms of&#xD;
      opioid withdrawal and provide clinicians with a safe and effective option for caring for this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probenecid was initially developed in the early 1950s as a tool to enhance the activity of&#xD;
      penicillin and allow for outpatient treatment of various infections. It increases plasma&#xD;
      levels and the half-life of weak organic acids (penicillins, cephalosporins, or other&#xD;
      beta-lactam antibiotics) by competitively inhibiting their renal tubular secretion. As a&#xD;
      result, it became widely used in combination with beta-lactam antibacterial agents. It is&#xD;
      still occasionally used today in combination with cefazolin for the treatment of skin and&#xD;
      soft tissue infections, and in combination with cefoxitin or doxycycline as an option for&#xD;
      outpatient treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probenacid also competitively inhibits active reabsorption of uric acid at the level of the&#xD;
      proximal convoluted tubule promoting excretion of uric acid, thereby reducing serum urate&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probenecid is also used in combination with cidofovir for the prevention of cidofovir-related&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity when used to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with HIV. More&#xD;
      recently, the effects of probenecid on serotonin levels and TRPV2 channels has led to&#xD;
      speculation about its utility in depression, Parkinson's Disease, and congestive heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug is no longer commercially available in Canada but is commercially available as 500&#xD;
      mg tablets in the United States which can be acquired through Health Canada's Special Access&#xD;
      Program. Probenecid can, however, be prepared in Canada by compounding pharmacies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single centre, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical&#xD;
      trial meant to study probenecid use among adult participants living with chronic non-cancer&#xD;
      pain using opioid drug therapy on a daily basis and planning to voluntarily reduce their&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
