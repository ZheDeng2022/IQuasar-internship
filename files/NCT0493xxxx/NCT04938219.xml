  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shivering is known to occur in around 40% of women as a side effect of neuraxial anaesthesia&#xD;
      during caesarean section.Women undergoing caesarean section under neuraxial anaesthesia are&#xD;
      randomised into either the treatment group or control group. Women in both groups are&#xD;
      observed during caesarean section. This study is to test a non-pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-invasive treatment with two groups, an intervention and a control group. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, intraoperative shivering during caesarean section is treated by placing&#xD;
      two surgical gloves filled with warm water into the women's hands. In the control group,&#xD;
      women will be treated with the current standard of care, which does not include specific&#xD;
      treatment of shivering.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shivering is an involuntary, repetitive activity of skeletal muscles that often, but not&#xD;
      exclusively, occurs as a thermoregulatory response to cold. It is associated with neuraxial&#xD;
      anaesthesia and is therefore a commonly observed phenomenon during caesarean sections. The&#xD;
      main cause for this is a sympathetic block of vasoconstriction in the legs, leading to&#xD;
      cutaneous heat loss and lower core temperature. This is not always accompanied by a cold&#xD;
      sensation, because the perceived skin temperature is increased. Out of all common side&#xD;
      effects of neuraxial anaesthesia, shivering is perceived as the most uncomfortable and&#xD;
      disruptive one. It can also interfere with monitoring of blood pressure, oxygen saturation&#xD;
      and legibility of electrocardiograms. It increases the metabolic rate and oxygen consumption&#xD;
      by up to 400%. Therefore, lactic acid and carbon dioxide production are significantly&#xD;
      increased. Pregnant women have reduced cardiac and pulmonary reserves and may therefore have&#xD;
      less capacity to adapt to the increased metabolic demands caused by shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of shivering during caesarean section at the University Hospital Basel was&#xD;
      determined by a previous study to be 41.0%. Studies have been conducted about pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment options for intraoperative shivering during caesarean section. However,&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment in pregnant and breastfeeding women is best reduced to a minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to test a non-pharmacological and non-invasive treatment with two groups, an&#xD;
      intervention and a control group. In the intervention group, intraoperative shivering during&#xD;
      caesarean section is treated by placing two surgical gloves filled with warm water into the&#xD;
      women's hands. In the control group, women will be treated with the current standard of care,&#xD;
      which does not include specific treatment of shivering. The warm water method has been used&#xD;
      by doctors to reduce shivering, but the actual effects of it have never been scientifically&#xD;
      proven. The gloves will be used as a treatment, not a prophylactic measure. Therefore, only&#xD;
      the women who exhibit shivering during surgery will be treated.&#xD;

    <description>Shivering is evaluated during caesarean section 5 minutes after intervention. Shivering is graded on a scale from 0 (No shivering) to 4 (Violent muscular activity that involves the entire upper body) .The score will be recorded before the intervention and at 2 and 5 minutes after initiation of the intervention, as well as after arrival at the recovery area. Score: 0 - No shivering.&#xD;
- No visible muscle activity, but one or more of piloerection, peripheral vasoconstriction or peripheral cyanosis (other causes excluded).&#xD;
- Muscular activity in only one muscle group.&#xD;
- Moderate muscular activity in more than one muscle group, but not generalized shaking.&#xD;
- Violent muscular activity that involves the entire upper body.</description>
