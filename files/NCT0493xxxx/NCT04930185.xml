  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to over 200 countries worldwide and is still on the rise in&#xD;
      88 countries. Unfortunately, Malaysia is not the exception and registered 340,642 COVID-19&#xD;
      cases till 29 March 2021 since the outbreak of the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 virus can be transmitted from an infected person to others through droplets when&#xD;
      coughing or sneezing as well as by touching objects infected with the virus. Although&#xD;
      precautionary measures, which include the regular and mandatory use of face masks, reducing&#xD;
      crowds, and physical distancing, have been widely encouraged by WHO and the Malaysian&#xD;
      government, getting COVID-19 vaccination remain the way forward to curb the wide spread of&#xD;
      the virus and to return to the normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the public awareness on the importance of getting vaccinated is still low with high&#xD;
      level of vaccination hesitance and refusal. In Malaysia, this challenge is compounded further&#xD;
      due to a lack of COVID-19 vaccination educational intervention programme in Bahasa Malaysia&#xD;
      to educate the predominantly larger group in the population who are more conversant in ther&#xD;
      national language. In order to improve the acceptance rate towards the COVID-19 vaccination&#xD;
      in Malaysia, it is imperative to design a comprehensive intervention program that will&#xD;
      increase the awareness and knowledge with regards to the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine as&#xD;
      a solution in overcoming this pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this in mind, this study aims to identify the correlational factors of COVID-19 and&#xD;
      develop an educational intervention programme on COVID-19 vaccination and thereafter, assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of this educational intervention programme.&#xD;

      Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the association among vaccination intention, attitudinal belief, subjective&#xD;
           norms, perceived behavioral control, vaccine hesitancy and its reasons among the&#xD;
           Malaysian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop an educational intervention Programme on COVID-19 vaccination to increase&#xD;
           knowledge, positive attitudes, and acceptance toward COVID-19 vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the effectiveness of the educational intervention programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Ministry of Sciences and Technology (2021) reported that the percentage of&#xD;
           Malaysians who voluntarily registered for the COVID-19 vaccine is still low. The&#xD;
           researcher, therefore, hypothesize that the level of knowledge, positive attitudes, and&#xD;
           acceptance towards the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysian population to be rather low.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The researcher hypothesize that there is an association among vaccination intention,&#xD;
           attitudinal belief, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, vaccine hesitancy&#xD;
           and its reasons among the Malaysian population&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The researcher hypothesize that the educational intervention programme has a&#xD;
           statistically significant effect on reducing vaccination hesitancy and vaccination&#xD;
           refusal between the baseline and the assessment soon after the program as well as at 3&#xD;
           months after the programme as compared to the control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study There are 2 phases in this study. Phase 1 is the cross-sectional study, while Phase&#xD;
      2 will look into the programme development and feasibility and the implementation of a&#xD;
      cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Cross-sectional Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design &amp; procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This cross-sectional study will utilize both online and paper questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The sample will be recruited through both voluntary response sampling and snowball&#xD;
           sampling methods. The survey will be sent out to Malaysian who are more than 18 years&#xD;
           old in the online social media platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To ensure the cross-sectional study to be effective, the researcher decided our sample&#xD;
           size based on Krejcie &amp; Morgan (1970) method that has commonly and widely been used in&#xD;
           simple random sampling studies for each sample. Thus, for a wide of 32 million of&#xD;
           population in Malaysia, the researcher had targeted for a total of 384 participants are&#xD;
           sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. This cross-sectional study aims to examine the association among vaccination intention,&#xD;
           attitudinal belief, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, vaccine hesitancy&#xD;
           and its reasons among the Malaysian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site and participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The cross-sectional study will be taking place in online setting. A few social media&#xD;
           platforms are chosen for this purpose such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and&#xD;
           et-cetera.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment materials and survey will be shared on the social medial platforms and&#xD;
           advocate public to share among others who are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (a): Programme Development and Feasibility Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design &amp; procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A group of experts consisting of public health experts in health education, health&#xD;
           psychology, and other health-care providers (communicable disease background) will hold&#xD;
           online meetings (Focus Group Discussions) to develop the modules for the Programme based&#xD;
           on literature review, best practices in the field and in consultation with public health&#xD;
           experts and other ministerial departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For a focus group discussion (FGD) to be effective, the number of participants shall&#xD;
           between 6-8 per group (Krueger &amp; Casey, 2002). The researcher will target 8 per group&#xD;
           and organize up to 5 groups and/or when the researcher reach data saturation points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The FGDs will aim to build the content and activities of the Programme. The core members&#xD;
           of this research team will finalise the Programme structure, before holding a second&#xD;
           online meeting with the experts involved to confirm its validity. This Programme will&#xD;
           continue to be refined throughout the study based on the feasibility study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (b): Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design &amp; procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Programme, a cluster randomised controlled trial&#xD;
           with three assessment points (Baseline, immediate after intervention and 3-month&#xD;
           follow-up) will be conducted with the materials and outcome measures listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This will be a study based on pre/post multiple time series study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Students from the School of Medical &amp; Life Sciences, Sunway University, Faculty of&#xD;
           Social Sciences, Quest University International, Ipoh and Centre of Community Health&#xD;
           Studies, UKM will be engaged in the design and development of the approved content. By&#xD;
           doing so, students from various universities would have a chance to apply what they have&#xD;
           learned in the classrooms into the real life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Materials will be in the form of pamphlet, webinar content and SMS and in Bahasa&#xD;
           Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-inferiority designed will be used to show that the new treatment is as effective but&#xD;
           need not superior when compared to the standard treatment (Zhong, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For non-inferiority design, the formula is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Based on the recent published results, non-response rate of standard vaccine rate is&#xD;
           reported to be 7% (Khubchandani et al., 2021). Thus, sample size required would be:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  N= 2 x [(1.645+0.845)/0.1]2 x 0.07 x (1-0.07)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  N= 80.7 (approximately 81 participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, the researcher will recruit at least 100 participants in&#xD;
           each category for each education material used, making a total of 300 for each site&#xD;
           (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site and participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The cluster randomised controlled trial with three parallel arms (i.e., 3 intervention&#xD;
           groups ) will be performed in both West and East Coast Malaysia. One major health&#xD;
           facility/university will be selected and approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment materials designed will be shared and distributed both online and offline to&#xD;
           the health facilities, schools, churches, mosques, temples, NGOs, recreation malls and&#xD;
           societies.&#xD;
