      QUESTION. Does duroplasty improve outcome after spinal cord injury?&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT DO WE STUDY? We will investigate whether performing a surgical procedure called&#xD;
      duroplasty improves outcomes after spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHY SPINAL CORD INJURY? Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition that causes permanent&#xD;
      disability such as paralysis, numbness and loss of bladder and bowel control. Currently,&#xD;
      there are no treatments shown to improve outcome after spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS DUROPLASTY? Duroplasty is an operation that involves opening the tough membrane&#xD;
      around the cord, called the dura, and stitching a patch of artificial dura to expand the&#xD;
      space around the swollen cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHY IS DUROPLASTY BEING STUDIED? Based on our preliminary evidence, we think that the dura&#xD;
      causes cord pressure after injury. We have shown in a small study of patients that performing&#xD;
      this operation safely and effectively reduces pressure on the injured cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO IS ELIGIBLE? Adult patients with severe spinal cord injuries in the neck who will have&#xD;
      surgery within 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT TREATMENT? Those who agree to take part will be allocated by chance (like tossing a&#xD;
      coin) to standard treatment or standard treatment plus duroplasty. Some patients will also be&#xD;
      asked to take part in a smaller study that involves placing probes at the injury site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHERE? We will recruit patients from U.K. Major Trauma Centres. Most assessments will be done&#xD;
      in U.K. Spinal Injury Centres. Later on, we may recruit from overseas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOW LONG? We aim to recruit 222 - 260 patients over 4 years. Patients will be followed up for&#xD;
      a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT DO WE ASSESS? Patients will be assessed (using questionnaires and by examination) how&#xD;
      well they can use their hands, walk, control their bladder and bowel and their quality of&#xD;
      life. Some of these assessments will be repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE OPTIONAL MECHANISTIC STUDY? DISCUS includes an optional study for at least 50&#xD;
      patients who will take part in the randomised controlled trial. The aim of the mechanistic&#xD;
      study is to determine how duroplasty improves outcome, i.e. whether duroplasty reduces cord&#xD;
      compression, improves blood flow to the injured cord perfusion, improves cord metabolism and&#xD;
      reduces cord inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE OPTIONAL INFORMATION STUDY? For the first two years, a study called QuinteT&#xD;
      Recruitment Intervention (QRI) is designed to optimise patient recruitment and informed&#xD;
      consent in the trauma setting.&#xD;

      RESEARCH QUESTION: After severe traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), does the addition of&#xD;
      dural decompression to bony decompression (includes laminectomy) improve muscle strength in&#xD;
      the limbs at 6 months, compared with bony decompression alone? BACKGROUND: TSCI is a&#xD;
      devastating condition that affects about 1,000 people in the UK annually. Most remain&#xD;
      disabled, tetraplegic or wheelchair bound and are dependent on carers with significant cost&#xD;
      to patients, carers and the NHS. Surgery aims to reduce spinal deformity, stabilise the spine&#xD;
      and achieve bony decompression of the cord. To date, no treatments have been shown to improve&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS / OBJECTIVES: The primary aim is to determine if, in patients with acute, severe TSCI,&#xD;
      the addition of dural decompression to bony decompression improves muscle strength. We&#xD;
      hypothesise that, after TSCI, the cord swells and is compressed against the dura. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to assess patient impact i.e. functional outcomes, health related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQoL), complication rates and mortality. Mechanistic sub-studies aim to determine if&#xD;
      the addition of duroplasty improves cord perfusion, reduces cord ischaemia and cord&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This is a prospective, phase III, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT). We&#xD;
      aim to recruit 222 adults with acute, severe cervical TSCI (American spinal injuries&#xD;
      association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A, B or C) who will be randomised 1:1 to undergo&#xD;
      bony decompression alone versus bony decompression with duroplasty. Patients and assessors&#xD;
      will be blinded to study arm. The primary outcome is change in AIS motor score (AMS) at 6&#xD;
      months compared with admission (Delta-AMS); secondary outcomes will assess function (grasp,&#xD;
      walking, urinary + anal sphincters), HRQoL, complications, need for further surgery and&#xD;
      mortality, assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months from randomisation. A&#xD;
      subgroup of 50 patients (25 per arm) will also have observational monitoring from the injury&#xD;
      site using a pressure probe (intraspinal pressure ISP, spinal cord perfusion pressure SCPP)&#xD;
      and microdialysis (MD) catheter (cord metabolism: tissue glucose, lactate, pyruvate,&#xD;
      lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (LPR), glutamate, glycerol); cord inflammation: tissue&#xD;
      chemokines/cytokines. Patients will be recruited from the 26 UK major trauma centres (MTCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIMELINES FOR DELIVERY: The study duration is 72 months and includes 6 months set-up, 48&#xD;
      months recruitment, 12 months to complete follow-up and 6 months for data analysis and final&#xD;
      reporting of results. There will be a formal stop/go review at month 15 (after 9 months of&#xD;
      recruitment) to ensure a minimum of 4 sites have been opened and 8 patients randomised. If&#xD;
      these targets are met, the trial will recruit for a further 36 months. Data from the pilot&#xD;
      will be included in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANTICIPATED IMPACT AND DISSEMINATION: It is anticipated that the addition of duroplasty to&#xD;
      standard of care will improve muscle strength in patients; this has obvious benefits for&#xD;
      patients and their carers as well as substantial gains for the NHS and society including&#xD;
      economic implications. If this RCT shows that the addition of duroplasty to standard&#xD;
      treatment is beneficial, it is anticipated that duroplasty will become standard NHS care in&#xD;
      all 26 UK MTCs. Participants will be informed of study findings via the Surgical Intervention&#xD;
      Trials Unit (SITU) website and the Spinal Injuries Association (SIA).&#xD;
