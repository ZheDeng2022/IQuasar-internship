      In this study, the &quot;Curve of Intraoperative Body Temperature Change in Patients with VATS&#xD;
      Surgery&quot; was taken as the main research content to retrospectively analyze the intraoperative&#xD;
      body temperature and its change rules of patients who met the research conditions, and draw a&#xD;
      trend curve, namely, the curve of body temperature change.Taking &quot;time&quot; as the independent&#xD;
      variable and &quot;body temperature&quot; as the dependent variable, the correlation between the two&#xD;
      was statistically analyzed.Through the development of the body temperature change curve, we&#xD;
      can further understand the phenomenon that the body temperature of patients undergoing VATS&#xD;
      surgery changes with the progress of surgery, and longitudinal understand the change trend&#xD;
      and the general rule of the body temperature change.The results can provide a basis for&#xD;
      clinical development of scientific preoperative evaluation plan, hypothermia prevention&#xD;
      strategy and intraoperative intervention plan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a common malignant tumor. With the increasingly serious air pollution and the&#xD;
      arrival of the aging society, the prevalence of lung cancer is increasing year by&#xD;
      year.According to the Globocan 2018 Cancer Report, published 2018 by the International Agency&#xD;
      for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization,Lung cancer accounted for&#xD;
      11.6% of new cases and 18.4% of deaths from malignancies globally in 2018, ranking first&#xD;
      among malignancies.As the mainstream surgical treatment of lung cancer, video-assisted&#xD;
      thoracic surgery (VATS) has many advantages such as less trauma and rapid recovery of&#xD;
      patients, and has become one of the preferred methods for the treatment of lung cancer,&#xD;
      especially early lung cancer.It has been widely used at home and abroad.However, with the&#xD;
      more and more extensive development of VATS surgery, the phenomenon of intraoperative&#xD;
      hypothermia in patients is relatively common clinically.The study results of Cywinski et al.&#xD;
      showed that the rate of hypothermia after thoracoscopic surgery could reach&#xD;
      50%.Intraoperative hypothermia can lead to adverse effects such as increased cardiovascular&#xD;
      events, coagulation dysfunction, prolonged wound recovery time, increased risk of wound&#xD;
      infection, immune system suppression, and slow drug metabolism [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative hypothermia means that the body's core body temperature is less than 36℃ due to&#xD;
      various reasons during the perioperative period, also known as perioperative unexpected&#xD;
      hypothermia or unplanned perioperative hypothermia.Perioperative hypothermia can be caused by&#xD;
      any factor that may affect thermoregulation.Risk factors affecting thermoregulation mainly&#xD;
      include patient anesthesia factors, self factors, surgical factors, environmental factors,&#xD;
      etc. [13].Operation when the room temperature is too low, inadequate coverage and other&#xD;
      factors leading to excessive heat loss surgery (room temperature as a given intravenous&#xD;
      fluids and rinses, evaporation of the skin disinfectant, etc.), lead to the low temperature&#xD;
      of unplanned, patients not only affect the function of blood coagulation, lead to increased&#xD;
      perioperative blood loss, also can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, and can&#xD;
      suppress the immune function,It can lead to postoperative infection and even more serious&#xD;
      adverse outcomes.Intraoperative hypothermia involved in this study includes perioperative&#xD;
      hypothermia, which is an important clinical manifestation of perioperative hypothermia.It is&#xD;
      found in clinical practice that the proportion of intraoperative hypothermia in patients&#xD;
      undergoing VATS surgery is high, which is closely related to the specific surgical position&#xD;
      and surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current studies on intraoperative hypothermia in patients undergoing VATS surgery [15-16]&#xD;
      mainly focus on the comparison of intervention methods, including the selection of&#xD;
      intervention methods, the effect comparison of heating equipment, or the effect comparison of&#xD;
      heating sites.However, there has been no in-depth study on the specific changes of body&#xD;
      temperature and the trend of body temperature changes during VATS surgery.At the same time,&#xD;
      the intervention time point for intraoperative hypothermia is mainly judged by clinical&#xD;
      experience, and there is a lack of support from objective data studies.Clinical observation&#xD;
      shows that the changes of body temperature in patients undergoing VATS surgery are not a&#xD;
      straight line, nor a simple arc, but a curve that changes continuously with the operation&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the &quot;Curve of Intraoperative Body Temperature Change in Patients with VATS&#xD;
      Surgery&quot; was taken as the main research content to retrospectively analyze the intraoperative&#xD;
      body temperature and its change rules of patients who met the research conditions, and draw a&#xD;
      trend curve, namely, the curve of body temperature change.Taking &quot;time&quot; as the independent&#xD;
      variable and &quot;body temperature&quot; as the dependent variable, the correlation between the two&#xD;
      was statistically analyzed.Through the development of the body temperature change curve, we&#xD;
      can further understand the phenomenon that the body temperature of patients undergoing VATS&#xD;
      surgery changes with the progress of surgery, and longitudinal understand the change trend&#xD;
      and the general rule of the body temperature change.The results can provide a basis for&#xD;
      clinical development of scientific preoperative evaluation plan, hypothermia prevention&#xD;
      strategy and intraoperative intervention plan.Moreover, it can further study the influence of&#xD;
      various factors, such as surgical factors, anesthesia factors and patients' own factors, on&#xD;
      the temperature change curve, so as to provide a basis for clinical intervention.&#xD;
