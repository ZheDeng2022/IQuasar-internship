    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety of the use of the following safety lancets: Medlance&#xD;
      Plus and myLance in the prevention of needle-stick injury (NSI) and to evaluate the user's&#xD;
      opinion with regard to the handling characteristics of the medical devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simulated use clinical study involves healthcare professionals (HCPs) who routinely use&#xD;
      safety lancets to collect blood samples.&#xD;
