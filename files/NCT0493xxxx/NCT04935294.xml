    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, nonrandomized, multi-center, single-dose, parallel group study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of severe renal impairment (RI) on the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of danicopan (ACH-0144471) compared to&#xD;
      demographically-matched healthy participants with normal renal function.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Participants with RI must have met the following additional criteria to be enrolled in this&#xD;
        study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A stable medication regimen was required. Concomitant medications must have been&#xD;

             14 days prior to check-in and use of any over-the-counter, nonprescription&#xD;
             preparations within 7 days prior to check-in, unless deemed acceptable by the&#xD;
             Investigator (or designee).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donation of whole blood from 3 months prior to study drug administration, or of plasma&#xD;
             from 30 days prior to study drug administration; receipt of blood products within 6&#xD;
             months prior to check-in.&#xD;

          -  Participant did not produce sufficient urine output to permit urine sampling at&#xD;
             screening and/or check-in; history of urinary incontinence prior to check-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of kidney transplant or actively on a transplant waiting list prior to&#xD;
