  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that the FGF signaling pathway is closely related to endocrine&#xD;
      therapy resistance in breast cancer, but there is not sufficient evidence for the combination&#xD;
      of endocrine therapy and FGFR inhibitors. Anlotinib is a highly effective VEGFRs, FGFRs,&#xD;
      PDGFRs multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Therefore, we conducted this single-arm,&#xD;
      single-center phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of anlotinib&#xD;
      combined with fulvestrant in patients with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients with&#xD;
      FGFR mutation and resistance to aromatase inhibitor therapy, to provide new treatment options&#xD;
      for these patients.&#xD;

      Endocrine therapy resistance is an unsolved problem in the treatment of HR+/HER2- metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer. Previous studies have shown that the FGF signaling pathway is closely related&#xD;
      to endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer, but there is not sufficient evidence for&#xD;
      the combination of endocrine therapy and FGFR inhibitors. Anlotinib is a highly effective&#xD;
      VEGFRs, FGFRs, PDGFRs multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which can effectively block the&#xD;
      migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and reduce tumor microvessel density. The&#xD;
      drug inhibits VEGFRs, FGFRs, PDGFRs to exert anti-angiogenesis effects and to achieve&#xD;
      anti-tumor effects. Therefore, we conducted this single-arm, single-center phase II clinical&#xD;
      study to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of anlotinib combined with fulvestrant in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer patients with FGFR&#xD;
      mutation and resistance to aromatase inhibitor therapy, to provide new treatment options for&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
