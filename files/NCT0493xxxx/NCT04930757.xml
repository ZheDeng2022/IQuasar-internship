    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional transversal research whose main objective is to quantify the&#xD;
      population of reverse migrating neutrophils in patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentric (3 sites) clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size :&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population concerned:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized in intensive care with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR from a&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of participation (treatment + follow-up): until the patient is discharged from the&#xD;
      ICU and within 2 months top.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis is planned. Analysis will be performed at the end of the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of circulating neutrophils in reverse migration</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 hours following the patient admission in Intensive Care Units (ICU).</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of circulating neutrophils in reverse migration determined on a sample taken during the admission of COVID 19 patients to Intensive Care Units by flow cytometry: the samples will be incubated for 45 minutes with anti-human CXCR1, CD11c, CD11b, and CD62L antibodies. Erythrocytes will be lysed and fixed leukocytes will be analyzed by flow cytometry.</description>

    <description>The analysis of neutrophils and platelets, and of the inflammatory environment will be carried out on a sample taken on admission of patients to Intensive Care Units&#xD;
Phenotypic and functional analysis of neutrophils&#xD;
Measurement of the oxidative explosion&#xD;
Measurement of neutrophil apoptosis&#xD;
Measurement of intravascular NETosis&#xD;
Analysis of platelet aggregation and activation&#xD;
Quantification of the fraction of immature platelets (IPF)&#xD;
Contribution of platelets to clot stiffness&#xD;
ELISA assay of soluble platelet activation markers&#xD;

    <measure>SAPS II score</measure>

    <description>Assessment of the link between phenotypic and functional markers of neutrophils on admission to the ICU.&#xD;
The severity of the disease is determined using clinical scores (SAPS II (&quot;simplified acute physiology&quot;) and SOFA (&quot;Sequential Organ Failure Assessment&quot;) (global SOFA, respiratory and non-respiratory) scores; these scores will be assessed during the period of hospitalization in Intensive Care Units. An association between these 2 scores (SAPSII and SOFA scores) and the neutrophil markers will be sought.</description>
