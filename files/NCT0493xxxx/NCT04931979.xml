      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pembrolizumab therapy of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with standard salvage radiation therapy (SRT) in patients with biochemical&#xD;
      recurrence (BCR) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence after radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      (RP).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend a salvage radiation therapy (SRT) with at least 66 Gy as&#xD;
      preferred treatment option in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) resp. PSA&#xD;
      (prostate-specific antigen) persistence after radical prostatectomy (RP). The guideline&#xD;
      recommendation is based on two non-randomized controlled trials that showed an improved&#xD;
      cancer-specific survival and a better local tumor control. The optimal timing for a radiation&#xD;
      therapy cannot be clearly defined by the available literature. A radiation therapy as early&#xD;
      as possible with a PSA level &lt;0,5 ng/ml seems to be beneficial. The guideline recommendation&#xD;
      is based on two non-randomized controlled trials that showed an improved cancer-specific&#xD;
      survival and a better local tumor control. A complete biochemical response is to be expected&#xD;
      in approx. 60-70% of patients after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The established imaging modality in patients with BCR used to be computed tomography of the&#xD;
      abdomen and bone scintigraphy for the detection of skeletal lesions. The introduction of PSMA&#xD;
      PET/CT (prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography combined with CT) has&#xD;
      changed the imaging in patients with recurrent prostate cancer and several studies could show&#xD;
      improved oncological results compared to patients undergoing standard treatment without&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) positive lesions with a 10% improvement in biochemical&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival after 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy alone has not yet proven to be efficacious in prostate cancer as a monotherapy&#xD;
      in smaller studies. Several trials could show that the combination of the immunotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy has the potential to provide a synergistic effect in treating genitourinary&#xD;
      malignancies, whereas more studies are needed to uncover the exact underlying mechanism. In&#xD;
      brief, radiation therapy of the location of recurrence increases the tumor´s immunogenic&#xD;
      potential and a systemic immunological reaction is initiated that leads to an increased&#xD;
      activity of the immune system against tumor tissue (abscopal effect). Lately several trials&#xD;
      have been evaluating a possible synergistic effect with tolerable side-effects. A trial&#xD;
      combining those two treatment regimens in the early treatment of prostate cancer recurrence&#xD;
      is not available up to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical benefit of concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is controversial and&#xD;
      literature failed to show a clear overall survival benefit for all patients. Several&#xD;
      retrospective trials have been evaluating a concomitant ADT and for patients with risk&#xD;
      factors like suspicious lymph-nodes in staging diagnostics. Several studies have been&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of concomitant ADT though. Shipley et al. could show the addition of 24&#xD;
      months of bicalutamide to SRT resulted in significantly higher rates of long-term overall&#xD;
      survival. However, sub-group analyses revealed that this effect counts mainly for patients&#xD;
      with PSA of &gt;0.7 ng/ml before SRT. The GETUG-AFU trial did not find any survival benefit for&#xD;
      short term (6 months) ADT additionally to SRT. However, a significant benefit in&#xD;
      progression-free survival after 120 months of follow-up time was reported. A combination&#xD;
      therapy of pembrolizumab and radiation therapy has not been evaluated before in this patient&#xD;
      population. The investigators hypothesize that this combination is more effective than&#xD;
      radiation therapy alone due to a radiogenic triggered immunomodulation which increases the&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect of pembrolizumab. For patients with BCR or PSA persistence after RP no such&#xD;
      treatment regimen has been tested yet.&#xD;
