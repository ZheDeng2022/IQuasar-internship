  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of severe cognitive and physical disability. Despite the high and&#xD;
      increasing incidence, and large health, economic, social and personal consequences, studies&#xD;
      designed to remedy cognitive impairments and improve rehabilitation care following stroke are&#xD;
      lacking. A promising line of research have shown that weak electrical current (tDCS) can be a&#xD;
      safe, cost-effective, and potent treatment when combined with other rehablitational&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanism is assumed that tDCS facilitates neuronal signaling, improving&#xD;
      plasticity and facilitating rehablitational outcome. But further research is needed to better&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms at hand, and to better evaluate the potential clinical utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope for the current project is to investigate both cognitive and neuronal effects of&#xD;
      tDCS in combination with cognitive training , with the ultimate goal to improve current&#xD;
      rehabilitational healthcare. To achieve this we will use multimodal MRI, EEG, and a&#xD;
      comprehensive battery of neuropsychological asessment, to describe and evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      tDCS in rehabilitation purposes.&#xD;

      Participants are randomly assigned to either active or sham condition, using codes provided&#xD;
      by the manufacturer and implemented by an in-house Matlab script, pseudo-randomizing&#xD;
      participants while maintaining balance in groups of 20. tDCS stimulation is applied at six&#xD;
      occasions for each participant, with a minimum of 48 hours between stimulations, aiming at an&#xD;
      average of two stimulations per week. Stimulation current is1000 μA, stimulation time was 20&#xD;
      min for the active group with a ramp-up time of 120 s and fade-out time of 30 s. The current&#xD;
      intensity is limited to 1 mA to limit the risk of adverse events due to the electrical&#xD;
      stimulation. The sham stimulation consists of ramp-up followed by 40 s of active stimulation&#xD;
      and then fade-out, following factory settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive training will be done by the computerized working memory training program (Cogmed&#xD;
      Systems AB, Stockholm, Sweden) consisting of 25 online training sessions. In this study, to&#xD;
      increase feasibility, we utilize 17 sessions over a period of three to four weeks,&#xD;
      corresponding to approximately five weekly training sessions. On average, we aim at two&#xD;
      training sessions combined with tDCS per week with a minimum of one day between each tDCS&#xD;
      session. The remaining CCT sessions are performed at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological assessments and MRI assessments are conducted three times: at baseline 1,&#xD;
      after a waiting period of 2-4 weeks (baseline 2, before intervention) and immediately post&#xD;
      intervention. Self-reported symptoms of fatigue and depression are assessed at five time&#xD;
      points, before, during and after completing intervention.&#xD;
