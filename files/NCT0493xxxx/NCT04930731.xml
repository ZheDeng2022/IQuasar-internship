  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus, severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2, was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in&#xD;
      December 2019 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following weeks, infections spread across China and other countries around the world .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chinese public health, clinical, and scientific communities took action to allow for&#xD;
      timely recognition of the new virus and shared the viral gene sequence to the world .&#xD;
&#xD;
      On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public&#xD;
      Health Emergency of International Concern&#xD;
&#xD;
      . On February 12, 2020, the WHO named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus&#xD;
      &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of international experts, with a range of specializations, have worked with Chinese&#xD;
      counterparts to try to contain the outbreak .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary reports suggest that patients with an underlying malignancy have inferior&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While haematology patients are thought to be at increased risk of developing severe&#xD;
      complications both due to immune dysfunction from their underlying haematological disorder&#xD;
      and immunosuppressive therapies used for treatment, delays in treatment of the underling&#xD;
      malignancy may compromise patient safety and survival. Data from other cohorts worldwide&#xD;
      suggest mortality from COVID-19 is higher in haematology patients compared to the general&#xD;
      population, with reported mortality rates between 39% and 50% in other British haematology&#xD;
      patient cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, a recent UK case series reported significantly higher case fatality rates in&#xD;
      haematology patients receiving immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy within three months of&#xD;
      COVID-19 diagnosis, raising concerns about the delivery of systemic anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
      (SACT) during the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an ongoing need to share collective experience regarding the clinical course of&#xD;
      COVID-19 in patients with haematological disorders, particularly regarding implications for&#xD;
      SACT delivery, in order to enable patients to receive treatment in a timely and safe manner&#xD;
      during the pandemic.&#xD;
