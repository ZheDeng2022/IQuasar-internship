      Adapt and evaluate a decision aid for patients with rectal cancer. Phase1: decision aid&#xD;
      testing (Delphi) A pilot version of the Belgian decision aid was developed and validated&#xD;
      through a double Delphi procedure. In this study, the assessment is extended to several&#xD;
      multicentre experts. The panel consists of ten experts who have extensive knowledge in the&#xD;
      field of rectal cancer or scientific research. They are asked to evaluate the information and&#xD;
      questions on accuracy, clarity, readability and relevance. They score the items of the&#xD;
      decision aid using a 4-point Likert-type scale (one (one = totally irrelevant; four = very&#xD;
      relevant) and a dichotomous scale (one = clear, two = not clear) to assess relevance and&#xD;
      clarity of wording, respectively (see Appendix 2 to this application). To quantify the degree&#xD;
      of content validity, the Content Validity Index (CVI) is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase2: pilot test decision aid The final step of the study is a pilot test of the decision&#xD;
      aid with patients who will undergo surgery/watch and wait strategy in the near future and&#xD;
      with healthcare professionals who work with the decision aid. The aim is to test the&#xD;
      acceptability of the decision aid with the patient and the ease of use with the healthcare&#xD;
      professional. With the feedback from the patients and the healthcare professional, the&#xD;
      decision aid can be further refined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the consultation in which the intervention is discussed, the consent to participate&#xD;
      will be asked of the patient and also of the informal carer who may be present at that&#xD;
      moment. Participation in the study means that during this consultation, the caregiver&#xD;
      involved will go through the decision aid completely with the patient and any informal carer.&#xD;
      After the intervention, they will be asked to give feedback on their experiences with the use&#xD;
      of the decision aid. This will be done by means of an interview for the patients, informal&#xD;
      carers and care workers involved. The interview with the patient (and informal carer if&#xD;
      applicable) will take place at home or in the hospital, depending on their preference. The&#xD;
      interview with the caregiver takes place in the hospital where the caregiver works. If the&#xD;
      current Covid-19 pandemic does not allow for a visit to the patient's home or to another&#xD;
      hospital, the interviews will be conducted by telephone or video call.&#xD;
