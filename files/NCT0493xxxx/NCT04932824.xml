  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop an effective vaccine against the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection, Clover Biopharmaceuticals is conducting a Phase 1 study&#xD;
      (CLO-SCB-2019-001) in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      SCB-2019, a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike protein (S-protein) subunit vaccine. This&#xD;
      study, CLO-SCB-2019-002, will be a long-term follow-up study for subjects who have completed&#xD;
      CLO-SCB-2019-001 in order to assess longer safety and immunogenicity up to 24 months after&#xD;
      the 1st dose of vaccination.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once a subject has completed the 6-month visit of study CLO-SCB-2019-001, he/she will enter&#xD;
      this study automatically, since subjects were requested to sign the informed consent form for&#xD;
      this long term follow-up study at the same time they consent to study CLO-SCB-2019-001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study CLO-SCB-2019-001 ends and the treatment assignments are unblinded, those subjects&#xD;
      who have received placebo and provided there is active study vaccine available, will be given&#xD;
      the option to receive 2 doses of active study vaccine 21 days apart (defined as treatment&#xD;
      cross-over). Afterwards they will be followed up until 18 months after the 1st dose of the&#xD;
      cross-over vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that received SCB-2019 vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 in study CLO-SCB-2019-001 will&#xD;
      be followed up for safety only for 12 months after the 1st dose received (V10, day 366).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following descriptive statistics will be used as applicable to summarize the study data&#xD;
      unless otherwise specified. Individual subject data will be presented in listings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous variables: sample size [n], mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum&#xD;
           [Min], and maximum [Max].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Categorical variables: frequencies and percentages. All safety analyses will be&#xD;
           performed on the Safety Analysis Set. Adverse events will be coded using Medical&#xD;
           Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) central coding dictionary, version 22.0&#xD;
           (or higher). The percentage of subjects with at least 1 adverse event (AE), adverse&#xD;
           event of special interest (AESI), or serious adverse event (SAE) will be tabulated with&#xD;
           exact 95% confidence interval (CI) for each treatment and overall. Adverse events/SAEs&#xD;
           leading to withdrawal and all pregnancies occurring during the study period will be&#xD;
           tabulated with exact 95% CI. The percentage of subjects with at least 1 local AE&#xD;
           (solicited and unsolicited), at least 1 general AE (solicited and unsolicited) and any&#xD;
           AE will be tabulated, with exact 95% CI. The same computations will be done for Grade 3,&#xD;
           any AEs considered related to vaccination, any Grade 3 AEs considered related to&#xD;
           vaccination, SAEs and AESIs. Analysis of immunogenicity will be based on the Per&#xD;
           Protocol Set. If, at any timepoint, the percentage of vaccinated subjects with&#xD;
           serological results excluded from the Per Protocol Set for analysis of immunogenicity is&#xD;
           10% or more, a second analysis based on the Immunogenicity Analysis Set will be&#xD;
           performed to complement the Per Protocol Analysis. Observed values and ratio/change from&#xD;
           Baseline values (as applicable) will be summarized for each treatment (placebo, vaccine,&#xD;
           and with addition of each adjuvant) and at each timepoint where blood samples are&#xD;
           collected. Individual data listings of any Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases&#xD;
           during the study will be provided. Number of cases that undergo COVID-19 workup as well&#xD;
           as the incidence of COVID-19 positive results will be individually listed and summarized&#xD;
           using summary statistics per treatment group and per protocol scheduled time point. Time&#xD;
           to COVID-19 positive result will also be summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods and the&#xD;
           median time to COVID-19 positive result will be estimated and presented with the 95%&#xD;
           CIs, if estimable, separately for each treatment group. In addition, clinical risk&#xD;
           assessment of COVID-19 at the time of the case workup as assessed by the National Early&#xD;
           Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) system will be individually listed and summarized per treatment&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
