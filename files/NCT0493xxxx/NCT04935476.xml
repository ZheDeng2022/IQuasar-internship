  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled (RCT) study to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of Dapsone in older adults, and/or in adult patients (≥40yrs of age)&#xD;
      with at least one high-risk comorbidity, among those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3000 infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, non-hospitalized at the time of enrollment,&#xD;
      meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized (1:1 allocation ratio) to&#xD;
      receive either Dapsone or placebo tablets for 21 days, and will be followed up for 7 days&#xD;
      after treatment termination for outcome assessment and up to 30 days for safety monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether early treatment with Dapsone&#xD;
      reduces pulmonary complications related to COVID-19 and consequent hospitalization in&#xD;
      high-risk group of elderly adults and adults (≥40yrs of age) with comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of Dapsone on reducing severe&#xD;
      complications related to COVID-19 (ICU, intubation and death) and the safety of treatment&#xD;
      with Dapsone in this high-risk COVID-19 patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3000 patients will be enrolled to receive either Dapsone or placebo (1:1 allocation ratio)&#xD;
      for 21 days. Follow-up assessments will occur remotely through participant e-daily diary and&#xD;
      virtual visits (electronically via internet and/or telephone) at Day 1(start of study drug),&#xD;
      7, 14, 21, 28 and 51 following randomization in order to document the occurrence of any trial&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy will be based on data from randomized patients. An independent data and&#xD;
      safety monitoring committee (DSMC) will periodically review study results and will make&#xD;
      recommendations to the study Steering Committee for continuing the trial as planned (or with&#xD;
      modification) or for stopping early for safety concerns.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study.&#xD;
Following e-signature of the informed consent form, approximately 3000 participants meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either Dapsone or placebo (1:1 allocation ratio) for 21 days. Screening blood-work and confirmatory tests are made available to participants at their residence by the study. Study interventions (drugs or placebo) will be delivered directly to participants by courier .&#xD;
Participants are remotely followed-up through e-daily diary during 21 days of treatment along with virtual visits (phone) at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 51 days following randomization for evaluation of the occurrence of any trial endpoints or other adverse events. During study enrollment patients are linked to the study through their participant account on the study virtual care platform.</intervention_model_description>
