      (1) Objective to establish an evaluation system for predicting the risk of epistaxis after&#xD;
      endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery（ 2) Objective to determine the risk factors of&#xD;
      epistaxis after endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma surgery. Referring to domestic&#xD;
      and foreign literature, combined with experts' opinions, the related risk factors that may&#xD;
      cause postoperative nosebleed of pituitary adenoma are: 22 patients and surgical factors. 3)&#xD;
      Objective to establish a risk prediction model of epistaxis after endoscopic transsphenoidal&#xD;
      pituitary tumor resection. According to the occurrence of epistaxis, the patients in the&#xD;
      modeling group were divided into epistaxis group and non epistaxis group. The risk factors of&#xD;
      epistaxis were taken as the independent variable, and the occurrence of epistaxis was taken&#xD;
      as the dependent variable. The variables with statistical significance in univariate analysis&#xD;
      were included in the multivariate logistic regression model, and the risk prediction model of&#xD;
      epistaxis after pituitary tumor resection was established by back LR method.(4) Objective to&#xD;
      verify the risk prediction model of endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma epistaxis.&#xD;
      The validation model is used to validate the prediction model, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow degree&#xD;
      is used to match the model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)&#xD;
      was used to evaluate the validity of the model.(5) Application of risk prediction model.&#xD;
