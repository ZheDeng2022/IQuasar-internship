  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NIS793 in combination&#xD;
      with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel versus gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and placebo in first-line&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore whether blockade of Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel can reduce fibrosis in PDAC, restore&#xD;
      chemo-sensitivity and ultimately lead to improvements in overall survival (OS) and other&#xD;
      clinically relevant outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter two-arm, phase III study that has two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety run-in part: An open-label safety run-in part will be conducted to confirm&#xD;
           recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D) of NIS793 in combination with gemcitabine and&#xD;
           nab-paclitaxel. Up to approximately 10 participants will be enrolled at each dose level&#xD;
           to achieve at least 6 evaluable participants; however, if the starting dose is not&#xD;
           recommended and a lower dose level is tested, 10 additional participants will be&#xD;
           enrolled. The decision to open the randomized part will be based on dose confirmation&#xD;
           and available safety, relevant PK, and other relevant data from run-in part&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized part: Enrolled participants will be randomized to the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment will be administered as a 28-day treatment cycle. Participants will be&#xD;
      treated until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression per RECIST 1.1, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent or any other condition of treatment discontinuation specified in the protocol.&#xD;

    <measure>Randomized part: Change from baseline in the patient reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS)-29 profile scores at week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS is a commonly used self-reported measurement system of health-related quality of life and physical function. The PROMIS-29 includes 29 items that assess seven domains: physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, pain interference and pain intensity. Questions are ranked on a 5-point response scale, with higher scores at times indicating better quality of life, and at other times indicating poorer quality of life. There is a pain rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher pain level. Scores will be reported for each domain, as well as for pain rating.</description>

    <measure>Randomized part: Change from baseline in the European Quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) scores (health index and EQ-VAS) at week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a 2-part questionnaire: the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The first part assesses participant's health state in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). The health state index score is calculated based on the responses to the 5 dimensions, providing a single value on a scale from -0.285 to 0.950, with higher scores indicating better health utility. The EQ-VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a visual analogue scale with endpoints labeled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'. This scale is numbered from 0 to 100. 100 means the best health you can imagine.</description>

    <description>A clinically meaningful deterioration or worsening in the domain will be defined according to change from baseline scores according to minimally important differences (MID) estimates for each domain. Time-to-deterioration is defined as the time from baseline to the date of deterioration event or death due to any cause. The event of deterioration is defined as the change from baseline (worsening) of the corresponding PROMIS-29 score ≥MID, with no later change below the thereshold</description>
