&#xD;
      Statistical analysis using SPSS 25.0 statistical software. Observation index are time index&#xD;
      of nursing treatment for patients with severe trauma: the time required for acquisition time,&#xD;
      disposable puncture success rate, blood routine and blood type delivery time, rescue room&#xD;
      stay time, etc and patient family and doctor satisfaction analysis: self-designed&#xD;
      questionnaire, family satisfaction process, service time, service attitude, rescue&#xD;
      technology, health education, including advice time, nursing quality, medical communication,&#xD;
