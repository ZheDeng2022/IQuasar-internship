  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continent Cutaneous Urinary Deviation (CUD), using the Mitrofanoff, Yang-Monti or Casale&#xD;
      principle, is offered to patients with neurological diseases who are unable to perform&#xD;
      intermittent catheterisation through the native urethra due to upper limb disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is very little data in the literature examining the long-term efficacy and&#xD;
      complications of this technique. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of long-term CUDs in spinal cord injury patients. The secondary objectives are&#xD;
      to evaluate the surgical complications and the impact on the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, several data will be collected and analyzed: age at operation, sex, Body&#xD;
      Mass Index (BMI), ASA score, ASIA score, type of bladder dysfunction assessed by urodynamic&#xD;
      evaluation, urinary abnormalities assessed by morphological examination (ultrasound and / or&#xD;
      computed tomography) and cystoscopy, creatinine clearance, operative indications, initial&#xD;
      mictional mode, surgical assembly and any immediate or late complications. In a second stage,&#xD;
      a questionnaire survey will be conducted by telephone.&#xD;

    <measure>Surgical complications and impact on the patient's quality of life: ASA score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 -16 years after their operation</time_frame>
    <description>The ASA Physical Status Classification System is used to assess and communicate a patient's pre-anesthesia medical comorbidities. The classification system alone does not predict the perioperative risks, but used with other factors (eg, type of surgery, frailty, level of deconditioning) it can be helpful in predicting perioperative risks.&#xD;
ASA I = A normal healthy patient ASA II = A patient with mild systemic disease ASA III = A patient with severe systemic disease ASA IV = A patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life ASA V = A moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation ASA VI = A declared brain-dead patient whose organs are being removed for donor purposes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical complications and impact on the patient's quality of life: ASIA score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 -16 years after their operation</time_frame>
    <description>The ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) assessment is the gold standard for assessing and documenting sensory and motor impairments after Spinal Cord Injury. The score ranges from A to E as follows:&#xD;
A = Complete injury. No motor or sensory function is preserved in the sacral segments S4 or S5.&#xD;
B = Sensory incomplete. Sensory but not motor function is preserved below the level of injury, including the sacral segments.&#xD;
C = Motor incomplete. Motor function is preserved below the level of injury, and more than half of muscles tested below the level of injury have a muscle grade less than 3 (see muscle strength scores table).&#xD;
D = Motor incomplete. Motor function is preserved below the level of injury and at least half of the key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade of 3 or more.&#xD;
E = Normal. No motor or sensory deficits, but deficits existed in the past. This score will be used to evaluate the patient at the start of care.</description>
