    <textblock>
      This study integrates the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) suicide risk models into&#xD;
      Opioid Wizard, an electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support (CDS) to identify&#xD;
      and treat patients at high risk of opioid use disorder (OUD)/overdose or diagnosed with OUD,&#xD;
      to alert primary care clinicians (PCCs) to patients at elevated risk for suicide and guide&#xD;
      them through structured suicide risk assessment. In both intervention and control clinics,&#xD;
      suicide risk scores will be calculated for all Opioid Wizard-eligible patients and relevant&#xD;
      EHR data to inform analyses will be archived. In intervention clinics, Opioid Wizard will&#xD;
      alert PCCs to Opioid Wizard-eligible patients who are at increased risk of suicide and coach&#xD;
      them through use of the Columbia Suicide Severity Risk Scale (CSSRS), a structured tool in&#xD;
      the EHR that will help PCCs assess immediate suicide risk. Based on the resulting CSSRS&#xD;
      score, Opioid Wizard will provide EHR links for risk-based referrals and follow-up&#xD;
      recommendations, including care as usual, routine or emergent referral to behavioral health,&#xD;
      or transportation to the emergency department (ED) for further assessment. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures include completion of CSSRS assessments for at-risk patients and patient engagement&#xD;
      in outpatient mental health care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When a patient is at elevated risk of suicide, the PCC will be prompted by Opioid Wizard to&#xD;
      complete the CSSRS, easily available to all PCCs in the EHR and saved as discrete data&#xD;
      elements. Risk-based (depending on CSSRS score) referral and follow-up recommendations for&#xD;
      suicide prevention will be given, with specific care recommendations ranging from care as&#xD;
      usual (very low risk) to referral to behavioral health for evaluation and safety planning&#xD;
      (moderate to high risk) to immediate evaluation in the emergency department and potential&#xD;
      inpatient admission (very high risk), building on workflows developed for use by care&#xD;
      managers in in our recently completed suicide prevention trial of over 19,000 people at&#xD;
      elevated risk of suicide. (28) The MHRN suicide risk models will be programmed into the EHR,&#xD;
      a rigorous process that will take approximately 6 months. This process includes building the&#xD;
      model in a testing environment in the EHR, testing the model with fictitious patients in a&#xD;
      EHR testing environment and conducting chart audits, revising as needed, testing the model in&#xD;
      a different EHR testing environment with real patient data, revising as needed, testing the&#xD;
      model by running it silently in the EHR production environment and conducting chart audits,&#xD;
      and revising as needed. This is followed by testing in the EHR production environment with&#xD;
      5-15 physicians in 1-2 pilot clinics. Prior to the go-live date for the suicide risk&#xD;
      calculator, training on use and interpretation of the suicide risk model and the CSSRS will&#xD;
      be provided to all PCCs and their rooming staff in intervention clinics. Training for control&#xD;
      clinics will be separate and will provide training on the use of the CSSRS.&#xD;
