    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant patients under an immunosuppressive treatment based on anti-calcineurin and&#xD;
      mycophenolate-mofetil and induction therapy with rATG who suffer from early systemic viral&#xD;
      replication by the CMV virus could benefit from the introduction of an i-mTor drug.&#xD;
      (everolimus) to replace mycophenolate mofetil. This conversion would be effective in slowing&#xD;
      down and controlling viral expansion without the need to initiate any prophylactic anti-viral&#xD;
      therapy thanks to the activation of the CMV-specific cellular effector response or to an&#xD;
      antiviral effect of i-Mtor itself.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common opportunistic pathogen in the first months&#xD;
      after solid organ transplantation, being associated with an increased risk of acute and&#xD;
      chronic graft rejection, graft loss and an increase in patient mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The susceptibility to developing CMV infection is essentially determined by the host's immune&#xD;
      status against the virus, with seronegative recipients (IgG-) receiving a graft from a&#xD;
      seropositive donor (IgG +) (R- / D +) being the group with an especially high risk of&#xD;
      developing CMV infection and disease after transplantation. In fact, without the&#xD;
      administration of a preventive therapy for CMV, around 60-70% of this risk group will present&#xD;
      viral infection (replication of copies of CMV in blood) and up to 30% will develop systemic&#xD;
      disease (viral invasion of the tissue). However, the incidence of infection among R + / D +&#xD;
      seropositive (IgG +) patients under treatment with induction with anti-IL2RA and the&#xD;
      combination of mycophenolate mofetil (MPA) and anti-calcineurin drugs (CNI), can reach up to&#xD;
      40%, and up to 60% if induction therapies are administered with T-lymphocyte depletors with&#xD;
      polyclonal antibodies (Thymoglobulin®, rATG) (6). All this suggests that the assessment of&#xD;
      the immunological risk of developing post-transplant CMV infection is relatively poor and&#xD;
      that the humoral response to the virus does not fully explain the patient's immunological&#xD;
      susceptibility to the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, it is well known that the subpopulation of CMV-specific memory / effector T&#xD;
      cells plays a key role in the control of viral survival replication in general and of CMV in&#xD;
      particular. While it has been reported that CD8 + cytotoxic T cells have the ability to&#xD;
      activate against a wide range of immunogenic proteins of the CMV virus, it appears that high&#xD;
      frequencies directed against the major CMV antigens such as those of immediate expression-1&#xD;
      (IE-1) and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) play a critical role in the control of CMV viral&#xD;
      replication. One of the most precise functional techniques to study the cellular memory&#xD;
      immune response is the IFN-γ ELISPOT test, which allows knowing the antigen-specific response&#xD;
      at the individual cellular level, thus providing high sensitivity and specificity. Along&#xD;
      these lines, our group and others have shown how the monitoring of the CMV-specific cell&#xD;
      response with the IFN-γ ELISPOT test, both before and after transplantation, is capable of&#xD;
      identifying those patients with a high risk of developing infection by CMV, regardless of&#xD;
      immunization status. In addition, data from a prospective, randomized clinical trial led by&#xD;
      our group, evaluating the cellular response to CMV before transplantation using the IFN-γ&#xD;
      ELISPOT test, have confirmed the high negative predictive power in identifying those patients&#xD;
      with high risk of developing viral infection after transplantation, despite being&#xD;
      serologically positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors, everolimus and sirolimus, are a class of&#xD;
      immunosuppressants commonly used in kidney transplantation both in the initial phase (de&#xD;
      novo) and in the maintenance phase. In addition, today it is considered routine clinical&#xD;
      practice in case of side effects mediated by CNI (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) or by&#xD;
      antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid) to replace the latter with iMtor&#xD;
      (conversion to iMtor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, recently reported clinical studies have shown a significant decrease in the&#xD;
      rate of both CMV infection and disease in patients treated with mTor inhibitors (i-mTOR)&#xD;
      after kidney transplantation, both in combination with MPA. as in combination with CNI drugs.&#xD;
      A recently published randomized clinical trial that included more than 2000 kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients has reported that the incidence of CMV viral infection in the CNI plus everolimus&#xD;
      group in the Serology D / R + / + group was 3.6% compared to 13.3% of the control group&#xD;
      treated with CNI plus mycophenolate mofetil. (RR 0.27 - CI 0.19-0.38) This effect has been&#xD;
      reported mainly among R + / D + patients, and even in those after receiving induction&#xD;
      treatment with rATG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the mechanism through which i-mTORs can inhibit and block viral replication after&#xD;
      transplantation is unknown, it is suggested that it could be through their ability to&#xD;
      directly inhibit proliferation on the virus, or well, through some of the immunomodulatory&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects that they exert on the adaptive immune response. Along these lines,&#xD;
      beyond its immunosuppressive capacity by inhibiting the lymphocyte proliferation signal&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must be 18 years or older (and weigh more than 34Kg) and may be of both sexes&#xD;
             and of any race.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects will be seropositive for CMV virus and will receive a seropositive graft (CMV&#xD;
             IgG D + / R +).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be willing and able to give their written informed consent to the trial.&#xD;
             If a subject cannot independently grant their informed consent in writing, her legal&#xD;
             representative may do so in her place.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must perform a pregnancy test at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment and agree to the use of a medically acceptable contraceptive method during&#xD;
             the selection period and while receiving the medication specified in the protocol. A&#xD;
             woman of childbearing age is considered to be any woman physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, from menarche to becoming postmenopausal, unless she is permanently&#xD;
             sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no&#xD;
             menstruation for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high level of&#xD;
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the postmenopausal range can be used to confirm&#xD;
             a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraceptives or hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH&#xD;
             measurement is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Only women of childbearing age who adhere to the contraceptive methods recommended by&#xD;
             the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) as highly effective contraceptive methods&#xD;
             may participate, that is, with a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used&#xD;
             consistently and correct:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combined hormonal contraception (containing estrogen and progestin) associated&#xD;
                  with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progestin-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
                  (oral, injectable, or implantable)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine Hormone Release System (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomized partner (provided the partner is the participant's only sexual&#xD;
                  partner in the WOCBP trial and the vasectomized partner has received a medical&#xD;
                  evaluation of surgical success)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual abstinence (defined as abstaining from sexual intercourse for the entire&#xD;
                  risk period associated with study treatments)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients without a medical contraindication for the use of i-mTOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Immunosuppressive induction rATG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects may not have a history of type I hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions&#xD;
             to drugs ganciclovir (GCV) or valganciclovir (VGCV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Breastfeeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects may not have any clinically significant disease that could interfere with&#xD;
             study evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participation in another clinical trial promoted by the pharmaceutical industry, in&#xD;
             which the promoter already establishes in the protocol what the treatment of CMV&#xD;
             should be.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with active viral replication of the HCV, HBV and / or HIV viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients requiring a desensitizing treatment that includes plasma exchange, Campath-1,&#xD;
             Rituximab®, Eculizumab® and / or Gammaglobulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence of donor-specific antibodies (DSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Prior intolerance to study medication (Certican®), prior documented history of&#xD;
             hereditary galactose intolerance, Lapp's lactase deficiency, or glucose or galactose&#xD;
