    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to make the proof of concept and to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) using Smart-TO device in fetuses with&#xD;
      congenital diaphragmatic hernia and moderate to severe pulmonary hypoplasia&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) leads to lung hypoplasia and impaired lung vasculature.&#xD;
      Fetal lung growth may be stimulated by fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion (FETO). In severe&#xD;
      CDH, FETO may improve survival. In the moderate cases, the prematurity induced by the&#xD;
      plug-unplug strategy limits the benefit from the lung growth induced by tracheal occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main drawbacks of FETO is the need for in-utero reversal of tracheal occlusion by&#xD;
      the balloon, as the current procedure involves re-establishment of patent airways either&#xD;
      electively at 34 weeks' gestation or earlier if required, ideally at least 24 h before birth.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, removal of the balloon is a difficult, invasive, and risky procedure.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it requires a specialist team to be able to reverse the occlusion at all times.&#xD;
      As a result, it is recommended that the patient stays close to a FETO center during the whole&#xD;
      duration of the occlusion, which may limit the acceptability of FETO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Smart-TO balloon allows an easy, remotely controlled, and non-invasive reversal&#xD;
      occlusion, so it allows to overcome issues related to the airway reestablishment. The&#xD;
      technology solution is based on a magnetic valve that opens under the influence of the&#xD;
      peripheral magnetic field around a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. The opening of the valve&#xD;
      induces the deflation of the balloon, which is then washed out by the fluid coming out from&#xD;
      the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to make the proof of concept and to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) using Smart-TO device in fetuses with&#xD;
      congenital diaphragmatic hernia and moderate to severe pulmonary hypoplasia. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include evaluation of prematurity, preterm premature rupture of membranes, lung&#xD;
      growth, and survival at discharge in case of FETO with Smart-TO balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FETO with Smart-TO balloon will be performed between 27 and 31wks + 6 days depending on the&#xD;
      severity of pulmonary hypoplasia, according to the same technique that is used with the&#xD;
      balloon usually used for FETO procedure. The unplug procedure will be performed between 34&#xD;
      and 34wks + 6 days or earlier if required. The patient will be asked to make a peripheral&#xD;
      course around the MR scanner in order to open the magnetic valve and induce the deflation of&#xD;
      the balloon. Ultrasound scan will be performed before and after the unplug procedure, in&#xD;
      order to check the balloon did not deflate spontaneously at the time of the unplug, and to&#xD;
      check the balloon deflates thanks to the magnetic fringe field of the MR scan. Expelling of&#xD;
      the Smart-TO balloon outside the airways will be check at birth by a thorax X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored during the whole duration of the study so serious unexpected or&#xD;
      adverse reactions can be recorded.&#xD;
