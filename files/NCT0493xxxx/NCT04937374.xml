      In this study, The Investigator will be assessing the efficacy and tolerability of Rehmannia&#xD;
      glutinosa Libosch leaf-based extract formulation consumption on the treatment of Acne&#xD;
      Vulgaris in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The participants will&#xD;
      consume one capsule per day containing active ingredient for the duration of 56 days.&#xD;
      Throughout the duration of the clinical trial, The Investigator will be studying the&#xD;
      formulation's effects on the change in the Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) score, facial&#xD;
      sebum secretion, the number and irritability of inflammatory lesions, quality of life via the&#xD;
      Acne-QoL questionnaire, skin wrinkle severity through the Modified Fitzpatrick Wrinkle&#xD;
      Severity Scale (MFWS) and the percentage population of responders at the end of the study.&#xD;
      The Investigator will also assess the change in skin radiance, luminosity, smoothness,&#xD;
      texture, firmness, and skin hydration through a participant based self-assessment&#xD;
      questionnaire as well as the safety and tolerability of the formulation through a global&#xD;
      evaluation by the participants and the investigators.&#xD;

    <measure>Acne severity: The global acne grading system</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 Day 28 and Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Acne lesions will be counted separately for all the six locations. Then the acne score (S) will be multiplied with the area factor (F) to get local score of that particular area. All six local scores will be summed to get the total scores. The total acne severity scores will be obtained on day 0, day 28, and day 56. The change in acne severity of all the enrolled participants will be assessed after 28 and 56 days of supplementation from baseline (Day 0) and in comparison to placebo.</description>

    <measure>Count of inflammatory acne lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 Day 28 and Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Acne vulgaris involves complications of pilosebaceous unit that causes inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules).&#xD;
Inflammatory acne lesions are manifested by typical signs of inflammation i.e., swelling, redness, pain and heat.&#xD;
All the inflammatory acne lesions on the face will be counted on day 0, 28 and day 56.&#xD;
Any change in the number of these lesions on day 28 and 56 will be compared with baseline and placebo.</description>

    <measure>Acne Quality of life questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Acne-QoL consist of 19 items stratified in four subscales; Self-perception, Role-emotional, Role-social, and Acne symptoms.&#xD;
The QoL of such participants will be assessed using Acne-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (Acne-QoL) questionnaire.&#xD;
The total score varies from 0 to 114, distributed as follows: 0- 30 (self-perception), 0-24 (role-social), 0- 30 (role-emotional), and 0-30 (acne symptoms). A higher score reflects better health related QoL .</description>

    <measure>Percentage responders</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 Day 28 and Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>The participants' acne severity will be assessed using GAGS on day 0, 28 and 56. Participants will be declared as responders based on the improvement in acne severity as per GAGS severity grading system (based on total scores). Participants with improvement in acne severity by one grade or more as per GAGS on day 28 and 56 in comparison to baseline (Day 0) will be considered as responders. Percentage population of these responders will be evaluated in comparison to placebo</description>

    <measure>Pain VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 Day 28 and Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS is an scale that measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is used regularly in clinical research studies for measuring the intensity or frequency of various symptoms. In the present study, a similar VAS will be used for assessment of physical symptoms associated with inflammatory acne lesions i.e., pain. The participant will be asked to mark the their severity of lesion pain as per the last 7 days on a 0 - 100 mm VAS scale on day 0, 28 and 56, where 0 - is no pain at all and 100 - is unbearable pain</description>
