    <textblock>
      The purpose of this telemedicine 24-person open-label study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      usability of a proprietary wearable microcurrent electroceutical (a device that delivers&#xD;
      micro-ampere electronic pulses) made by Healables, Ltd. to promote healing of chronic mild to&#xD;
      moderate knee osteoarthritis as shown by decreased disability and relief of pain. In this&#xD;
      study, subjects treat themselves at home once/day for an hour using a smart phone to activate&#xD;
      the device worn on an e-textile sports knee sleeve. Microcurrent signals are transmitted from&#xD;
      a device thru built in conductive pathways to strategic electrodes placed above and below the&#xD;
      knee. A proprietary App both activates therapeutic protocols to transmit microcurrent signals&#xD;
      as well as allows user-generated recording of the status of knee pain &amp; function prior to and&#xD;
      following each treatment. These records are then transmitted to health professionals using&#xD;
      software compliant with human use data transmission regulations including subject anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale that the device would be effective is supported by microcurrent treatment for&#xD;
      osteoarthritis at several US clinics including the prestigious Cleveland Clinic as well as by&#xD;
      data of published randomized controlled clinical trials. One reason that more persons do not&#xD;
      avail themselves of microcurrent therapy is that treatment usually requires several trips to&#xD;
      a clinic often requiring considerable travel by a patient who may be in considerable pain.&#xD;
      The health provider typically administers therapy in a clinic using electrodes with a desktop&#xD;
      sized instrument. Our miniaturization of a microcurrent device and its use with wearable&#xD;
      e-textiles such as a knee compression sleeve is a distinct advantage that enables regular use&#xD;
      of effective therapy in home-based self-treatment to provide pain relief and improved knee&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcurrent electrotherapy represents a significant improvement in pain control and healing&#xD;
      since it employs current in the microampere range, 1000 times less than that of&#xD;
      Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) devices that transmit millicurrent&#xD;
      electrical signals. This study is designed to demonstrate use of a wearable microcurrent&#xD;
      electroceutical at home for subjects to self-treat at their leisure in a comfortable&#xD;
      environment that facilitates healing. Moreover, data communication via a smart phone App to&#xD;
      health providers enables digital telemedicine for rapid collation and interpretation of&#xD;
      relevant data.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Definitions: an electroceutical, compared to a pharmaceutical, is a device that&#xD;
      provides treatment by delivering potentially therapeutic electrical pulses; a microcurrent&#xD;
      electroceutical delivers electrical pulses in the micro-ampere range and is distinguished&#xD;
      from devices that deliver millicurrent which are electrical pulses in the milliampere range,&#xD;
      1000-fold greater than the micro ampere range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical microcurrent therapy represents a significant improvement in rapid pain control&#xD;
      and acceleration of healing since it not only avoids the side effects of drugs including&#xD;
      opioids and NSAIDs, but is also a superior electroceutical modality since it uses 1000-fold&#xD;
      less electric current than that of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), which&#xD;
      requires application of current in the millicurrent range and can itself be painful and&#xD;
      damaging to nerve tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrotherapy, especially microcurrent electrical therapy, has been used to treat a variety&#xD;
      of clinical conditions and is routinely used at pain clinics in the USA, most notable among&#xD;
      them, the Cleveland Clinic, consistently rated among the top 3 medical centers in the USA.&#xD;
      Microcurrent electro-therapy may be the best treatment for many pain-related disorders, since&#xD;
      it not only provides fast relief of symptoms and promotes quick healing but also it has&#xD;
      significantly fewer adverse side effects than many analgesic drugs. Indeed, this Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic website lists multiple diseases and disorders amenable to microcurrent therapy to&#xD;
      ameliorate pain as do numerous published studies. Unfortunately, such microcurrent therapy is&#xD;
      traditionally administered using a large desktop instrument through electrodes positioned by&#xD;
      a health practitioner so that current can flow between the electrodes through the affected&#xD;
      area of pain. While many practitioners in the USA are competent to administer such&#xD;
      microcurrent therapy in both small and large clinical settings, treatment often requires&#xD;
      significant travel by the patient who may be in considerable pain. Hence, patients frequently&#xD;
      forego microcurrent therapy to avoid multiple trips to the health care provider at a clinic&#xD;
      which may be quite distant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcurrent Electroceutical: Healables Ltd. has determined that microcurrent therapy can be&#xD;
      designed as a wearable medical device for use at home, at work or when travelling. This&#xD;
      functional innovation provides a solution to provide widespread availability of microcurrent&#xD;
      therapy. Healables has miniaturized a device that can deliver microcurrent electrotherapy and&#xD;
      has devised a way to dock it to wearable e-textiles such sleeves, socks or body shirts with&#xD;
      built in electrode paths to deliver microcurrent signals to the affected areas. Powered by an&#xD;
      smart phone App (provided), the subject can wear the Healables device at home, work or in&#xD;
      transit to provide timely and, if warranted, frequent microcurrent therapy at his/her&#xD;
      leisure. Moreover, the App allows the subject to remotely communicate with health providers&#xD;
      by digital health telecommunication to report and document daily progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical trial at the Edith Wolfson Medical Center (WMC) is to&#xD;
      demonstrate the safety, tolerability and usability of a Healables electroceutical device in&#xD;
      subjects with mild to moderate osteoarthritis pain and/or dysfunction to promote healing of&#xD;
      chronic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis as shown by relief of pain and decreased&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcurrent Putative Mechanisms of Action: Microcurrent electrical fields have been shown to&#xD;
      stimulate cellular physiology and growth. In a preclinical study, microcurrent electric&#xD;
      fields increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation close to 500% whereas higher&#xD;
      currents actually decreased the results. This study also demonstrated that microcurrent&#xD;
      enhances amino acid transport and protein synthesis. In a clinical study, fibromyalgia pain&#xD;
      was successfully treated with microcurrent therapy and pain improvement scores were&#xD;
      accompanied by substantial reduction in serum inflammatory cytokines Interleukin-1 (IL-1),&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) levels as well as release of&#xD;
      neuropeptide substance P and increases in serum Beta-endorphin and cortisol. This correlation&#xD;
      indicated not only contributory treatment mechanisms effected by microcurrent therapy but&#xD;
      also suggested that that such treatment can be objectively measured by observing changes in&#xD;
      cytokines associated with pain and inflammation. Another suggested mechanism is based on the&#xD;
      natural anti-oxidant ability of microcurrent to deliver electrons to tissues and saturate&#xD;
      free radicals with required electrons. Such anti-oxidant activity is thought to repair local&#xD;
      tissue damage that can be caused by a variety of chronic inflammatory illnesses including&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Description This is a non-blinded, open label study. Subjects that have&#xD;
      signed informed consent, have met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study and treated. Each subject will be given an electroceutical device and a&#xD;
      wearable knee sleeve that docks onto with the device and that shall be worn on the subject's&#xD;
      leg with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. The subject is also provided with a smart&#xD;
      phone phone (iPhone) with a proprietary App to run the device and data reporting software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects instructed by staff regarding device and App function and method of operation. Each&#xD;
      treatment will comprise a self-treatment session at home of electroceutical microcurrent&#xD;
      treatment for 60 +/- 20 minutes per day for 5 days per week for four consecutive weeks. Each&#xD;
      treatment session will accompanied by use of the App to complete the 11-point Wong-Baker&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for knee pain prior to and following each treatment. The subject&#xD;
      will also use the App once per week, every week of active treatment during the 1st 4 weeks of&#xD;
      the study to score the 5-point, 12 question Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score&#xD;
      (KOOS-12) for knee pain and dysfunction. In addition, for a 4-week follow up period after the&#xD;
      4 week treatment period, subjects will use the VAS and KOOS-12 weekly to assess residual&#xD;
      effects of the treatments received during the 4 weeks of active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the periodic questionnaires completed by the subject using the App, the&#xD;
      International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire will be administered at the&#xD;
      Wolfson Medical Center (WMC) osteoarthritis clinic at baseline and at weeks 2, 4 and 8. In&#xD;
      this manner assessment will be made during active treatment, at the end of 4 weeks treatment&#xD;
      and 4 weeks after the end of treatment to assess any residual effects of treatment after&#xD;
      treatment has ended. The IKDC will be the primary goal to assess the effect of treatment on&#xD;
      the level of pain and functionality of the subject's osteoarthritic knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data Management Workflow Clinical data will be entered digitally from three sources.&#xD;
      In the clinic the health practitioners will enter information into a tablet or other computer&#xD;
      device that will transmit data to a Flaskdata backend. Such data will include the IKDC form&#xD;
      and all info of the eCRF (electronic case report form). Another sources of data include data&#xD;
      directly transmitted to Flaskdata from the device including, for example, measures of&#xD;
      impedance, specific protocols used as well as times and lengths of use. A third component of&#xD;
      data will be generated by subject responses to program queries and transmitted to Flaskdata&#xD;
      via the App including questions regarding hydration and the Wong/Baker VAS pain levels and&#xD;
      the 12-question KOOS-12 questionnaires described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data from both the App as well as from the WMC clinic will be referred electronically to&#xD;
      the health portals of Flaskdata.io to be securely and privately kept with de-identification&#xD;
      according to the prerequisites of HIPPA and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Data will be&#xD;
      available to the WMC health professionals to monitor the subject's progress and use of the&#xD;
      device and the App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and reporting data from the App completed by the subject and from the e-CRFs&#xD;
      (Electronic Case Report Forms) completed by WMC health providers also will be transmitted&#xD;
      electronically to a database via Flaskdata.io for subsequent analysis in a de-identified and&#xD;
      HIPPA compliant manner.&#xD;
