    <textblock>
      The objective will be to analyze the development of cellular and humoral immunity against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 after administration of a third dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine in patients&#xD;
      who have remained seronegative after the full standard (two-dose) regimen.&#xD;
