      To describe the general trajectories of rehabilitation compliance in first-onset stroke&#xD;
      patients within 6 months, and to identify the heterogeneous development trajectory of&#xD;
      different subgroups based on the mixed model of latent growth.To explore the predictors of&#xD;
      different change tracks of rehabilitation compliance of stroke patients from the perspectives&#xD;
      of biological, psychological and social factors, so as to provide the basis for formulating&#xD;
      precise nursing intervention measures.&#xD;

      To describe the general trajectories of rehabilitation compliance in first-onset stroke&#xD;
      patients within 6 months. To recruit first-onset stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation&#xD;
      and collect the general data. Telephone follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and&#xD;
      24 weeks after the onset. Based on the biological-psychosocial medical model and literature,&#xD;
      biological, psychological and sociological factors were screened. The patient rehabilitation&#xD;
      adherence level in different periods was measured. Latent Growth Mixture Model (LGMM) was&#xD;
      used to investigate the general trend of rehabilitation compliance in patients with&#xD;
      first-episode stroke within 6 months. Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) method in Latent&#xD;
      Growth hybrid model was used to identify the track of heterogeneous change. Multivariate&#xD;
      Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the predictors of different subgroups of&#xD;
      change trajectories relative to other subgroups.&#xD;
