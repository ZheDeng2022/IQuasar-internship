  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use by diabetes patients of real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system is&#xD;
      becoming widespread and has changed diabetic practice. Automated closed-loop (CL) insulin&#xD;
      therapy has come of age. This major technological advance is expected to significantly&#xD;
      improve the quality of care for adults, adolescents and children with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions remain about patients' perception and acceptance on this automatisation of the&#xD;
      management of their glycemic variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus this study is built to evaluate the impact of the activation of the closed-loop on&#xD;
      quality of life and burden of their diabetes in patients with type 1 diabetes under CSII.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This cohort study will follow patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing under continuous&#xD;
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with Continuous Glucose Monitoring (GCM). After&#xD;
      inclusion visit, there's a 20 days' period to assess their quality of life and perception of&#xD;
      the burden of their diabetes and confirm their eligibility to the closer-loop. During this 20&#xD;
      days' period, patients should complete all the self-questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, during the 2d visit, the closed-loop will be activated by the diabetologist for a 6&#xD;
      months follow-up including six visits with 3 phone contacts (at week 1, week 2 and week 6)&#xD;
      then 2 direct visits at 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 phone contacts are mainly planned, as recommended in French guidelines, to ensure the&#xD;
      good use of the device and to detect or prevent any unexpected events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2 visits at 3 and 6 months, are planned to assess the glycemic variability using&#xD;
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring data and to collect perception of the patients via the 2 main&#xD;
      criteria self questionnaires (Quality of life and burden to be filled-in by patients at 3 and&#xD;
      6 months) and all perception dimensions by all the self questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main results will provide data on the evolution of quality of life and burden of diabetes by&#xD;
      comparison between scores at 6 months and baseline, and evolution of glycemic variability.&#xD;
