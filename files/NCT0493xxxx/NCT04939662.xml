      Study design This study is a single arm, multi-centre phase II study of olaparib and&#xD;
      bevacizumab combination therapy in subjects with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a&#xD;
      second or third line (systemic) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive olaparib and bevacizumab combination therapy. The arm is composed of 28&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib 300 mg bid per os every 12 hours administered each cycle day and bevacizumab 15&#xD;
      mg/kg via IV administered on Day 1 of every cycle for every 3 weeks. One cycle consists of 21&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour evaluation by RECIST v1.1 using CT or MRI scans of chest, abdomen, pelvis and brain&#xD;
      (optional in case of brain metastases), CEA, NSE and LDH will be conducted at screening&#xD;
      (within 28 days prior to first dose of Cycle1 Day1) and every 6 weeks (±1 week) for the first&#xD;
      42 weeks relative to the start of combination therapy (Cycle 1 Day 1), and thereafter every 9&#xD;
      weeks (±1week) until objective disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression (unless other criteria&#xD;
      for treatment discontinuation are met). Subjects may continue olaparib and bevacizumab beyond&#xD;
      progression (according to RECIST 1.1), at the discretion of the investigator if they are&#xD;
      clinically benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subjects discontinues study treatment prior to disease progression, they should continue&#xD;
      to be assessed using RECIST 1.1 until disease progression and then followed up for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments for survival should be made every 3months following objective disease&#xD;
      progression. The details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer, after discontinuation&#xD;
      of olaparib and bevacizumab treatment, will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging modalities used for RECIST 1.1 assessment will be CT or MRI scans of chest,&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis. And CEA, NSE and LDH tests are also used for the evaluation. RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      scans will be analysed by the investigator on site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may also be requested to provide tumour samples from the primary or metastatic&#xD;
      tumours on progression to understand resistance mechanisms. Sample provision is optional and&#xD;
      depend on the subject's will.&#xD;
