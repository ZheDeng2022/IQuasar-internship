    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BN101&#xD;
      in subjects with Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) after at least First Line of&#xD;
      systemic therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled to receive orally administered BN101 200 mg QD&#xD;
      (once daily)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug will be administered in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Subjects may receive study drug in the inpatient or outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curative Effect analysis The efficacy was analyzed based on MITT The point estimate and 95%CI&#xD;
      of ORR were calculated based on the exact probability method of binomial distribution.If&#xD;
      applicable, a logistic regression model will be used for multivariate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical analyses were provided for all secondary efficacy endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following subgroups will be analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe cGVHD (Yes/No)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of organs involved (&lt;4 vs. ≥4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of previous systemic cGVHD treatment (1 vs. ≥2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of cGVHD before inclusion (i.e., from the time of cGVHD diagnosis to the time&#xD;
           of inclusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung Involvement (Yes/No)&#xD;
