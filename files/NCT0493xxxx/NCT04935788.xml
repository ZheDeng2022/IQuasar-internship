      Increasing muscle protein synthesis via protein-based nutrition, with or without exercise,&#xD;
      maintains a strong, healthy muscle mass, which in turn leads to improved health, independence&#xD;
      and functionality in older adults. There is increased interest in plant-based proteins, but&#xD;
      these have in general a lower anabolic effect than animal proteins. Various strategies have&#xD;
      been suggested to augment the anabolic properties of plant proteins, including using&#xD;
      plant-animal protein blends. However, only little is known yet about the anabolic properties&#xD;
      of such an approach. As the peripheral metabolic availability of proteins is an important&#xD;
      aspect that has to be taken into account when screening the anabolic properties of protein&#xD;
      sources/blends, it is the aim of this study to investigate the postprandial AA response of&#xD;
      milk protein, micellar casein, pea protein, and a milk protein-pea protein blend in healthy&#xD;
      older adults.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to quantify the postprandial area under the curve (iAUC), the&#xD;
      maximal level (Cmax) and the time profile (Tmax) of blood amino acids after ingestion of milk&#xD;
      protein, micellar casein, pea protein, and a milk protein-pea protein blend in healthy older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to quantify the postprandial insulin response, and to quantify the&#xD;
      potential muscular response, using an in vitro muscle cell assay, of postprandial blood&#xD;
      derived from healthy older adults after ingestion of milk protein, micellar casein, pea&#xD;
      protein, and a milk protein-pea protein blend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study is designed as a randomized, single-blinded within-subject&#xD;
      (cross-over) trial in which a group of 12 subjects receive 4 different protein drinks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy older adults (60-80 years) Intervention (if applicable): Four&#xD;
      different protein drinks will be investigated: milk protein, micellar casein, pea protein,&#xD;
      and a milk protein/ pea protein blend. All drinks will contain a 20 gram protein load. All&#xD;
      protein supplements will be mixed with 250 mL water and contain some additional non-caloric&#xD;
      flavorings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Postprandial blood amino acid response, up to 5 hours after&#xD;
      consumption of a protein drink measured (incremental area under curve, Cmax and Tmax).&#xD;
