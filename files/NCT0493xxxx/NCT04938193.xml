  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of chronic prosthetic joint infection (PJI) can be difficult. 68Ga-citrate Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) has been recently developed and has many&#xD;
      advantages such as high resolution and low radiation exposure. To date, 68Ga-citrate PET/CT&#xD;
      has not been specifically assessed in prosthetic joint infection. In this prospective study,&#xD;
      patients referred for a suspected PJI will benefit from both a 68Ga-citrate PET/CT and a&#xD;
      99mTc-HMPAO-labelled leukocyte SPECT/CT. The primary outcome is the assessment of the&#xD;
      68Ga-citrate PET/CT accuracy for the diagnosis of chronic prosthetic hip or knee infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a serious and rare complication of orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
      Diagnosis is based on precise criteria (MSIS criteria Musculoskeletal Infection Society).&#xD;
      However, diagnosis can be difficult, in particular when the infection is present for more&#xD;
      than one month. One of the usual exams is bone scintigraphy and 99mTc-HMPAO-labelled&#xD;
      leukocyte scintigraphy. This imaging allows an accurate assessment but it has some&#xD;
      limitations since it requires ex vivo isolation and marking of patient's leukocytes and&#xD;
      repeated acquisition for 24 hours. 68Gallium-citrate positron emission tomography/computed&#xD;
      tomography (68Ga-citrate PET/CT) has been recently developed. 68Ga-citrate PET/CT is&#xD;
      innovative compared to [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT) and has many&#xD;
      advantages: high resolution, realization in only two hours, short radioactive period and no&#xD;
      handling of patient's leukocytes. Furthermore, preliminary data indicate that 68Ga-citrate is&#xD;
      picked up by immune cells, which makes this exam inflammation-selective. To date,&#xD;
      68Ga-citrate PET/CT has not been specifically assessed in PJI, it is the objective of the&#xD;
      present study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study using 68Ga- citrate PET/CT and a 99mTc-HMPAO-labelled leukocyte SPECT/CT.&#xD;
      Patients referred for a suspected PJI and with a positive bone scintigraphy will be&#xD;
      prospectively enrolled. After information and signature of informed consent, patients will&#xD;
      benefit from a 68Ga citrate PET/CT, in addition to leukocyte scintigraphy in a two-week&#xD;
      period. Both images will be anonymized and interpreted by two independent nuclear physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final PJI diagnosis is based on reference criteria (MSIS) to ensure diagnosis during the&#xD;
      standardized medical follow-up. Patients will be followed until 12 months after the leukocyte&#xD;
      scintigraphy.&#xD;
