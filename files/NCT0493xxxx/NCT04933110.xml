  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The upper extremity in people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) has become a more popular&#xD;
      research topic in recent years, with the increase in studies reporting widespread&#xD;
      involvement. The aim of our study was to evaluate the upper extremity from multiple&#xD;
      perspectives in early stage pwMS, to identify problems by comparing them with healthy&#xD;
      individuals, and to examine the relationship of problems with activity and participation.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (on the predetermined assessment day)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the severity of fatigue. Score range 1-7 point, a higher score indicates more severe fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symbol Digit Modalities Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (on the predetermined assessment day)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess cognitive level. A higher score indicates better cognitive level.</description>
