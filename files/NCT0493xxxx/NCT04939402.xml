  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel zoonotic coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) mid-December&#xD;
      2019 and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus&#xD;
      rapidly spread to the rest of the world, including Europe and explicitly affects the&#xD;
      respiratory system, generating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employees of the university hospital of Brussels (UZ Brussel) presenting symptoms suggestive&#xD;
      of COVID-19 are offered to be tested with real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. As&#xD;
      asymptomatic infections have been described and as the PCR can be negative when taken late&#xD;
      after onset of symptoms, serologic tests can be performed. The SARS-CoV 2003 epidemic&#xD;
      demonstrated that serological assays were a useful diagnostic tool of non-acute infections.&#xD;
      Although it is still uncertain whether convalescing patients have a risk of re-infection,&#xD;
      recent data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could protect at least for some time from&#xD;
      subsequent viral exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the COVID-19 pandemic had devastating medical, economic and social consequences, safe and&#xD;
      effective prophylactic vaccines were urgently needed. And thus several candidate vaccines&#xD;
      against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed. The vaccination campaign of the health care workers&#xD;
      of the UZ Brussel started mid January 2021. The first available vaccine was the BNT162b2&#xD;
      (Pfizer) vaccine. Early March 2021, in order to accelerate the vaccination of the UZ Brussel&#xD;
      employees, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD12222) (Oxford, AstaZeneca) vaccination program was&#xD;
      implemented in parallel with the BNT162b2 vaccination program In the COVEMUZ-2 study the&#xD;
      investigators have already started to document the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and&#xD;
      seroconversion among vaccinated employees (using BNT162b2) in the UZ Brussels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to prospectively document the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence&#xD;
      and seroconversion among vaccinated employees (using ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) of the UZ Brussel, at&#xD;
      three different time points, namely 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks; T1), 6 months (+/- 1 month; T2) and&#xD;
      12 months (+/- 1 month; T3) after the second vaccination.&#xD;
