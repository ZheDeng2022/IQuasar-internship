      The patients whose musculoskeletal symptoms initiated or aggravated with Covid-19, were&#xD;
      compared with the patients whose musculoskeletal symptoms did not change with Covid-19. The&#xD;

      There is a lack of an overview of the factors associated with post acute-Covid-19&#xD;
      musculoskeletal symptoms. The aims are;1-to evaluate the most frequent admission symptoms and&#xD;
      the frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms in post acute-Covid-19 patients,2-to determine the&#xD;
      related factors with the post acute-Covid-19 musculoskeletal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective study; the patients whose musculoskeletal symptoms initiated or&#xD;
      aggravated with Covid-19, were compared wthe patients whose musculoskeletal symptoms did not&#xD;
      change with Covid-19. The variables; the demographic and treatment datas, admission symptoms,&#xD;
      post acute-Covid-19 symptoms, laboratory (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, ferritin,&#xD;
      D-dimer), chest computed tomography findings.&#xD;

    <description>A detailed anamnesis was retrospectively recorded about age, gender, body mass index, education, working, the presence of any chronic disease (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, cancer, rheumatological disease…), smoking, duration of symptoms, usage of supplementing vitamins such as vitamin D,C, zinc…, treatment place (home quarantine, hospital, intensive care unit), duration of home quarantine and hospital treatment, the number of months since the onset of Covid-19 symptoms, usage of anticoagulants, treatment drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir. Also the symptoms during the period of Covid-19 infection were recorded from patient files; cough, fever, dyspnea, chest pain, loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache, no symptom, musculoskeletal symptoms such as: muscle, low back, back, joint pain.</description>

    <description>Typical findings of chest CT were; bilateral, multifocal, peripheral ground glass opacities with/without consolidation, including the fissures, close to visceral pleural surfaces. Covid-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) was used for chest CT. CO-RADS assigns scores from 1 (very low suspicion of Covid-19) to 5 (very high suspicion of Covid-19).</description>
