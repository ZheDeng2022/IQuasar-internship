  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the Covid-19 pandemic hit New York City in the spring of 2020, many families were&#xD;
      home-bound due to the city-wide lockdown. As a result, families in New York City were unable&#xD;
      to attend their child's healthcare appointments and many young children did not receive their&#xD;
      regularly-scheduled vaccinations. Parts of the city-wide lockdown did eventually lift in the&#xD;
      summer of 2020 as positive Covid-19 virus rates declined in NYC. However, regularly scheduled&#xD;
      vaccination rates (non-Covid-related) remain low. Yet, it is critical that young children&#xD;
      receive their mandatory vaccines in a timely manner to decrease the chance of contracting&#xD;
      preventable illnesses. Thus, the investigators seek to increase vaccination rates among&#xD;
      children ages 0-2 years in Sunset Park Brooklyn.&#xD;
