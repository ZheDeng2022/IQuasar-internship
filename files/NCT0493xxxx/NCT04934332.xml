  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, bi-centric diagnostic, performance study on a new diagnostic procedure with&#xD;
      ultrasounds against a reference diagnostic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to study the performance of ultrasound coupled with clinical&#xD;
      examination at 1 week of admission for early screening of heterotopic ossification (HO) in&#xD;
      patients admitted to a post intensive care rehabilitation unit (PICRU) after a severe&#xD;
      neurologic trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CT scan at 5 weeks of admission is considered as the gold standard. CT scan reader will&#xD;
      be blinded to clinical data.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heterotopic ossification still pose the problem of diagnosis and clinical management that is&#xD;
      too late and invasive when complications arise. The challenge would be to identify patients&#xD;
      at earlier stage of HO development in order to start an early treatment. This study will&#xD;
      focus on the performance of ultrasound in the early screening of HO for patients admitted to&#xD;
      a post intensive care rehabilitation unit after severe neurological trauma, this population&#xD;
      being at high risk of HO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient enrollment will be performed only at the PICRU of the Raymond Poincaré Hospital&#xD;
      (AP-HP). Another center (the imaging department of the same hospital) will participate in&#xD;
      this research for ultrasounds and CT scans, but will not perform any recruitment.&#xD;
