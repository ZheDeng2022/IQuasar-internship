  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop an objective scar scoring system via ultrasonography and try to&#xD;
      apply it to clinical using.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was divided into two parts. The first part of the study is an observational study&#xD;
      design. The scar scoring system will be developed, and its test-retest reliability and&#xD;
      criterion-related validity will be tested in this part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part is also an observational study design. The clinical application of the system&#xD;
      on traumatic injured patients is conducted in the second part. The results from this scar&#xD;
      scoring system are correlated with hand function measurements. Moreover, every scar will be&#xD;
      recorded three times within one month during routine rehabilitation to investigate the&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
