    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation plan will include a Screening/Baseline visit (V1) in which&#xD;
      patients will be screened on the basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria and clinically&#xD;
      evaluated. Screened and eligible patients will be randomly assigned in one of the two groups:&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive ConnettivinaBio Plus cream whereas Group 2 will receive ConnettivinaBio&#xD;
      cream. Lesions will be cleaned and a photo will be acquired with a digital camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, the schedule treatment will consist of daily medication changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound Bed Score, clinical signs of localized infection, measurement of the wound area,&#xD;
      collection of the swab, according to the Levine's technique, EQ-5D questionnaire to the&#xD;
      patient will be assessed on Day 1 (V1, baseline visit), 7 (V2), 14 (V3), 21 (V4) and 28 (V5)&#xD;
      post-baseline. Treatments in both groups (ConnettivinaBio Plus or ConnettivinaBio) will be&#xD;
      applied for a maximum period of 28 days. The easiness of treatment application will be also&#xD;
      recorded at V5.&#xD;

    <masking_description>At Screening/Baseline visit patients who signed the informed consent and are eligible for the study will be screened by the Investigator who will gather demographic and medical history data and perform the randomization procedure. After the allocation of the patient to Group 1 or 2, the Un-blinded Investigator will perform the treatment, according to the group allocation and instruct the patients on dressing daily renewal. The Investigator, who won't take part in the administration of study treatments and won't be aware on the patient.s group assignment, will perform all the evaluations for primary and secondary endpoint, during the visits (Blinded Evaluator).</masking_description>

The appearance and/or modification of signs of infection will be evaluated as percentage change from baseline at all visits. The evaluation will be carried out calculating the clinical wound's infection score through an 18-point scale, based on the presence and intensity of the following clinical signs: fever, local heat, peri-lesional erythema, persistent pain (between two dressing changes), oedema, malodour, pus and exudate production (Cutting KF, 1994; Trial C, 2010).</description>
