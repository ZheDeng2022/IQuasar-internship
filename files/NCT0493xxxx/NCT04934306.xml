  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The velopharyngeal mechanisms (in particular the movements of the soft palate) is frequently&#xD;
      affected by craniofacial anomalies such as cleft lip and palate. Nasofibroscopy is frequently&#xD;
      used in clinical care to assess the velopharyngeal function because it allows for direct&#xD;
      visualization of the velopharyngeal port. However, it is an invasive procedure that could not&#xD;
      be tolerated well by children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasometry is a non-invasive acoustic measurement technique which can be used to objectively&#xD;
      assess a velopharyngeal dysfunction (whether it can be heard or not), and thus supplement the&#xD;
      perceptual evaluation conducted by a trained clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to establish normative nasalance scores with the&#xD;
      KayPENTAX Nasometer (Nasometer II 6450 model) for native French-speaking children between 8&#xD;
      and 10 years old.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The velopharyngeal mechanism (in particular the movements of the soft palate) is frequently&#xD;
      affected by craniofacial anomalies such as cleft lip and palate and it needs to be assessed.&#xD;
      Indeed, the velopharyngeal sphincter has to be efficient in order to properly isolate the&#xD;
      oral cavity from the nasal cavity. Thus, the nasal cavity is protected during swallowing&#xD;
      (preventing food or liquids from passing through the nose). It also ensures a correct&#xD;
      phonation and articulation of oral phonemes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A perceptual evaluation of the velopharyngeal function is always conducted by a clinician.&#xD;
      But it is a subjective assessment which may need to be supplemented by an objective&#xD;
      instrumental assessment. Nasofibroscopy is frequently used in clinical care to evaluate the&#xD;
      velopharyngeal function because it allows for direct visualization of the velopharyngeal&#xD;
      port. However, it is an invasive procedure that could not be tolerated well by children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasometry on the other hand is a non-invasive acoustic measurement technique. It is based on&#xD;
      the relation between nasal and oral acoustic energy and determines a nasalance score.&#xD;
      Calculated in real time during speech production, the nasalance is a measure expressed as a&#xD;
      percentage : (nasal acoustic energy) / (sum of oral and nasal acoustic energy). The device&#xD;
      computing the nasalance score is called a Nasometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in addition to the speech therapist's perceptual evaluation, nasometry can be used to&#xD;
      objectively assess and quantify a velopharyngeal dysfunction whether it can be heard or not.&#xD;
      However in order to determine if a patient's nasalance score is pathological or not, it must&#xD;
      be compared to standardized norms. Yet presently, there are no normative nasalance data for&#xD;
      French-speaking children. The main objective of this study is to establish normative&#xD;
      nasalance scores with the KayPENTAX Nasometer (Nasometer II 6450 model) for native&#xD;
      French-speaking children between 8 and 10 years old.&#xD;
