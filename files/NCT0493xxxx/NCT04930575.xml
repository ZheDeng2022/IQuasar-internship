      The purpose of this study will determine the effect of muscle energy technique versus&#xD;
      mulligan technique on neck pain in breastfeeding women.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conservative treatments used to manage neck pain are numerous and include usual medical care&#xD;
      ( face to face interview, education, reassurance, medication, ergonomic and stay active&#xD;
      advice), various forms of exercise, massage, and acupuncture among others, but a lack of&#xD;
      evidence regarding their relative efficacy was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More research is needed to determine specific exercise programs that can decrease neck pain&#xD;
      in breastfeeding women. So, this study will be conducted to determine clinical evidence of&#xD;
      the effectiveness of muscle energy technique versus mulligan technique on neck pain, which&#xD;
      constituted a great problem facing the mother during the breastfeeding period.&#xD;

    <measure>Assessing the change in Functional disability</measure>

    <description>Assessment via using Neck pain disability index questionnaire consists of 10 items each of them is scored from 0 to 5. The total maximum score is therefore 50.The original report provided scoring interval for interpretation, as; (0-4) = no disability, (5-14) mild, (15-24) moderate, (25-34) sever, (above34) complete disability.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the group (B) will receive muscle energy technique on tonic muscles in the neck (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes, levator scapulae, and upper trapezius) in addition to strengthening exercise for deep cervical flexors and advice to correct positions three times per week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
The aim of the Muscle Energy Technique in the context of NP is to decrease pain, improve movement, motor control, and function and thereby reduce disability.&#xD;
A biomechanical correction approach can lead to the normalization of spinal curvatures and a decrease in the compressional and tensional stress on joints and soft tissues of the body thus alleviating the patient's signs and symptoms.</description>

    <description>The patient will be in a supportive low back chair, thus cervical region will be in a vertical position (Weight-bearing position) with the therapist position will be behind the patient.&#xD;
Then the therapist will move the spinous process up in the direction that must follow the apophyseal joint plane under treatment, that is, toward the eye ball. While sustaining this pain-free accessory glide, the patient will be instructed to actively perform the physiological movement gradually until the end ROM with over pressure at the end of the range.</description>
