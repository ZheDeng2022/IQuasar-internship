  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by limited exercise performance, which is mainly&#xD;
      determined by disease-specific factors, such as diminished cardiac output, abnormal&#xD;
      ventilatory response, and low perfusion in skeletal muscles, which lead to skeletal muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction.1 Exercise intolerance and symptoms may lead to activity restriction and further&#xD;
      functional deterioration with the progression of CHF. There is some evidence that&#xD;
      disease-specific self-report measures more quantify clinically relevant domains than measures&#xD;
      of general health status and are generally more sensitive to clinical change. aim of the&#xD;
      study is to investigate the validity and reliability of the PMADL-8 questionnaire in the&#xD;
      Turkish population.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 8 questions. It is a daily living activities measurement questionnaire consisting of 4 categories (very easy = 1 point, easy = 2, difficult = 3 points, very difficult = 4 points). High scores indicate severe functional limitations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Heart Failure Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 20 questions and four sub-dimensions. The sub-dimensions of the scale are dyspnea (5 questions), fatigue (4 questions), mood (7 questions) and dominance (4 questions). The questions have Likert-type response options ranging from 1 (worst) to 7 (best). The higher the score, the higher the quality of life.</description>
