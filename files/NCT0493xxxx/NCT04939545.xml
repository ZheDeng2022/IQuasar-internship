  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to examine the analgesic effectiveness of continuous loco-regional analgesic&#xD;
      application (ropivacaine) through surgically placed Intercostal Catheter (ICC) and to&#xD;
      establish correctly this method as a possible standard of care in the postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      after Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) anatomical lung resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Good control of the pain without excessive use of opiates supports the benefits of minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to examine the efficacy of continuously via surgically placed intercostal&#xD;
      catheter administered ropivacaine at a flow rate of 6-8 ml/h of 2 mg/ml on post-operative&#xD;
      pain (NRS) and pulmonary function (FEV1, PEF) during a maximum of 72 ± 2 hours after skin&#xD;
      closure. Patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic anatomical resection of the lung&#xD;
      under general anaesthesia with confirmed or anticipated Stage I Lung cancer will be included.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as superiority, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized. The&#xD;
      efficacy of loco-regional administered ropivacaine will be compared to placebo (NaCl, 0.9%)&#xD;
      administration. The whole study period per participant is expected to be 6 months. In the&#xD;
      follow-up, 6 months after surgery, the impact of ropivacaine on long-term pain (NRS, McGill)&#xD;
      and pulmonary function (FEV1, PEF) shall be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Silverman integrating approach (SIA) score is a combined score from the pain numerical rating scale (NRS) and analgesics (opiate) usage. It is a sum of rank- based percentage differences from the mean rank in pain scores and opioid use, ranging from -200 to 200%. SIA-scores integrate pain scores and opioid use for the individual patient.</description>

    <description>The SF-MPQ consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory; 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate or 3 = severe. Three pain scores are derived from the sum of the intensity rank values of the words chosen for sensory, affective and total descriptors. The SF-MPQ also includes the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) index of the standard MPQ and a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable. The higher the integrated score, the higher the pain level.</description>
