  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: HIV prevalence and sexual risk have been estimated very high for transgender&#xD;
      people. However, the limited sampling and data collection methods used in current research on&#xD;
      transgender people potentially led to overrepresentation and generalisation of people at risk&#xD;
      for HIV. Current HIV prevalence estimates in transgender populations are generalised from&#xD;
      studies mainly focusing on transgender women who engage in sex work. Moreover, current&#xD;
      research remains cisnormative, and studies focusing on non-binary people, who identify with a&#xD;
      broad range of identities beyond the traditional male and female gender identities, are&#xD;
      scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study aims to estimate the HIV prevalence rate in the Flemish and Brussels&#xD;
      (Belgium) transgender population, including transgender women as well as transgender men and&#xD;
      non-binary people, and identifying the associated individual and community-level risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this community-based cross-sectional study, self-identified transgender and&#xD;
      non-binary (TGNB) people will be recruited through a two-stage time-location sampling&#xD;
      approach to minimize selection bias. In a first part, community settings in which TGNB people&#xD;
      gather will be mapped using qualitative and ethnographic research methods, to reveal how the&#xD;
      TGNB community in Flanders and Brussels is structured and to develop an accurate sampling&#xD;
      frame. In a second part, to select the respondents, a multistage sampling design is applied&#xD;
      involving a stratification based on setting type (healthcare facilities vs outreach events),&#xD;
      a selection of clusters by systematic sampling and a simple random selection of TGNB people&#xD;
      within each cluster. Participants will complete an electronic self-reported survey to measure&#xD;
      sociological, sexual and drug-using behaviors (risk factors) and, at the same time, oral&#xD;
      fluid aliquots will be collected and tested for HIV antibodies. Logistic regression models&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate risk factors independently associated with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first to investigate the HIV&#xD;
      prevalence rates and behaviors that increase risk and vulnerability for HIV infection in an&#xD;
      accurate representation of the TGNB population in a West European country. The findings of&#xD;
      this study will globally serve as a knowledge base for identifying subgroups at risk for&#xD;
      becoming infected with HIV within TGNB people and to set up targeted prevention programs on&#xD;
      sexual health.&#xD;
