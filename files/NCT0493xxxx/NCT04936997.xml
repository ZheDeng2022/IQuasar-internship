      Explore the effects on immune response to include a potential third vaccine for the cancer&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent work performed by the University of Arizona Cancer Center team, 59 patients with a&#xD;
      known diagnosis of a solid tumor malignancy on active immunosuppressive cancer therapy were&#xD;
      enrolled through the University of Arizona Cancer Center during their routine care. These&#xD;
      subjects had a decreased response with the vaccine when compared to the health cohort. The&#xD;
      investigators are amending this study to explore the effects on immune response to include a&#xD;
      potential third vaccine for the cancer cohort. This will increase the visits required to&#xD;
      approximately two more visits. It will require two additional blood samples, one 48 hours&#xD;
      prior to third vaccine and the second, 5-11 days after the third vaccine. The following&#xD;
      protocol will be for the subjects that decide to continue onto a third vaccination.&#xD;
