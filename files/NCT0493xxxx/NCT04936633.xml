  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy of remote intervention by medical staff based on a cloud system&#xD;
      of continuous glucose monitoring data in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes using flash&#xD;
      sensor-based glucose monitoring (FSGM).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Previous studies have been reported on the efficacy of CGM or FSGM and education on&#xD;
           glucose control in insulin-dependent diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study aims to investigate whether it is more effective to receive remote&#xD;
           intervention by medical staff based on a cloud system, than only to use FSGM and receive&#xD;
           general education on FSGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial design : parallel group, allocation ratio 1:1, a superiority study design&#xD;
