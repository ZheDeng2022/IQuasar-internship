  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The women's health IPU at UT Health Austin is happy with having patients write down their&#xD;
      goals at their first visit and then tracking those. It would be interesting to study people&#xD;
      seeking musculoskeletal specialty care to determine whether asking patients what result of&#xD;
      their care would be rated a success helps direct the clinician-patient interaction in a more&#xD;
      fruitful direction compared to the usual clinical interaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People's stated preferences are often inconsistent with what matters most to them (their&#xD;
      values). And they are often based on misconceptions, distress, and less effective cognitive&#xD;
      coping strategies. For instance, a person might say &quot;My goal is to have no pain&quot; when that is&#xD;
      not possible. Or they might say &quot;My goal is to get the shot that fixes this&quot; when there is no&#xD;
      such shot. It may go without saying that people want: &quot;To be able to live a normal lifestyle&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;To be able to accomplish most of their goals.&quot; In other words, people want to be able to&#xD;
      be themselves. They are seeking care because they are not able to be themselves or they are&#xD;
      concerned that they may not be able to be themselves. The word health comes from an old&#xD;
      German word meaning &quot;whole.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      One part of good health is correcting or alleviating pathophysiology (e.g. reading glasses).&#xD;
      Another part of good health is evolving one's inner narrative (e.g. &quot;I'm older now and need&#xD;
      glasses to read&quot;).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All new, adult (18+ years old) patients seeing an orthopedic surgeon for a consultation will be invited to participate in this study. Patients randomly will be assigned to: write down goals their goals for their medical care (intervention) or not (usual visit control group). The research assistant will ask the patient to fill out a survey entailing demographics, JSPPE, the communication effectiveness score, the PAM score and a satisfaction scale at the end of the visit. A research assistant will record the diagnosis,</intervention_model_description>
