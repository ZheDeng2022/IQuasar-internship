  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, and tolerability of ASP0739, when&#xD;
      administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the clinical response and other measures of anticancer activity&#xD;
      of ASP0739 when administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab based on&#xD;
      central and local assessment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is comprised of 2 phases. Phase 1 (dose escalation) includes participants with&#xD;
      solid tumors known to express New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1). Phase&#xD;
      2 (ASP0739 as single agent and in combination with Pembrolizumab) includes participants with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Synovial Sarcoma (SS), myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL), and ovarian&#xD;
      cancer who have not responded to Standard of Care (SOC) or are ineligible for standard&#xD;
      therapy. Phase 2 single agent will also include a cohort of participants with select solid&#xD;
      tumors known to express NY-ESO-1 (melanoma, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer-adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      [NSCLC], squamous cell and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ESCC]).&#xD;
