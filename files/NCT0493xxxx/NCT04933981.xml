  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residents in nursing homes for the senior citizens (NH) are at high risk for death from&#xD;
      COVID-19. We investigated whether repeated non-mandatory RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 surveillance of NH&#xD;
      staff and visitors reduces COVID-19 incidence rates in NH residents and allows to reduce&#xD;
      visiting restrictions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nursing homes for senior citizens are considered risk areas for the transmission of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. To protect these risk groups, different strategies have been implemented within&#xD;
      the framework of legally applicable conditions. The aim of this study is to observe two&#xD;
      procedural standards (e.g. visiting restrictions, hygiene measurements):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the one hand, a standard procedure without testing of visitors and employees and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on the other hand, a standard procedure with additional surveillance by voluntary&#xD;
           testing of visitors and staff for SARS-CoV-2 and associated relaxation of measures for&#xD;
           contact of visitors with residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both standard procedures are designed to ensure adequate protection against infection. The&#xD;
      standard procedure with the use of relaxing the measures after testing aims to make the&#xD;
      experience of social isolation more bearable for the residents of care facilities and thus&#xD;
      less stressful from a psychological point of view. The extent of such possible effects is not&#xD;
      the subject of the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to observe the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections among&#xD;
      residents of nursing homes for senior citizens under different procedural standards for&#xD;
      infection control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, various measures specified by care institutions for visits to senior citizens'&#xD;
      homes are accompanied by scientific screening. The aim of the screening and the analysis of&#xD;
      infection protection measures is to enable this vulnerable group to regain participation in&#xD;
      society but still slow down the spread of the virus and prevent an outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The (mobile) infection control center (&quot;Coronamobil&quot;) of the University Hospital of Cologne&#xD;
      (UKK) makes a decisive contribution to the longitudinal investigation of a risk population&#xD;
      and to the early detection of chains of infection in addition to the surveillance carried out&#xD;
      by the authorities. In this study, the Coronamobil and personnel are provided to avoid an&#xD;
      additional screening burden for the homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance of nursing homes allows protection of particularly vulnerable populations in the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and additional controlled contact. An evidence-based, safe and human&#xD;
      visit concept could be transferred from Cologne to the whole of Germany. The resulting&#xD;
      scientific knowledge would additionally provide a foundation for the control of future&#xD;
      outbreak situations.&#xD;

      Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is performed by nasal and/or pharyngeal swab using conventional swab&#xD;
      materials. The oropharynx and/or nasopharynx of the participants will be swabbed in an arc&#xD;
      for approx. 5 seconds to ensure the highest possible quality of the swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The swabbing is performed by qualified medical personnel using personal protective equipment&#xD;
      including gloves, disposable gown, hood, goggles and FFP masks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples are brought to the testing laboratory within 12 hours of collection. Further analysis&#xD;
      of the nose/throat swabs is performed by PCR at the Institute of Virology, University of&#xD;
      Cologne.&#xD;
