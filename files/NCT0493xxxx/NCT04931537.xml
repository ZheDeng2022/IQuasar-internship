    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major microvascular complications associated with&#xD;
      diabetic patients, and also the major global cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD). Albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are&#xD;
      currently recognized clinical indicators for early diagnosis of DN, however, the sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity are unsatisfactory. The early identification and treatment of DKD are&#xD;
      conducive to lowering the risk of kidney damage by as much as 50%. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      particularly critical to find new biomarkers to reflect the potential DKD lesions in the&#xD;
      clinical silent period earlier and more accurately. Therefore, this study intends to analyze&#xD;
      the differentially expressed lipids in early DKD, T2DM and healthy adults by mass&#xD;
      spectrometry, and verify the related results by larger samples, so as to screen out early&#xD;
      markers of DKD and achieve the ultimate goal of clinical application.&#xD;

      The present study was a scientific research project concurrently conducted by clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory. In term of clinical research, the basic personal data, medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination and auxiliary examination results of subjects were mainly recorded. Whereas in&#xD;
      term of basic research, the serum, plasma and urine samples of patients were collected for&#xD;
      serological and metabonomics research to find new biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, we recruited the patients who met the inclusion criteria. The patients' serum, plasma&#xD;
      and urine were collected at baseline after obtaining informed patient consent.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, the basic information, anthropometric indicators (including height, weight,&#xD;
      waist circumference, hip circumference, blood pressure), past history, family history,&#xD;
      menstrual history, birth history, medication history, lifestyle of the patients were&#xD;
      registered, and the corresponding laboratory examination and auxiliary examination were&#xD;
      carried out according to the diagnostic process. All data and data were entered into the&#xD;
      database for later analysis. After the initial diagnosis, the patients were enrolled in the&#xD;
      current trial. The patients were followed up annually until the last follow-up visit, and the&#xD;
      complete follow-up was conducted for at least 5 years. Each follow-up followed the principles&#xD;
      of routine clinical diagnosis and treatment. In addition, the patients' serum, plasma and&#xD;
      urine samples were collected once a year during follow-up, and a centralized test of&#xD;
      glycosylated hemoglobin was performed once a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetic nephropathy was explored through&#xD;
      multi-center standardized clinical follow-up; The potential mechanism and possible biomarkers&#xD;
      in patients with early renal diseases of type 2 diabetes was explored through prospective&#xD;
      long-term follow-up, so as to find novel therapeutic approaches and suitable population.&#xD;
