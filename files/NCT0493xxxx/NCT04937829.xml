  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults between 18 and 65 years of age who have depression (major&#xD;
      depressive disorder). People with a current depressive episode lasting between 2 months and&#xD;
      one and a half years can join the study. This study is for people for whom existing&#xD;
      treatments for depression do not work sufficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test how well a medicine called BI 1569912 is tolerated and&#xD;
      whether it may help people with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to test 4 different dosages of BI 1569912 in this study. Each participant gets&#xD;
      either one BI 1569912 dosage or placebo. It is decided randomly, which means by chance, who&#xD;
      gets which treatment. Participants take BI 1569912 or placebo as tablets once during the&#xD;
      study. Placebo tablets look like BI 1569912 tablets but do not contain any medicine.&#xD;
      Participants also continue taking their usual medicine for depression throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are in the study for about 5 weeks. During this time, they visit the study site&#xD;
      4 times, with a stay at the study site for 9 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors check the health of the participants and note any health problems that could have&#xD;
      been caused by BI 1569912. The participants fill in questionnaires about their depression&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>MADRS is a ten-item questionnaire used to measure the severity of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

&#xD;
          1. Established diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as confirmed at the time of&#xD;
             screening by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), with a duration&#xD;
             of current depressive episode ≥ 8 weeks and ≤ 18 months at the time of screening&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least moderate severity of MDD confirmed by a trained site-based rater, at&#xD;

             as evaluated by Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ).&#xD;
