  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the individual and interactive effects of oral cannabis and alcohol&#xD;
      on subjective and behavioral measures of impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical laboratory study will be double-blind, placebo-controlled and will utilize a&#xD;
      within-subjects experimental design. Participants will complete 7 outpatient drug&#xD;
      administration sessions that will consist of self-administration of oral cannabis (0, 10 or&#xD;
      25mg THC) and alcohol (either placebo or active; BAC of 0.05 percent); participants will&#xD;
      always receive both an alcohol drink (active or placebo) and dose of cannabis (active or&#xD;
      placebo). Participants will also complete a condition in which they administer alcohol (BAC:&#xD;
      0.08 percent) with placebo cannabis, as a positive control. Primary outcomes include&#xD;
      performance on field sobriety tests, cognitive and psychomotor impairment, subjective drug&#xD;
      effects, and simulated driving performance. Blood concentrations of THC and THC metabolites&#xD;
      will also be determined.&#xD;
