      The study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the effect of segmental trunk stability training on sitting in children with&#xD;
           spastic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the effect of segmental trunk stability training on upper limbs functions in&#xD;
           children with spastic CP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postural dysfunction is one of the most limiting factors in children with CP. It restricts&#xD;
      reaching skills and in turn reduces participation in activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trunk plays a key role in maintaining the postural control mechanism and also in the&#xD;
      organization of balance reactions in this developmental process. The trunk control is also&#xD;
      required for a stable base of support which is necessary to execute functional activities for&#xD;
      limb movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal level of trunk support for a child with spastic CP still remains unknown. Thus,&#xD;
      providing intermediate levels of trunk stabilization would be a better solution than&#xD;
      providing full support in children with CP. Innovation is necessary to improve outcomes for&#xD;
      children with moderate to- severe CP who are at level IV and V on GMFCS. However, these&#xD;
      children are often excluded from posture research . Very little research has examined&#xD;
      postural constraints in children with moderate-to-severe CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is a lack of tools used in precise trunk stabilization during training, a further&#xD;
      researches are needed. Recently, a special attention has been given to the segmental trunk&#xD;
      control and its effects on improvement of gross and fine motor skills. Most of previous&#xD;
      studies have been applied during segmental fixation of the trunk at multiple levels from&#xD;
      static position either sitting or standing. In the present study, the effect of external&#xD;
      segmental stabilization of the trunk at selected parts will be monitored during the active&#xD;
      training and participation of the child.&#xD;
