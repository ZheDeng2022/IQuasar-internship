  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed for participants who have cancer of the upper gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      tract such as cancer of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum (the initial portion of your small&#xD;
      intestine), pancreas, bile duct (Cholangiocarcinoma), ampulla, or gall bladder with limited&#xD;
      sites of spread (metastases). Doctors leading this study are looking to see if treating the&#xD;
      disease using sequential procedures (more than one procedure given one after another) such as&#xD;
      surgeries or radiation can lead to better survival and if these surgeries, combined with&#xD;
      standard of care treatment, are safe for the treatment of upper GI cancers.&#xD;

      The purpose of the proposed study is to identify a group of patients with metastatic cancer&#xD;
      of the upper GI and biliary tract that may benefit from sequential procedures such as&#xD;
      surgeries or radiation compared to the current standard of care chemotherapy treatment alone.&#xD;

    <description>If you are assigned to this arm, study doctors will sequentially remove and treat all visible cancer spots with surgery, radiation, ablation, or other procedures. These interventions might include surgical removal of the diseased part of your lung, liver, lymph nodes, and/or the lining of your belly. In addition, if surgery could not be done, we could treat these diseased spots with other modalities such as radiation and/or radiofrequency/microwave ablation.&#xD;

    <description>Depending on the location of you cancer and the state of your cancer after chemotherapy, you may receive on the the following ablation treatments:&#xD;
-Microwave or Radiofrequency Ablation: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are treatments that remove liver tumors by placing a needle through the skin into the tumor. In RFA, high-frequency electrical currents are passed through an electrode in the needle, creating a small region of heat. In MWA, microwaves are created from the needle to create a small region of heat. The heat destroys the liver cancer cells.&#xD;
-General Tumor Ablation Treatment: a minimally invasive surgical method to treat solid cancers. Special probes are used to &quot;burn&quot; or &quot;freeze&quot; cancers without the usual surgery. Doctors use images of your tumor to guide where they place the needle. This requires only a tiny hole, usually less than 3 mm via which the probe is introduced.</description>
