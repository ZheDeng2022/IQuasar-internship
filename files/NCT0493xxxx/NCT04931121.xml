  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease in the world and induces major physical,&#xD;
      psychological, societal and economic burdens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of osteoarthritis is complex. Viscosupplementation by local injection in the&#xD;
      arthritic knee is a validated therapy used after failure of conventional analgesic treatments&#xD;
      and non-pharmacological modalities. The size effect of this treatment is modest between 0.3&#xD;
      and 0.6. We do not currently have any predictive criteria for the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure tested in this research is the characterization of synovial fluid (SF) by an in&#xD;
      vitro Raman microspectroscopy technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained will make it possible to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      visco-supplementation with hyaluronic acid from the Hyalgan© trade according to classic&#xD;
      criteria in the literature.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study consists in analysing the synovial fluid (SF) of patients obtained in&#xD;
      conventional care that do not require new medical or nursing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All care that patients will receive is routinely provided by physicians. There is no&#xD;
      additional act of surveillance during the research. The follow-up medical visits are exactly&#xD;
      the same as those offered to patients as part of their treatment, no additional visits are&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the orthopedic consultation for HA injection, the initial WOMAC score as well as the&#xD;
      PGAP and PASS scores will be measured. SF, usually considered as medical waste, will be&#xD;
      collected during an arthrocentesis prior to the intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid,&#xD;
      freezed at -80°C and then sended to the IVTV platform at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon for DDRS&#xD;
      Raman spectroscopy (LabRam HR 800, Horiba Jobin Yvon, Villeneuve d'Asq). Studied SYNODIAG&#xD;
      biomarkers are dried drops parameters (surface) and Raman ratios according to the FR3059781&#xD;
      patent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6-month follow-up visit, WOMAC, PGAP and PASS scores will be re-measured to determine&#xD;
      the patient's responding/non-responding status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the objective of the study is to verify if there are significant differences between&#xD;
      the Raman ratios and dried drops parameters of SF patients responding and non-responding to&#xD;
      viscosupplementation.&#xD;

        Subjects are patients referred for knee osteoarthritis and treated with an hyaluronic acid&#xD;
        injection (viscosupplementation). The patient knee radiography will be used to grade&#xD;
        osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren Lawrence score. The study will be limited to&#xD;
        patients with a KL score lower than 4.&#xD;
