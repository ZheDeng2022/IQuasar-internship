    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the tumor objective response rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      sotorasib assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria in&#xD;
      participants who receive sotorasib at either Dose A or a Dose B whose tumors are programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) &lt; 1% and/or harbor a serine/threonine&#xD;
      kinase 11 (STK11) co-mutation, in a subgroup of subjects with PD-L1 &lt; 1% and in a subgroup of&#xD;
      subjects with STK11 co-mutation.&#xD;

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
