    <textblock>
      The QUIT-Mobile study proposes to use mobile phone self-monitoring and feedback to enhance&#xD;
      and sustain over 12-months the impacts of the Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT), an&#xD;
      effective screening and brief intervention (SBI) previously successful in reducing risky drug&#xD;
      use (i.e., moderate use) in low-income, diverse patients over a 3-month follow up. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct the QUIT-Mobile study for patients who receive care in clinics of&#xD;
      federally qualified health centers (FQHC) in Southern California over 12-months follow up.&#xD;
      The study is an Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Type 1 design consisting of a&#xD;
      single-blind, 3-arm, RCT with adult, mostly Latino FQHC primary care patients with risky drug&#xD;
      use (ASSIST score 4-26), randomized to 3 conditions (n=320/arm, n=960 total): 1) QUIT-Mobile;&#xD;
      2) standard QUIT; 3) Usual Care. Qualitative data on implementation facilitators and barriers&#xD;
      will inform future scale-up and sustainability, in addition to cost data analyses. The aims&#xD;
      are to examine effectiveness in reducing risky drug use and cost-effectiveness comparing the&#xD;
      three arms over 3-, 6- and 12-months. Drug use measures include self-reports for past 30-days&#xD;
      and urine drug screen validation for underreporting (acknowledging that people with moderate&#xD;
      risk drug use have sporadic drug use patterns requiring longer self-report recalls for drug&#xD;
      use that urine screens may not detect). The 3-arm study enables testing of the independent&#xD;
      and synergistic effects of QUIT-Mobile compared to QUIT and both to Usual Care. The 12-month&#xD;
      timeline reflects annual primary care visits when screening and brief intervention would be&#xD;
      repeated routinely. The QUIT intervention contains 3 primary components: 1) patient screening&#xD;
      with the WHO ASSIST, 2) brief clinician advice (&lt;3 minutes) including opioid overdose&#xD;
      prevention education, and 3) 2- and 6-week telephone drug-use health coaching sessions&#xD;
      utilizing motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral techniques, delivered by&#xD;
      paraprofessional health coaches. QUIT-Mobile tests the addition of mobile phone&#xD;
      self-monitoring, automated feedback, and coach monitoring dashboard to enhance and sustain&#xD;
      QUIT's drug use reductions using mobile-web app, text-messaging (SMS), or interactive voice&#xD;
      response (IVR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The US Mental Health Parity Act encourages primary care (PC) providers to integrate&#xD;
      behavioral health, including drug use reduction, into routine PC. QUIT (the Quit Using Drugs&#xD;
      Intervention Trial), a multi-component screening and brief intervention (SBI) for diverse&#xD;
      drug using adults in PC, reduces risky drug use and improves quality of life (QoL) over 3&#xD;
      months; the findings have been replicated in a subsequent study. Three key evidence gaps are:&#xD;
      a) the effectiveness of SBI for people with moderate risk drug use over 6- and 12-months; b)&#xD;
      low-cost methods to enhance, sustain, and monitor drug use reductions; and c) implementation&#xD;
      barriers, facilitators, and costs of SBI for people with moderate risk drug use in PC. This&#xD;
      study is an Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Type 1 design consisting of a 3-arm RCT and&#xD;
      qualitative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUIT is a four-pronged program: 1) patient screener at reception via tablet-device; 2) brief&#xD;
      clinician advice (&lt;5-minute); 3) video doctor reinforcing clinician advice; and 4) two&#xD;
      telephone health coaching calls at 2- &amp; 6-weeks. Mobile phone &quot;apps,&quot; text-messaging (SMS),&#xD;
      and interactive voice response (IVR) tools offer opportunities to enhance, sustain, and&#xD;
      monitor effects of SBIs by facilitating patient activation and self-management between&#xD;
      coaching sessions during daily routines, and sustaining changes after coaching ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUIT-Mobile augments QUIT with 3 key functions: 1) patient self-monitoring of drug use and&#xD;
      related factors (i.e., cravings, pain, physical and mental health symptoms/QoL) twice weekly&#xD;
      by app, SMS, or IVR (per patient preference) and weekly from 6 wks to 12mo; 2) weekly&#xD;
      automated feedback on goal progress for reducing drug use; and 3) dashboards for coach&#xD;
      monitoring of patients' self-monitoring data. These functions aim to: enhance coaching&#xD;
      sessions by facilitating goal tracking, problem solving, and patient-coach engagement; and&#xD;
      after coaching to sustain patient activation; and monitor patients to prompt coach follow-up&#xD;
      if drug use increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-monitoring is a core element of self-regulation and self-management applied in a range&#xD;
      of chronic conditions. SMS, IVR, and apps enable self-monitoring and automated feedback to be&#xD;
      cheaply implemented and scaled. The theoretical bases underlying QUIT's cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      and motivational interviewing strategies emphasize that self-monitoring and feedback are&#xD;
      integral to self-regulation and self-management through self-observation, reflection,&#xD;
      self-correction, and reinforcement via self-reward, critique, and feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of QUIT-Mobile and QUIT over 12-months will be examined in a single-blind, 3-&#xD;
      arm, RCT with low-income, adult, mainly ethnic minority FQHC PC patients with risky drug use&#xD;
      (RDU - based on ASSIST score 4-26; ASAM level 0.5), randomized to 3 conditions (n=320/arm,&#xD;
      960 total): 1) QUIT-Mobile, 2) standard QUIT, and 3) Usual Care (UC). Primary outcomes are&#xD;
      drug use reductions measured by self-reports of past 30 days drug use (due to sporadic use&#xD;
      patterns of people with moderate/risky drug use) with urine screen validation measured at&#xD;
      baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-months. Subgroups will be compared on outcomes by demographics, drug&#xD;
      type, intervention engagement, comorbidities, pain, and clinic-level factors. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are health services utilization and quality of life. Formative Qualitative Research&#xD;
      will be conducted with patients, coaches, FQHC staff (providers, administrators, executives),&#xD;
      payers / insurers and policy stakeholders to identify barriers/facilitators to adoption,&#xD;
      implementation and sustainability. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research&#xD;
      (CFIR) will guide this work. Costs will also be monitored, and cost analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Reductions in use of the highest scoring drug on the ASSIST at baseline (that was&#xD;
      used in the past 30 days) across time at 3-, 6- and 12- months follow-up, as measured by&#xD;
      number of days of drug use in the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: 1) Improvement of quality of life as measured by the SF-12 physical and mental&#xD;
      health scores; 2) costs analyses of the interventions for reducing drug use, including use of&#xD;
      health services utilization data from EHR reviews; 3) barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      intervention implementation from qualitative reports with providers and clinic stakeholder,&#xD;
      patients, and payer and policy maker stakeholders; 4) drug use reductions measured by&#xD;
      timeline follow back (TLFB) of past 30 days use.&#xD;

Web-based dashboards will be used by coaches for monitoring of patients' self-monitoring data to enhance 2- and 6-week coaching sessions and for monitoring during the post-coaching self-management and monitoring period from 7-weeks to 12-months and intervening accordingly. The mobile platform will provide the same intervention functions (self-monitoring surveys and feedback messages) and robust data transfer protocols across three mobile technology platforms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients 18 years old and older receiving care at study clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a phone number at which they can be contacted over time during the study (to&#xD;
             conduct follow-up health education phone calls).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a primary care visit with a regular clinic provider on the date of recruitment&#xD;
             and enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English or Spanish-speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASSIST score between 4 and 26 indicating risky (moderate) drug use, and used the&#xD;
             substance in the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able (not cognitively impaired) and willing to cooperate with data collection and&#xD;
             research procedures, including and 2-week, 6-week, and 3, 6, 12-month follow-up&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planning to be in the Los Angeles area for the next 12 months so they can complete the&#xD;
             study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy: Women who report being pregnant at the time of randomization will be&#xD;
             excluded from participation. This latter exclusion criterion is based on the following&#xD;
             reasons: (a) The interaction of drug use (in any amount) and fetal-maternal health is&#xD;
             physiologically complex and beyond the scope of this proposed intervention. (b) Drug&#xD;
             users who are pregnant are considered high-risk pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeaters: All patients will be asked a set of repeater questions. This includes a&#xD;
             question on whether they have ever been involved in our UCLA study at the clinic&#xD;
             before. We will create a unique identifier based on a set of questions that we have&#xD;
             used in our prior studies that combines aspects about the potential subject (mother's&#xD;
             first name, father's first name, month and day of birth) that will screen them out if&#xD;
             they screen again in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASSIST Score above 26 indicating high use and potential serious SUD needing referral&#xD;
             to specialty treatment: The RA will receive a message that the subject scored 27+ on&#xD;
             alcohol or any drugs on the WHO ASSIST (i.e. indication of possible severe substance&#xD;
             use disorder). The RA will inform the patient that they are at risk for certain health&#xD;
             behaviors and ask the patient if they want to disclose this information to their&#xD;
             doctor. If they agree to disclose information to their doctor then we will fill out a&#xD;
             letter informing the doctor of patient's potential more serious substance use&#xD;
             disorder. We will also provide the patient with a list of local substance use disorder&#xD;
             treatment referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASSIST Score below 4 (low use): These patients are not eligible for enrollment in the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject Enrolled in a Substance Use Treatment Program: Subjects enrolled in a&#xD;
             treatment program are excluded from the study.&#xD;
