  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is comparing telemedicine and face-to-face visits to understand patients'&#xD;
      experiences with telemedicine versus face to face visits and to understand when it is and is&#xD;
      not appropriate to conduct visits remotely&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized trial of telemedicine (TM) versus face-to-face (F2F)&#xD;
      visits for follow up care of patients with either early-stage breast or prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not involve investigational drugs or devices but does involve survey data&#xD;
      collection from participants about their experiences of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an initial in-person routine visit, participants will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      telemedicine or face-to-face care delivery for their next routine visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated participants will be in the study for about 6 months depending on the&#xD;
      timing of their routine care appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 360 people will take part in this research study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For breast cancer participants: Early-stage breast cancer defined as Stages I-IIIA at&#xD;
             diagnosis or localized prostate cancer defined as Stages I-III&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For breast cancer participants: participant has completed definitive treatment for&#xD;
             early stage breast cancer including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, anti-HER2&#xD;
             antibody treatment. Participant may or may not be taking oral anti-estrogen treatment&#xD;
             such as tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For prostate cancer participants: participant is on active surveillance or has&#xD;
             undergone definitive surgery for localized prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is on a surveillance follow up visit schedule occurring at every three to&#xD;
             seven month intervals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to use Patient Gateway portal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has access to an electronic device that can support a video and audio&#xD;
             virtual visit platform (for example, laptop computer, desktop computer, smart phone)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants can be women or men&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose next visit requires cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy,&#xD;
             anti-HER2 antibody therapy or investigational cancer agents are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with distant metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated by radiation therapy for prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose next visit requires a prostate biopsy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Non-English speaking patients (non-English speaking patients will be excluded from the&#xD;
             trial given the challenges of delivering telemedicine with the use of medical&#xD;
             interpreters. There are also logistical challenges in obtaining the study endpoints,&#xD;
             which are largely survey based, with non-English speakers as well as the possibility&#xD;
             that study endpoints will be influenced by the presence of a medical interpreter&#xD;
             during a visit).&#xD;
