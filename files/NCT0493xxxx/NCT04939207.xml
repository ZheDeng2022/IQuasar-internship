  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Yearly, 180 000 patients in the Netherlands are referred to a cardiologist with symptoms&#xD;
      suspected of coronary artery disease (CAD). To assess this, multiple diagnostic tests are&#xD;
      available. Non-invasive imaging tests, such as coronary CT-scan, are safe, relatively cheap&#xD;
      and can effectively rule-out CAD. However, when CAD is present, coronary CT-scan cannot&#xD;
      assess the restriction in blood flow caused by the stenosis. Cardiac angiography with&#xD;
      invasive blood flow measurements is required to assess this restriction in blood flow. This&#xD;
      is an invasive test, more expensive than CT and it is accompanied by certain risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients in whom CAD is present do not need treatment, and would therefore benefit from&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostic tests. To reduce the number of unnecessary cardiac angiography with&#xD;
      flow measurements, new imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques use CT- or&#xD;
      angiographic images to calculate the restriction in coronary blood flow and determine the&#xD;
      need for treatment. This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of these&#xD;
      techniques when used as an addition to coronary CT-scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are eligible if their CT-scan indicates possibly significant CAD. To determine need&#xD;
      for treatment of a subject's CAD, the investigators will randomize subjects in three arms.&#xD;
      One arm consists of additional CT-derived calculation of coronary blood flow, one arm&#xD;
      consists of angiography-derived calculation of coronary blood flow and one arm consists of&#xD;
      standard care, coronary angiography and invasive coronary blood flow measurements. After&#xD;
      these tests, subjects are treated and followed according to routine care guidelines.&#xD;
      Additionally, subjects are requested to complete 5 questionnaires in a 12 month follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the total number of invasive cardiac angiographies with&#xD;
      additional blood flow measurements can be reduced by half with the use of new imaging&#xD;
      techniques. The investigators expect that this will lead to a reduction in healthcare costs,&#xD;
      complications and a lower burden of diagnostic tests for patients. The investigators do not&#xD;
      expect a difference in primary endpoints between the study groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only a small proportion of the 180 000 patients that are referred to a cardiologist each year&#xD;
      in the Netherlands with complaints of angina pectoris or shortness of breath suffer from&#xD;
      coronary stenosis in such a degree that revascularisation is required. To identify these&#xD;
      patients, multiple diagnostic tests are available. Simple non-interventional imaging tests,&#xD;
      such as coronary CT-scan, are safe, relatively cheap and can effectively rule-out coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. However, when coronary artery disease is present, coronary CT-scan cannot&#xD;
      assess the restriction in blood flow caused by the stenosis. Cardiac angiography with&#xD;
      invasive blood flow measurements is required to assess this restriction in blood flow. This&#xD;
      is an invasive test, more expensive than CT and it is accompanied by certain risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In retrospect, many patients unnecessarily undergo cardiac angiography with, if deemed&#xD;
      neccessary, flow measurements. These patients do not need treatment for coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. To reduce the number of unnecessary cardiac angiography with flow measurements, new&#xD;
      imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques use CT- or angiographic images to&#xD;
      calculate the restriction in coronary blood flow and determine the need for treatment. These&#xD;
      new imaging techniques have been tested extensively in observational studies. Currently,&#xD;
      there is no consensus in the optimal diagnostic pathway resulting in major differences in&#xD;
      strategies between hospitals. Moreover,data on cost-effectiveness is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of these techniques when used as an&#xD;
      addition to coronary CT-scan. Our target population will be patients with complaints of&#xD;
      angina pectoris or shortness of breath for which the patients will undergo coronary CT-scan.&#xD;
      If the CT-scan shows one or more possibly flow-limiting stenoses, further diagnostic testing&#xD;
      is required. These subjects are randomized in one of three possible arms. One arm will&#xD;
      receive additional CT-derived calculation of coronary blood flow, one arm will receive&#xD;
      angiography-derived calculation of coronary blood flow and one arm will receive standard&#xD;
      care. Standard care consists of coronary angiography and invasive coronary blood flow&#xD;
      measurements. The results of these tests determine the need for treatment of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. After these tests, subjects are treated according to routine care guidelines.&#xD;
      Subjects are requested to complete 5 questionnaires in a 12 month follow-up period. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is a composite of MACE - all-cause mortality, aborted sudden cardiac death,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and unplanned hospitalization for chest pain leading to urgent&#xD;
      revascularization during the 12-month follow-up period. Secondary endpoints consist of&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, the number of avoided invasive coronary angiographies and flow&#xD;
      measurements and quality of life. The investigators will use hospital patient files and&#xD;
      completed questionnaires to collect information about events during the follow-up period&#xD;
      until the last included subject has completed their final questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the total number of invasive cardiac angiographies with&#xD;
      additional blood flow measurements can be reduced by half with the use of new imaging&#xD;
      techniques. The investigators expect that this will lead to a reduction in healthcare costs,&#xD;
      complications and a lower burden of diagnostic tests for patients. The investigators do not&#xD;
      expect a difference in primary endpoints between the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the randomised controlled trial, all eligible subjects whose coronary CT-scan&#xD;
      does not show possibly significant coronary artery disease (CAD-RADS 0-2) are included in a&#xD;
      patient registry. Because of absent or limited coronary artery disease, additional diagnostic&#xD;
      testing is not needed in these patients. These subjects are requested to answer 5&#xD;
      questionnaires in a 12-month period, similar to the subjects included in the RCT-part of the&#xD;
      trial. The outcome measures of this part of the trial are similar to those of the RCT. Our&#xD;
      primary outcome is the occurrence of MACE-events, secondary outcomes are quality of life and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;
