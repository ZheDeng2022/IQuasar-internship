  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purposes of the proposed study is 1) To examine the changes of muscle fiber&#xD;
      cross-sectional areas in the leg extensor muscles (vastus lateralis) pre- to post- 6 weeks of&#xD;
      high-intensity resistance training and low-intensity resistance training with blood flow&#xD;
      restriction and 2) To examine changes in motor unit size (a non-invasive measure of muscle&#xD;
      fiber size) in the leg extensor muscles (vastus lateralis) pre- to post- 6 weeks of&#xD;
      high-intensity resistance training and low-intensity resistance training with blood flow&#xD;
      restriction.&#xD;

      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To examine the changes of type I and II (different types of muscle fibers)&#xD;
      muscle fiber cross-sectional areas in the leg extensor muscles (vastus lateralis) pre- to&#xD;
      post- 6 weeks of high-intensity resistance training and low-intensity resistance training&#xD;
      with blood flow restriction. Hypothesis 1: Type I and II fiber cross-sectional area will&#xD;
      increase following low-intensity resistance training with blood flow restriction, however,&#xD;
      only cross-sectional area of type II fibers will increase post high-intensity resistance&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To examine changes in the size of the motor units that are active during low&#xD;
      and high intensity contractions in the leg extensor muscles (vastus lateralis) pre- to post-&#xD;
      6 weeks of high-intensity resistance training and low-intensity resistance training with&#xD;
      blood flow restriction. Hypothesis 2: The motor units that are active during low and high&#xD;
      intensity contractions will increase in size from low-intensity resistance training with&#xD;
      blood flow restriction, but only the motor units that are active during high intensity&#xD;
      contractions will increase in size from high-intensity resistance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To examine changes in whole muscle cross-sectional area as measured via&#xD;
      ultrasound pre- to post- 6 weeks of high-intensity resistance training and low-intensity&#xD;
      resistance training with blood flow restriction. Hypothesis 3: Whole muscle cross-sectional&#xD;
      area will increase to similar degrees from both high-intensity resistance training and&#xD;
      low-intensity resistance training with blood flow restriction.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in this group will complete 3 resistance training sessions per week for 6 weeks (18 sessions total). During each resistance training session, participants will perform 3 sets of bilateral leg-extensions (performed with both legs) to volitional failure (likely 8-12 repetitions) using 80% of their 1-repetition maximum (the most weight they are able to perform 1 complete repetition with, but not 2).</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will complete 3 resistance training sessions per week for 6 weeks (18 sessions total). During each training session, participants will perform 3 sets of bilateral leg-extensions (performed with both legs) to volitional failure using 30% of their 1-repetition maximum (the most weight they are able to perform 1 complete repetition with, but not 2). Participants in this group will perform all leg extensions with blood flow restriction cuffs applied to the proximal thigh of both legs. The pressure that the cuffs are inflated to will be calculated based on estimates of each subject's arterial occlusion pressure from their thigh circumference. Once the target pressure is reached, the cuffs will not be deflated until after the final set of the training session.</description>
