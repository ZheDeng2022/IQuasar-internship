    <textblock>
      Pediatric oncology patients experience physical and psycho-social symptoms that negatively&#xD;
      affect their quality of life during treatment. &quot;Yoga&quot; practices, known as a unique physical&#xD;
      activity that combines mind-body awareness and breathing exercises to improve the quality of&#xD;
      life of pediatric oncology patients, have recently become popular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted experimentally in the form of pre-test and post-test with 30&#xD;
      controls, 30 experimental group children who were treated in the Pediatric Oncology /&#xD;
      Hematology service of a university hospital and their parents, in order to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of children's yoga program on the quality of life of pediatric oncology patients.&#xD;
      Ethics committee, institutional and parental consent was obtained. Data were collected using&#xD;
      a questionnaire form and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory &quot;PedsQL (4.0)&quot;. Participants&#xD;
      filled out the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory &quot;PedsQL (4.0)&quot; Child and Parent Form&#xD;
      before the 3-week (6 sessions) yoga program and salivary cortisol samples were taken from the&#xD;
      children. These procedures were repeated after the yoga program. Anova test and &quot;Paired&#xD;
      sample t&quot; test were used among statistical analysis methods. Statistical significance was&#xD;
      accepted as p &lt;0.05.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A questionnaire form was used to learn the socio-demographic characteristics of the children&#xD;
      participating in the study and their families. The survey questions are: (age of parents,&#xD;
      employment status, child's age, gender, maternal/paternal age, income status, diagnosis of&#xD;
      the child, hospitalization the reason (chemotherapy, new diagnosis, relapsed? hospitalized&#xD;
      for side effects of the disease? how much whether he was diagnosed a long time ago, how long&#xD;
      he has been in the hospital, whether he went to school, whether he had previous yoga&#xD;
      experience, whether he had knowledge about children's yoga before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the child yoga program, the study was conducted&#xD;
      with pre-test and post-test. Before the first yoga session, the experimental and control&#xD;
      group caregiver parents and children was completed the quality of life inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children's yoga program lasted for 3 weeks, 2 sessions per week. At the end of the 6th&#xD;
      session, parents and the child's quality of life inventory was repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the effect of yoga on stress of children, cortisol from saliva samples&#xD;
      were taken both groups before the program starts.The measurement was performed for both&#xD;
      groups after a 3-week (6 sessions) yoga program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses in the study can be summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Physical activity pre-test and post-test scores of the control and experimental groups&#xD;
      There is a significant difference between the groups in favor of the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Emotional functionality pre-test and post-test scores of the control and experimental&#xD;
      groups there is a significant difference between the groups in favor of the experimental&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Social functionality pre-test and post-test scores of the control and experimental groups&#xD;
      there is a significant difference between the groups in favor of the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: School functionality pre-test and post-test scores of the control and experimental groups&#xD;
      there is a significant difference between the groups favor of the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5: Cortisol levels, pre-test and post-test scores of the control and experimental groups&#xD;
      there is a significant difference between the groups in favor of the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS 22.0 Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program used for data&#xD;
      analysis.descriptive, parametric and non-parametric statistical analyzes, mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, median, frequency, percentile, minimum, maximum values calculated. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of the yoga program was measured using the anova (mixed anova) test and the&#xD;
      &quot;Paired sample t&quot; test. p&lt;0.05 value was accepted as the statistical significance limit.&#xD;
