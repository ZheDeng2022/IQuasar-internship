      From July to September 2020, in a first uncontrolled cohort study, 478 patients who were&#xD;
      hospitalized at Bicêtre hospital for COVID-19 and who survived were evaluated at 4 months&#xD;
      (publication accepted at JAMA). The current project aims to bring together the means to&#xD;
      continue this work during the 2nd epidemic wave.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      From 15th July to 18th September, 2020, in a first uncontrolled cohort study (Multi-Expertise&#xD;
      Consultation of Bicêtre After Covid-19, COMEBAC), we evaluated at four months the surviving&#xD;
      patients who were hospitalized at the Bicêtre hospital for COVID-19 during the 1st wave of&#xD;
      the epidemic in France and having survived this hospitalization. This cohort included 478&#xD;
      patients. The article resulting from the analysis of the data collected is accepted for&#xD;
      publication in JAMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation, the aim of which was both clinical and scientific, was carried out largely&#xD;
      thanks to human and material resources then demobilized because of the epidemic and thanks to&#xD;
      the investment of doctors and psychologists who carried out the work in addition to their&#xD;
      usual work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to the current call for projects aims to bring together the means to continue&#xD;
      this monitoring work during the 2nd epidemic wave, while the means and staff are this time&#xD;
      completely mobilized by the care of patients with COVID-19 and other. It also aims to raise&#xD;
      funds that will allow an in-depth analysis of the residual symptoms presented by the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project aims to continue the work started with the COMEBAC &quot;1st wave&quot; cohort&#xD;
      with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inclusion of patients hospitalized after the 1st wave.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An assessment of symptoms according to the SARS-CoV-2 variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 12-month follow-up of symptomatic patients during the evaluation in COMEBAC &quot;1st&#xD;
           wave&quot;.&#xD;
