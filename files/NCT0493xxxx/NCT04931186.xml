      1.1 Background Obstructions of the lacrimal drainage system can be differentiated based on&#xD;
      anatomical location or severity. But also, differentiating between congenital and acquired&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is possible. The incidence of congenital NLDO (CNLOD)&#xD;
      has been shown to be approximately 20%. Most of the cases undergo spontaneous remission, as&#xD;
      the ductus nasolacrimalis may open spontaneously. About 2-12% display a symptomatic course.&#xD;
      2. S: 290; 3; 4, 5 Acquired NLDO may occur during childhood and adulthood. The incidence of&#xD;
      symptomatic acquired NLDO is around 30 cases per 100.000 people in an US-based cohort study.&#xD;
      S: 293; 30 Two major anatomical closure sites have been described, which are on the one hand&#xD;
      located at the between the punctum and canaliculus, and on the other hand located after the&#xD;
      lacrimal sac. 1. S. ; 2. S: 293 1.2 Aim of this study The aim of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      success rates for different types of primary tear duct surgery, performed from 2013 - 2017 at&#xD;
      the department of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Medical University of Vienna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment success was defined as the absence of clinical signs of lacrimal drainage system&#xD;
      obstruction (epiphora, increased tear leak, mucous discharge) and without the need for&#xD;
      re-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is further investigated whether the type of operation performed or whether the silicone&#xD;
      tube used influence success rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Methods A retrospective chart analysis of all patients - independent of the underlying&#xD;
      pathology - undergoing surgery of the lacrimal drainage system between 1st of January 2013&#xD;
      and 31st December 2017. Success rates and patient profiles will be analyzed not only for all&#xD;
      patients, but also for subgroups based on the underlying pathology and operation performed.&#xD;
