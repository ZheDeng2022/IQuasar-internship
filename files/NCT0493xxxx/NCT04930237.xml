  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective case-control study of 40 patients undergoing 1-2 level ALIF&#xD;
      procedures at Methodist Dallas Medical Center (MDMC). Patient records will be reviewed to&#xD;
      identify details including demographics, comorbidities, procedure details, and the primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcome metrics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RELISTOR is a legally marketed device and will be used off-label under the authority of a&#xD;
      health care practitioner within a legitimate practitioner-patient relationship with the&#xD;
      intent of the &quot;practice of medicine&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of RELISTOR in the experimental group of this study meets all of the following&#xD;
      conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is not intended to be reported to the FDA in support of a new indication for use or to&#xD;
           support any other significant change in the labeling for the drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it does not involve a route of administration or dosage level, use in a subject&#xD;
           population, or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the&#xD;
           acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it is conducted in compliance with the requirements for IRB review and informed consent&#xD;
           [21 CFR parts 56 and 50, respectively];&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it is conducted in compliance with the requirements concerning the promotion and sale of&#xD;
           drugs [21 CFR 312.7]; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it does not intend to invoke 21 CFR 50.24&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo two levels of screening: the initial screening and a post-operative OIC&#xD;
      screening. The initial screening will involve all 1-2 level ALIF patients in the experimental&#xD;
      group and observational group who will be approached to participate in the study before&#xD;
      surgery. After eligible patients agree to participate and sign the ICF, all patients will&#xD;
      then be asked to complete the PAC-SYM instrument about their constipation symptoms over the&#xD;
      past 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will undergo their 1-2 level ALIF procedure and then will undergo the&#xD;
      post-operative OIC screen/rescreen (as needed) daily for acute OIC for a maximum of 3 days&#xD;
      (i.e., postoperative days 2 - 4). Patients who are found to have acute OIC will be designated&#xD;
      to the experimental and observational treatment regimens accordingly to Study Treatment&#xD;
      Regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient does not have acute OIC after they are rescreened on postoperative day 4, are&#xD;
      discharged, or do not meet the inclusion criteria, will be placed in the not-constipated or&#xD;
      post-operative screen failure group.&#xD;
