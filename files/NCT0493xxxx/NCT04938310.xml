  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Custom-made orthopedic support equipment and abdominal-lumbar support belts offer promising&#xD;
      potential for several aspects affecting the health and well-being of people with obesity who&#xD;
      choose a surgical weight loss option. However, research is needed to quantitatively document&#xD;
      their short and long term effects on a wide range of parameters related to mobility, quality&#xD;
      of life, lower back pain and skin maceration following parietal gastrectomy. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to characterize the effect of a support garment in an experimental design where&#xD;
      a subgroup of participants will be randomized and followed for the first 12 months after a&#xD;
      gastrectomy. The measures will be: physical activity, lower back pain, self-esteem, quality&#xD;
      of life, skin maceration and infections. This study will scientifically document the&#xD;
      usefulness and effectiveness of support garments throughout the weight loss surgery process.&#xD;
