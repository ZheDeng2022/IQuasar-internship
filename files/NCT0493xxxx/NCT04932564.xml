  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a well-known complication of allogeneic transplant. In&#xD;
      GVHD, the cells of the donor attack the patient's tissues and cause damage. It can affect any&#xD;
      organ or system of the body. In a proportion of patients, it affects the joints and muscles.&#xD;
      This is known as musculoskeletal GVHD. The standard treatment of musculoskeletal GVHD is&#xD;
      steroids. However, these are usually needed for prolonged periods, and cause a large number&#xD;
      of additional problems in transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leflunomide is a drug which has been used for several years in diseases like rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (RA). RA is an auto-immune disorder. The biological mechanisms underlying RA and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal GVHD are quite similar. Hence it is likely that leflunomide may work in&#xD;
      musculoskeletal GVHD also. The investigator have previously used leflunomide in a few&#xD;
      patients with musculoskeletal GVHD and have found it to be extremely effective. Also, it was&#xD;
      very safe (unlike steroids). Yet another advantage is that it is fairly cheap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to study the efficacy and safety of leflunomide in&#xD;
      patients with musculoskeletal GVHD in a prospective way.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The curative potential of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is&#xD;
      hampered by acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Although chronic GVHD (cGVHD)&#xD;
      can affect any organ / system in the body, commonly affected are skin, oral cavity, eyes,&#xD;
      liver, joints and fascia, and lungs. Involvement of these can occur alone or concurrently,&#xD;
      and these lead to a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal involvement in chronic GVHD (mGVHD) can have varied presentations like&#xD;
      fasciitis, myositis, arthritis, etc. The basic pathogenesis of mGvHD closely mimics&#xD;
      autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment goals of mGvHD include improvement or stabilisation of manifestations,&#xD;
      limitation of long-term treatment related toxicities, improvement in functional capacity and&#xD;
      quality of life. Corticosteroids, the standard frontline treatment, are typically&#xD;
      administered for a median of 2 to 3years, leading to substantial morbidity. An effort to&#xD;
      decrease corticosteroid doses has led to their use in combination with other drugs, such as&#xD;
      cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, etanercept,&#xD;
      ruxolotinib, imatinib, ibrutinib, ECP (extra corporeal photopheresis), methotrexate etc, in&#xD;
      frontline or second-line settings. All these drugs have been used with far and few responses&#xD;
      but with significant treatment related toxicity and costs. As far as musculoskeletal GVHD is&#xD;
      concerned, the British guidelines recommend corticosteroids as first line treatment and&#xD;
      rituximab as second line option. However, the morbidity associated with long term steroid use&#xD;
      warrants a quest for use of non-steroid therapies to be used in 1st line setting for chronic&#xD;
      GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leflunomide has been used in rheumatoid arthritis. At our centre, the investigator have&#xD;
      previously used leflunomide for patients with musculoskeletal GVHD and found it to be&#xD;
      effective and safe. Leflunomide is relatively cheap and potentially more effective compared&#xD;
      to other more expensive alternatives. If proven to be effective in a larger cohort of&#xD;
      patients, this drug could become the standard first line agent in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this, the investigator have planned to carry out this study to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      leflunomide in musculoskeletal GVHD post allogeneic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
