  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of cryotherapy in the early period pain&#xD;
      treatment of elderly patients with rib fractures due to blunt thoracic trauma.In this&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled study, geriatric patients were assigned to groups to&#xD;
      receive either coolant spray (n=51) or placebo spray (n=50). To the coolant spray group&#xD;
      patients,a coolant spray was applied. To the placebo group patients, a normal saline solution&#xD;
      in a bottle covered with white opaque paper and refrigerated at 4 °C was sprayed. The visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS) scores of all patients were recorded before starting spray application (V&#xD;
      0 ), at 10th minute (V 1 ), 20th minute (V 2 ), 30th minute (V 3 ), 60th minute (V 4 ), 120th&#xD;
      minute (V 5 ), and 360th minute (V 6 ). The mean decreases in the VAS scores and the mean of&#xD;
      the percentage of reduction in the VAS scores were calculated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical&#xD;
      trial.All patients were informed about the study procedures, and written consent was obtained&#xD;
      from the volunteers, who agreed to participate. Application of the sprays and measurement of&#xD;
      the VAS scores were performed by ED physicians who were blinded for the study. For the&#xD;
      placebo group, a standard saline solution in a bottle covered with opaque white paper and&#xD;
      refrigerated at 4°C was prepared. In the coolant spray group, coolant spray was applied as&#xD;
      suggested by the manufacturer (at a distance of 20 cm from the injured area for 5-10 s).&#xD;
      Saline solution was sprayed for the same duration and at the same distance from the injured&#xD;
      area as well. The first spray application was performed after the initial assessment, and the&#xD;
      second spray application was performed at the end of the 30th minute (immediately after the&#xD;
      pain level/score measurement). All patients were given intravenous (IV) dexketoprofen (50 mg&#xD;
      in 50 ml standard saline solution) in 5 minutes simultaneously with the first spray&#xD;
      application. The physicians applied the designated treatment protocol for each treatment&#xD;
      group. As a rescue analgesic treatment, patients were scheduled to be given IV fentanyl at a&#xD;
      dose of 1 mcg/kg.&#xD;
