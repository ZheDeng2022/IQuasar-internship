  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to validate and evaluate AI algorithms for detection and characterization of&#xD;
      early GI neoplasia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated; multi-centre study and will be conducted in two phases.&#xD;
      Validation &amp; Optimization phase, where routinely collected and anonymized endoscopic images&#xD;
      and videos from the departmental teaching and training library will be used to validate, and&#xD;
      if needed fine-tune and improve, the accuracy of an AI algorithm. Testing phase, where the&#xD;
      evaluation of AI algorithms performance will be conducted on a prospective basis. The ground&#xD;
      truth (standard) will be expert assessment and histological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has no direct impact on patient's clinical care, and collection of all endoscopic&#xD;
      data will take place during standard endoscopy procedures done for purely clinical&#xD;
      indications. No additional procedures, biopsies or interventions will be performed as a part&#xD;
      of this study.&#xD;
