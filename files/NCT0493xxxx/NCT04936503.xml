  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of March 2020, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, halting athletic competition&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports from China show a high prevalence of cardiac involvement in patients with severe&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. These cardiac forms were found to be closely associated with adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. The use of Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) had allowed to show that cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction could be mediated by myocardial inflammation (i.e. myocarditis). The direct&#xD;
      implication of the virus was demonstrated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2&#xD;
      being detected on myocardial biopsies in a patient with severe heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience with other viruses causing acute myocarditis shows that there is a high rate&#xD;
      of undetected injuries. Indeed, although severe heart failure can be present at the acute&#xD;
      stage, acute viral myocarditis is most commonly pauci or asymptomatic, but still leaving&#xD;
      occult myocardial scars visible on MRI, and exposing to higher risks of ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death over the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although athletes are younger and have fewer comorbidities than the general population and&#xD;
      therefore are at lower risk for severe disease or death, there is a critical and urgent need&#xD;
      to assess the prevalence of occult scars in the population of high-level athletes returning&#xD;
      to training after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemia.&#xD;
