  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the HALT COVID Ambassador&#xD;
      educational outreach program on increasing likelihood to vaccinate against COVID-19&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will use a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of HALT COVID&#xD;
      educational outreach by HALT COVID Ambassadors. HALT COVID Ambassadors will receive training&#xD;
      to answer common vaccine questions &amp; address misconceptions; conduct motivational&#xD;
      interviewing; and implement basic behavioral economics and related strategies to remove&#xD;
      barriers to vaccination. A random sample of FQHC patients will be identified in EHR data&#xD;
      downloads of adult patients seen in the last year and contacted by telephone to gain consent&#xD;
      and assess eligibility. A total of 100 individuals will be enrolled into the trial and&#xD;
      randomized to intervention (engagement with the HALT COVID Ambassador over a 1 month period&#xD;
      via in-person or virtual sessions exploring their own questions and concerns about vaccines)&#xD;
      or usual care (no extra engagement). Baseline, 1-month, and 2-month follow-up surveys will&#xD;
      assess for vaccine likelihood.&#xD;
