    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the effect of a continuous glucose monitor application in&#xD;
      improving outcomes in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and active cancer.&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction with type 2 diabetes management influences medication-taking behavior as&#xD;
      well as health outcomes. Adding continuous glucose monitor application to diabetes treatment&#xD;
      plan after hospital discharge plan may improve patient satisfaction and reduce diabetes&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate if addition of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to diabetes treatment plan&#xD;
      following inpatient hospitalization is associated with improved patient satisfaction with DM&#xD;
      management in patients with cancer and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate feasibility of CGM initiation upon hospital discharge. II. Evaluate effect of CGM&#xD;
      on recognition of post-hospitalization hypoglycemia. III. Evaluate patient reported outcome&#xD;
      of CGM incorporation into patient diabetes care burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate effect of CGM on depression score before and after CGM use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to hospital discharge, patients receive CGM application and education on how to apply&#xD;
      the CGM, and how to use the sensor and its associated smart phone application (app). Patients&#xD;
      also receive basic diabetes mellitus education. After hospital discharge, patients use CGM&#xD;
      for up to 28 days.&#xD;
