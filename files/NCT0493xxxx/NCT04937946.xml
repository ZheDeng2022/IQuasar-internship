      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Fentanyl for pain control in&#xD;
      Newborns on mechanical ventilator.&#xD;

      This Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted in the Department of Neonatology, BSMMU,&#xD;
      Dhaka after approval by Institutional Review Board (IRB). A Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained before enrollment in the study from the parents or guardians. . The study cohort&#xD;
      will comprise all inborn and outborn newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit&#xD;
      (NICU) who receive mechanical ventilation administered through an endotracheal tube . The&#xD;
      enrolled neonates will be randomly assigned with computer-generated random number tables via&#xD;
      software named 'Random Allocation Software', to receive either of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the parents will agree to the study and provide signed informed consent, all eligible&#xD;
      neonates will be randomized to start treatment within 24 hours from the initiation of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Randomized infants will be allocated to the fentanyl group to receive&#xD;
      a continuous infusion of fentanyl or to the placebo group to receive a continuous infusion of&#xD;
      iv fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl will be administered as an intravenous loading dose of 1 microgram/kg in 30 minutes,&#xD;
      followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 1μg/kg/hour. The infusion will be&#xD;
      administered through a peripheral line. Fentanyl infusion will be initiated within 24 hours&#xD;
      after the start of mechanical ventilation and will be continued until the end of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, and not longer than 5 days .&#xD;
