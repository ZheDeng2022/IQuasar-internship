  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protection of the body integrity of the newborn is very important in terms of the&#xD;
      development of physical and mental health and social health. Failure to protect the skin&#xD;
      integrity of newborns and not paying attention to the clinical findings on the skin may cause&#xD;
      morbidity/mortality. Attitudes of nurses can affect the evaluation of newborn skin negatively&#xD;
      and/or positively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was determined as the development of an attitude scale for newborn nurses to evaluate&#xD;
      newborn skin and examining the factors affecting their attitudes. In line with this purpose,&#xD;
      an attitude scale for newborn nurses regarding the evaluation of newborn skin will be&#xD;
      developed and nurses' attitude levels, sociodemographic variables that are related to&#xD;
      attitude and cause significant difference can be determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the indicators of the level of development of the countries is the newborn's life and&#xD;
      death rates. The increase in the neonatal survival rate is primarily related to the care&#xD;
      provided in the delivery room. Adaptation to the outside world is important because of the&#xD;
      physiological and psychosocial changes experienced by the newborn after birth. For this&#xD;
      reason, the adaptation process is monitored by monitoring the physiological and behavioral&#xD;
      changes in the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin is an important organ that &quot;protects the organism against environmental factors and&#xD;
      also regulates temperature and water loss in the organism&quot;. Newborn skin begins to act as a&#xD;
      barrier in the womb, matures gradually, and continues for up to 1 year after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immaturity of the skin of the newborn causes it to be the most open organ to external&#xD;
      factors, and it has a very sensitive and fragile structure until it reaches the required&#xD;
      maturity. Newborn skin can be damaged as a result of daily applications, and failure to&#xD;
      follow up the skin regularly and unsuitable interventions for the skin cause&#xD;
      morbidity/mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in skin maturation of preterm infants vary according to gestational age. The&#xD;
      stratum corneum, the outer layer of the epidermis, continues to mature until the 24th - 34th&#xD;
      week of pregnancy. In preterm infants born before the stratum corneum is mature; Risks of&#xD;
      infection, transepidermal water loss, temperature irregularity, absorption of topical agents,&#xD;
      or physical trauma are encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for neonatal nurses to fulfill their duties and responsibilities; They should have&#xD;
      knowledge and skills such as evaluating the newborn, using the equipment and technologies in&#xD;
      the unit, training/counseling parents, communicating effectively and collaborating. While&#xD;
      providing appropriate care by neonatal nurses increases the effect of the treatment, it also&#xD;
      minimizes the side effects that may occur. It is also very important for the early diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of the problems that have occurred and/or may occur with the clinical findings&#xD;
      determined as a result of the skin evaluation of the newborn by the nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attitude is one of the processes in which the individual is involved and has an important&#xD;
      place in explaining the reason for the behavior of the individual. Attitude is a preparatory&#xD;
      tendency for behavior and is the result of the interaction of emotion, thought and behavior&#xD;
      elements. The fact that the individual has order, harmony and continuity between his&#xD;
      feelings, thoughts and behaviors regarding a situation/event shows that a positive attitude&#xD;
      towards that situation/event is developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the national and international literature on nurses, who have an important role in the&#xD;
      evaluation of newborn skin, is examined, there are studies examining the knowledge and skills&#xD;
      of skin evaluation and care of both healthy and risky newborns. However, nowadays, it is&#xD;
      observed that instead of using an objective assessment tool, whose validity and reliability&#xD;
      has been ensured, in the evaluation of the skin condition of especially healthy/risky&#xD;
      newborns, the definitions of 'impaired skin integrity' or 'complete skin integrity' are still&#xD;
      made with the evaluations made with a subjective approach, and the newborn skin is not&#xD;
      considered as a whole. Regular evaluation of newborn skin is part of good care and allows for&#xD;
      early diagnosis and treatment of skin problems. In the evaluations made with a subjective&#xD;
      approach, the definitions of 'impaired skin integrity' or 'skin integrity' are made, and the&#xD;
      skin is not considered as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the national and international literature review, assumptions and opinions regarding&#xD;
      newborn nurses' evaluation of newborn skin with a subjective approach rather than an&#xD;
      objective approach have been put forward, but no research has been encountered that examines&#xD;
      their attitudes towards the subject. It is known that nurses' attitudes towards evaluating&#xD;
      newborn skin are important for the early prevention of skin problems of newborns and other&#xD;
      problems that may develop due to these problems, as an indicator of their tendencies towards&#xD;
      the evaluation process.&#xD;
