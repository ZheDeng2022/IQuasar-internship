  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial compares the effect of adding radiation therapy to an immunotherapy drug&#xD;
      called atezolizumab vs. atezolizumab alone in treating patients with urothelial cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). The addition of radiation to&#xD;
      immunotherapy may shrink the cancer, but it could also cause side effects. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a type of radiation therapy that uses high energy x-rays to&#xD;
      kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. This method uses special equipment to position a patient&#xD;
      and precisely deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor&#xD;
      cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and may cause less damage to normal tissue than&#xD;
      conventional radiation therapy. The combination of atezolizumab and radiation therapy may be&#xD;
      more efficient in killing tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the overall response rates by 6 months in patients with advanced urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma when treated with immunotherapy alone and immunotherapy plus radiotherapy to a&#xD;
      single site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the response rates using immune related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (iRECIST) as assessed by central review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients treated&#xD;
      with immunotherapy and immunotherapy plus radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess adverse events experienced by patients treated with immunotherapy and&#xD;
      immunotherapy plus radiotherapy via the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) and Patient Reported Outcome (PRO)-CTCAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether treatment affects are similar for key subgroups including those&#xD;
      defined by the stratification variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY OF LIFE CORRELATIVE STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare patient-reported fatigue as assessed by the Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Fatigue 8a from baseline through 24 months between&#xD;
      patients treated with immunotherapy alone and immunotherapy plus radiotherapy to a single&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as assessed by the European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (QLQ)-Core (C)30 from baseline through 24 months between patients treated with immunotherapy&#xD;
      alone and immunotherapy plus radiotherapy to a single site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare urinary symptoms as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-BLM30 from baseline through 24&#xD;
      months between patients treated with immunotherapy alone and immunotherapy plus radiotherapy&#xD;
      to a single site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare patient-reported diarrhea, shortness of breath and pain as assessed by the&#xD;
      EORTC QLQ-C30 from baseline through 24 months between patients treated with immunotherapy&#xD;
      alone and immunotherapy plus radiotherapy to a single site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare health utilities and quality-adjusted survival between patients treated with&#xD;
      immunotherapy alone and immunotherapy plus radiotherapy to a single site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare other scale scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (global health status and quality of&#xD;
      life; physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social function; symptoms) and EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-BLM30 (urostomy problems, catheter problems, future perspectives, abdominal bloating and&#xD;
      flatulence, body image, sexual function) at 45 days, and at 6, 12, and 24 months between&#xD;
      patients treated with immunotherapy alone and immunotherapy plus radiotherapy to a single&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of each&#xD;
      cycle. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive atezolizumab as in Arm A. Patients also undergo stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) for 3 fractions over 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 12 weeks and then every&#xD;
      3 months for 3 years following registration.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with life expectancy of less than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychiatric illness which would prevent the patient from giving informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medical conditions such as uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus&#xD;
                  or cardiac disease which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make&#xD;
                  this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective&#xD;
                       anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are&#xD;

                    -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been&#xD;
                       treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on&#xD;
                       treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
                  cancers or cervical carcinoma in situ. Patients are not considered to have a&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women and men of reproductive potential should agree to use an appropriate method of&#xD;
             birth control throughout their participation in this study and for 5 months (150 days)&#xD;
             after the last dose of study agent due to the teratogenic potential of the therapy&#xD;
             utilized in this trial. Appropriate methods of birth control include abstinence, oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, implantable hormonal contraceptives or double barrier method&#xD;
             (diaphragm plus condom). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  No history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone for CNS disease; patients on a stable&#xD;
