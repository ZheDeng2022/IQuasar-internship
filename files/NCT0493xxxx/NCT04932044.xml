      This research plan to construct an &quot;Early Sleep Facilitation Program&quot;and to explore the&#xD;
      effects of the &quot;early sleep Facilitation program&quot; on the sleep and health of preterm infants&#xD;
      and the sleep, stress, quality of life and attachment of the caregiver for a Long-term&#xD;
      follow-up research.&#xD;

      Background and purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants need to receive intensive care in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to&#xD;
      survive, but the sleep of preterm infants is disturbed by the environment of the intensive&#xD;
      care unit, invasive treatment and care activities. When a preterm infant's sleep is&#xD;
      interrupted, it not only affects his physical growth, behavior and emotional development, but&#xD;
      also affects his recovery from illness and the length of hospital stay, and even affects his&#xD;
      sleep quality and development after returning home. However, medical personnel are busy with&#xD;
      clinical practice, seldom pay attention to the sleep development of preterm infants. In the&#xD;
      past, few studies paid attention to the factors that affect the sleep of preterm infants&#xD;
      after returning home, and few studies also explored the sleep and physical and mental health&#xD;
      of preterm infants and their main caregivers after returning home. Sleep intervention in&#xD;
      preterm infants was mostly a single outcome indicator; besides, past studies lacked objective&#xD;
      sleep instruments and long-term follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above research gaps, this research plan to construct an &quot;early sleep&#xD;
      Facilitation program&quot; and to explore the effects of the &quot;Early Sleep Facilitation Program&quot; on&#xD;
      the sleep and health of preterm infants and the sleep, stress, quality of life and attachment&#xD;
      of the caregiver for a Long-term follow-up research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has six specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore the effect of &quot;Early Sleep Facilitation Program&quot; on the sleep of preterm infants&#xD;
           during hospitalization and after returning home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the effect of &quot;Early Sleep Facilitation Program&quot; on the health of preterm&#xD;
           infants during hospitalization and after returning home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the effect of &quot;Early Sleep Facilitation Program&quot; on the sleep of the caregiver&#xD;
           after preterm infants during hospitalization and after returning home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore the effect of the &quot;Early Sleep Facilitation Program&quot; on the stress of the&#xD;
           caregivers of preterm infants during hospitalization and after returning home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explore the effect of &quot;Early Sleep Facilitation Program&quot; on the quality of life of the&#xD;
           caregivers of preterm infants during hospitalization and after returning home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Explore the effect of &quot;Early Sleep Facilitation Program&quot; on the attachment of the&#xD;
           caregivers of preterm infants during hospitalization and after returning home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will adopt a longitudinal repeated measures design to&#xD;
      examine the &quot; Early Sleep Facilitation Program &quot; on the sleep and health of preterm infants&#xD;
      and the sleep, stress, quality of life and attachment of the caregiver. Preterm infants and&#xD;
      the caregiver were recruited by convenience sampling in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and&#xD;
      Infant Intermediate Care Unit of a medical center in northern Taiwan from July in 2020 to&#xD;
      December in 2022. There are two different intervention modes (intervention group and control&#xD;
      group), the intervention group receives &quot; Early Sleep Facilitation Program &quot; and the control&#xD;
      group receives routine care. The program is divided into two stages. The first stage is to&#xD;
      provide sleep circadian rhythm training for preterm infants during hospitalization, and the&#xD;
      second stage is to give the caregiver the nursing guidance to promote preterm infants' sleep&#xD;
      before preterm infants discharged from the hospital. Moreover, continue to give nursing&#xD;
      guidance and follow its implementation status after the first month and the second month&#xD;
      after discharge. The control group receives routine care and provide general discharge care&#xD;
      and nursing guidance. The questionnaires and physiological measurements will be used to&#xD;
      collect the data. The two groups will collect data during hospitalization, one week before&#xD;
      discharge, and the first month and the second month after discharge. We will use generalized&#xD;
      estimation equations method to analyze research data.&#xD;

    <description>World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) The WHOQOL is a quality of life assessment developed by the WHOQOL Group with fifteen international field centres, simultaneously, in an attempt to develop a quality of life assessment that would be applicable cross-culturally. There are 28 questions in the questionnaire. The content includes four aspects: physical health, psychology, social relations and environment. Each question is based on Likert's five-point. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Caregivers' attachment-T1</measure>
    <time_frame>T1-baseline collect Caregiver of preterm infants after 32 weeks of gestation before intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal Attachment Inventory (MAI) The Maternal Attachment Inventory(MAI) has 26 questions on the scale. The questions use a response level of 1 to 4. The 1 point means almost none, 2 points means occasionally, 3 points means often, and 4 points means almost often.&#xD;
The higher the total score, the closer the maternal-infant attachment.</description>

    <description>It is divided into two stages. The first stage is to provide sleep circadian rhythm training for preterm infants during hospitalization, and the second stage is to give the caregiver the nursing guidance to promote preterm infants' sleep before preterm infants discharged from the hospital. Moreover, continue to give nursing guidance and follow its implementation status within two months after discharge.</description>
