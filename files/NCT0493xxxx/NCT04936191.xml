      The novolimus-eluting DynamX bioadaptor system is composed of 71 µm cobalt-chromium&#xD;
      sinusoidal rings connected to each other axially by three S-links Each ring contains three&#xD;
      uncaging elements that are positioned at equal distance in low stress regions of struts&#xD;
      oriented in a helical configuration along the length of the bioadaptor which remain intact&#xD;
      after uncaging. The uncaging elements consist of three separable junctions per ring held&#xD;
      together by a 6 µm polymer coating that is resorbed over six months, allowing uncaging of the&#xD;
      vessel and adaptive remodeling. Previous study showed the DynamX biodaptor is safe and&#xD;
      effective treating in de novo coronary lesion. It also increased of vessel and device area&#xD;
      while maintain in the mean lumen area after one year follow-up. However, the unchanging&#xD;
      effect of Dynamx bioadaptor on coronary geometry change remained unknown. The present&#xD;
      randomized control study is designed to investigate the differences of dynamic coronary&#xD;
      artery geometry changes evaluated by coronary computed tomography angiography after DynamX&#xD;
      Bioadaptor and permanent metallic DES implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease and the leading cause&#xD;
      of death worldwide. Percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft are&#xD;
      the guideline suggested treatment. Drug-eluting stents (DES) is the guideline suggested&#xD;
      treatment options. Percutaneous coronary intervention with DES provides not just acute&#xD;
      luminal gains, but also good long-term patency and clinical outcomes. However, in-stent&#xD;
      neoatherosclerosis, very late stent thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction remained&#xD;
      important long-term issues. In addition, metallic stent encages the vessel segment, limits&#xD;
      its remodeling and vasomotor function. The original vessel geometry, curvature, tortuosity,&#xD;
      and wall shear stress, which are associated with plaque formation are also changed&#xD;
      permanently by stent implantation. Although bioresorbable scaffolds attempted to address&#xD;
      these issues by providing structural support to the vessel early on, followed by resorption,&#xD;
      randomized trials showed that, prior to their resorption, they were less safe and effective&#xD;
      than contemporary DES. Since that, the novel DES, DynamX Bioadaptor, is designed to improve&#xD;
      these limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel DES, DynamX Bioadaptor, is designed to restore normal pulsatility and adaptive&#xD;
      remodeling in blood vessels after stent implantation. It is a cobalt-chromium stent with a&#xD;
      biodegradable polymer coating that releases novolimus. Segments of the stent are held&#xD;
      together by the polymer coating, which is designed to be fully absorbed in 6 months. After&#xD;
      degradation of polymer, the stent struts unlink and uncage the stented segment. Pilot study&#xD;
      demonstrated vessel uncaging and restoration of cyclic pulsatility 12 months after DynamX&#xD;
      Bioadaptor implantation. Adaptive remodeling 12 months after DynamX Bioadaptor implantation&#xD;
      will restore flexibility and natural geometry of the stented vessel segment. Thus, the&#xD;
      dynamic beat-to-beat (cardiac cycle) changes of curvature and tortuosity will be more&#xD;
      pronounced in the DynamX Bioadaptor group compared with that in the permanent metallic Elixir&#xD;
      DESyne DES group. The DynamX Bioadaptor can potentially restore the vessel geometry and&#xD;
      improve outcomes. The present randomized control study is designed to investigate the&#xD;
      differences of dynamic coronary artery geometry changes after DynamX Bioadaptor and permanent&#xD;
      metallic DES implantation, using coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as an&#xD;
      evaluation tool.&#xD;

    <description>Patients received percutaneous coronary intervention in a similar way to a traditional DES. Patients first receive radial artery or femoral artery cannulation with anticoagulation during the intervention. All coronary angiograms are carefully measured by at least 2 orthographic views and performed under the same standard conditions. After adequate predilatation of the target lesion, the coronary stenting will be performed. All patients will receive a loading dose of acetylsalicylic acid and a P2Y12 inhibitor pre-procedure followed by dual antiplatelet therapy for at least 6 months.</description>
