      The purpose of this study is to determine if INCORPorATe IP3 is feasible prior to a larger&#xD;
      trial focused on determining efficacy. Feasibility will be measured using the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework4: Reach or Participation (Primary Outcome): (a) percent of eligible participants&#xD;
      who are successfully recruited and attend at least one group session; Effectiveness:&#xD;
      retention rate in the intervention; Implementation: fidelity to the intervention protocol;&#xD;
      Maintenance: intervention sustainability based on continued engagement from the participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-Hispanic black (NHB) women are 49% more likely to experience a preterm birth (PTB),&#xD;
      delivery before 37 weeks. PTB is associated with increased risk of poor short and long-term&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes. PTB can occur in multiple clinical scenarios including spontaneous PTB&#xD;
      (e.g. preterm labor, preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes) and medically induced preterm&#xD;
      labor (e.g. preeclampsia). Women with a history of PTB are at 1.5 - 2 fold increased risk for&#xD;
      future PTB. There are medical therapies than can reduce the risk of recurrent PTB specific to&#xD;
      the presumed etiology of the prior PTB. Thus, women with a history of a prior PTB who receive&#xD;
      care with Duke Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) receive and Individualized Prematurity&#xD;
      Prevention Plan (IP3) to reduce their risk of recurrent PTB. The IP3 plans are often labor&#xD;
      intensive with requirements ranging from daily medications, weekly clinic visits, painful&#xD;
      injections or invasive ultrasounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increased rate so of PTB among NHB women and some suggestion of decreased adherence&#xD;
      in this population1, we previously conducted qualitative studies with NHB women to uncover&#xD;
      patient perceived barriers to IP3 adherence2,3. These studies revealed that NHB women with&#xD;
      prior preterm birth felt that stress and lack of support were key barriers to preterm birth&#xD;
      prevention adherence. Stress and limited support made women feel isolated from their peers&#xD;
      and community. Based on these data we worked with a stakeholder group to develop a&#xD;
      patient-centered, community-involved intervention that will increased adherence to an&#xD;
      individualized prematurity prevention plan using community-level social supports. The&#xD;
      resulting invention titled, EngagINg the COmmunity to Reduce Preterm Birth via Adherence To&#xD;
      an Individualized Prematurity Prevention Plan (INCORPorATe IP3) includes community doula led&#xD;
      group social support.&#xD;
