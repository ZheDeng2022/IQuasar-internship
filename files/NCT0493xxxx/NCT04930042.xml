      Safety and Efficacy study of AVT04 (Alvotech Biosimilar to Ustekinumab), in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AVT04 is a fully human immunoglobulin class G1κ monoclonal antibody that specifically binds&#xD;
      to the shared p40 protein subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 and therefore inhibits their activites&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVT04 is being developed to be a biosimilar with the European Union (EU)-licensed drug&#xD;
      Stelara® (hereafter referred to as Stelara) ustekinumab, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical&#xD;
      code: L04AC05) injection for subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous use. Stelara is an anti-IL-12&#xD;
      and anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody approved for various indications. Indications approved in&#xD;
      the EU11 and United States (US)12 include: PsO in adult and pediatric patients, psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Indications approved in the People's&#xD;
      Republic of China include PsO and Crohn's disease.13 Approval status may differ in other&#xD;
      geographic regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active control clinical study to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of AVT04 versus Stelara in patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe chronic PsO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active period of Study AVT04-GL-301 comprises 2 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1: Primary Efficacy Assessment (Day 1 to Week 15)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2: Long Term Efficacy and Safety Assessment (Week 16 to 52) Stage 1 On Day 1,&#xD;
           after successfully completing Screening activities, eligible patients will be randomized&#xD;
           into Groups 1 and 2, in a 1:2 ratio (AVT04:Stelara), and begin Stage 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient randomization will be stratified by presence or absence of previous biologic&#xD;
      treatment, by region; ie, Europe or China, and by body weight category (≤80 kg vs &gt;80 kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Patients will receive an initial dose of AVT04 45 mg administered SC, followed&#xD;
           by 45 mg 4 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Patients will receive an initial loading dose of Stelara, 45 mg administered&#xD;
           SC, followed by 45 mg 4 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 16:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were initially randomized in Group 1 (AVT04) will continue to receive AVT04 45&#xD;
      mg SC every 12 weeks at Weeks 16, 28, and 40 (unless withdrawn from the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were initially randomized in Group 2 (Stelara) will be re-randomized into Groups&#xD;
      2A and 2B, in a 1:1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2A: Patients will begin receiving AVT04 45 mg SC every 12 weeks, at Weeks 16, 28,&#xD;
           and 40 (unless withdrawn from the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2B: Patients will continue to receive Stelara 45 mg SC every 12 weeks, at Weeks&#xD;
           16, 28, and 40 (unless withdrawn from the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 28:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-responsive patients (PASI improvement &lt;50% compared to BL) will be encouraged to&#xD;
           continue in the study for safety analyses, per the Schedule of Assessments (SoA) (Table&#xD;
           7.1), but will not receive further study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Responsive patients (PASI improvement ≥50% compared to BL) will continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 40: All patients who are still in the study (except Week 28 non-responsive patients)&#xD;
      will receive the final study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 52 (EoS/ET): All patients will undergo final efficacy and safety assessment.&#xD;
