    <textblock>
      Studies of appetitive behavior in humans after RYGB have produced ambiguous results. It&#xD;
      therefore remains unclear whether there are fundamental shifts in the palatability of&#xD;
      high-fat and sugary foods after RYGB or simply a decrease in the appetitive drive to ingest&#xD;
      them. Moreover, learning processes may play a role as changes in diet selection progress with&#xD;
      time in rats after RYGB. However, direct measures of an altered food selection in humans&#xD;
      after RYGB are rare and both the durability of the phenomenon as well as the role of&#xD;
      experience for changes in food selection remain elusive.&#xD;

      Introduction Bariatric surgery (BS) is currently the most effective treatment of severe&#xD;
      obesity. BS has a pleiotropic effect on the body, involving changes in basic metabolic rate,&#xD;
      gut hormones and bile acid levels, intestinal nerve signaling and microbiota composition.&#xD;
      Overall, patients report to eat less, to feel less hungry and they often change their food&#xD;
      preferences. Initial insights on food intake and appetite can be provided by indirect&#xD;
      measurements such as verbal report of energy intake, food diaries, and dietary recall&#xD;
      questionnaires. However, indirect measurements are vulnerable to inaccuracy and, at best,&#xD;
      only offer an estimate of the patients' real behavior. Such methodological limitations can be&#xD;
      improved by complementing existing findings with direct measurements of eating and drinking.&#xD;
      There are only very few studies to date that have applied direct measurements of ingestive&#xD;
      behavior in BS patients. These studies focused mainly on macronutrient composition within a&#xD;
      cafeteria diet and on some motivational aspects of appetitive behavior. This might be due to&#xD;
      the fact that the assessment of the temporal organization of ingestive behavior within a meal&#xD;
      in humans poses significant methodological and conceptual challenges to researchers and study&#xD;
      design. The investigators have recently developed and validated a drinkometer for humans,&#xD;
      which may have great utility in the investigation of the specific behavioral variables that&#xD;
      underlie the altered appetite control in obesity, and also to specify neural effects of&#xD;
      various medical or surgical weight-loss interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this exploratory pilot study is to investigate a possible correlation between the&#xD;
      microstructure of ingestive behavior and body weight loss in patients after Roux-en-Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass with a follow-up of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Prospective observational study in patients that already received a RYGB. 50 patients&#xD;
      will be recruited to consume a ready-to-drink, energy-dense oral nutritional supplement&#xD;
      (product: Resource 2.0+fibre, Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland) in a food deprived state, until&#xD;
      reaching satiety. The novel drinkometer will be used to measure ingestive microstructure and&#xD;
      overall intake, and anthropometric parameters (weight, height) will be measured as well.&#xD;
      Visual analogue scales will be used to assess self-reported hunger, thirst, fullness, liking,&#xD;
      nausea, and pain. The participants will be asked to estimate their intake at the end of each&#xD;
      session. The study visits will take place at each postoperative yearly control visit. Only&#xD;
      for one subgroup of 30 patients, one year after surgery, one second study visit will be&#xD;
      organised after an interval of two weeks from the first visit. In order to avoid sex-driven&#xD;
      major differences in ingestive microstructure, only female participants will be included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The drinkometer data will be processed and filtered by an in-house&#xD;
      developed algorithm in Matlab 2017 software. Results will be analysed using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and statistical tests in RStudio software version 3.5.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential outcomes Any comprehensive understanding of how BS affects food intake requires a&#xD;
      detailed analysis of the ingestive behavior itself, not simply the measurement of the outcome&#xD;
      of the behavior. In other words, the information on how the food is consumed is equally or&#xD;
      even more important than the information on how much food has been ingested. To the best of&#xD;
      our knowledge, this is the first time that drinking microstructure in humans will be recorded&#xD;
      and analyzed with a five-year follow-up in BS patients. Results will confirm if, in the long&#xD;
      term, the microstructure of ingestive behavior might have a correlation with body weight loss&#xD;
      or regain and hence be used as a predictor of surgery outcome. Further, this exploratory&#xD;
      study may generate hypothesis on behavioral changes that occur following BS. Any treatment&#xD;
      that affects total intake - e.g. BS - can be entirely viewed as function of its single&#xD;
      components such as size and number of sucking bursts which then can provide relevant&#xD;
      information e.g. on the motivational aspects of the ingestive behavior. The investigators&#xD;
      expect to find at least two type of ingestive behaviours among study participants, one that&#xD;
      would correlated with sustained body weight loss and one that would correlate with body&#xD;
      weight regain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of which outcomes are obtained, this innovative experiment will be a critical and&#xD;
      a novel test of the explicit experience of humans with a high-sugar high-fat liquid meal&#xD;
      after RYGB and its potential role for the understanding possible mechanisms determining&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes, such as weight loss.&#xD;
