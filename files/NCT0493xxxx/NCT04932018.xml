    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 6- month study is to determine the feasibility of a start-up incubator&#xD;
      intervention designed to decrease occupational stress and depression for beginning Kentucky&#xD;
      farmers. The objectives are to: #1) test the feasibility of a mentorship and start-up&#xD;
      incubator intervention on depression in beginning Kentucky farmers using questionnaires&#xD;
      administered prestudy, mid-study, and post-study; #2) explore associations between&#xD;
      mentorship, occupational stress and depression in beginning Kentucky farmers using specific&#xD;
      survey questionnaires to guide future research. This study's results will provide valuable&#xD;
      data to agriculture and occupational health researchers. The data will illustrate the impact&#xD;
      of mentorship and community support on improving depression and occupational stress of&#xD;
      beginning Kentucky farmers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A suicide rate in farmers which is higher than the general population (rate 17.3/100,000)&#xD;
      should remind occupational health professionals that the important work of agriculture is&#xD;
      creating an emotional burden resulting in preventable death. Given the high incidence of&#xD;
      suicide in the farming population, it is imperative that we explore the agrarian culture to&#xD;
      guide the development of interventions to reduce occupational stress and depression in&#xD;
      beginning Kentucky farmers. The isolating nature of rural farming, a leading risk factor for&#xD;
      depression, creates an urgency to develop interventions to protect our Kentucky farmers from&#xD;
      occupational stress and depression, which are leading risk factors for suicide. Interventions&#xD;
      developed to reduce occupational stress and depression are an essential strategy to improve&#xD;
      mental health before the devastating outcome of suicide. To address a gap in the management&#xD;
      of occupational stress and depression in beginning farmers in Kentucky, novel interventions&#xD;
      must address the unique agrarian culture, rural isolation, peer influence and social stigma&#xD;
      of depression. Interventions must be available at little to no expense and without extensive&#xD;
      time commitment; must be accessible in rural areas and provide mentorship and community&#xD;
      support. The concept of a start-up incubator for beginning farmers is one type of&#xD;
      intervention that combines the accessibility of a virtual program with mentorship by farming&#xD;
      experts, peer and community support, with a mental health curriculum provided by occupational&#xD;
      health nurses is our proposed intervention to address occupational stress and depression in&#xD;
      the beginning Kentucky farmer. The curriculums of several existing programs related to&#xD;
      occupational stress and depression guide the development of this incubator intervention.&#xD;
      Incubator curriculums are designed to address failures and mitigate conditions to support&#xD;
      future success. Rural Resilience, Farm Aid, and Farm Stress are training programs that&#xD;
      address stress, depression, and suicide in farmers, these programs use components of an&#xD;
      incubator model to fit the constructs of agrarian business and culture. The start-up&#xD;
      incubator model in this proposal utilizes mentorship and community support to form a&#xD;
      strategic alliance between mentors and beginner farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mentorship and community support are social capital that can be utilized through networking&#xD;
      opportunities which may eliminate the structural barriers identified by beginning farmers.&#xD;
      The impact of mentorship and community support in the context of healthcare, business, and&#xD;
      farming has consistently been supported in research. Uncomfortable topics of occupational&#xD;
      stressors and depression have only recently been included in initiatives to help farmers,&#xD;
      however available mentorship programs in Kentucky are currently focused on farm management&#xD;
      knowledge deficits. Results from this proposed study have the potential to guide future&#xD;
      research related to the effectiveness for occupational stress, depression and suicide&#xD;
      reduction in beginning Kentucky farmers. This proposal will address a major mental health&#xD;
      objective of Healthy People 2020: Reducing the rising national suicide rate, specifically by&#xD;
      addressing the vulnerable population of farmworkers considered to be at high risk&#xD;
      (https://www.healthypeople.gov/node/4804/data_details). The The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of a start-up incubator intervention designed to decrease&#xD;
      occupational stress and depression for beginning Kentucky farmers. The central hypothesis is:&#xD;
      A start-up incubator intervention will be feasible and acceptable to the beginning farmer&#xD;
      population. Specific Aim #1: To test the feasibility of a start-up incubator intervention on&#xD;
      occupational stress and depression in beginning Kentucky farmers. Hypothesis #1: Compared to&#xD;
      an attention control group, individuals assigned to the incubator intervention (6 month&#xD;
      curriculum) group will have a lower incidence of occupational stress and depression at three&#xD;
      and six months from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To explore associations between mentorship, occupational stress and&#xD;
      depression in beginning Kentucky farmers to guide future research. Hypothesis #2:&#xD;
      Associations exist between mentorship, occupational stress and depression that will guide&#xD;
      future research focused on prioritizing efforts to advance farmer health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. The design is that of a two-group intervention study. Subjects (N=48) will be&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 2 groups (intervention group or attention control group based on county of&#xD;
      residence; randomization will occur at the county level). Subjects will be recruited from&#xD;
      eight central Kentucky counties: Washington, Anderson, Franklin, Henry, Scott, Harrison,&#xD;
      Woodford and Owen. The intervention group will participate in a round table educational&#xD;
      session with a study facilitator/mentor farmer and occupational health nurse plus receive an&#xD;
      invitation to participate in an interactive virtual community providing ongoing resources and&#xD;
      support from community farmers and agriculture experts. The second group (attention control)&#xD;
      will receive an invitation to participate in the virtual community without mentor&#xD;
      interaction. Data collection for both groups will occur at baseline, 3 months, and 6-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample and Setting. Subjects will be referred by county extension agents located in&#xD;
      Washington, Anderson, Franklin, Henry, Scott, Harrison, Woodford and Owen counties in&#xD;
      Kentucky that have contact with &quot;beginning farmers&quot;, as defined by the United States&#xD;
      Department of Agriculture (USDA). Subjects will be contacted via email or personal contact by&#xD;
      County Extension agents, or via CCTS recruitment services, potential interested parties will&#xD;
      be given the PI's email, name and phone to contact for pre-screening of eligibility into the&#xD;
      study. A total of 48 subjects meeting inclusion criteria will be assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups. Based on USDA estimates of beginning farmer characteristics, the planned enrollment&#xD;
      in this study is 60% men, 95% Caucasian, and 5% Black or African American (demographic survey&#xD;
      will include a question regarding Hispanic ethnicity).&#xD;
