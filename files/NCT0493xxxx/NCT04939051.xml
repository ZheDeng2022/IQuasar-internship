    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of obeticholic acid in treating patients with&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus. Bile acids present in duodenogastroesophageal reflux contribute to&#xD;
      neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus. Obeticholic acid, may help increase bile flow&#xD;
      from the liver while suppressing bile acid production, therefore reducing the exposure of the&#xD;
      liver to toxic levels of bile acids which is potentially linked to cancer development.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the mean change from baseline in the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein&#xD;
      coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) + cells in the crypts of esophageal tissue among patients with&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) receiving 25 mg of obeticholic acid (OCA), once daily from 0 to 180&#xD;
      days as compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of OCA on FXR expression in Barrett's tissue. II. To determine OCA&#xD;
      concentrations and concentrations of the two major active metabolites, taurine, and glycine&#xD;
      conjugates, in plasma after dosing with OCA 25 mg to determine the concentrations reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the effects of treatment with OCA versus placebo on total and individual bile&#xD;
      acid composition in Barrett's tissue, gastric aspirate, and serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the effects of treatment with OCA versus placebo on serum levels of C4, a key&#xD;
      precursor in bile acid synthesis, and FGF-19, a fibroblast growth factor which downregulates&#xD;
      bile acid synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the effects of treatment with OCA versus placebo on biomarkers of the&#xD;
      carcinogenic process - proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3), and oxidative&#xD;
      damage (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine) as determined from Barrett's mucosal biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the effects of treatment with OCA versus placebo on histologic changes in&#xD;
      Barrett's samples pre and post-intervention for development/ resolution of dysplasia VII. To&#xD;
      assess the effects of treatment with OCA versus placebo on markers of differentiation-&#xD;
      CDX2/SOX2/p53 expression in Barrett's tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To assess the safety profile of treatment with OCA versus placebo which includes&#xD;
      incidence and severity of pruritus and changes in serum total cholesterol, low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and&#xD;
      triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive OCA orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed at 30 weeks.&#xD;

             pain, fever, and leukocytosis associated with gallbladder inflammation diagnosed&#xD;
             within the prior 6 weeks) or biliary obstruction (defined by extrahepatic cholestasis)&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the limited available human data&#xD;
             on the use of OCA during pregnancy are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated&#xD;
             risk. There is no information on the presence of OCA in human milk, the effects on the&#xD;
             breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             OCA, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with OCA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bile acid binding resins such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevelam (may&#xD;
                  reduce the absorption, systemic exposure, and efficacy of OCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Warfarin (INR decreases following coadministration of warfarin and OCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CYP1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic index (clozapine, theophylline and&#xD;
