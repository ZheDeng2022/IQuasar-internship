  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using avatrombopag in patients with&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia due to temozolomide treatment can safely improve a patient's platelet count&#xD;
      and allow the patient to complete the temozolomide treatment course as planned.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine if using avatrombopag in patients with low platelet&#xD;
      count due to temozolomide treatment is safe, while at the same time assess whether the&#xD;
      avatrombopag can improve the low platelet count and allow the temozolomide treatment to&#xD;
      continue as planned.&#xD;
