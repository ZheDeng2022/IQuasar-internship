      The purpose of this study is to test an experimental device, the Adherus AutoSpray and&#xD;
      Adherus AutoSpray ET Dural Sealant, in spinal surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to compare Adherus AutoSpray and Adherus AutoSpray ET Dural Sealant&#xD;
      to DuraSeal Exact Spinal Sealant, which has already received Federal Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) approval in spinal procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind, multicenter, pivotal trial that&#xD;
      will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Adherus Dural Sealant when used in conjunction&#xD;
      with standard methods of dural repair in spinal procedures. This trial uses the commercially&#xD;
      available DuraSeal Exact as an active control. The trial is designed to demonstrate&#xD;
      non-inferiority of Adherus Dural Sealant to DuraSeal Exact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are undergoing spinal surgery, consent to participate in this trial and&#xD;
      experience a durotomy will be considered for study enrollment. Following a two-tiered&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion consideration, subjects will be randomized intraoperatively using a 1:1&#xD;
      randomization ratio. Up to 256 subjects will be randomized to treatment with either Adherus&#xD;
      Dural Sealant or DuraSeal Exact with at least 50% of subjects undergoing procedures at lumbar&#xD;
      or lumbosacral levels. Up to 30 investigational sites within the United States will&#xD;
      participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A primary composite endpoint evaluating safety and effectiveness will be measured within a&#xD;
      90-day required follow-up period post-procedure. Subjects will be followed at discharge or&#xD;
      between postoperative days (POD) 1-4 from the index procedure (whichever occurs first) and at&#xD;
      30 days and 90 days post-index procedure.&#xD;
