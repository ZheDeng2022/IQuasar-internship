    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial investigates the side effects and best dose of alvocidib when given&#xD;
      together with decitabine and venetoclax and to see how well it works in treating patients&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (relapsed), has not responded to previous&#xD;
      treatment (refractory), or as frontline treatment for patients unable to receive other&#xD;
      therapies (unfit). Alvocidib, decitabine, and venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of alvocidib hydrochloride (alvocidib) in combination with&#xD;
      decitabine and venetoclax in relapsed or refractory patients with acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) or as frontline therapy in unfit/frail patients with AML. (Phase I) II. To determine&#xD;
      the efficacy alvocidib in combination with decitabine and venetoclax in relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or as frontline therapy in unfit/frail&#xD;
      patients with AML. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the preliminary assessment of efficacy by response to revised International&#xD;
      Working Group (IWG) criteria and time to response variables, including overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR) of patients treated with this&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment with this combination and&#xD;
      its impact in long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of the level of pre-treatment expression of BCL-2 and MCL-1 (by&#xD;
      BH3 profiling) with response to this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the effect of this treatment combination on responding patients&#xD;
      transitioning to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of alvocidib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10, alvocidib&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, 1-5, 1-7, 1-10, or 1-14, and venetoclax orally (PO)&#xD;
      once daily (QD) on days 1-14 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5, alvocidib&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, 1-5, 1-7, 1-10 or 1-14, and venetoclax PO QD on&#xD;
      days 1-10. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.&#xD;
