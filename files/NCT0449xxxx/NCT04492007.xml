      This is a proof-of-concept pilot randomized clinical trial to test the feasibility of the&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this proof-of-concept study, our multidisciplinary team will conduct a pilot randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to test the feasibility of the innovative Patient-Reported Outcomes-Informed&#xD;
      Symptom Management System (PRISMS) to enhance personalized supportive care for cancer&#xD;
      patients and caregivers during post-treatment care transition. We will randomly assign 21&#xD;
      cancer patients with newly created ostomies for cancer treatment with curative intent and&#xD;
      their primary caregivers to the PRISMS or usual care groups (21 patient-caregiver dyads, a&#xD;
      total of 42 individuals). PRISMS is defined as a personalized psychoeducational website&#xD;
      including monitoring and personal feedback. We will conduct pre- and post-assessments of QOL&#xD;
      and PRO (symptoms) at baseline upon enrollment and 2 months later.&#xD;

    <description>Perceived ease of use of the PRISMS program will be assessed by the 23-item Usability Scale measuring the ease of use in three aspects: general, content, and navigation.

    <time_frame>T1 (baseline survey) and T2 (2-month followup survey)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life (QoL) will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General Scale (FACT-G) v.4, a 27-item measure yielding total score and scores for physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being of demonstrated reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change. FACT-G consists of 4 subscales: physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and social well-being (SWB). Scores on the four subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 108 with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Change in the FACT-G scores from T1 (baseline survey) to T2 (2-month followup survey) will be calculated.</description>
