  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how older adults might benefit from sessions that&#xD;
      teach behavioral coping skills for increasing physical activity and reducing interference&#xD;
      from arthritis pain. This study will randomize individuals to receive Engage-PA, or continue&#xD;
      to receive treatment as usual. Engage-PA involves two sessions (about 45 minutes each) with a&#xD;
      study therapist that teaches individuals behavioral skills for increasing daily steps. These&#xD;
      behavioral skills include identifying their personal values and instructions on how to pace&#xD;
      their daily physical activity to avoid creating severe pain when walking. All participants in&#xD;
      the study will wear small devices that track physical activity such as daily steps throughout&#xD;
      the study, which also allow participants to see their daily step counts and overall level of&#xD;
      activity. All participants will answer a set of questions about how much arthritis gets the&#xD;
      way of many important life activities, their success at living in line with their personal&#xD;
      values, and how much thoughts, feelings and body sensations get in the way of living a&#xD;
      satisfying life. These questions will be asked at the beginning of the study, 6 weeks into&#xD;
      the study, and at 10 weeks into the study.&#xD;
