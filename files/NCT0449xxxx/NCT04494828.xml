  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is one of the most common serious complications after major surgery&#xD;
      and is associated with undesirable consequences. Prevention of postoperative delirium is&#xD;
      recommended in the clinical guidelines and consensus statements. Dexmedetomidine, a highly&#xD;
      selective α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has been investigated as a pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention to prevent postoperative delirium. Several randomized controlled trials have&#xD;
      shown that prophylactic use of low-dose dexmedetomidine may decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium in patients after cardiac and non-cardiac operations. However,&#xD;
      neurosurgical patients are often excluded from previous studies due to potential&#xD;
      consciousness and cognition impairment. The investigators design this pilot study aiming to&#xD;
      clarify the feasibility and safety of use of low-dose dexmedetomidine for prevention of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium in patients after intracranial operation for brain tumor.&#xD;
