      To investigate and compare the burden of dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome dry eye vs&#xD;
      non-Sjögren's syndrome dry eye, as well as investigate the diagnostic potential of tear film&#xD;
      mucins and various inflammatory cytokines evaluated by tear fluid analysis and impression&#xD;
      cytology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a prevalent ocular disorder worldwide and recognized as one of the most frequent&#xD;
      reasons for seeking eye care. Whether locally or systemically initiated, inflammation plays a&#xD;
      key role in the pathogenesis of dry eye. Approximately half of the patients with clinically&#xD;
      significant dry eye have an underlying systemic inflammatory or autoimmune disease. One&#xD;
      serious disease that causes significant dry eye is Sjögren's syndrome (SS). SS is an&#xD;
      autoimmune disorder characterized by immune-mediated destruction of the salivary and lacrimal&#xD;
      glands, with subsequent development of sicca symptoms. It is one of the most common&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases in adults, affecting 1% to 4% of the general population. Approximately&#xD;
      10% of patients with clinically significant dry eye have underlying SS. Currently, the&#xD;
      diagnosis of SS among dry eye patients is delayed by about a decade, largely due to lack of&#xD;
      awareness and also diversity of patient symptoms and signs, adding to the complexity of&#xD;
      diagnosis. Importantly, patients with SS are at risk for many ocular and systemic&#xD;
      complications including central nervous system and visceral organ involvement as well as&#xD;
      lymphoma. In fact, SS is the autoimmune disease most frequently associated with lymphoma.&#xD;
      Therefore, identifying the subset of dry eye patients with SS is relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of SS remains challenging mainly due to the lack of definitive diagnostic tests.&#xD;
      The presence of aqueous-deficient dry eye is an integral part of diagnostic criteria for SS.&#xD;
      Arguably, the hallmark of SS-related dry eye is conjunctival vital dye staining related to&#xD;
      loss or alteration of the ocular surface mucins. A healthy conjunctiva is essential for&#xD;
      ocular surface health as conjunctival goblet cells are responsible for secretion of the large&#xD;
      gel-forming mucin MUC5AC which plays an important role in maintenance of the tear film on the&#xD;
      ocular surface. Reduction of MUC5AC levels in tears of patients with SS has been demonstrated&#xD;
      in a single previous study. The investigators also found lower levels of tear MUC5AC, and&#xD;
      higher levels of IL-6 an IL-8 in patients with SS-dry eye in comparison to non-SS dry eye and&#xD;
      controls. In addition, the investigators found the conjunctival lissamine green staining has&#xD;
      a role in differentiating SS versus non-SS dry eye, independently of the dry eye severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, increased levels of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-13, IL-21, and&#xD;
      interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in tears and conjunctiva have previously been shown to correlate&#xD;
      with goblet cell loss in SS as well as non-SS-dry eye patients. In murine studies, IFN-γ and&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were reported to inhibit MUC5AC secretion in goblet cells&#xD;
      stimulated with a cholinergic agonist. Such inhibition correlated with the expression of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines in the conjunctiva of a mouse model of SS and significantly reduced&#xD;
      tear MUC5AC levels. Nevertheless, targeting tear and ocular surface mucins and the&#xD;
      relationships to various cytokines in dry eye as a diagnostic or therapeutic area has yet to&#xD;
      be extensively studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is well known that patients with SS-related dry eye have much more&#xD;
      significant visual complaints than ocular discomfort symptoms arguably due to high corneal&#xD;
      punctate erosion scores and diminished corneal subbasal nerve plexus when compared with&#xD;
      non-SS dry eye patients. Although the exact mechanism of this is not known, cytokine levels&#xD;
      in the tear film might possibly be a contributing factor. Indeed, the worsening of the&#xD;
      corneal staining after prolonged gazing, could possibly be attributable to lack of tear film&#xD;
      mucin as the investigators demonstrated the correlation between the conjunctival lissamine&#xD;
      green staining (a surrogate for goblet cell density which secrete the mucin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, although the advent of targeted biological treatments and other factors has led to&#xD;
      renewed interest in Sjögren's among rheumatologists and immunologists, its ocular&#xD;
      manifestations and burden remain underappreciated. As an example, the most widely used&#xD;
      Sjögren's disease activity tool, the EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index&#xD;
      (ESSDAI), does not include the extraglandular ocular manifestations of Sjögren's, such as&#xD;
      corneal melt/perforation, uveitis, scleritis, retinal vasculitis, and optic neuritis. In&#xD;
      addition, the EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) only includes one item&#xD;
      that addresses the severity of dryness, but this refers to overall dryness and not&#xD;
      specifically ocular dryness. Most importantly, these tools do not include any visual symptoms&#xD;
      related to dry eye, such as blurred vision and visual or ocular fatigue. The investigators'&#xD;
      most recent study points to a significant toll that the ocular manifestations of Sjögren's&#xD;
      can have on patients emotionally, physically, and financially, in fact much more pronounced&#xD;
      than other manifestation.&#xD;
