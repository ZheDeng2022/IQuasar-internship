      This qualitative study is designed to elicit the perspectives of relevant stakeholders to&#xD;
      adapt a community-based TB/HIV intervention aimed on providing home-based TB prevention&#xD;
      treatment (TPT) initiation for child TB contacts, to design its implementation strategy and,&#xD;
      post intervention, to assess lessons learned for future scale up. Participants will include&#xD;
      policy makers and health system managers, nurse and physician providers, community health&#xD;
      team members, and child caregivers of TB-exposed children. Stakeholders will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in two interviews, one prior to the cluster randomized trial assessing this&#xD;
      intervention and one after the cluster randomized trial. Trained interviewers will conduct&#xD;
      1-hour semi-structured in-depth interviews that will be audio-recorded, translated and&#xD;
      transcribed for thematic analysis using a priori and emergent domains of interest.&#xD;
      Free-listing, ranking exercises and cultural consensus will be used to identify&#xD;
      context-specific intervention adaptations and implementation strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains a top 10 cause of child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
      Short-course combination TB preventive therapy (TPT) regimens are highly effective with high&#xD;
      completion rates and therefore hold promise to reduce the 1 million pediatric TB patients and&#xD;
      233,000 child TB deaths annually. TPT effectiveness requires improvement in access to&#xD;
      pediatric TB preventive care. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates only 23% of the&#xD;
      1.3 million TB-exposed children under 5 years old initiated TPT in 2017. The investigators'&#xD;
      previous data suggest 50-75% of TB-exposed children under 5 years old fail to be either&#xD;
      identified or linked to TB preventive care. Children under 5 years are at exceptionally high&#xD;
      risk of TB disease due to not only immature immune systems, but also HIV infection and HIV&#xD;
      exposure. Guidelines have long recommended TPT for children under 5 years, but have recently&#xD;
      been expanded to children under 15 years. Developing and testing innovative health care&#xD;
      delivery models to accompany new WHO-endorsed short-course combination TPT regimens is&#xD;
      essential to reduce TB-associated global child morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated community case management (iCCM) is a cost-effective intervention that increases&#xD;
      child survival by bringing curative therapies to at risk children in the community. Recently,&#xD;
      algorithms for screening pediatric patients with household exposure to TB have been&#xD;
      simplified to include symptom screening only, eliminating costly laboratory and radiographic&#xD;
      evaluations that are barriers to treatment and do not improve sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      the assessment. The CHIP-TB Trial plans to assess whether integrated community-based&#xD;
      pediatric TB/HIV prevention services is feasible, acceptable and effective in increasing TPT&#xD;
      uptake among child TB contacts under 15 years in a cluster-randomized trial in South Africa&#xD;
      and Ethiopia, two high-burden, resource-limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested within this larger trial, the investigators will use qualitative research to (1)&#xD;
      describe the social context in which the community health teams perform the team's duties,&#xD;
      (2) make context-specific adaptations to the intervention to maximize its effectiveness, (3)&#xD;
      define a context-specific implementation strategy and evaluation plan, and (4) learn&#xD;
      important lessons for the future scale up and dissemination of the community-based&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct 10-15 paired semi-structured individual in-depth interviews&#xD;
      (IDI) for each of the four key stakeholder groups: (1) caregivers of TB-exposed children, (2)&#xD;
      community health team members, (3) clinic-based nurse and clinic or hospital-based physician&#xD;
      providers, and (4) health system managers and policy makers, for a total of ~120 IDIs (~60 in&#xD;
      South Africa and ~60 in Ethiopia) both pre and post trial. Before the intervention the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a one-hour interview that will explore the inner setting of the&#xD;
      community health team's environment from each stakeholder perspective and will develop and&#xD;
      decide upon key intervention adaptations and implementation strategies for the&#xD;
      community-based TB/HIV prevention program that will be assessed with a one-year&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial. Upon trial completion, the investigators will conduct another 10-15&#xD;
      semi-structured IDIs with each stakeholder group in each country (total ~120 IDIs) to&#xD;
      identify key facilitators and barriers to the implementation. Thematic content analysis with&#xD;
      an inductive approach will be used to analyze transcripts for both a priori and emergent&#xD;
      domains of interest. A coding scheme will be adapted from Consolidated Framework for&#xD;
      Implementation Research (CFIR) constructs. Free listing, ranking, and cultural consensus will&#xD;
      be used to identify intervention adaptations and implementation strategies that are context&#xD;
      specific. The investigators will use Smith's Saliency Index to analyze the free listed data,&#xD;
      mean rank order to assess ranking exercises, and the Eigenvalue to evaluate consensus across&#xD;
      groups all using the ANTHROPAC Â® 4.0 software.&#xD;
