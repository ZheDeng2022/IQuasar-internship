    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized prospective open-label single-arm clinical phase I trial&#xD;
      investigating dose finding, feasibility and safety of the combined treatment of HDM201 and&#xD;
      midostaurin in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FLT3mut&#xD;
      applying an accelerated titration design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal hematopoietic malignant disease characterized by&#xD;
      genetic and epigenetic alterations leading to inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53. This&#xD;
      contributes to a block in normal differentiation of the various blood type lineages and to an&#xD;
      accumulation of leukemic blasts in the blood and bone marrow. The disease variants have been&#xD;
      grouped into favorable, intermediate and poor risk categories. The largest group of poor risk&#xD;
      AML is characterized by the genetic alterations of the FLT3 receptor gene termed FLT3-ITD or&#xD;
      FLT3-TKD. The prognosis for this specific subset which comprises 25-35% of all AML patients&#xD;
      is generally poor, particularly in elderly or in relapsed patients, highlighting the unmet&#xD;
      need for novel treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting the mutated FLT3 receptor is a promising approach to treat this specific poor risk&#xD;
      AML subset. Midostaurin is particularly effective to induce cell death in FLT3-ITD/-TKD and&#xD;
      TP53wt cells. Targeting MDM2 is a novel approach to restore the crucial p53 tumor suppressor&#xD;
      function in AML cells. Preliminary data indicate that the MDM2 inhibitor HDM201 is active in&#xD;
      AML cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Like midostaurin HDM201 is specifically effective to&#xD;
      induce cell death in FLT3-ITD and TP53wt cells. The combination of midostaurin and HDM201&#xD;
      targets FLT3-ITD AML cells, with little effect on FLT3 wt cells and healthy blood cells. Both&#xD;
      compounds induce apoptosis and cell death in a dose-dependent manner in FLT3-ITD TP53wt AML&#xD;
      cells, with enhanced effects in the combination treatment. The combination treatment with&#xD;
      midostaurin and HDM201 ought to be superior to the current best available treatment which&#xD;
      utilizes intensive genotoxic induction therapy. In order to confirm inhibition of mutated&#xD;
      FLT3 receptor and restoration of p53 tumor suppressor function, blood samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed in this trial before, during and after treatment with HDM201 and midostaurin for&#xD;
      changes in the expression of FLT3 and p53 target genes as well as induction of pro- apoptotic&#xD;
      genes. These gene expression levels will be correlated with clinical response and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to establish the recommended dose for a subsequent&#xD;
      phase II (RP2D) of HDM201 in combination with midostaurin in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory FLT3mut TP53wt AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine the safety and tolerability of HDM201 in&#xD;
      combination with midostaurin and to assess the preliminary antitumor activity of HDM201 in&#xD;
      combination with midostaurin in patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3mut TP53wt AML and&#xD;
      in newly diagnosed AML with FLT3mut and TP53wt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial study duration encompasses the time from when the first participant signs the&#xD;
      informed consent until the last protocol-specific procedure of the last patient in the trial&#xD;
      has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I trial involves a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 24 subjects. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      Investigator anticipate a duration of recruitment of between 3 and 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for up to 12 months after end of treatment, adding to a&#xD;
      total study duration of between 15 and 33 months depending on the effective number of&#xD;
      patients in the various dose cohorts.&#xD;

             during dosing and for at least 12 months after stopping medication. Highly effective&#xD;
             contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 12 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Midostaurin may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives; therefore,&#xD;
                  females using systemically active hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier&#xD;
                  method of contraception.&#xD;
