  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis [MS] is a prevalent neurological disease that is the leading cause of&#xD;
      irreversible neurological disability among young women and the second leading cause of&#xD;
      disability among young men in the United States. This disease results in the progressive loss&#xD;
      of walking mobility and substantial worsening of cognition, symptoms, and quality of life&#xD;
      over time. There is evidence that physical activity is beneficially associated with aerobic&#xD;
      fitness and brain structure and function in persons with MS. Nevertheless, this population is&#xD;
      strikingly sedentary and physically inactive. This highlights a vital opportunity to improve&#xD;
      aerobic fitness and brain health by developing behavioral interventions that increase&#xD;
      physical activity. To that end, this project is a Phase-II randomized control trial for&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of a behavioral intervention that is based on social-cognitive theory&#xD;
      and delivered through the Internet for increasing physical activity and, secondarily,&#xD;
      improving aerobic fitness and brain structure and function in persons with MS.&#xD;

    <description>The current behavioral intervention consists of two primary components; an Internet website and one-on-one video chats with a behavioral coach. The Internet website involves content delivered through interactive video courses. The interactive video courses are based on elements of social cognitive theory. Each courses consists of an introduction, the primary content, and a take home message. The interactive courses include embedded, supplementary options such as videos on content and worksheets related to the topic. A pedometer is provided for tracking steps, and these steps will be entered into the website so progress can be monitored. The chats support adherence to the intervention, discussion of website material, supportive accountability, and reporting of adverse events/injuries. The chats are conducted face-to-face through Skype. The chats occur 7 times during the first 2 months, 4 times during the second 2 months, and twice during the final 2 months of the intervention.</description>

    <description>Provides an Internet website and one-on-one video chats that discuss materials about self-managing multiple sclerosis (MS) consequences and health indicators through methods other than physical activity. The materials are transformations of brochures provided by the National MS Society, including Gait or Walking Problems: The Basic Facts; MS and Your Emotions; Pain: The Basic Facts; Solving Cognitive Problems; Taming Stress in MS; Food for Thought: MS and Nutrition; and Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbs: An Introduction. The delivery of the Internet materials and chat sessions will occur on the same time schedule and frequency as the intervention condition, and will have a comparable time commitment. The control condition will not involve tracking steps and a pedometer with not be provided.</description>
