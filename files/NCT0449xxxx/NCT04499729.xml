  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of the proposed project is to conduct a pragmatic, quality improvement&#xD;
      evaluation of the IntelliCare Platform for improving processes of care in the Rush&#xD;
      Collaborative Care program, and improving patient population depression outcomes, to&#xD;
      determine the long-term utility of IntelliCare for Rush.&#xD;

      This study is a pragmatic, system-wide rollout quality improvement evaluation design&#xD;
      displayed in Figure 1. The Rush IRB has waived consent for this quality improvement trial.&#xD;
      Data from the EHR will be used beginning December 1, 2019. The first care manager (CM) will&#xD;
      begin enrolling patients into IntelliCare in September, 2020. Additional CMs will begin using&#xD;
      IntelliCare at approximately 3 month intervals. In September 2021, support for IntelliCare&#xD;
      from the evaluation team will be withdrawn, to examine the sustainability of the IntelliCare&#xD;
      Platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Data from all patients, aged 18 or older, enrolled collaborative care from December&#xD;
      1, 2019 through August 31, 2022 will be used to evaluate the IntelliCare service. All CCT&#xD;
      patients who are 18 or older, and have a smartphone will be offered enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be offered IntelliCare as part of their care in the Rush Collaborative Care service. Patients who agree will download the IntelliCare app, which provides self management and collects symptom self-report data. Symptom severity scores are displayed to the care manager, allowing them to manage the patient's care. The app also provides a secure messaging service for communication between the care manager and the patient.</description>
