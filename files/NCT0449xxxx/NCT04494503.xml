    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and&#xD;
      efficacy of APG-2575 single agent and in combination with other therapeutic agents in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase Ib/II study of safety, PK, PD and efficacy of&#xD;
      APG-2575 as a single agent or in combination with rituximab or ibrutinib in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two parts: The first part is the APG-2575 single agent cohort&#xD;
      expansion. The cohort expansion will be conducted at three dose levels of 400 mg, 600 mg, and&#xD;
      800 mg. And up to 15 patients are planned to be enrolled at each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part contains two arms: APG-2575 combined with rituximab (Arm A) and APG-2575&#xD;
      combined with ibrutinib (Arm B). Both the two arms consist of two stages: dose escalation&#xD;
      stage (first stage) and dose expansion stage (second stage). The first stage is the study of&#xD;
      APG-2575 dose escalation combined with rituximab/ibrutinib. APG-2575 dose escalates according&#xD;
      to the standard 3+3 design, the initial dose is 200mg, the dose of APG-2575 will be increased&#xD;
      in subsequent levels, to 400mg, 600mg, 800mg respectively. The second stage is the MTD/RP2D&#xD;
      expansion stage. Once the respective MTD/RP2D of arms A and B is determined, up to 15&#xD;
      subjects in each MTD/RP2D dose level would be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APG-2575 will be administered orally, once daily for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab, on cycle 1 day 8(C1D8): 375mg/m2; on cycles 2-6 day l(C2-6D1): 500mg/m2, a total&#xD;
      of six infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ibrutinib 420 mg will be orally administered daily beginning from cycle 1 day 8 and&#xD;
      continuously thereafter, every 4 weeks as a cycle.&#xD;
