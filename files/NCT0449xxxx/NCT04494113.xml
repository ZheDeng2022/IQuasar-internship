  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial investigates the response of the anti-cancer drug, triapine, in&#xD;
      uterine cancers by using markers from tissue samples at the time of removal of the uterus,&#xD;
      ovaries, and fallopian tubes (hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Triapine may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Adding&#xD;
      triapine to the usual approach of surgery followed by chemotherapy alone or in combination&#xD;
      with radiation therapy may help to slow the growth of uterine cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether intravenous (IV) triapine 25 mg/m^2 will induce cell cycle arrest as&#xD;
      measured by phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) in uterine serous adenocarcinoma cells removed at the&#xD;
      time of hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether a preoperative dose of intravenous triapine 25 mg/m^2 can be safely&#xD;
      given prior to hysterectomy and staging for uterine serous adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether changes in cyclin D/E and Ki-67 protein expression are detectable using&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry pre- and post-triapine treatment in uterine serous adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate plasma and tissue triapine concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the feasibility of using single-cell transcriptome analysis to quantify changes&#xD;
      in gene expression following triapine treatment and to evaluate their concordance with&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) endpoints of cell cycle arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify genomic variants of uterine serous adenocarcinoma (including but not limited to&#xD;
      p53) with treatment response to ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors such as triapine using&#xD;
      whole exome sequencing (WES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive triapine IV over 2 hours on day 1 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients then undergo surgical resection and tissue collection 6-8 hours after the initiation&#xD;
      of the triapine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 42 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Pharmacodynamic response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-8 hours post-triapine infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacodynamic response rate will be estimated as the proportion of evaluable patients who achieve pharmacodynamic response defined as a decrease in phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) immunoscore of &gt;= 1 from baseline to post-exposure of intravenous triapine for each patient. The corresponding 95% confidence interval will be provided.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), as listed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5, are defined as any pre-surgical grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity or grade 4 neutropenia, neutropenic fever, or thrombocytopenia within 24 hours of triapine administration. Toxicity will be tabulated by type and grade.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 minutes before end of triapine infusion, 6-8 hours post-infusion (at time of surgical tissue resection), and 24 hours post-infusion</time_frame>
    <description>End of infusion plasma concentrations represent maximum concentration (Cmax) and will be compared with historical data. Post-triapine plasma and tissue concentrations will generate plasma to tissue ratios, which represent the tissue partitioning coefficient, a useful PK parameter.</description>
