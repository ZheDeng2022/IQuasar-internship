  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast reconstruction after mastectomy is a highly personal decision. Although it can restore&#xD;
      quality of life for many, there are numerous risks associated with the procedure. The risk of&#xD;
      complications exceeds that of most elective procedures. In past work, a clinical decision&#xD;
      support tool, BREASTChoice, with personalized risk information and patient preferences, was&#xD;
      created to be used to address these issues. It was modified with extensive stakeholder input&#xD;
      and built to be incorporated into electronic health records and patient portals. This&#xD;
      randomized control trial will evaluate whether the implementation of BREASTChoice into&#xD;
      routine care delivery is more effective than a control website, at improving the quality of&#xD;
      reconstruction decisions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the beginning of the Randomized Control Trial (RCT), a pilot phase will be launched&#xD;
      to test the workflow and procedures. The investigators plan to recruit up to 20 patients,&#xD;
      continuing until procedures are smooth and ready for the randomized trial. The investigators&#xD;
      will follow these same procedures as the trial, other than randomization, to test the&#xD;
      workflow and tool use programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the RCT, patients considering mastectomy at academic and community practices (n=340) will&#xD;
      be randomized over 18 months to use BREASTChoice or a control website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient participant consents to be in the study, they will be randomized (using&#xD;
      computer random assignment) participants to view the clinical decision support tool,&#xD;
      BREASTChoice or the attention control website, using block randomization (block size of 2 and&#xD;
      4). Depending on the clinic work-flow, the patients may be sent the link to the tool or&#xD;
      control website: 1) by email or MyChart message, prior to their visit with the plastic or&#xD;
      reconstruction surgeon, for them to complete from home or in the waiting room (ideal and&#xD;
      preferred approach); 2) by email or MyChart, in person or virtually at the time of their&#xD;
      plastic or reconstruction visit, for patients that have same-day breast surgeon and plastic&#xD;
      reconstruction surgeon visits, with time to wait in between appointments; or 3) by email or&#xD;
      MyChart, after the plastic surgery appointment, if they have not yet made a decision about&#xD;
      reconstruction after mastectomy (e.g., if they are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or&#xD;
      they want or need more time to decide on their surgery choices). Participants will be sent&#xD;
      the link via MyChart unless they do not have a MyChart account. In that case, they will be&#xD;
      sent the link via email. Study staff will be available to answer questions about MyChart via&#xD;
      phone or email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BREASTChoice is interactive with multiple modules. It starts with facts about breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. Modules describe pros and cons of reconstruction, reconstruction timing, and&#xD;
      reconstruction types. When discussing reconstruction timing, a risk prediction model pulls&#xD;
      health data from the EHR (asking patients information in the model that is missing) to&#xD;
      personalize risk of complications from immediate breast reconstruction. It also shows average&#xD;
      risks for mastectomy alone and mastectomy plus immediate breast reconstruction so women can&#xD;
      compare their personalized risk to average risks. Each module contains real patient quotes, a&#xD;
      section called &quot;Let's review&quot; which checks patients' understanding, and &quot;What matters to&#xD;
      you&quot;, which elicits patients' preferences. Diverse patient photos and outcomes are provided.&#xD;
      It is written at a 7th grade reading level. Data on patients' risks and a summary of her&#xD;
      preferences are sent to their plastic/reconstructive surgeon to view in the electronic health&#xD;
      record. The tool takes the patient about 20minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Website: The investigators chose an attention control, rather than usual care, to&#xD;
      reduce differences between arms in participant expectation of benefit. Those in the control&#xD;
      arm will get a link to an NCI website about breast reconstruction. That website includes 10&#xD;
      sections with information about types of breast reconstruction, timing, recovery, risks,&#xD;
      cancer surveillance and additional resources. The website provides information, but does not&#xD;
      include values clarification or tailored risk information. It is not interactive and does not&#xD;
      include photos..&#xD;

    <measure>Knowledge as measured by Decision Quality Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>After initial visit but before surgery, estimated to be before day 7</time_frame>
    <description>-The validated Breast Reconstruction Decision Quality Instrument (DQI) knowledge scale contains 9 items on key facts about reconstruction. A knowledge score will be calculated for each patient by dividing the number of correct responses by the number of knowledge items.&#xD;
*For participant arms only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Preference concordance as measured by the Decision Quality Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Preference assessed after initial visit, estimated to be day 7; actual treatment received collected from the EHR</time_frame>
    <description>-The investigators will first estimate the patient's preferred treatment (mastectomy alone versus mastectomy with reconstruction), by inputting her values (entered into BREASTChoice or control survey) into a previously developed statistical model to compute her preferred treatment. The investigators will compare her preferred treatments to actual treatment received, with concordance determined by agreement between preferred and actual treatment received. The investigators will consider &quot;actual treatment received&quot; to be delayed reconstruction, if the patient states an intention to have delayed reconstruction, as she might not have started this process during the study.&#xD;
*For participant arms only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict as measured by the SURE (Sure of myself; Understand information; Risk-benefit ratio; Encouragement) scale for decisional conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>After initial visit but before surgery, estimated to be before day 7</time_frame>
    <description>-The validated, widely-used SURE measure of decisional conflict asks whether patients have enough information to make a choice, enough support to make a choice, and are clear about their values. It is a 4-item measure of yes/no questions (1=yes, 0=no). A score of â‰¤3 indicates decisional conflict.&#xD;
*For participant arms only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare number of high-risk participants from each arm who chose breast reconstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>After patient participation (approximately 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-Participants will be considered high-risk if their risk exceeds two times the population average</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provider intention to engage in shared decision making as measured by the change in the mean CPD (Continuing Professional Development)-Reaction scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed pre- and post-study (approximately 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-CPD Reaction scale is a 12-item measure, each item with a scale of 1-7. Measure change in mean response. Higher change in mean indicates behavior change. Constructs assessed include Intention, Social Influence, Beliefs about capabilities, Moral norm, and beliefs about consequence.&#xD;
**For clinician arm only</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge as measured by knowledge questions developed in previous studies</measure>
    <time_frame>After initial visit but before surgery, estimated before day 7</time_frame>
    <description>-This is an 11-item measure. A knowledge score will be calculated for each patient by dividing the number of correct responses by the number of knowledge items, using the approach described for the DQI</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consult time as measured by time spent with clinician during the visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial visit (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>-Consult time using the BREASTChoice will be compared to consult using the attention control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability as measured by the system usability scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>After initial visit but before surgery, estimated to be before day 7</time_frame>
    <description>-The SUS is a 10-item measure of how easy a website is to use. A usability score is calculated by adding the item and multiplied the sum by 2.5. Scores can range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating greater usability.</description>
