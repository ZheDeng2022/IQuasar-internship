  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the midterm, longterm and acute psychological and physical effects of&#xD;
      an 8-week whole-body-workout using Electromyostimulation (EMS) in healthy individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EMS-whole-body-workouts are less time-consuming and effort-intensive but generate physical&#xD;
      effects which are comparable to conventional strength training. Therefore EMS could lower the&#xD;
      barrier to physical activity. The present study focusses on psychological and physical&#xD;
      effects of an 8-week EMS workout. Physical activity is notably important for mental and&#xD;
      physical health, but is on average far too rarely implemented. Therefore&#xD;
      EMS-whole-body-workouts could provide an opportunity to generate positive psychological and&#xD;
      physical effects through a less (subjective) cost-intense strength training.&#xD;
