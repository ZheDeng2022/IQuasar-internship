  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      Intrarosa®, also known as Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and prasterone. By doing this study,&#xD;
      the investigators hope to learn if Intrarosa® can improve vaginal discomfort. Participants&#xD;
      will be assigned to one of two groups. One group will use Intrarosa® once a day. The other&#xD;
      group will use Replens™ two times a week.&#xD;

      This will be a two-armed, randomized Phase II trial. All study subjects will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out a simple 5-question sexual functioning survey. If any concern about sexual functioning is&#xD;
      noted, the subject will also be asked to fill out a more extensive Sexual functioning tool,&#xD;
      to help determine which domain of sexual functioning is the most bothersome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who complete the initial screening will be randomly assigned to the Intrarosa® or&#xD;
      Replens™ arm by a 1:1 ratio. Subjects randomized to the Intrarosa® arm will use 6.5 mg daily&#xD;
      for 12 weeks (±1 week). Subjects randomized to the Replens™ arm will use a vaginal applicator&#xD;
      two times per week for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and at 12 weeks, subjects will undergo a physical exam including clinical breast&#xD;
      and gynecological exam. During gynecologic exams, the vaginal Potential of Hydrogen (pH) will&#xD;
      be determined and a swab of vaginal epithelium sent for determination of the Vaginal&#xD;
      Maturation Index (VMI) and Maturation Value (MV). These will be used as objective physiologic&#xD;
      markers to determine the improvement in vaginal atrophy. The cytologist's reading specimens&#xD;
      will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, all study subjects will be asked to fill out questionnaires at baseline and&#xD;
      again in 12 weeks.&#xD;
