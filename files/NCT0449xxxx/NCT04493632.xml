  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The OSPREY Patient Registry has been developed to collect and assess the performance and&#xD;
      safety of the OncoSil™ device when used within the approved indication of unresectable,&#xD;
      locally advanced pancreatic cancer, in combination with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy,&#xD;
      within a real-world observational registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry data will provide both complementary and contemporary information to the&#xD;
      existing clinical data across various countries and will form part of the post-market&#xD;
      clinical follow-up activities for OncoSil™. Therefore, the Registry will be implemented only&#xD;
      in countries with regulatory (commercial) approval for the OncoSil™ device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OSPREY is a post-market, global, multicentre, observational, prospective registry in which&#xD;
      data is recorded from patients who undergo OncoSil™ device implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Countries intended for initial commercial distribution include Australia, Belgium, France,&#xD;
      Germany, Italy, Singapore, Spain, &amp; the United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who are intended to undergo treatment with the OncoSil™ device in the&#xD;
      commercial (sales) setting will participate in this Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient who is prescribed OncoSil™ in the commercial setting will be approached by the&#xD;
      Treating Physician to consent to participate in the OSPREY Patient Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who choose not to consent to participate in the OSPREY Patient Registry will not be&#xD;
      excluded from being treated with the OncoSil™ device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five hundred patients (implanted with OncoSil™) will be recruited into the OSPREY Patient&#xD;
      Registry. It is anticipated recruitment will be over a five-year period, subject to the rate&#xD;
      of commercial adoption of the OncoSil™ device in the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adequately collect data relating to the performance and safety of the OncoSil™ device,&#xD;
      data will be collected from patients over a prescribed 12-month period from enrolment, the&#xD;
      cohort is then followed to death or to 24-months post the date of the last enrolled patient&#xD;
      implanted with OncoSil™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the Registry is expected to run for a seven-year period. Relevant observational&#xD;
      data will be collected via medical record review.&#xD;

    <description>The analysis for safety within the real-world setting will be performed. The safety of OncoSil™ is defined by the Adverse Event profile. All safety summaries will be produced for the Intention-To-Treat (ITT) population. Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All Adverse Events recorded during the Registry will be listed.&#xD;
Summary tables will be produced for Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs). The number and percentage of patients with device-related Adverse Events by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term will be tabulated. Similar summaries will be produced by severity of event (both mild, moderate or severe, CTCAE grade 1-4) and drug and/or device relationship.&#xD;
In addition, summary tables will be produced for serious TEAEs and TEAEs associated with special interest acute/late radiation effects and or withdrawal.</description>

Overall Survival (OS) will be analysed at the interim analysis and once all 500 OncoSil™ implanted patients have been followed to death or to 24-months post the date of the last enrolled/treated patient.</description>
