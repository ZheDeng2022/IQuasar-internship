  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in women of reproductive age that is&#xD;
      characterized by elevated androgen levels, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian&#xD;
      morphology (PCOM). Moreover, has been associated to insulin resistance, obesity, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with PCOS are a heterogeneous group, and specific PCOS phenotype could have a&#xD;
      substantial impact on oocyte quality and molecular profile. Regarding the Rotterdam criteria&#xD;
      for PCOS, four different phenotypes of the syndrome are defined (A, B, C, D). Phenotypic&#xD;
      group A is the most frequent and severe subtype of PCOS. It is described that patients with&#xD;
      so-called phenotype A exhibit a significantly increased risk of pregnancy complications&#xD;
      compared to women with more favorable PCOS phenotypes. Specifically, this clinical-laboratory&#xD;
      study will focus on the molecular characterization of PCOS phenotype A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic are external modifications to DNA that affect how cells &quot;read&quot; genes. These&#xD;
      external modifications have garnered attention in the pathogenesis of PCOS since epigenetics&#xD;
      changes have been reported in various organs in women with the condition. However, remains&#xD;
      unknown whether these alterations are also found in the egg and in its surrounding cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further research is needed to understand the PCOS disorder and to design treatments that can&#xD;
      ameliorate the symptoms of the disease. In particular, this project aims to generate the&#xD;
      molecular profiles of PCOS phenotype A eggs and surrounding cells and compare them with the&#xD;
      ones obtained from and healthy controls. This approach involves the aspiration of immature&#xD;
      eggs without hormonal stimulation or with stimulation of only a few days.&#xD;

    <description>Blood tests will be performed to determine free testosterone levels, anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and lipid profile including fasting plasma glucose and insulin. Women from both PCOS and control groups will be minimally stimulated with gonadotrophins and cumulus-oocytes complexes (COCs) will be aspirated from small antral follicles (2-8mm) without any ovulation triggering. Specifically, administration of highly purified human menopausal gonadotropin (HP-hMG) will start on cycle Day 3 of the menstrual period or a withdrawal bleeding. A pelvic ultrasound scan will be performed in the morning of the last stimulation day to schedule the oocyte collection. Cumulus-oocyte complexes retrieved 42 hours after the last gonadotropin injection will be collected, washed, denuded and individually stored for further molecular characterization.</description>

        Research material will be collected from (i) PCOS patients with phenotype A undergoing IVM&#xD;
        who donate part of their oocytes for research, and (ii) women with normal ovaries and&#xD;
        androgen levels who also donate the total amount of the retrieved oocytes for research.&#xD;
        Participants between the ages of 18 and 37 will be enrolled through correspondent&#xD;
        recruitment programs running in the Centre for Reproductive Medicine of UZ Brussel (CRG).&#xD;
        BMI will be determined and blood tests will be performed to determine free testosterone&#xD;
        levels, AMH and lipid profile including fasting plasma glucose and insulin. The PCOS group&#xD;
        will include patients with phenotype A and the age-matched control groups will include&#xD;
        volunteers with normal androgen levels.&#xD;
