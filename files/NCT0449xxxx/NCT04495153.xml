  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 multi-site trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding&#xD;
      Gene Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy (GMCI™) to standard of care in patients with stage&#xD;
      III/IV NSCLC that are not responding to a first line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). GMCI&#xD;
      kills tumor cells and creates an immune stimulatory environment in the tumor. Killing tumor&#xD;
      cells in an immune stimulatory environment induces the body's immune system to detect and&#xD;
      destroy cancer cells. Patients will receive two courses of GMCI with aglatimagene besadenovec&#xD;
      injected into an accessible involved tumor site followed by 14 days of oral valacyclovir.&#xD;
      Patients will continue with standard of care ICI, plus chemotherapy if indicated. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the combination of GMCI and ICI may improve the response rate and overall&#xD;
      clinical long-term benefit for NSCLC patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial seeks to add GMCI to stage III/IV NSCLC patients who are on standard of care first&#xD;
      line ICI with evidence that the treatment may not be optimal but have the potential for&#xD;
      delayed clinical benefit such that continuing the ICI is indicated. Studies of first line ICI&#xD;
      have shown that most patients that will respond, respond in the first few weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      However, a small percentage of patients have a delayed response with ICI. GMCI has been shown&#xD;
      to increase the response rate to ICI in animal studies. Safety and potential efficacy of GMCI&#xD;
      has been seen in clinical trials in over 700 patients with cancer (lung, pancreas, brain and&#xD;
      ovarian). The goal of this study is to evaluate if adding GMCI can increase the percentage of&#xD;
      patients that respond to the continued ICI. Patients may receive whatever standard of care&#xD;
      therapy is indicated for their disease, such as maintenance chemotherapy, bevacizumab or&#xD;
      focal radiation, in addition to continuing ICI. The eligibility criterion for determining&#xD;
      that the ICI may not be working is based on time on ICI and response status with 3 cohorts as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 is for patients with stable disease radiographically at least 18 weeks after&#xD;
      starting ICI treatment and are clinically stable but appear to have disease that is not&#xD;
      responding further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 is for patients with evidence of radiographic progression at least 18 weeks after&#xD;
      starting ICI treatment but who are clinically stable. Examples that would fit this cohort&#xD;
      would be patients that have disease that decreased or was stable with initial ICI therapy,&#xD;
      and then is slowly progressing or a new distant lesion appears on imaging, but the patient is&#xD;
      otherwise clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3 is for patients who have new lesions or progression of existing lesions at least 9&#xD;
      weeks after starting ICI but who are clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific ICI treatment regimen on this protocol is not specified to allow for different&#xD;
      standard of care options with or without chemotherapy; for example, pembrolizumab alone,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, atezolizumab or atezolizumab plus chemotherapy. In addition,&#xD;
      it allows stage III patients after chemoradiation who may be on durvalumab as their standard&#xD;
      of care. For example, a stage III patient may be eligible for cohort 2 if they have&#xD;
      radiographic progression but are clinically stable 18 weeks after starting durvalumab or&#xD;
      cohort 3 if they develop a new lesion at 12 weeks after starting durvalumab.&#xD;
