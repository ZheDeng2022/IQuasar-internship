  <brief_summary>

      This study aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic for&#xD;
      resecting paracaval-originating lesions by contrast of open procedures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The paracaval portion of the caudate lobe is located in the core of the liver. Lesions&#xD;
      originating in the paracaval portion often cling to or even invade major hepatic vascular&#xD;
      structures. Open surgery is the traditional surgical method for resection of&#xD;
      paracaval-originating lesions. With the development of laparoscopic surgery,&#xD;
      paracaval-originating lesions are no longer an absolute contraindication for laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedures. The high-definition magnified view and ability to change perspectives with the&#xD;
      laparoscope are conducive to subtle manipulation, and compression of the carbon dioxide&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum can reduce venous bleeding. Nevertheless, laparoscopic anterior hepatic&#xD;
      transection for paracaval-originating lesion resection is still a challenging procedure, and&#xD;
      only a few cases have been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of laparoscopic for resecting paracaval-originating lesions by contrast of open&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

    <description>The laparoscopic view is caudal to cephalic, which is consistent with the direction of hepatic transection. In addition, the high-definition magnified view and ability to change perspectives with the laparoscope are conducive to subtle manipulation, and compression of the carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum can reduce venous bleeding. Therefore, laparoscopic surgery may have certain advantages in the treatment of paracaval-originating lesions.</description>

    <description>Patients were supine in a reverse Trendelenburg position and received intravenous inhalation combined with anesthesia. The patients' legs were spread apart. A carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum was established. The intermittent Pringle's maneuver was carried out when necessary. Five trocars were placed in a fan shape around the lesion. Cholecystectomy was performed routinely. First, the liver was mobilized. Then, the liver parenchyma was transected and the branches of the hepatic veins and pedicles encountered were clipped and divided. The lesion was meticulously separated from the vascular structures and liver parenchyma and completely resected. The raw surface was treated with bipolar coagulation to achieve hemostasis and repeatedly washed until no bleeding or bile leakage was confirmed. Finally, the specimens were packed in a specimen bag and removed. The raw surface was packed with biological hemostatic materials, and drainage tubes were routinely placed.</description>

    <description>Patients were placed in the supine position and received intravenous inhalation combined with anesthesia. The intermittent Pringle's maneuver was carried out when necessary.
