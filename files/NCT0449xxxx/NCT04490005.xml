      The use of quantitative, automated, infrared technology for pupillary examination has long&#xD;
      been used in ophthalmology and anesthesiology research. Its interest in neurocritical care&#xD;
      has progressively grown, in parallel with the advancements in device technology. In this&#xD;
      regard, the use of the noninvasive NPi®-200 pupillometer (Neuroptics, Laguna Hills,&#xD;
      California, USA) allows the measurement of a series of dynamic pupillary variables (including&#xD;
      the percentage pupillary constriction, latency, constriction velocity, and dilation&#xD;
      velocity), which can be integrated into an algorithm, to compute the Neurological Pupil index&#xD;
      (NPi). The NPi is a proprietary scalar index with values between 0 and 5 (with a 0.1 decimal&#xD;
      precision), an NPi value &lt; 3 indicating an abnormal pupillary reactivity. Importantly, the&#xD;
      NPi is not influenced by sedation-analgesia, at the doses used in neurocritical care&#xD;
      practice, and by mild hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary single-center data recently demonstrated that abnormal NPi is associated with&#xD;
      worse outcome in patients with traumatic and hemorrhagic ABI, and can be a useful adjunct for&#xD;
      ICP monitoring and therapy. There is currently a great need for quantitative tools to predict&#xD;
      early prognostication in ABI patients, and the NPi appears of potential great value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Abnormal NPi (defined as NPi &lt;3) are strongly predictive of poor GOS-E (1-4) at 6 months&#xD;
           after the acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NPi=0 is strongly predictive of mortality (GOS 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abnormal NPi is predictive of a higher ICP 20 index (number of end-hourly measures of&#xD;
           ICP &gt;20 mm Hg divided by the total number of measurements, multiplied by 100) and a&#xD;
           greater burden of interventions needed to control ICP (measured by the Therapy Intensity&#xD;
           Level scale for ICP management, Therapy Intensity Level (TIL) 4).&#xD;

      Introduction Pupillary examination, and in particular pupillary light reactivity (PLR), is&#xD;
      fundamental for intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and follow-up of patients with acute&#xD;
      brain injury (ABI), and has both diagnostic and prognostic values. Secondary cerebral&#xD;
      insults, e.g. elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) may alter midbrain function and cause&#xD;
      abnormalities in pupil size, symmetry and PLR. Sustained or newfound pupillary abnormalities&#xD;
      are associated with a worse outcome, and indeed PLR is a robust validated predictor in&#xD;
      several prognostic models, such as the CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization after Significant&#xD;
      Head Injury) and the IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical&#xD;
      Trials) scores. In current clinical practice however, pupillary examination is performed&#xD;
      using a manual, hand-held light source (e.g. pen torch), implying that the evaluation of&#xD;
      pupillary size and reactivity remains essentially based on a visual qualitative assessment.&#xD;
      This traditional approach has several limitations, such as limited precision (especially in&#xD;
      patients with small pupil size), significant intra- and inter-observer variability,&#xD;
      differences in ambient light exposure between measurements, or the technique used to direct&#xD;
      the stimulus (i.e. intensity, proximity, duration and orientation of the light source).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of quantitative, automated, infrared technology for pupillary examination has long&#xD;
      been used in ophthalmology and anesthesiology research. Its interest in neurocritical care&#xD;
      has progressively grown, in parallel with the advancements in device technology. In this&#xD;
      regard, the use of the noninvasive NPi®-200 pupillometer (Neuroptics, Laguna Hills, CA, USA)&#xD;
      allows the measurement of a series of dynamic pupillary variables (including the percentage&#xD;
      pupillary constriction, latency, constriction velocity, and dilation velocity), which can be&#xD;
      integrated into an algorithm, to compute the Neurological Pupil index (NPi). The NPi is a&#xD;
      proprietary scalar index with values between 0 and 5 (with a 0.1 decimal precision), an NPi&#xD;
      value &lt; 3 indicating an abnormal pupillary reactivity. Importantly, the NPi is not influenced&#xD;
      by sedation-analgesia, at the doses used in neurocritical care practice, and by mild&#xD;
      hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary single-center data recently demonstrated that abnormal NPi is associated with&#xD;
      worse outcome in patients with traumatic and hemorrhagic ABI, and can be a useful adjunct for&#xD;
      ICP monitoring and therapy. There is currently a great need for quantitative tools to predict&#xD;
      early prognostication in ABI patients, and the NPi appears of potential great value. For this&#xD;
      purpose, large multicenter studies are required. The Investigators recently conducted an&#xD;
      international multicenter study that demonstrated the prognostic value of NPi in the setting&#xD;
      of early prognostication of ABI following cardiac arrest. Here, the Investigators aim at&#xD;
      evaluating the prognostic value of the NPi in patients with ABI following traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (TBI), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at&#xD;
      risk of secondary ICP elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Abnormal NPi (defined as NPi &lt;3) are strongly predictive of poor GOS-E (1-4) at 6 months&#xD;
           after the acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NPi=0 is strongly predictive of mortality (GOS 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abnormal NPi is predictive of a higher ICP 20 index (number of end-hourly measures of&#xD;
           ICP &gt;20 mm Hg divided by the total number of measurements, multiplied by 100) and a&#xD;
           greater burden of interventions needed to control ICP (measured by the Therapy Intensity&#xD;
           Level scale for ICP management, TIL 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, observational, international cohort study focused at identifying the&#xD;
      relationship of NPi with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  long-term outcome defined as 6-months mortality and neurological recovery, measured with&#xD;
           the extended Glasgow Outcome Score, GOS-E;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intracranial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation No formal sample size calculation has been performed due to the&#xD;
      exploratory nature of the study. However, the Investigators expect to recruit a total of 420&#xD;
      patients, 140 per pathology for whom GOSE will be performed (i.e. TBI, ICH, SAH), over a&#xD;
      12-months period. Therefore, the twelve participating centres will contribute, based on their&#xD;
      potentiality of recruitment, with a minimum of 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening All patients admitted to the participating ICUs in coma after ABI will be screened&#xD;
      daily and entered into a screening log . Each ICU will recruit eligible patients for 12&#xD;
      consecutive months and collect data for each recruited patient daily in an expanded&#xD;
      electronic case report form (eCRF). Both common-data elements and etiology-specific data will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and Medical History Demographic characteristics and medical history information&#xD;
      will be extracted from patients' medical records including gender, age, co-morbidities,&#xD;
      diagnosis, timeline and clinical presentation of acute brain injury. All NPi and ICP&#xD;
      monitoring data, as well as additional neuro-monitoring and neuroimaging data will be&#xD;
      extracted from patients' medical records too and documented in the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPi Data and Daily eCRF The daily eCRF Data Capture will be completed for NPi (collected&#xD;
      every 4 hours) and for ICP (matched to NPi), every day, from admission up to day 7 . Data&#xD;
      collected will also include additional ICP derived variables and interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) as main outcome will be collected at&#xD;
      ICU/hospital discharge and at 6 months). Data on the cause of death will be collected as&#xD;
      well. The GOS-E at the End-of-Study will be collected via telephone-structured interviews to&#xD;
      patients and/or family members using a validated questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods No formal sample size calculation has been performed due to the&#xD;
      exploratory nature of the study. However, the Investigators expect to recruit a total of 420&#xD;
      patients, 140 per pathology (i.e. TBI, ICH, SAH), over a 12-months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the twelve participating centres will contribute, based on their potentiality of&#xD;
      recruitment, with a minimum of 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be summarised by counts and percentages and quartiles or means and standard&#xD;
      deviation, as appropriate, for qualitative and quantitative characteristics, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unsupervised and supervised methods will be applied with explorative purposes using the&#xD;
      individual NPi longitudinal measurements. For example, the pattern recognition of&#xD;
      longitudinal profiles and the cluster trajectory analyses will be used in order to identify&#xD;
      patterns of NPi trajectories associated with prognosis. NPi trends will be also described&#xD;
      graphically and modelled by longitudinal mixed models using splines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cox and a logistic model will be then applied to evaluate the association between the NPi&#xD;
      process with the 6-month mortality and the neurological recovery (GOSE≤4 vs GOSE&gt;4) at 6&#xD;
      months, respectively. This will be done considering NPi in categories identifying different&#xD;
      potential patterns in NPi profiles or using summary measures that have been already&#xD;
      introduced in this context, such as the percentage of NPi&lt;3 observed in the time interval of&#xD;
      observation or the area under the trajectory in time. The two eyes will contribute to these&#xD;
      analyses with the worst result. This analysis will be done overall on a multivariable model&#xD;
      that will also explore a potential interaction effect with the different pathologies, while&#xD;
      the improvement with respect to the standard risk factors (e.g. the components of the IMPACT&#xD;
      model for TBI patients) will be evaluated by multivariable models on each of the three&#xD;
      specific pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, the association between NPi and mortality will be evaluated by the use of shared&#xD;
      frailty joint models, in which NPi trend in left and right eye will be evaluated by a&#xD;
      multivariate mixed model, which outcome will be used to model mortality. Model-based&#xD;
      mortality prediction will be computed based on individual NPi trends. The same kind of&#xD;
      approach will be used for the binary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks and Benefits Risks The ORANGE study is observational. It does not introduce&#xD;
      any interventional procedure. The data is extracted from the patients' medical records and&#xD;
      does not affect local standard of care. Hence, the study does not add any interventional risk&#xD;
      to the patients recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality breach is a potential risk, which will be addressed by patients' data&#xD;
      codification. A unique code will be generated by the e-CRF and allocated to every site and&#xD;
      every enrolled patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits No individual benefit is expected for the study participants. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      results of the study could possibly help us improving the knowledge for a better medical care&#xD;
      for similar patients in the future and the generation of hypotheses for further collaborative&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection ICUs willing to participate will register electronically and collect data via&#xD;
      an electronic Case-Report Form (RedCAP platform). An online training module will be developed&#xD;
      to help data collectors in completing the study eCRF. Data collection will be web based,&#xD;
      permitting conditional Data Collection screens, i.e. data collectors will be automatically&#xD;
      guided as to which sections to complete based on data entered indicating whether Inclusion&#xD;
      Criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical standards This study is conducted in compliance with the protocol version 3.0 , the&#xD;
      current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH-Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      guidelines, as well as local relevant legal and regulatory requirements of every site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics committee Each investigator will notify the relevant ethics committee, in compliance&#xD;
      with the local legislation and rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approval of the protocol (if required by local authorities) must be obtained before any&#xD;
      participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by&#xD;
      the 3 chief investigators before the changes are implemented to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of capacity and Delayed Consent Patients recruited in this study will not be able to&#xD;
      provide informed consent at the time of recruitment. The responsible clinical/research staff&#xD;
      will act as Consultee and consent eligible patients after discussion with the next-of-kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has a Power of Attorney or a Legal tutor or an, he/she will act as Consultee&#xD;
      and will be asked to consent/decline participation to the study on legal behalf of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients have Advance Decision Plan including participation in research studies the Plan&#xD;
      will be respected and recruitment pursued/abandoned accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow-up, patients who have regained capacity will be asked to provide Informed Consent&#xD;
      and will be given the possibility to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide Informed Consent for the acute data and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deny research participation and request destruction of acute data collected.&#xD;
