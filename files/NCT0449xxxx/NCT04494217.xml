  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective clinical study conducted with the approval of the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of phototherapy lights on the accuracy of pulse oximetry will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient's oxygen saturation will be measured non-invasively via a nondisposable&#xD;
      polyethylene neonatal probe taped to the infant's palm, toe, or dorsum of the foot. The probe&#xD;
      will be connected to an Massimo Rad97 pulse oximeter that is standardized at the factory. It&#xD;
      runs through an automatic systems check when turned on and needs no further calibration&#xD;
      before being used. The oxygen saturation measurements will be considered valid when there&#xD;
      will be a normal plethysmographic waveform, a fullscale signal strength bar, and a stable&#xD;
      heart rate closely approximating an independent electrocardiographic (ECG) pulse rate. The&#xD;
      pulse oximeter works by using the technology of plethsmography which allows the detection of&#xD;
      an arterial pulse) with oximetry (which measures oxygen saturation at specific wavelengths).&#xD;
      The pulse oximeter will be placed on each infant as already described. After a stable pulse&#xD;
      oximeter reading was obtained, the value will be recorded (&quot;before&quot;) and then the probe will&#xD;
      be covered with a standard disposable diaper, shiny side up. When the reading stabilized, the&#xD;
      value will be recorded (&quot;during&quot;) and then the diaper will be removed.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        All newborn babies who are receiving phototherapy for indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the&#xD;
        NICU of the Hacettepe University will be included in the study following the obtaining of&#xD;
        informed consent by their parents/guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The oxygen saturation of all babies receiving inpatient treatment in the NICU is routinely&#xD;
        monitored with a pulse oximeter. In this study, the oxygen saturation of the newborns&#xD;
        receiving phototherapy will be recorded.&#xD;
