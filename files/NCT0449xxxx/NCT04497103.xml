    <textblock>
      The Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)&#xD;
      were considered as primary outcome measurements. Secondary outcomes included total active&#xD;
      range of motion (ROM) of the digits, hand grip strength and pinch strengths (tip, palmer and&#xD;
      lateral pinch). All measurement was conducted at two occasions: at the baseline and after&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The included participant were children with a deep partial thickness or a full thickness burn&#xD;
      induced by either a scaled or a flame thermal burn with involvement of more than 50% of the&#xD;
      hand and wrist, total body surface area (TBSA) less than 30% , age ranged from 7 to 14 years,&#xD;
      recent discharge of inpatient acute care, spontaneous healing (within 34 weeks) or grafting&#xD;
      with split thickness or full-thickness skin grafts (at least before 2 weeks). Children were&#xD;
      excluded from this study if they had infection, juvenile arthritis, fracture, tendon&#xD;
      injuries, muscle injury, degenerative joint diseases, peripheral nerve diseases, Pre -&#xD;
      established psychologically and physically disorders (extreme aphasia, cognitive and&#xD;
      developmental deficits that can influence the rehabilitation).&#xD;
