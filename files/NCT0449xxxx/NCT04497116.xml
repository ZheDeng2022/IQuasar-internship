  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to study the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      orally-administered RP-3500 alone or in combination with talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor, in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors with ATR inhibitor-sensitizing mutations. This study will&#xD;
      also evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-3500 alone or in combination with&#xD;
      talazoparib, examine both the pharmacokinetics (PK)and pharmacodynamics (PD)and investigate&#xD;
      its anti-tumor activity in solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion&#xD;
      study to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety profile and MTD of RP-3500 when administered orally, alone and in&#xD;
           combination with talazoparib, to establish the dose and schedule recommended for the&#xD;
           Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the PK profile of RP-3500 alone or in combination with talazoparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify anti-tumor activity associated with RP-3500 given alone or in combination with&#xD;
           talazoparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine biomarker responses and establish a correlation with RP-3500 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial cohorts will test RP-3500 as monotherapy. Additional cohorts will be enrolled&#xD;
      with RP-3500 in combination with a PARP inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the RP2D and schedule is determined, expansion cohort(s) for RP-3500 will be enrolled&#xD;
      to study the anti-tumor effect, and further examine the safety, PK, and PD of RP-3500 at the&#xD;
      RP2D&#xD;
