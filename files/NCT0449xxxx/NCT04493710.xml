  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency laparotomy is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. These risks are&#xD;
      increased in the elderly population with a third of over-80s dying within thirty days of&#xD;
      surgery, rising to 50% at 1-year post emergency laparotomy. Many patients are frail and have&#xD;
      multiple co-morbidities, often with coexistent malnutrition and so present a significant&#xD;
      challenge in the emergency surgery setting. The National Emergency Laparotomy Audit has&#xD;
      reported that greater than half of patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in the UK are&#xD;
      over-65 years of age and are the highest risk patients with the highest mortality. This&#xD;
      group, therefore, is one in which accurate prognostication is desirable to allow optimal&#xD;
      treatment decisions, provision of critical care treatment, and resource allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of multivariate risk prediction models exist including POSSUM, P-POSSUM and&#xD;
      APACHE-II with on-going modification of P-POSSUM as part of the National Emergency Laparotomy&#xD;
      Audit(NELA). Whilst such models are commonly used, evidence suggests that they may be less&#xD;
      accurate in elderly patients, a group which offer difficult decision-making problems to the&#xD;
      surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Frailty is the lack of physiological functional reserve and is commonplace in elderly&#xD;
      patients. It has profound effects on the ability to withstand and recover from emergency&#xD;
      surgery. Despite this, frailty does not form part of the commonly used multivariate risk&#xD;
      prediction models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is the progressive and global loss of skeletal muscle mass as well as reduction in&#xD;
      strength and is closely linked to frailty. Multiple methods of quantifying skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass and therefore sarcopenia have been defined, but calculation of psoas major&#xD;
      cross-sectional area on pre-operative CT imaging may be the most pragmatic in the emergency&#xD;
      setting due to routine use of pre-operative CT imaging prior to emergency laparotomy.&#xD;
      Measurement of the psoas major as a marker of sarcopenia has been shown to predict outcomes&#xD;
      in a wide range of surgical specialties. However, there is no consensus as to how this marker&#xD;
      of sarcopenia should be used in surgical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal- To assess the utility of psoas major measurement to predict outcomes following&#xD;
      emergency laparotomy in older patients and whether it could enhance the accuracy of mortality&#xD;
      prediction when combined with P-POSSUM model variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods An analysis of data collected as part of the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit was&#xD;
      conducted. Data were collected from patients over the age of 65 who underwent emergency&#xD;
      laparotomy in Merseyside, United Kingdom between 2014 and 2018. Patients who underwent&#xD;
      pre-operative cross-sectional imaging with abdominal CT pre-operatively were included in the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, histological, clinical, biochemical and operative data were collected and&#xD;
      analysed by accessing patient clinical notes and electronic records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures included inpatient mortality, 30-day mortality and 90-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological Analysis Pre-operative CT imaging of the abdomen were accessed and analysed.&#xD;
      Cross-sectional images at the level of the L3 inferior end plate were analysed.&#xD;
      Cross-sectional area of the psoas major and L3 vertebral body (mm2) were calculated and a&#xD;
      ratio of psoas major to L3 cross-sectional area calculated (PML3) . Higher PML3 values&#xD;
      indicate higher levels of skeletal muscle mass. Cross-sectional area calculation was&#xD;
      conducted using the area of interest tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis for continuous variables was conducted using&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-squared test for categorical variables. Receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristics curves were used for analysis of association of PML3 with mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression analysis. Logistic&#xD;
      regression models were produced including P-POSSUM variables with and without the inclusion&#xD;
      of PML3. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the respective logistic regression&#xD;
      models were conducted to assess whether the addition of PML3 enhanced mortality prediction.&#xD;
