  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased mammographic density of mammary gland tissues and hyperprolactinaemia are regarded&#xD;
      as one of the risk factors for the development of breast cancer in women aged 40 to 52 years,&#xD;
      which necessitates closer monitoring of the mammary gland and can be considered as&#xD;
      modifiable. The herbal drug Cyclodynone® has a dopaminergic effect on the hypothalamus, which&#xD;
      causes its inhibitory effect on the secretion of prolactin. At present, a significant&#xD;
      positive clinical and scientific experience has been accumulated in the use of the&#xD;
      Cyclodynone® for the treatment of benign breast dysplasias against a background of mild&#xD;
      hyperprolactinaemia in women of reproductive age. Demonstration of the positive effect of&#xD;
      this drug on the reduction of hyperprolactinemia, mammographic density of MF, evaluation on&#xD;
      the scale BI-RADS would justify its application for the modification of this risk factor in&#xD;
      women aged 40 to 52 years.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: Increased mammographic density of mammary gland tissues and hyperprolactinaemia&#xD;
      are regarded as one of the risk factors for the development of breast cancer in women aged 40&#xD;
      to 52 years, which necessitates closer monitoring of the mammary gland. However, this risk&#xD;
      factor can be considered as modifiable. The drug Cyclodynone® (contains 4 mg of special&#xD;
      extract of dried fruits of Chaste Berry (Vitex agnus-castus)) has a dopaminergic effect on&#xD;
      the hypothalamus, which causes its inhibitory effect on the secretion of prolactin. At&#xD;
      present, a significant positive clinical and scientific experience has been accumulated in&#xD;
      the use of the Cyclodynone® for the treatment of benign breast dysplasias against a&#xD;
      background of mild hyperprolactinaemia in women of reproductive age. However, the experience&#xD;
      of using Cyclodynone® in women older than 40-52 years with increased density or dyshormonal&#xD;
      pathology of breast cancer is limited. Demonstration of the positive effect of this drug on&#xD;
      the reduction of hyperprolactinemia, mammographic density of MF, evaluation on the scale&#xD;
      BI-RADS would justify its application for the modification of this risk factor in women aged&#xD;
      40 to 52 years.&#xD;
