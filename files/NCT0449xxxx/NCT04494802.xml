  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cuff inflation up to the maximum cuff pressure when using LMA flexible can cause sore throat&#xD;
      and discomfort after the surgery, and if the surgery is unexpectedly prolonged, there can be&#xD;
      a side effect that can cause ischemic damage around the neck. If keeping cuff pressure low&#xD;
      will not increase gastric insufflation and there is no change in other outcome variables,&#xD;
      keeping it low may have a positive effect on anesthesia management and outcome in children.&#xD;
