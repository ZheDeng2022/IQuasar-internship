  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurophysiological contributors to muscle&#xD;
      function following ACL Reconstruction and the influence of motor control biofeedback exercise&#xD;
      on measures of muscle function. The research team hypothesizes that the application of motor&#xD;
      biofeedback will increase cortical excitability of the quadriceps compared to the passive&#xD;
      movement of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single session cross-over intervention study with a 1-week washout period between&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;

      1. Pre-treatment neuromuscular assessment Cortical Active Motor Threshed We will measure&#xD;
           motor evoked potentials with the use of a Transcranial magnetic stimulator (MagStim&#xD;
           model 200, Magstim Co., Ltd., Wales, UK). The MagStim has FDA 510K Clearance for&#xD;
           stimulation of peripheral nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will be asked to sit in the dynamometer (Biodex, System 3) in knee&#xD;
                extension at 90 degrees of knee flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EMG electrodes will be placed on the distal quadriceps&#xD;
&#xD;
                o Local shaving, debridement, and cleaning will be done prior if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A non-latex swim cap will be placed on the participants head for investigator's&#xD;
                measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Briefly, a magnetic field with a maximum value of 2.2 Tesla will be introduced to&#xD;
                the scalp at a location in the pre-motor cortex that corresponds to the quadriceps.&#xD;
                Single pulse stimulations will be delivered with no less than 10 seconds between&#xD;
                stimulations (maximum = 0.1 Hz).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When the magnetic field is received at the premotor cortex at the appropriate area,&#xD;
                a motor signal is sent to the quadriceps. We will record this signal with surface&#xD;
                EMG electrodes that are on the quadriceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will be asked to extend their leg to match a force equivalent to 5%&#xD;
                MVIC. Feedback will be provided to the participant to provide such force.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stimulation of the TMS will happen once every ten seconds until the Active Motor&#xD;
                Threshold was found by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The motor evoked potential measured by the quadriceps will be recorded at 80%,&#xD;
                     90%, 100%, 110%, 120%, 130%, 140%, and 150% of the patients Active motor&#xD;
                     threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The patient is then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. 1) Visuomotor Therapy or 2)&#xD;
           Passive Motion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform Randomized Treatment Visuomotor Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will sit in the Biodex chair with the tested limb secured in the&#xD;
                dynamometer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will receive live real-time biofeedback of their knee force output&#xD;
                (no more than 30% of maximum force)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will aim to match their force output to a target threshold&#xD;
                presented on the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will complete 10 60-second trials of this exercise with a 30 second&#xD;
                rest between each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
           Passive Motion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will sit in the Biodex chair with the tested limb secured in the&#xD;
                dynamometer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The dynamometer will passively move the patients lower limb between 80 to 120&#xD;
                degrees of knee flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will be asked to relax for the duration of testing - The&#xD;
                participant will complete 10 60-second trials of this exercise with a 30 second&#xD;
                rest between each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reassess Neuromuscular outcome (Step 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 1-week washout period&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 but the patient receives the cross-over arm intervention&#xD;
