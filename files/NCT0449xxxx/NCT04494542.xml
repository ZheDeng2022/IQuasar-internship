    <textblock>
      The current prospective pliot randomized controlled trial has been designed to demonstrate&#xD;
      non-inferiority of sustained low efficiency dialysis (SLED) when compared to continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy in managing AKI in context of cirrhotics with septic shock who are&#xD;
      hemodynamically unstable. The patients would be randomized 1:1 to either SLED or CRRT after&#xD;
      screening for the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;

      Aim &amp; Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To study the efficacy of sustained low efficiency dialysis versus&#xD;
      continuous renal replacement therapy in cirrhotics with septic shock and severe AKI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Effects on renal recovery rates in the two groups To assess the effects&#xD;
      on 7-day and 28-day mortality Efficacy on Lactate Clearance Duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and ICU stay Effect on systemic hemodynamics and reversal of shock Clearance of&#xD;
      endotoxin and pro-inflammatory cytokines Effect on coagulation and endothelial function&#xD;
      Improvement in SOFA scores at 48 hours and day 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology All included patients would be randomised to receive either continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy or sustained low efficiency dialysis (SLED) Patients with septic shock&#xD;
      would be screened. Following this, patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be screened and randomized to the two treatment groups. Standard criteria will be considered&#xD;
      to define refractoriness to fluids and initiation of dialysis. Fluid management would be&#xD;
      performed using the dynamic indices in patients on mechanical ventilation or using IVC&#xD;
      diameter and passive-leg rasing in non-intubated patients. In all patients, baseline&#xD;
      endotoxin activity assay and blood and urine sample will be stored for looking at the effect&#xD;
      of therapy on cytokine profile (TNF alpha, IL-IB, IL6, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, IL-10 and ADAMTS and&#xD;
      vWillebrand factor). Septic shock would be defined as a clinical construct of sepsis with&#xD;
      persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP&gt;=65 mm of Hg and having a serum&#xD;
      lactate &gt;2 mmol/L despite adequate volume resuscitation. The blood flow rate, dialysis flow&#xD;
      rate and need of ultrafiltration would be recorded for all enrolled patients. Subsequent&#xD;
      sessions of therapy would be done as per requirement and recorded. The dose of vasopressor in&#xD;
      norepinephrine equivalent would be recorded for all patients at enrolment as under&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cirrhosis with septic shock and AKI requiring dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for initiation of dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Metabolic acidosis with ph&lt;7.2 or serum bicarbonate &lt;15 mEq/lt&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hyperkalemia with serum potassium &gt;5.5 Meq/L non-responsive to standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Oliguria with or without fluid overload (non-responsive to diuretics) with urine output&#xD;
           of less than 0.5ml/kg/hr despite fluid resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Uremic complications (encephalopathy, pericarditis etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A randomized controlled study- Non-inferiority trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted on patients admitted to Department of Hepatology from June&#xD;
           2020 to December 2020 at ILBS, New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group will comprise critically ill patients with cirrhosis with septic shock and&#xD;
           AKI requiring dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: The study will be conducted on patients admitted to Department of Hepatology&#xD;
      from May 2020 to December 2020 at ILBS, New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation: The study will be designed as a pilot RCT with an aim to enrol 25&#xD;
      patients in each group. At completion a decision for termination versus continuation of the&#xD;
      study would be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: CRRT versus SLED until renal recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal recovery would be defined as increase in urine output to more than 400ml/day in&#xD;
      patients with anuria, resolution of metabolic complications or spontaneous decline in urea&#xD;
      and creatinine necessitating stopping dialytic support&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Assessment: Hourly till the patient is in the intensive care then every 7 days&#xD;
      until day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All variables shall be expressed in mean (sd) or median (range)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables will be compared by Mann- Whitney U test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Categorical variables we will use Chi-Square or Fisher's test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival analysis will be done using Cox-proportional regression analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actuarial probability of survival shall be calculated by Kaplan- Meier graph and compared by&#xD;
      log- rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Effects: Worsening of hypotension, bleeding any cardiac side-effects, worsening&#xD;
      lactate, hypothermia, bradycardia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rule: clinically relevant bleeding (i.e., transfusion requirements of at least 2&#xD;
      units of packed red cells), arrythmias (brady or tachyarryhthmias), poorly tolerated&#xD;
      supraventricular arrhythmia related blood stream infections, development of electrolyte&#xD;
      abnormalities hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia or hypomagnesemia refractory to medical&#xD;
      management, renal recovery&#xD;
