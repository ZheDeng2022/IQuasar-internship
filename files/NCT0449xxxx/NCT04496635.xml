      The Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program in Catalonia (VINCat) monitors surgical site&#xD;
      infection (SSI) in elective colorectal surgery since 2007 in 55 public and private acute care&#xD;
      hospitals. These hospitals perform active and prospective standardized surveillance of&#xD;
      elective colorectal resections. Post-discharge surveillance is mandatory at least up to 30&#xD;
      days after surgery. Hospitals are classified according to their size into three groups: &gt;500&#xD;
      hospital beds; 200-500 beds; &lt;200 beds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. To examine the effect on SSI rate of a specific preventative bundle in elective&#xD;
      colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Pragmatic study using VINCat prospective colorectal database from 2007 to 2018. In&#xD;
      2016, a bundle of six preventative measures was recommended to the VINCat hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the results of SSI before (baseline phase, BP) and after the bundle implementation&#xD;
      (implementation phase, IP) a logistic regression model has been established. The results will&#xD;
      be shown as Odds Ratio (OR) and the corresponding confidence intervalsCI95. The significance&#xD;
      level will be fixed at 5% (P &lt; 0.05).&#xD;

      Surveillance. The VINCat Program was developed in the 2007 as the Nosocomial Infection&#xD;
      Surveillance system in Catalonia, covering a population of seven and a half million people.&#xD;
      The system is similar to other international reference programs, such as the National&#xD;
      Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), and its described in detail on the VINCat website.&#xD;
      Hospitals carry out active and prospective standardized surveillance, and are classified&#xD;
      according to their number of beds into three groups: group 1 (500 beds); group 2 (200-500&#xD;
      beds); group 3 (200 beds). The staff performing surveillance had received training in the&#xD;
      VINCat surveillance methodology to ensure the collection of homogeneous, accurate data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance is continued at least for 30 days after the operation. All public and private&#xD;
      participating hospitals report data voluntarily and receive feedback once a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of colorectal surgery is performed prospectively and continued until a minimum of&#xD;
      100 interventions per year is reached in each hospital, although some centres include all&#xD;
      their yearly cases. Hospitals with less than 10 interventions per year are excluded.&#xD;
      Participating hospitals record the data on an Internet-based database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and post-discharge surveillance. Patients are followed up by trained infection&#xD;
      control staff. Active mandatory post-discharge surveillance is performed at least to day 30&#xD;
      post surgery by a multimodal approach including electronic review of clinical records&#xD;
      (primary and secondary care), checking readmissions, checking emergency visits, and reviewing&#xD;
      microbiological and radiological data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the colorectal surgical site infection program. In 2015, a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team of nurses and medical specialists from the VINCat Program, and surgeons belonging to the&#xD;
      Catalan Society of Surgery was set up to formulate a specific bundle of SSI preventative&#xD;
      measures for colorectal surgery. The literature for optimal care during the preoperative,&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative phases was reviewed, including evidence on oral antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis and mechanical bowel preparation. Practices were chosen either by their high&#xD;
      levels of scientific evidence or by being considered, by consensus, reasonable, associated&#xD;
      with minimal risk, and potentially beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working group developed a 6 measures bundle to be voluntary implemented by the&#xD;
      participating hospitals. The measures of the bundle are: intravenous and oral antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis, mechanical bowel preparation (MBP), laparoscopic surgery, maintenance of&#xD;
      normothermia, and the use of a wound retractor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention began on 1 January 2016, with diffusion of the bundle measures via e-mail,&#xD;
      and a workshop addressed to all to the surgical and ICT teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions. SSI is defined according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and is&#xD;
      stratified into categories of surgical procedures (-1 to 3) according to the risk of surgical&#xD;
      infection defined by the NHSN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the pragmatic trial. Implementation of the bundle precluded randomization. The&#xD;
      study compared two phases: baseline (BP), from 2008 to 2015, and implementation (IP), from&#xD;
      2016 to 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-five of the 66 hospitals participating in the VINCat Program were included in the&#xD;
      analysis. Prospective surveillance was performed by the infection control team (ICT) of each&#xD;
      hospital to ensure appropriate data collection. The surveillance period lasted from January&#xD;
      2007 to December 2018. During the first 4 years of the program, the results of colon and&#xD;
      rectal surgery were aggregated. From 2011, data is separated for each type of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all eligible patients were included in the pragmatic design, informed consent was not&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted as a performance improvement project and approved by the Ethics in&#xD;
      Research Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be summarized as frequencies and proportions for categorical&#xD;
      variables or as medians and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. Infection&#xD;
      rates will be expressed as cumulative incidence, that is, the crude percentage of operations&#xD;
      resulting in SSI/ number of surgery procedures. Data will be also stratified by year, risk&#xD;
      index category, hospital group and SSI type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyse the relationship between two qualitative variables, contingency tables will be&#xD;
      used, and the chi-square test or the likelihood ratio test will be performed. The analysis&#xD;
      will be completed with grouped bar graphs. To analyse differences in the proportion of&#xD;
      infection over the years, the logistic regression model will be performed. The results will&#xD;
      be presented in terms of OR or estimated infection rates, with the corresponding 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals. The significance level will be set at 5% in all tests. The results will&#xD;
      be analysed using software: Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) v9.4, SAS Institute Inc.,&#xD;
      Cary, USA.&#xD;
