  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth involved in the juvenile justice system (YJJ) bear a disproportionate burden of the&#xD;
      addiction crisis. YJJ substance use (SU) is extremely prevalent, with a third of YJJ meeting&#xD;
      criteria for a substance use disorder (SUD). The investigators seek to address the national&#xD;
      addiction crisis at its epicenter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite their high need for SUD services, and the proliferation of evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions to reduce SU, YJJ are rarely connected to needed, high-quality SU care. A care&#xD;
      cascade model highlights gaps in YJJ achieving the full continuum of SUD care (i.e., SUD risk&#xD;
      identification, treatment referral, treatment initiation, and treatment engagement). YJJ on&#xD;
      community supervision/probation face a unique problem accessing SUD services; while the&#xD;
      courts or probation may identify YJJ need for SUD care, YJJ must receive care through&#xD;
      healthcare agencies in the community. The primary goal of the project, Alliances to&#xD;
      Disseminate Addiction Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) is to address this and other gaps&#xD;
      along the care cascade for YJJ. The investigators will accomplish this goal by creating&#xD;
      alliances between the juvenile justice system (JJ) agencies and community mental health&#xD;
      centers (CMHCs) in eight Indiana counties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADAPT takes a two-pronged approach. First, the investigators will employ a Learning Health&#xD;
      System (LHS) to develop collaborative alliances between JJ agencies and CMHCs, organizations&#xD;
      that traditionally operate independently. Second, the investigators will present local&#xD;
      Cascade data during continuous quality improvement cycles within the LHS alliances. By&#xD;
      offering agency representatives an opportunity to view and discuss, for example, the local&#xD;
      rate at which YJJ with SUD risk are initiating CMHC SU services, the investigators will&#xD;
      facilitate development of tailored, local solutions to improve the Cascade for each county's&#xD;
      YJJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maximize long-term sustainability of ADAPT's JJ-CMHC alliances, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct this research in collaboration with leaders from an existing statewide initiative,&#xD;
      the Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI). JDAI is a juvenile justice reform&#xD;
      effort that utilizes data-driven decision-making and is implemented in almost 300 counties&#xD;
      across the US. If this project is successful, the JDAI infrastructure and support for this&#xD;
      research will inform sustainment and expansion across Indiana and the nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that ADAPT - novel LHS alliances using Cascade data to&#xD;
      implement localized solutions to YJJ receiving evidence-based addictions care - will&#xD;
      positively impact SU and recidivism outcomes over time. The investigators seek to complete&#xD;
      the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Implement LHS alliances between JJ agencies and CMHCs. The investigators will&#xD;
      establish LHS alliances: novel, collaborative partnerships between JJ agencies and CMHCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Generate and track local solutions to address gaps in the Cascade for YJJ in rural&#xD;
      Indiana counties. Quantifying local Cascade data will enable JJ agencies and CMHCs to suggest&#xD;
      and implement tailored, evidenced-based interventions, which will be tracked through LHS&#xD;
      quality improvement cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: Assess implementation outcomes and processes. We will assess implementation outcomes,&#xD;
      such as system alliance, among JJ and CHMC personnel using mixed methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 4: Assess the impact of ADAPT. Conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to assess the impact of LHS alliances on the Cascade for YJJ. We will analyze&#xD;
      administrative data linked across JJ and health systems to assess the long-term,&#xD;
      community-wide effects of ADAPT on public health and safety outcomes (e.g., lower rates of&#xD;
      SU-related outcomes and criminal recidivism).&#xD;
