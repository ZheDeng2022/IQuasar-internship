    <textblock>
      During Infection, oflfending microbes interact with the host immune system producing a&#xD;
      downstream inflammatory cascade involving cytokines and other mediators, which in turn&#xD;
      triggers a systemic response. The resultant effects linclude vasodilation, increased vascular&#xD;
      permeability, myocardial depression, and impairment of the coagulation cascade, resulting in&#xD;
      global imbalance of systemic oxygen supply and demand. During the late stage of sepsis,&#xD;
      immunosuppression predominates, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and further clinical&#xD;
      deterioration .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host&#xD;
      response to infection with two or three on Quick Sepsis-related organ failure assessment&#xD;
      score (qSOFA). Septic shock is defined as the presence of sepsis and refractory hypotension&#xD;
      to fluid management. Vasopressors are needed to maintain systolic blood pressure more than&#xD;
      90mmHg or mean blood pressure more than 65 mmHg .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental and Clinical evidence suggests that sepsis is associated with dysregulated&#xD;
      response of Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that may involve any of the steps from&#xD;
      cortisol production to cortisol use by cells .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoid therapy for the treatment of septic shock remains controversial, with&#xD;
      conflicting evidence regarding a mortality benefit. It has been used in patients with septic&#xD;
      shock who remained hypotensive after fluid and vasopressor resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludrocortisone is a corticosteroid and acts as a powerful mineralocorticoid along with some&#xD;
      additional but comparatively very weak glucocorticoid activity. Relative to cortisol, it is&#xD;
      to 10 times the glucocorticoid potency but 250 to 800 times the mineralocorticoid potency .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludrocortisone is added to hydrocortisone to provide additional mineralocorticoid potency.&#xD;
      The rationale for adding mineralocorticoid treatment is that an experimental sepsis study&#xD;
      showed marked nuclear factor NF-κB mediated down regulation of vascular mineralocorticoid&#xD;
      receptors .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids attenuate inflammation in various organs an effect partly related to&#xD;
      inhibition of nuclear factor NF-κB. Improve cardiovascular function by restoring effective&#xD;
      blood volume through increased mineralocorticoid activity and by increasing systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance through vascular α-Adrenergic responsiveness and reduces inflammation-mediated&#xD;
      vasodilation .&#xD;
