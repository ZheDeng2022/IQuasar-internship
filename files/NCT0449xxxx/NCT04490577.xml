      This study aimed to compare the effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) training and Pilates&#xD;
      exercises on physical fitness, fatigue, and physical self-perception in healthy women. This&#xD;
      study was carried out on 36 healthy sedentary female subjects. Subjects were divided into&#xD;
      three groups; Pilates training group, WBV training group, and control group. In the Pilates&#xD;
      group, the exercises were performed with &quot;Reformer速&quot; for eight weeks, twice in a week, 45-min&#xD;
      per day. In the WBV group, the training was given &quot;Power Plate速&quot; for eight weeks, twice in a&#xD;
      week, and 30 minutes in a day. The control group did not receive any training.&#xD;

      This study aimed to compare the effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) training and Pilates&#xD;
      exercises on physical fitness, fatigue, and physical self-perception in healthy women aged&#xD;
      between 25-45 years. The study was conducted between August 2018-January 2019 in a health and&#xD;
      physiotherapy clinic. This study was carried out on 36 healthy sedantary female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the study, the subjects were divided into three groups in a randomized manner&#xD;
      using &quot;Random Online Allocation Software&quot; (www.Graphpad.com)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: Pilates training group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: WBV training group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group 3: Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilates training group: The exercises were performed with &quot;Reformer速&quot; for eight weeks, twice&#xD;
      in a week, 45-min per day. Warm-up and cool-down exercises were performed before and after&#xD;
      the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WBV training group: The training was given &quot;Power Plate速&quot; for eight weeks, twice in a week,&#xD;
      and 30 minutes in a day. Warm-up and cool-down exercises were performed before and after the&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: The control group did not receive any training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body composition of the subjects was evaluated with body mass index, waist-hip ratio and&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis; functional capacity with Shuttle Run Test; core endurance&#xD;
      with lateral bridge test, modified Biering-Sorensen test, trunk flexion test and prone bridge&#xD;
      test and functional core strength with sit-ups and modified push-up tests. The stability of&#xD;
      the core muscles was also measured with a pressure biofeedback instrument. The Sit and Reach&#xD;
      test was used to assess flexibility and the Functional Reach Test was used for balance.&#xD;
      Fatigue was evaluated with The Fatigue Severity Scale and physical self-perception was&#xD;
      assessed with the Physical Self Perception Profile. The subjects were evaluated&#xD;
      pre-intervention and immediately after the intervention.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Composition Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The body composition of the subjects was evaluated with bioelectrical impedance analysis (Tanita BC 601,Tanita Corp., Maeno-Cho, Tokyo, Japan). Body fat proportion was recorded as a percentage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The body composition of the subjects was evaluated with body mass index (BMI). The BMI is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist-hip ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The body composition of the subjects was also evaluated with waist-hip ratio. The waist to hip ratio measurement is calculated by dividing the measurement of your waist by your hip measurement. The score recorded as centimeter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aerobic capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The aerobic capacity of the participants was evaluated with Shuttle-run test. Shuttle run test involve repetitive running back and forth, either over the same distance, or with changing distances. The shorter trial recorded as seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The balance was evaluated by Functional reach test. The test evaluated dynamic balance and limit of stability. This test measures the distance between the length of an outstretched arm in a maximal forward reach from a standing position,while maintaining a fixed base of support. The score recorded as centimeter. Higher scores indicate good level of balance.</description>
