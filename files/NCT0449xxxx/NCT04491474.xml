    <textblock>
      Aim Acute migraine attack is a clinical condition that is frequently encountered in emergency&#xD;
      departments and varies from patient to patient in terms of treatment modalities. There are&#xD;
      many different treatments whose effectiveness has been proven by concrete evidence(1). Drug&#xD;
      treatments applied to patients are generally given intravenously or intramuscularly.&#xD;
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, metoclopramide and intravenous magnesium therapy is&#xD;
      generally used for treatment in emergency departments (1). The effectiveness of supraorbital&#xD;
      nerve blockade and great occipital nerve blockade in migraine treatment and prophylaxis has&#xD;
      been proven in many studies(2-6). The aim of this study is to discuss the effectiveness of&#xD;
      supraorbital and great occipital nerve blockade treatments in acute migraine attack, when&#xD;
      combined or used individually.&#xD;

      Study Design The study was designed as a double-blind, prospective, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all patients who meet the International Headache Society (IHS CLASSIFICATION ICHD-3)&#xD;
      migraine with or without aura criteria will be included to the study (7). Secondary it is&#xD;
      mandatory to meet our inclusion criteria, and not to include exclusion criteria, with written&#xD;
      informed consent to be in the study. The study will be carried out with 160 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet these conditions will be randomly divided into 4 groups. First group&#xD;
      bilateral GON blockade and bilateral isotonic injection into the SON region,second group&#xD;
      bilateral SON blockade and bilateral isotonic injection into the GON region,Group 3 bilateral&#xD;
      GON blockade and bilateral SON blockade and last investigators planned to give bilateral GON&#xD;
      and SON region saline injection to group 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While performing these procedures, 1 ml of 2% lidocaine and 1 ml of saline will be used for 2&#xD;
      ml of 1% lidocaine for nerve block. Also 2 ml of saline will be used for placebo effect. For&#xD;
      blocking the GON region 0.75 ml of 1% lidocaine will be applied and 0.75 ml of saline for&#xD;
      placebo effect(8). During applying to the SON region 0.25 ml of 1% lidocaine for blockage and&#xD;
      0.25 ml of saline for placebo effect will be used(8). The GON injection site was planned to&#xD;
      be 2 cm lateral and 2 cm below the occipital protrusion and the SON injection site was&#xD;
      planned as the area with frontal incisor in the orbital arch (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up in the emergency room for 120 minutes. In the study, 1 large box&#xD;
      will be used to ensure double blindness and randomization. There will be 2 more small boxes&#xD;
      in it. Small boxes will be named as '' G '' and '' S '' containing the names of the nerve&#xD;
      regions. There will be 8 injectors in each small box. There will be 8 syringes in each small&#xD;
      box, 4 of them containing saline and 4 contains 1% lidocaine. The injectors will be numbered&#xD;
      with the name of the box in which they are located (such as G1, G2… G8 or S1, S2… S8). In the&#xD;
      study, 8 patients will be treated daily. In the following days, injector numbers will be&#xD;
      written as numbers in progress (such as G9, G10..G16 and S9, S10… S16). The contents of these&#xD;
      injectors prepared by the pharmacist will also be recorded by the pharmacist. Envelopes with&#xD;
      random number injector combinations will be offered to patients. The combination in the&#xD;
      envelope chosen by the patient will be applied. Injector numbers will be recorded to the data&#xD;
      form. When the study is finished, these numbers will be checked and it will be determined&#xD;
      which patient is given which treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>0-30th minute- 60th minute-120th minute visual analog scale pain measurements.</time_frame>
    <description>VAS (Visual Analog Scale) with 100mm length, which writes start and end points, will be used as the pain assessment scale. In this scale, 0 shows the lightest pain in the form of a straight line and 100 mm indicates the most pain. This scale will be described to the participant and asked to mark the intensity of pain on the line.&#xD;
VAS values of the participants for 0 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 120 minutes will be taken and evaluated separately. If there is no relief in the pain of the participants at the 30th minute, it is planned to administer meperidine (0.75 mcg / kg) as in similar studies as a recovery therapy(4). These patients will then be excluded from the study. Participants will be discharged after 120 minutes if they express that their pain has passed or they do not need more analgesics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assessment according to Likert type verbal scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0 minute and 120th minute</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary the participants will be asked about their responses to treatment with a scoring method from 1 to 5 according to Likert-type verbal scale, which is a verbal assessment method at 0 and 120 minutes of treatment. On this scale, they will be asked to say 1: I have a lot of pain, 2: I have a pain, 3: moderate relief, 4: I am good, 5: I am very good, and they will be asked to choose a number to evaluate their pain. This will also be recorded.</description>
