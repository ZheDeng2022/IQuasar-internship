  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study investigating whether intravenous&#xD;
      tranexamic acid has any effect on blood loss during maxillofacial trauma surgery, or the&#xD;
      subsequent postoperative sequelae. Intraoperative bleeding and postoperative ecchymosis and&#xD;
      edema are objectively rated and complications are noted.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study investigating whether intravenous&#xD;
      tranexamic acid has any effect on blood loss during maxillofacial trauma surgery, or the&#xD;
      subsequent postoperative sequelae. Intraoperative bleeding is calculated from anaesthesia&#xD;
      chart and recorded in ml. Postoperative ecchymosis and bleeding are recorded as dichotomous&#xD;
      events (yes/no) and are subjectively rated by both patient and surgeon on postoperative days&#xD;
      1and 2. Any surgical or postoperative complications are noted. Scores are aggregated for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
