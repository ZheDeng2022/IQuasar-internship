  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the characteristics of gut microbiome and metabolome in non-CF&#xD;
      bronchiectasis patients, hoping to explore the underlying mechanisms as well as the influence&#xD;
      of gut microbiota composition on bronchiectasis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease characterized by irreversible&#xD;
      and progressive dilation of the large airways, bronchi and bronchioles, which severely&#xD;
      impairs the life quality of patients and increases the social and economic burden. It is also&#xD;
      a heterogenous disease affected by multiple factors such as geography and ethnicity. The&#xD;
      incidence of bronchiectasis among the Chinese population is about 1.2%, which has clearly&#xD;
      been underestimated. However, due to the lack of awareness, the research of bronchiectasis in&#xD;
      China is still in its infancy. Colonization and recurrent infection of pathogen is the&#xD;
      primary unsolved problem in clinical practice. With the proposition of &quot;gut-lung axis&quot;&#xD;
      theory, the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases has been&#xD;
      gradually revealed. Evidences have shown that gut microbiota regulates respiratory immunity&#xD;
      via releasing soluble bacterial components and its metabolites into the circulation, as well&#xD;
      as facilitating the migration of immune cells directly to the lung. In the 1980s, a patient&#xD;
      after a colectomy has been reported to generate bronchiectasis. The most common clinical&#xD;
      manifestation of pulmonary involved IBD patients is also bronchiectasis, suggesting that the&#xD;
      &quot;gut-lung axis&quot; may be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Therefore, clarifying&#xD;
      the role and mechanism of gut microbiota in bronchiectasis and its gut microbiome is expected&#xD;
      to provide new theoretical basis and ideas for its diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
