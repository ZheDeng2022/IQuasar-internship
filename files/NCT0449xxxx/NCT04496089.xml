  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      89Zr-TLX250 is a carbonic anydrase IX (CAIX)-targeted imaging agent that is under clinical&#xD;
      development as a non-invasive diagnostic imaging agent for teh detection of clear cell renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The Phase 1 study part of this study is to confirm the&#xD;
      safety/tolerability and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in&#xD;
      subjects with suspected renal cell carcinoma (RCC) including clear cell renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      The Phase 2 component of the study is to to evaluate the sensitivity/specificity of using&#xD;
      89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT images to detect RCC and ccRCC in patients with suspected RCC.&#xD;

      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1 component of this study will be conducted in in 6-10 subjects at one study&#xD;
      center, with the objective of confirming the safety/tolerability and the whole-body dose&#xD;
      distribution of 89Zr-TLX250. 89Zr-TLX250 will be administered via a single IV injection (at&#xD;
      least 3 min) at an activity dose of 37 MBq (± 10%) and at a dose of 10 mg (±10%). After the&#xD;
      enrollment of 6 subjects, if the male-to-female ratio is different from the Japanese&#xD;
      epidemiological RCC data (male-to-female ratio ≒ 2:1 in 2017), more subjects, up to 10&#xD;
      subjects in total, are to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis will be is performed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 24, 72 h&#xD;
      and during the Day 5 ± 2 imaging visit. The dose distribution will be determined using&#xD;
      low-dose, non-contrast-enhanced CT whole body imaging at 0.5, 4, 24, 72 h and Day 5 ± 2.&#xD;
      Diagnostic images will be acquired on Day 3 and Day 5 ± 2 using whole body PET/CT-imaging&#xD;
      where individual organs will be assessed using Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days after the Day 5 ± 2 imaging visit, patients will attend a follow-up visit to&#xD;
      conduct safety evaluations and to undergo blood sampling for HACA measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 component of this study will be conducted after the completion of the phase 1&#xD;
      study in 6-10 patients. This part of the study is equivalent to a phase 2, open-label,&#xD;
      multi-center (2-5 sites) to assess the sensitivity/specificity of PET/CT images in subjects&#xD;
      with suspected but not definitely diagnosed RCC including ccRCC. The study is intended to&#xD;
      evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT test as a non-invasive test with the&#xD;
      CAIX-targeted imaging agent 89Zr-TLX250. The study will include patients who are scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo a partial or total nephrectomy. Patients with an indeterminate renal mass with the&#xD;
      longest diameter of 7cm or less, by diagnostic imaging, will receive a single administration&#xD;
      of 37 MBq (+/- 10%) 89Zr-TLX250. Imaging will then be conducted Day 5 ± 2 post&#xD;
      administration. The partial/total nephrectomy will be performed at institutional discretion&#xD;
      any time following the PET/CT imaging visit, but no later than 90 days post administration of&#xD;
      89Zr-TLX250. Histological tumour samples will be prepared and used for histological diagnosis&#xD;
      of the renal mass (ccRCC or non-ccRCC) read by a central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image data analyses will be performed by a central image core lab. Qualitative visual&#xD;
      analysis (presence or absence of localised 89Zr-TLX250 uptake inside or in vicinity of renal&#xD;
      lesion, as seen on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI), will be used to assess test performance or&#xD;
      89Zr-TLX-250 PET/CT imaging to non-invasively detect ccRCC, using histological results from&#xD;
      the central histological reference laboratory as standard of truth.&#xD;
