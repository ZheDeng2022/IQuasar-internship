  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed clinical trial, Adherence Connection for Counseling,&#xD;
      Education, and Support (ACCESS)-II, is to test the efficacy of ACCESS-II on antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment (ART) adherence and HIV-viral load in Black and Hispanic HIV-infected (HIV+)&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults (AYA), ages 18-29 years (N=120) using a longitudinal (12 and 24&#xD;
      week outcomes), two-group, randomized control trial (RCT). Participants in the intervention&#xD;
      condition will use videoconferencing to connect synchronously with trained HIV+ peer health&#xD;
      coaches who will deliver eight weekly, 60-minute cognitive behavioral/motivational sessions&#xD;
      for improved ART adherence. Participants in the control will connect asynchronously to a&#xD;
      web-based HIV ART adherence education condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve these aims, a longitudinal (12 and 24- week study outcomes), two-group, randomized&#xD;
      control trial (RCT) is proposed in a sample population of 120 perinatally and behaviorally,&#xD;
      HIV-infected youth (ages 18-29 years). Participants in the intervention condition will use&#xD;
      videoconferencing to connect synchronously with trained HIV+ peer health coaches who will&#xD;
      deliver eight weekly, 60-minute cognitive behavioral47-50 motivational18 sessions for&#xD;
      improved ART adherence. Participants in the control will connect asynchronously to a&#xD;
      web-based HIV ART adherence education condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will access the intervention and control conditions outside of the&#xD;
      clinical setting using study funded smart phones. Self-reported adherence and viral load&#xD;
      (extracted from the medical records) of study participants will be measured, and uploaded to&#xD;
      RedCAP. ART knowledge, adherence self-efficacy, HIV stigma, social support, psychological&#xD;
      distress, and substance use will be measured using survey measures. Statistical analyses will&#xD;
      be computed to assess the potential impact of ACCESS on adherence and HIV viral suppression,&#xD;
      and will also be computed to assess changes in ART knowledge, adherence self-efficacy, HIV&#xD;
      stigma, social support, psychological distress, and substance use among participants in both&#xD;
      the intervention and control conditions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The ACCESS II RCT uses a two group, parallel, longitudinal study design. Participants will be randomized to the ACCESS synchronous peer intervention or the asynchronous web-based HIV ART adherence control. Block randomization will be used; the randomization scheme will be developed by the biostatistician and implemented in Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to ensure that assignment to treatment condition is evenly distributed within each site.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported ART adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Days</time_frame>
    <description>3-day self-report of ART adherence will be collected to describe subjective adherence behavior. Investigators will compute an average missed dose calculation: # of doses missed divided by total number of prescribed doses over the past 3 days. (scores range from 0 to 100%; higher scores = better adherence )</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in serum HIV RNA quantitative viral load</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured to eliminate the potential for social desirability bias associated with self-reported adherence. Viral load data will be extracted from the medical records of participants at baseline (pre-intervention), and 12 and 24-weeks. In cases where a visit does not include a biological assessment of HIV viral load, we will use the most recent assessment in the medical record (within two-weeks of the visit)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knowledge about ART</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the HIV Treatment Knowledge Scale: This 21-item instrument uses true and false questions to assess knowledge of adherence, side effects and antiretroviral resistance (scores range from 0-21; higher scores = increased knowledge).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in HIV stigma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the HIV Stigma Scale. 40 item questionnaire. Items are scored as follows: strongly disagree = 1 disagree = 2 agree = 3 strongly agree = 4. The range of possible scores depends on the number of items in the scale. For the total HIV Stigma Scale, scores can range from 40 to 160 [1 x 40 items to 4 x 40 items]. For the personalized stigma subscale, scores can range from 18 to 72. For the disclosure subscale, scores can range from 10 to 40. For the negative self-image subscale, scores can range from 13 to 52. For the public attitudes subscale, scores can range from 20 to 80.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psychological Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). This measure contains nine primary symptom subscales (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism) and three indices (global severity, depression, and anxiety). The test is a 53-item self report scale that uses the 5 point Likert scale. Respondents rank each item on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). A higher score indicates higher Psychological Distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Social support and isolation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) iTech short measure of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measure Information System (PROMIS) Social Relationship scales. The ATN short measure is a 20-item tool which uses a 5-point Likert scale with total possible composite scores of 25 to 125; higher scores suggest increased social support and decreased isolation. This measure assesses five domains of social support: emotional, informational, instrumental, companionship, and isolation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Substance use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble) a 6-item measure designed for use in clinical settings. Two or more YES answers suggest a serious problem and need for further assessment.</description>
