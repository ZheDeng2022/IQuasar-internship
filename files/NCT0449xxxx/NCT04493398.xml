      Background: To effectively disrupt microbial biofilm and remove dental calculus with minimal&#xD;
      damage to the root surface and soft tissues with limited patient discomfort constitute a&#xD;
      significant tenet of periodontal therapy. The aim of the present prospective 12-month study&#xD;
      was to compare clinical and microbiological effects following an erythritol air-polishing vs.&#xD;
      conventional mechanical debridement of furcation defects in a cohort of periodontal&#xD;
      maintenance patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twenty patients with grade II mandibular molar furcation defects volunteered to&#xD;
      enroll in this study. In a split-mouth design, two furcation sites in each patient were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either receive subgingival debridement using erythritol air-polishing&#xD;
      (test) or conventional ultrasonic/curette debridement (control) at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months. Probing depth, clinical attachment level and bleeding on probing were recorded&#xD;
      at 3-month intervals. Subgingival microbiological samples obtained at baseline, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months were analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Discomfort from treatment was&#xD;
      scored at 12 months using a visual analogue scale.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION.Traditionally, periodontal debridement is accomplished using curettes, sonic or&#xD;
      ultrasonic scalers, all presenting comparable outcomes.1,2 However, periodic root&#xD;
      instrumentation may lead to dental hard tissue3-6 and soft tissue damage,7 and sensitivity&#xD;
      due to exposure of dentinal tubules.8-10 Air-polishing using low abrasive glycine or&#xD;
      trehalose powder has been shown to reach similar clinical outcomes as hand and ultrasonic&#xD;
      instrumentation, but with less hard tissue loss.11-16 Moreover, air-polishing provides&#xD;
      superior outcomes relative to patient comfort and time efficiency.7,11,12,14 Recently, a low&#xD;
      abrasive erythritol powder with comparable physical properties to glycine air-polishing&#xD;
      powder was introduced for subgingival air-polishing.17 Erythritol, a non-toxic, chemically&#xD;
      neutral and completely water-soluble polyol is widely used in food industry as an artificial&#xD;
      sweetener. Two studies comparing conventional mechanical debridement with erythritol&#xD;
      air-polishing, reported similar results in supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) relative to&#xD;
      clinical and microbiological outcomes.18,19 Such observations are also reflected in a&#xD;
      systematic review concluding that air-polishing systems as a monotherapy are comparable to&#xD;
      conventional therapy in patients undergoing SPT in single- and multi-rooted teeth without&#xD;
      furcations.20 Moreover, inhibitory effects on pathogenic bacteria including Porphyromonas&#xD;
      gingivalis have also been observed.21 To the investigator's knowledge, no prospective studies&#xD;
      investigating the efficacy of a low abrasive erythritol air-polishing system in molar&#xD;
      furcation defects during SPT have been reported. The objective of this 12-month prospective&#xD;
      study was to compare clinical and microbiological effects following an erythritol&#xD;
      air-polishing system vs. conventional mechanical debridement of furcation defects in a cohort&#xD;
      of periodontal maintenance patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD AND MATERIALS. The study protocol and informed consent following the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration of 1975 (version 2008) was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (2016/793), University of Bergen, Norway. Participating subjects read and signed the informed&#xD;
      consent prior to enrolling in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prestudy calibration and training. Two operators performed the clinical aspects of this&#xD;
      study. Author TS, masked to treatment assignments, performed all clinical recordings and&#xD;
      sampling, author IU performed all treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. The sample size estimation was based on change in PD. A difference of 0.5 mm was&#xD;
      considered clinically relevant.22 Standard deviation of the difference between repeated PD&#xD;
      measurements from the intra-calibration exercise was 0.5 mm. A power analysis based on 20&#xD;
      subjects and with the level of significance (α) set to 0.05, resulted in 98.9% power to&#xD;
      detect a true difference of 0.5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments. Following baseline examination, mandibular jaw quadrants were randomized (coin&#xD;
      toss) to either receive debridement using the erythritol powder/air-polishing system (test)&#xD;
      or conventional ultrasonic/curette instrumentation (control) using a split-mouth study&#xD;
      design. Sequence of treatments was randomized in a similar fashion. Treatments were delivered&#xD;
      at baseline, and repeated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Test sites thus received root debridement&#xD;
      using the low abrasive erythritol powder (Air-flow powder plus®, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland )&#xD;
      applied through a Perio-Flow hand piece connected to an airflow unit (Air-Flow Master®, EMS,&#xD;
      Nyon, Switzerland). The hand piece was fitted with a nozzle for subgingival delivery&#xD;
      directing the power/air jet perpendicular to the root surface at the water exit at the tip of&#xD;
      the nozzle. The nozzle was inserted to the apical aspect of furcation sites with PD≥ 4 mm&#xD;
      using striking movements over the furcation area for 5 sec.12 Sites adjoining the test site&#xD;
      with PD≥ 4 mm were similarly treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control sites were debrided using an ultrasonic scaler (Piezon Master 400 Perio Slim Tip®;&#xD;
      Electro Medical System, Nyon, Switzerland) with power set at 75% and water as coolant, and&#xD;
      root planed with sharp curettes (Gracey SAS, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were returned to their regular SPT upon completion of study. Gingival crevicular&#xD;
      fluid assessments. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was recorded at baseline, and at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months. Briefly, furcation sites were isolated with cottons rolls, cleaned for supragingival&#xD;
      plaque, and air-dried. A perio paper strip was then placed 1-2 mm into the orifice of the&#xD;
      site and left in place for 30 sec. Next, the perio strip was inserted into the Periotron&#xD;
      8000® (Oraflow, Smithtown, NY, USA) calibrated to estimate the volume of GCF collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological assessments. At baseline, and at 6 and 12 months the supragingival area above&#xD;
      the furcation site was wiped clean using sterile cotton pellets. Three sterile paper points&#xD;
      were then inserted into the pocket of the furcation site. The paper points were kept in place&#xD;
      20 sec27 removed and immersed into pre-reduced, anaerobic transport medium (PRAS; Dental&#xD;
      Transport Medium, Morgan Hill, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain experience assessments. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were used to estimate patient&#xD;
      discomfort experienced during test and control treatment.31 Scoring was performed at 12&#xD;
      months following completion of the debridement with 0=&quot;no pain&quot; and 100=&quot;worst pain I can&#xD;
      imagine&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data were entered into MS-Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA ) proofed&#xD;
      for errors and then imported into Stata, version 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics (means ± SEM) for the clinical variables were calculated for the test and&#xD;
      control at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months. Due to the repeated nature of data, a mixed&#xD;
      effect model taking into consideration incomplete data at 12 months was applied to analyze&#xD;
      the data at patient and tooth level. Time and treatment were considered fixed factors. Mixed&#xD;
      models were applied for both primary and secondary outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For testing differences in microbial composition at test and control sites harboring&#xD;
      different proportions of bacteria &gt;105 at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months, logistic&#xD;
      regression models with robust standard error were applied. VAS scores were analyzed using&#xD;
      ordinary linear regression models with robust standard error. The level of significance was&#xD;
      set at 0.05.&#xD;
