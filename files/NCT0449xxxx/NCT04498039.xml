      This study sought to examine the effect of targeted physical therapy with and without cranial&#xD;

      exhibited a dysfunctional gait.&#xD;

      Background: This study sought to examine the effect of targeted physical therapy with and&#xD;
      without cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation (CN-NINM), on the walking ability of&#xD;
      people with MS who exhibited a dysfunctional gait. The investigators hypothesized that&#xD;
      subjects who received electrical stimulation would have greater improvement than those who&#xD;
      had a control device after a 14-week intervention. Gait disturbance is a common problem for&#xD;
      people with multiple sclerosis (MS). The investigators have developed an effective&#xD;
      rehabilitative strategy using neuromodulation of the cranial nerves via electrical&#xD;
      stimulation of the tongue to enhance the plasticity of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study is a within-subject blinded randomized control design. Twenty chronic MS&#xD;
      subjects with an identified gait disturbance were assigned to either an active or control&#xD;
      group. Both groups completed a 14-week intervention program using a standardized combination&#xD;
      of exercise and a device that provided electrical stimulation to the tongue. Those in the&#xD;
      active group received electrical stimulation on the tongue that they could perceive. Those in&#xD;
      the control group used a device that did not provide a physiologically significant stimulus&#xD;
      and was not perceivable. Subjects were assessed with the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI).&#xD;

    <description>The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) is a clinician-scored index of 8 gait tasks which was developed as a clinical tool for assessing gait, balance, and fall risk by evaluating dynamic balance. Tasks include steady state walking, changing speeds while walking, walking with horizontal and vertical head turns, walking around and stepping over objects, walking to a pivot turn and stop, and traversing stairs. The maximum total individual score is 24 points (0-3 on each task), with higher scores indicating better function. A 4-point change in DGI would require an improvement of at least one level on four of 8 tasks, or multiple levels of improvement on several tasks. Thus, a 4-point change represents a clinically significant difference that is generally measurable without excessive variability.</description>

    <description>Electrical stimulation to the tongue is delivered via the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS™) device . The PoNS™ device is held in place lightly by the lips and teeth around a rectangular tab that goes into the mouth and rests on the anterior, superior part of the tongue.
