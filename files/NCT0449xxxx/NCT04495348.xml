  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight gain following antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation occurs with all modern&#xD;
      regimens. Recent real-world reports suggest that integrase strand transfer inhibitor&#xD;
      (INSTI)-based ART may be associated with excess weight gain compared to other regimens.&#xD;
      Weight gain appears to occur regardless of baseline weight, and is most pronounced among&#xD;
      women and minorities, often those at highest risk of obesity-associated comorbidities. INSTI-&#xD;
      and TAF-based regimens are now preferred regimens for most persons according to the&#xD;
      Department of Health and Human Services ART-Treatment Guidelines. As a result, there is an&#xD;
      urgent need to understand the underlying mechanisms for this weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to understand the changes in energy balance that occur with changes in ART.&#xD;
      Participants with HIV who have experienced &gt;10% weight gain on INSTI (bictegravir or&#xD;
      dolutegravir-based therapy) will be switched to doravirine for 12 weeks, and then back to&#xD;
      their prior INSTI regimen, allowing for assessment of changes in metabolic parameters with&#xD;
      drug withdrawal and reintroduction (with no change to NRTI-backbone). Twenty-four hour energy&#xD;
      balance will be measured on both regimens during a 24-hour stay using a whole room indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry, with a standardized diet. Ultimately, the investigator's goal is to understand&#xD;
      the mechanisms of weight gain so that future interventions can most effectively mitigate&#xD;
      ART-associated weight changes.&#xD;
