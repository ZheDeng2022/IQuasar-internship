  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and study aims Depression is more prevalent in younger populations. The age of&#xD;
      first onset of depression has become younger, yet many adolescents with depressive symptoms&#xD;
      remain untreated. Rates of anxiety and depression are increasing among children and young&#xD;
      people.postsecondary education also represents a peak onset period for the occurrence of&#xD;
      mental disorders. It is estimated that 12-46% of all university students are affected by&#xD;
      mental health disorders in any given year. Who can participate? Afghan students over 18 years&#xD;
      old fluent in Persian or Pashto, and access to an internet connection. What does the study&#xD;
      involve? Participants will be randomly allocated to receive training in skills and coping&#xD;
      strategies which are useful in stressful conditions.&#xD;

      Condition Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptom, emotional problems Interventions Participants&#xD;
      in experimental group Receive 12 weeks training according to the guideline below Participants&#xD;
      in control Receive treatment as usual, also the experts will respond to their questions. The&#xD;
      unified protocol can track its basis from cognitive-behavioral therapy approaches. As in the&#xD;
      traditional CBT approaches, the unified protocol has several modules whose base is the&#xD;
      emotions . The modules focus on increasing awareness of interaction and the function of the&#xD;
      model of emotion components which include thoughts, physical sensations, and behaviors. The&#xD;
      final bit of the unified protocol is to change the components to a present moment awareness.&#xD;
      The unified protocol is used to treat different emotional disorders unlike the traditional&#xD;
      CBT approaches. This is done by targeting the underlying mechanisms that form part of all&#xD;
      emotional disorders. The 5 core skills above are delivered to patients through five core&#xD;
      modules. Before the key modules, there are 2 modules for introduction and learning about&#xD;
      emotions. After the 5 core modules there is a module for treatment progress appraisal and&#xD;
      making plans to prevent relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unified protocol modules are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Module 1: Setting the treatment goals and motivation augmentation Module 2: Using&#xD;
      psychoeducation to learn the function of emotions and their development Module 3: Mindful&#xD;
      (present-focused and non-judgmental) emotional awareness- Core module Module 4: Cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility- Core module Module 5: Identifying and countering emotional avoidance behaviors-&#xD;
      core module Module 6: Increasing awareness and confronting physical sensations/ interoceptive&#xD;
      sensitivity- core module Module 7: Both situational and interoceptive emotion-focused&#xD;
      exposures- Core module Module 8: Recognizing accomplishments and looking to the future&#xD;
      (relapse prevention) Primary outcome measure&#xD;

    <description>This is a 21-item self-report questionnaire for the measurement of anxiety symptoms experienced during the past week. Each item is rated from 0 to 3 (i.e. not at all, mildly, moderately, severely), added together to obtain a maximum score of 63. The BAI has demonstrated good to excellent internal consistency in prior validations of the scale (.85-.94), as well as adequate convergent and divergent validity . Cronbach's alpha for the BAI in the present study was excellent</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>he OASIS is a 5-item self-report scale that evaluates the frequency and severity of anxiety symptoms, the functional impairment related to these symptoms (i.e. school, work, home, or social impairment), and behavioral avoidance. Each item instructs respondents to endorse one of five responses that best describes their experiences over the past week. Response items are coded from 0 to 4, added together to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 20. Previous studies have shown high internal consistency.</description>

    <description>.The Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS; Bentley et al., 2014) is a 5-item self-report measure that was designed for assessing the frequency and intensity of depression symptoms, the functional impairment related to these depressive symptoms, as well as behavioral avoidance across emotional disorders. Each item of the ODSIS instructs respondents to endorse one of five responses that best describes their experiences over the past week. Response items are coded from 0 to 4 and can be summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 20.</description>

    <description>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS-16) consists of 16 items that assess the following dimensions of emotion regulation difficulties: nonacceptance of negative emotions (three items), inability to engage in goal-directed behaviors when distressed (three items), difficulties controlling impulsive behaviors when distressed (three items), limited access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective (five items), and lack of emotional clarity (two items). As with the original DERS, respondents rate the extent to which each item applies to them on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always).
