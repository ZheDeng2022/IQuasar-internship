  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dislocation after THA usually occurs early after surgery and some go on to disabling&#xD;
      recurrent dislocations . The posterior surgical approach is frequently used since it provides&#xD;
      excellent exposure of both acetabulum and femur. However, many series on primary THA have&#xD;
      reported that dislocation is 2 to 3 times more frequent after the posterior approach as&#xD;
      compared to other approaches . Dissatisfaction with these dislocation rates resulted in the&#xD;
      introduction of different posterior soft tissue repair techniques. Many authors have reported&#xD;
      statistically significant differences in dislocation rates with posterior soft tissue repair&#xD;
      as compared to without . However, there is still a concern in the literature regarding the&#xD;
      durability of posterior soft tissue repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study was to analyse THA patients with posterior soft tissue repair in terms&#xD;
      of suture durability of two different suture materials and time of suture failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 42 consecutive THA patients (20 women,22 men) operated for primary osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (OA) between 2018 and 2019 were included in the study. All patients were operated by the same&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeon under spinal anaesthesia via posterior approach using the same type of&#xD;
      uncemented Polar stem(Smith and Nephew Inc) with 36 mm head in combination with uncemented&#xD;
      Ep-Fit acetabular cup (Smith and Nephew Inc). All the patients were randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups. The randomization process was done by the odd and even number technique in which the&#xD;
      patients with even inpatient numbers were assigned in Group A while the odd inpatient number&#xD;
      patients were allotted in Group B. Patients in whom number 5 Ethibond Excel(Ethicon,&#xD;
      Somerville, NJ) were used for soft tissue repair were included in Group A (n=22), whereas&#xD;
      patients treated with number 2 Vicryl (Ethicon, Somerville,NJ)were in Group B (n=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short external rotators tendons were released from the greater trochanter just at their&#xD;
      insertion point. The capsule was incised, but not excised. The posterior repair included&#xD;
      reattaching the piriformis,conjoined tendons and the capsule to the greater trochanter at the&#xD;
      insertion point through 2, 2 mm drill holes with 2 stitches with non-absorbable no.5 Ethibond&#xD;
      suture in one group and with absorbable no 2 vicryl suture in the other group after the&#xD;
      prosthesis had been implanted and the joint reduced. One hemoclip was attached to the&#xD;
      piriformis tendon and another to the conjoined tendons before pulling the sutures out of the&#xD;
      drill holes in the trochanter. The suture materials lateral to the drill holes at the&#xD;
      trochanter were also attached with two hemoclips.(fig 1-2) The postoperative regimen included&#xD;
      walking with full weight bearing the next day after the surgery with a walking frame and&#xD;
      without limitations in internal rotation or flexion. Anteroposterior radiographic examination&#xD;
      was undertaken immediately after the patients returned from the operating theatre to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit,at the 15th day, at 3 months and 6 months postoperatively (figure 3). The&#xD;
      detachment of the hemoclips were measured during the follow up period.&#xD;
