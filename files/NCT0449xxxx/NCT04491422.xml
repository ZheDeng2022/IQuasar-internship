  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transgender women (trans women; assigned male sex at birth but identify as female) are at&#xD;
      high risk for HIV infection, and are an important, under-researched population in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa. Trans women have a 13 times greater risk of acquiring HIV than adults aged 15-49&#xD;
      years in the general population, and in Africa, trans women have nearly twice the HIV&#xD;
      prevalence (25%) of men who have sex with men [MSM] (14%). Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP) is an effective prevention tool that could change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic&#xD;
      among the 25 million trans women globally, yet its use has been suboptimal in this vulnerable&#xD;
      population. Same-day PrEP initiation is feasible and acceptable and improves retention in&#xD;
      PrEP care in resource-rich settings. Same-day initiation of emtricitabine/tenofovir&#xD;
      alafenamide (F/TAF), a new PrEP regimen, has not to our knowledge previously been evaluated&#xD;
      as PrEP in African trans women. F/TAF is potentially more efficacious and safer than&#xD;
      emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (F/TDF) as shown in the recent DISCOVER trial.&#xD;
      However, concerns about drug-drug interactions between feminizing hormonal therapy (FHT) and&#xD;
      PrEP are a key potential adherence barrier for trans women. While PrEP drugs do not lower FHT&#xD;
      levels, FHT decreases plasma TFV and (emtricitabine) FTC levels. Little is known about FHT&#xD;
      use among African trans women taking F/TAF or how concerns about F/TAF-FHT interactions may&#xD;
      influence PrEP adherence. Moreover, interventions to support PrEP adherence in this&#xD;
      population are needed. Feedback about PrEP use has been shown to potentially improve PrEP&#xD;
      adherence among MSM but has not been utilized among trans women. Key knowledge gaps include:&#xD;
      1) whether same-day PrEP can be successfully implemented for African trans women, 2) the&#xD;
      impact of drug-level feedback on PrEP adherence, and 3) how use of FHT may influence PrEP&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these questions, this protocol describes a randomized trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of same day initiation of F/TAF PrEP, evaluate impact of&#xD;
      drug-level feedback on PrEP adherence and characterize PrEP persistence, and in-depth&#xD;
      interviews to explore how self-care interventions for sexual health influence prevention&#xD;
      choices among trans women and their sexual partners. This will be the first clinical trial,&#xD;
      to our knowledge, to evaluate F/TAF as PrEP for HIV-negative trans women in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of same-day&#xD;
      F/TAF initiation and characterize F/TAF persistence among trans women taking PrEP. This&#xD;
      research will be conducted at the Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University in&#xD;
      Kampala, Uganda and consists of 3 complementary aims. In Aims 1 and 2, the investigators will&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of same-day F/TAF initiation and characterize PrEP&#xD;
      persistence. In Aim 3, the investigators will use qualitative methods to explore how&#xD;
      self-care interventions for sexual health influence prevention choices among trans women and&#xD;
      their sexual partners. Study subjects will be accrued using respondent driven sampling (RDS)&#xD;
      and enrolled at the study clinic where F/TAF will be initiated same day. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention arm (quarterly integrated next steps&#xD;
      counseling [iNSC] using point-of-care [POC] urine tenofovir [TFV] levels) or the control arm&#xD;
      (standard adherence counseling without drug level feedback). In Aim 3, the investigators will&#xD;
      use qualitative methods to explore how self-care interventions for sexual health influence&#xD;
      prevention choices among trans women and their sexual partners. The overall goal will be to&#xD;
      assess whether POC urine testing and iNSC counseling increase PrEP uptake and persistence&#xD;
      over 12 months. This study for trans women is guided by the cardinal ethical principles of&#xD;
      justice, respect for persons and beneficence. The local trans community will be involved in&#xD;
      study design and implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 : Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of same-day F/TAF PrEP initiation among&#xD;
      African trans women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: The investigators will recruit up to 200 trans women. All study participants who&#xD;
      meet study eligibility criteria will be consented and enrolled at the study clinic.&#xD;
      Randomization will occur through REDCap. Participants will start PrEP on the day of&#xD;
      enrollment and receive F/TAF for 12 months. Free HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI)&#xD;
      testing and treatment will be provided to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 : Characterize F/TAF persistence and test the impact of drug level feedback among&#xD;
      African trans women taking PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Using a factorial design within the Aim 1 study, all F/TAF users will be randomized&#xD;
      to real-time drug level feedback and adherence counseling using a POC urine TFV lateral-flow&#xD;
      immunoassay versus standard counseling alone. Socio-behavioral surveys will assess potential&#xD;
      factors influencing adherence, including gender dysphoria and FHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 : Explore how self-care interventions for sexual health influence HIV/STI prevention&#xD;
      choices among African trans women and their sexual partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: To clarify how same-day PrEP initiation, FHT use and self-collection of samples&#xD;
      (SCS) for STI testing may influence prevention choices, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      in-depth interviews with participants and their sexual partners to assess perceptions and&#xD;
      experiences with same-day PrEP, real-time drug level feedback, use of FHT, SCS, and how&#xD;
      self-care interventions could empower trans women to engage in prevention services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Same-day PrEP initiation will be a feasible and acceptable entryway into PrEP&#xD;
      care among trans women.&#xD;
