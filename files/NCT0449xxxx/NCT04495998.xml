  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to contribute to the knowledge of the relationship between Motor Neurological Soft&#xD;
      Signs (MNSS) and schizophrenia, as well as to point out the implications and recommendations&#xD;
      for clinical and rehabilitative practices, in order to contribute to the identification of&#xD;
      these signs as potential facilitators of prevention and a better follow-up in the&#xD;
      psychosocial rehabilitation processes of the person with schizophrenia.&#xD;

      The aim is to contribute to the knowledge of the relationship between Motor Neurological Soft&#xD;
      Signs (MNSS) and schizophrenia, as well as to point out the implications and recommendations&#xD;
      for clinical and rehabilitative practices, in order to contribute to the identification of&#xD;
      these signs as potential facilitators of prevention and a better follow-up in the&#xD;
      psychosocial rehabilitation processes of the person with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore important to answer the following starting questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How can MNSS be assessed and analysed in the Portuguese population with schizophrenia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How does the manifestation of MNSS differ between people with and without schizophrenia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do the MNSS of people with schizophrenia vary according to their functionality level&#xD;
           including the following areas of activity (Cognition, Mobility, Self-Care, Interpersonal&#xD;
           Relations, Daily Activities and Participation) and their motor experiences?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How can the information obtained by applying a validated assessment tool for this&#xD;
           purpose be made operational as a procedure for psychomotor assessment and intervention&#xD;
           with this population?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following objectives have been defined to answer these questions, which guide the work:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Translate, adapt and validate the BMS instrument (Jahn et al., 2006) for the Portuguese&#xD;
           population with schizophrenia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the relationship of MNSS with demographic variables (e.g.: age, gender,&#xD;
           education), clinical-therapeutic variables (e.g.: age of diagnosis, number of&#xD;
           hospitalizations, medication, type of support) and psychosocial variables (e.g.:&#xD;
           functionality, satisfaction and well-being, motor experiences);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test a multifactorial model of the relationships between MNSS, demographic variables,&#xD;
           functional clinical-therapeutic and psychosocial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare MNSS in people with schizophrenia and people from a healthy control group.&#xD;

    <description>The aim of this study was to translate, adapt and validate a Portuguese version of the Brief Motor Scale (BMS_pt) in people with schizophrenia (Jahn et al, 2006).&#xD;
The participants (N=43) were evaluated twice with an interval of two weeks. In total, the sample collection lasted 6 weeks.&#xD;
Scale used and caracteristics:&#xD;
Unabbreviate title - Brief Motor Scale - Portuguese version Abbreviate title - BMS_pt Minimum value = 0; Maximum value = 2 Higher scores mean a worse outcome.&#xD;
Scale description:&#xD;
BMS_pt is a quantative test, which assessed motor neurological soft signs (MNSS) in two domains: motor coordination and motor sequencing. BMS_pt have a range score between 0 and 2 points for each item, domains and total score.</description>
