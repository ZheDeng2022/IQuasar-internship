    <textblock>
      Objectives: Evaluation of endodontic treatment success is largely based on radiographical&#xD;
      assessment of anatomical and treatment-related parameters of teeth with apical periodontitis&#xD;
      (AP). This study aimed to analyse 2-year treatment outcomes of teeth with AP based on&#xD;
      radiographical changes, and to evaluate prognostic validity of Periapical and Endodontic&#xD;
      Status Scale (PESS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: 128 patients (176 teeth) were examined by cone-beam computed&#xD;
      tomography at baseline and in 24 months after endodontic treatment. Treatment outcome was&#xD;
      evaluated using estimates of periapical radiolucencies in size, relation with anatomical&#xD;
      structures and location. Strength of associations between these and treatment-related&#xD;
      parameters was tested by logistic regression analysis. Predictive validity of PESS was&#xD;
      verified by estimating association between treatment risk groups defined at baseline and&#xD;
      negative outcome.&#xD;

      Study sample The study participants were adult patients, admitted for general oral&#xD;
      rehabilitation to Vilnius Implantology Center, Lithuania, and referred for treatment to a&#xD;
      specialist in endodontics during the period December 2016 - December 2019. A total of 140&#xD;
      patients, with 200 teeth with AP, were invited to participate in the study. Ten patients were&#xD;
      excluded according to the inclusion criteria, and 2 patients declined to participate.&#xD;
      Finally, 128 patients with 176 teeth with AP, agreed to participate in this study. The mean&#xD;
      age of the participants was 46 years, range 18-70 years, (SD =12.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no systemic diseases present;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at least one tooth with the diagnosis of AP (necrotic pulp and/or filled root canals)&#xD;
           present;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sufficient periodontal support (absence of clinical periodontal inflammation on an&#xD;
           anatomically intact or, on a reduced periodontium of the teeth indicated for treatment);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline CBCT images available (performed for general oral rehabilitation planning&#xD;
           purposes, no earlier than one month prior to endodontic procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of apical periodontitis was based on the clinical tests of pulp vitality&#xD;
      (sensitivity to heat and cold), percussion, palpation, presence of abnormal bite, swelling,&#xD;
      caries, sinus tracts, of unstimulated/stimulated pain, and on the radiological findings. A&#xD;
      total of 176 teeth (403 root canals) were subjected to endodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women, immunosuppressed patients, and patients presenting with un-restorable teeth&#xD;
      (e.g., deep root caries lesion, coronal cracks, root fracture) or, with the probing depths &gt;5&#xD;
      mm around the marginal bone were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants gave written informed consent to be involved in the clinical trial. The&#xD;
      study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Biomedical studies, Lithuania&#xD;
      (Protocol No 111; 10.03.2016; edition No BE-2-27; 20.12.2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiographic examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients were examined clinically and radiographically at baseline, and in 24&#xD;
      months (further on, referred as &quot;2 years&quot;) after endodontic treatment. The intermediate&#xD;
      follow-up examinations were set at 12 months' time point, however, only the final study&#xD;
      results are discussed in the present report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical examinations were performed by one examiner (JG) and included standard tests&#xD;
      such as percussion, palpation, evaluation of coronal seal, of tooth mobility and of the&#xD;
      periodontal probing depth. All diagnostic procedures were performed in a dental chair using a&#xD;
      dental mirror and explorer (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). The case history&#xD;
      (presence of clinical symptoms, complaints, the time of the previous treatment) was obtained&#xD;
      from every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographical examinations of the patients were performed with CBCT imaging, and with&#xD;
      digital radiography. For the present study purposes, only CBCT data were included in the&#xD;
      analysis. The baseline CBCT images were already available following the general diagnostic&#xD;
      and treatment plan. The follow-up CBCT was performed in 2 years after the endodontic&#xD;
      treatment, only for the respective maxillary or mandibular arch. All images were made with&#xD;
      i-CAT scanner (Imaging Sciences International Inc., Hatfield, PA, USA), the exposure&#xD;
      parameters were as follows: 84 kV, 5 mA, 0.3 mm voxel resolution, 6x16 and 6x6 cm field of&#xD;
      view, 18.3s and 5s acquisition time at baseline and at the final examination, respectively.&#xD;
      The CBCT images were viewed as an original i-Cat presentation (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA) on&#xD;
      the computers with a 27-inch flat panel display with a pixel resolution of 2.560 x 1.440 with&#xD;
      dimmed ambient light, less than 50 lux, without time restrictions. A total of 256 (128&#xD;
      baseline and 128 follow up) CBCT images were coded and analyzed by the same examiner (JG),&#xD;
      without knowledge of the clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographical assessment of the periapical status of the teeth was performed following&#xD;
      the Periapical and Endodontic Status Scale (PESS).&#xD;
