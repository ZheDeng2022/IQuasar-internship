      Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) reduce the risks of neonatal death and morbidities, such as&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care for women at risk of preterm birth includes 2 doses of 12 mg betamethasone&#xD;
      (for a total of 24 mg) to accelerate fetal lung maturity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to conduct a pilot clinical trial to determine the feasibility of a trial comparing&#xD;
      half the usual dose (total 12 mg) of betamethasone to the standard double dose (total 24 mg)&#xD;
      of betamethasone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at risk of mortality and morbidity. Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS)&#xD;
      reduce the risks of neonatal death and morbidities, such as respiratory distress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care for women at risk of preterm birth includes 2 doses of 12 mg betamethasone&#xD;
      (for a total of 24 mg) to accelerate fetal lung maturity. There are no published clinical&#xD;
      trial data on the benefits or risks of a single dose of antenatal corticosteroid vs. standard&#xD;
      double doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot trials are now viewed as an &quot;almost essential prerequisite&quot; to large, expensive, full&#xD;
      scale studies. Thus, we plan to conduct a pilot clinical trial to determine the feasibility&#xD;
      of a trial comparing half the usual dose (12 mg of betamethasone + placebo) to the standard&#xD;
      double dose (12 mg + 12 mg of betamethasone), as well as the feasibility of the study&#xD;
      protocol. Secondary outcomes will include process outcomes, clinical outcomes, maternal&#xD;
      experiences, and provider outcomes.&#xD;
