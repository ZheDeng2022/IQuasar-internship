  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention being studied is a 12-week nutrition and physical activity intervention,&#xD;
      delivered using videoconference technology by registered dietitian clinicians to maintain&#xD;
      weight loss and functional gains in older adults who successfully completed a weight loss&#xD;
      intervention. The &quot;Legacy Intervention&quot; will include cognitive behavioral strategies (e.g.,&#xD;
      goal setting, self-monitoring, and social support), and draw upon a toolbox of e-approaches,&#xD;
      including daily and weekly text reminders, virtual exercise classes, virtual individual and&#xD;
      group nutrition classes, and step tracking device.&#xD;
