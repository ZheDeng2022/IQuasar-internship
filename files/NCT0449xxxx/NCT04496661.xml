  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) has been associated with severe impairments, primarily related to&#xD;
      activities of daily living, functional ability and quality of life. A multimodal approach to&#xD;
      pain management, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and peripheral&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (PES), may improve outcomes in chronic LBP. However, the optimal&#xD;
      cerebral target for stimulation still remains controversial. This pilot trial aims to&#xD;
      investigate whether active stimulation could promote additional gains to the PES results in&#xD;
      LBP participants. The secondary objective is to investigate whether the stimulation of&#xD;
      primary motor cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex results in distinct clinical effects&#xD;
      for the participants involved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this, a pilot, sham-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in accordance&#xD;
      with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)&#xD;
      guidelines. Sixty participants with chronic low back pain will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      three tDCS groups associated with PES: motor primary cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      and sham stimulation. Each group will receive transcranial direct current stimulation at an&#xD;
      intensity of 2 mA for 30 minutes daily for 10 consecutive days. Participants will be assessed&#xD;
      with a Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Medical&#xD;
      Outcomes Study 36-item Short - Form Health Survey (SF-36) and electromyography at baseline,&#xD;
      endpoint (after 10 sessions) and 1-month follow up. This study will help to clarify the&#xD;
      additive effects of tDCS combined with peripheral electrical stimulation on pain relief,&#xD;
      muscle function and improvement in quality of life. Additionally, the investigators will&#xD;
      provide data to identify optimal targets for management of chronic low back pain.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will be randomly allocated via an online generator (www.random.org) in one of three groups (1:1:1): anodal tDCS of M1 + PES; anodal tDCS of DLPFC + PES; Sham of M1 + PES. This sequence will be performed blindly, independently, and remotely by a blind investigator who will have no contact with other research procedures, and randomization will be hidden until the group is allocated.&#xD;
The hidden allocation process will be performed using sequential, numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes. The outcome assessors, trialists (care provider and investigator) and participants will be blinded to the performed procedures.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients will be submitted to 10 treatment sessions, five days a week, for 30 minutes, paired to the same PES protocol. The participants will be positioned in ventral decubitus position. The direct current (2 mA) will be transferred through a neuro-stimulator (TransCranial Technologies, Hong Kong, China), with the use of electrodes and 4x4 cm sponges moistened with 0.9% saline solution. The anodic electrode will be placed on C3 to stimulate the left primary motor cortex according to the international 10-20 EEG system. The reference electrode will be positioned in the supra orbital contralateral region. For the PES, four self-adhesive electrodes with dimensions of 5 x 5 cm will be placed at the height between the T12 and S1 vertebrae in order to cover the entire lumbar area. A 20Hz frequency and pulse duration of 330ms will be provided by means of two channels from an electro-stimulator (Neurodyn, Ibramed).</description>
