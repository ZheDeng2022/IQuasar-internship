    <textblock>
      he project aims to evaluate the glycemic index of different types of pasta with different&#xD;
      formats and with different types of flour. In particular, we want to know the effect of the&#xD;
      format and the different type of flour on the glycemic and insulinemic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective 1: determination of the glycemic index of the product concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective 2: determination of the insulinemic index of the product concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective 3: determination of the pasta format and the type of flour with a lower&#xD;
      glycemic and insulinemic index.&#xD;

      The study is divided into the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: screening of subjects aimed at identifying possession of the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      necessary for participation in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Enrollment of the subject and for each of the enlisted subjects, execution of the&#xD;
      first and second determination of the glycemic and insulinemic response curve with the&#xD;
      standard glucose solution 30 days apart; 15 days after the second determination of the&#xD;
      glycemic and insulinemic response to the glucose load, the assumption of the food test will&#xD;
      be performed on which to measure the glycemic index (type of pasta) and evaluation of the&#xD;
      glycemic and insulinemic response curve to this food ; finally, after a further 30 days, the&#xD;
      third determination of the glycemic and insulinemic response curve will be performed with the&#xD;
      standard glucose solution;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: statistical processing of the results of phase 2 and determination of the glycemic&#xD;
      index and insulinemic index for each type of pasta tested;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: description of the results of phase 3 with indication to the supplier company of the&#xD;
      pasta format and the type of flour with lower glycemic and insulinemic index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More phases detailed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Voluntarily enrolled subjects undergo a clinical history to exclude the pathologies&#xD;
      present in the exclusion criteria and a routine blood sample to exclude metabolic alterations&#xD;
      affecting the metabolism of sugars, lipids, uric acid, and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: The subjects considered suitable to enter the study will be subjected to the&#xD;
      administration of the standard glucose solution for the determination of the first glycemic&#xD;
      and insulinemic curve. The standard solution consists of 50 g of glucose dissolved in 200 cc&#xD;
      of trace mineral water, which the subject will be invited to drink in about 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Venous blood samples for the determination of glucose and insulin will be collected at time&#xD;
      0, and then at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes from the start of the standard intake of&#xD;
      the glucose solution. In case of a normal response to the first determination of the glycemic&#xD;
      and insulinemic curve, the subject will continue in the study; otherwise it will be excluded&#xD;
      and will be directed to clinical study paths to assess the presence of any pathologies not&#xD;
      yet concluded (diabetes, reduced response to insulin, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow all subjects eligible to continue the study and at least 12 participants, 30 days&#xD;
      after the first glucose load curve, will be subjected to the second administration of the&#xD;
      standard glucose solution according to the procedures described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 15 days, the same subjects will be given a portion of pasta (food on which to measure&#xD;
      the glycemic index) containing 50 grams of available carbohydrates. The determination of the&#xD;
      quantity of carbohydrates inside the product (pasta) on which it determines the glycemic&#xD;
      index must be done with a direct method and supplied by the food company together with the&#xD;
      pasta samples. The subject will be invited to consume the pasta in 15 minutes while sipping&#xD;
      200 cc of mineral water at the same time. Blood samples for the determination of blood sugar&#xD;
      and insulin will be collected at time 0, and then at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes from&#xD;
      the start of the pasta intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After another 30 days, the third glucose response curve and all insulin will be performed on&#xD;
      each subject, with the other modalities of the first two loading curves (this provides an&#xD;
      average value of the subject's response to glucose over time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Statistical processing of the results of phase 2 and determination of the glycemic&#xD;
      index and insulinemic index for each type of pasta tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: For each type of pasta tested, a detailed report will be drawn up, complete with&#xD;
      graphs relating to the glycemic and insulinemic response for each subject. Each report will&#xD;
      include the glycemic and insulinemic index values of the product concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow to determine which pasta format and which type of flour has the lowest&#xD;
      glycemic and insulinemic index.&#xD;
