      Rehabilitation of lower limbs after a stroke supported by robots aims to return to&#xD;
      independence and minimize disability caused by the incident, but the results have been mixed.&#xD;
      Objective of the study was to assess the changes in gait capabilities, muscle tone and daily&#xD;
      activities in patients after a recent stroke who underwent a 6-week supervised rehabilitation&#xD;
      process using exercises on the LUNA EMG neurorehabilitation robot. A total of 60 participants&#xD;
      with impaired motor function and gait after subacute stroke were included in the study. Each&#xD;
      patient was randomly assigned to an intervention (robot) or control group (RG or CG). All&#xD;
      patients, except standard therapy, underwent 1 session of therapy per day, 5 days a week for&#xD;
      6 weeks. People with RG had 30 minutes of training sessions on the Luna EMG robot, while CG&#xD;
      received exercises on the lower limb rotor. Patients were evaluated before the start of the&#xD;
      study, and then after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of therapy using the Ashworth scale, Rivermead&#xD;
      mobility index (RMI), Repty functional index, Time Up and Go test (TUG) and muscle&#xD;
      circumference on the thigh.&#xD;

    <description>Measurement of resistance during passive knee flexion and extension&#xD;
Scorse range from 0 to 4, with 5 choices:&#xD;
Grade 0: No increase in muscle tone. Grade 1: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal.&#xD;
resistance when the affected part is moved in flexion or extension. Grade 2: More marked increase in muscle tone, but affected part(s) easily moved.&#xD;
Grade 3: Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult. Grade 4: Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

Each item is scored either yes &quot;1&quot; or no &quot;0&quot;. It is based on Guttman scaling, which presumes that each subsequent item is of a more difficult nature. To advance to the next question, one must score (1) on an item, otherwise the test is stopped.</description>
