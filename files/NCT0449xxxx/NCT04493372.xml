  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks to characterize gradients of dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      after spinal cord injury. The autonomic nervous system plays key roles in regulation of blood&#xD;
      pressure, skin blood flow, and bladder health- all issues that individuals with spinal cord&#xD;
      injury typically suffer. Focusing on blood pressure regulation, the most precise metric with&#xD;
      broad clinical applicability, the investigators will perform a combination of laboratory,&#xD;
      ambulatory, and imaging-based tests to probe the body's ability to generate autonomic&#xD;
      responses. For both individuals with spinal cord injury and uninjured controls,&#xD;
      laboratory-based experiments will utilize multiple parallel recordings to identify how the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system is able to inhibit and activate signals. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that those with autonomic dysfunction after spinal cord injury will exhibit&#xD;
      abnormalities in these precise metrics. The investigators will further have research&#xD;
      participants wear a smart watch that tracks skin electrical conductance, heart rate, and skin&#xD;
      temperature, which can all provide clues as to the degree of autonomic dysfunction someone&#xD;
      may suffer at home. The investigators will look to see if any substantial connections exist&#xD;
      between different degrees of preserved autonomic function and secondary autonomic&#xD;
      complications from spinal cord injury. Finally, functional magnetic resonance imaging scans&#xD;
      will be attained to characterize patterns of connectivity within the injured spinal cord. In&#xD;
      a similar manner, the investigators will look to see if different patterns of spinal cord&#xD;
      connectivity are more closely related to groupings of secondary autonomic complications. In&#xD;
      accomplishing this, the investigators hope to give scientists important insights to how the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system works after spinal cord injury and give physicians better tools to&#xD;
      manage these secondary autonomic complications.&#xD;
