  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of art-based and music-based therapy programs lasting three months (with&#xD;
      additional follow-up 3 months after the end of the trial) in breast cancer patients currently&#xD;
      receiving therapy as well as in cancer survivors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cancer diagnosis is often associated with adverse psychosocial effects, including:&#xD;
      increased stress and anxiety, fatigue and sleep disturbance, impaired memory and cognition,&#xD;
      and poor quality of life. Chemotherapy can cause a cognitive decline in up to 75% of&#xD;
      patients; an impairment that oftentimes persists beyond completion of the regimen. This is&#xD;
      known as &quot;chemobrain&quot;. Integrative therapies are actively being investigated to help improve&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing among cancer patients and survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard at this institution is to inform patients of different complementary&#xD;
      services that are available, including art therapy, music therapy or acupuncture, but not&#xD;
      require patients to use them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomized to one of three arms 1) Art therapy program, 2)&#xD;
      Music therapy program, or 3) Standard of care (SOC). In-person and at-home therapy sessions&#xD;
      will be scheduled in alternating, weekly sessions, to allow one week of self-reflection and&#xD;
      remote therapy between in-person sessions. Each participant will be asked to attend two&#xD;
      in-person therapy sessions per month (total of 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of a 3-month, therapist-led&#xD;
      art or music therapy program to improve quality of life in breast cancer patients currently&#xD;
      receiving therapy and in cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of these programs on patient cognition in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of these programs symptoms of anxiety and depression in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether the effect of these programs is sustained at a 3-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life (QOL) as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Breast Cancer (FACT-B) questionnaire. This is a validated survey, completed by the patient, consisting of 37 items, each scored on a 0-4, Likert scale (0 = &quot;Not at all&quot;; 4= &quot;Very much&quot;). Subscales include: Physical Well-Being (PWB) (score range: 0-28), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB) (score range: 0-28), Emotional Well-Being (EWB) (score range: 0-24), Functional Well-being (FWB) (score range: 0-28), and the additional breast cancer concerns (BCS) (score range: 0-40) all with higher scores indicating better outcomes.

    <description>The art therapist will assist each participant in producing a bound collection of participant art works/writings for personal, group and/or caregiver inspiration, at the participant's request. For in-person sessions, a variety of studio-based art and writing materials will be available for participant selection and creation. Each session will be directed in the following manner:&#xD;
New therapeutic prompt or bridge from prior session&#xD;
Creative expression, opportunity for reflection, verbal sharing / processing, and a session summary&#xD;
Discussion of action plan for the next consecutive, at-home session (weekly assignment).&#xD;
Possible wellness themes for each session (in-person or at-home) may include: mental health, physical health, emotional health, spiritual health, relational health (family and social), or occupational health/financial health.</description>

    <description>Participants have the opportunity to engage in: learning an instrument, active music-making, receptive music-listening, singing, improvisation, song-writing, education on music technology, or music discussion. During in-person musical sessions the six psychosocial goals promoted by the music therapist include: 1) self-care/self-love, 2) support systems, 3) practicing positivity 4) gratitude 5) mindfulness/living in the moment, and 6) goal-setting.&#xD;
For at-home assignments, participants will be asked to pick a song of the week that coincides with the theme/goal discussed in previous session(s). They will be asked to write a journal entry about the topic discussed. Journal entries can be freely written or a prompt/question can be provided. If participants do not have access to search for songs or listen to music as at home, they may select a piece from the session and be given lyrics and/or a recording on an .mp3 player returned at conclusion of study.</description>
