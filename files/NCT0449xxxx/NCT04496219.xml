  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the safety and feasibility of utilizing acupuncture in patients&#xD;
      with high-risk bladder cancer that has not spread to the surrounding muscle (non-muscle&#xD;
      invasive) undergoing treatment with Intravesical BCG. BCG is a weakened form of the bacterium&#xD;
      Mycobacterium bovis that does not cause disease. It is used in a solution to stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system in the treatment of bladder cancer. Unfortunately, many patients experience&#xD;
      side effects such as pelvic pain, painful urination, severe urgency, frequency, urge&#xD;
      incontinence, need to urinate at night, and/or infectious complications. These side effects&#xD;
      may cause patients to delay or stop BCG treatment. Acupuncture is a medical intervention in&#xD;
      which fine metallic needles are inserted into anatomical locations of the body to stimulate&#xD;
      the peripheral and the central nervous system. Giving acupuncture before each intravesical&#xD;
      BCG treatment may help to reduce the side effects of intravesical BCG, and help patients&#xD;
      complete treatment. Specific outcomes of interest include acceptability to patients, effect&#xD;
      of acupuncture on intravesical BCG-related side effects, and adverse events associated with&#xD;
      acupuncture.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo acupuncture therapy and receive BCG via intravesical injection on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive&#xD;
      standard of care symptom management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive BCG via intravesical injection on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 in&#xD;
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard of care symptom&#xD;
      management. Patients may undergo acupuncture therapy after completion of intravesical BCG&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 week.&#xD;

                  with the effectiveness of BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any previous allergies or severe reactions to BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Acupuncture points included in the protocol&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring chronic treatment with certain antibiotics that may interfere with&#xD;
             the effectiveness of BCG. Fluoroquinolone therapy may decrease the efficacy of&#xD;
             intravesical BCG. Antibiotic therapy for ongoing treatment of active tuberculosis will&#xD;
             decrease the efficacy of intravesical BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled or concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded. Acupuncture points included in the protocol are&#xD;
             contraindicated with pregnancy and BCG is contraindicated in pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;

             electrostimulation interfering with a pacemakers operation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets: &lt; 20,000/ uL. Risk of bleeding with acupuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC: &lt; 500 cells/uL. Risk of infection with acupuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received acupuncture in the previous 3 months. Acupuncture treatment effects persist&#xD;
             after a course of treatment, previous exposure to the intervention has the potential&#xD;
             to affect the baseline data for treatment and control arms&#xD;
