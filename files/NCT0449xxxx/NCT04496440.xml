  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was focused on a type of arthritis (knee) in which patients develop pain with&#xD;
      disabilities in sitting and walking etc. In advance stage the person is bereft of his/her&#xD;
      personal physical activities. The prevalent treatment is temporary and dis-satisfactory. A&#xD;
      new treatment was designed and a trial was conducted on 125 patients (100 in the trial group,&#xD;
      25 in the control group) for a duration of six months.&#xD;

      The study was focused on establishing the cause and treatment of a painful knee joint disease&#xD;
      (Primary Osteoarthritis Knee = OA Knee). At present the cause and treatment are not known.&#xD;
      The study was based on a hypothesis, designing a treatment and testing it through a clinical&#xD;
      trial. This established that the deficient full flexion or deficient full extension of knee&#xD;
      joints, producing contracture in their capsules was the cause and the correction (Contracture&#xD;
      Correction Therapy = CCT) was the cure of the disease. The correction was carried out by&#xD;
      passive flexion or passive extension of affected knee through eight body postures designed&#xD;
      specifically during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the efficacy a multi-centre, multi surgeon six months study on 125 patients was&#xD;
      carried out, patients were divided into Trial and Control groups. The effects were measured&#xD;
      by primary outcome measure - The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index&#xD;
      (WOMAC) score and other measure EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scales (EQ-VAS) score, DFF*, DFE^ at&#xD;
      0, 6 ,12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Intervention&quot; for 1st group was CCT and for the 2nd group was &quot;No intervention&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Deficient full flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
      ^ Deficient full extension&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Deficient Full Flexion (DFF)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The degree by which flexion is lesser then 145°. Full flexion is measured by Goniometer, expressed in blocks of 5°, such as 140°, 135°, 130° etc. In first case DFF is 145-140 = 5°. Higher degree of DFF denotes higher severity. To access a change from baseline score at six months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Deficient Full Extension (DFE)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The degree by which full extension falls short to 0°. When full Range of Motion (ROM) is 0-145° and full extension is 145° the Full extension is should be 0.The DFE are represented by 5°, 10°, 15° etc. Higher degree of DFE denotes higher severity. To access a change from baseline score at six months.</description>
