  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new way of treating the most common form of lung&#xD;
      cancer. The investigators are testing a combination of radiotherapy with two new forms of&#xD;
      immunotherapy. This study is testing the safety and effectiveness of this treatment approach&#xD;
      as compared to standard treatment options.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label phase I/II study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive FLT3 ligand (CDX-301), anti-CD40 antibody (CDX-1140) and SBRT (Arm 1) versus&#xD;
      standard care (Arm 2). Subjects on either study arm with limited disease will receive SBRT to&#xD;
      all evident sites of active disease. Subjects on Arm 1 with extensive disease will initially&#xD;
      receive SBRT to a single site of disease but may receive additional &quot;cycles&quot; of FLT3 ligand&#xD;
      (CDX-301) anti-CD40 antibody (CDX-1140), and SBRT at later time points. Subjects on Arm 2&#xD;
      with extensive disease are expected to receive some form of standard systemic therapy (e.g.,&#xD;
      docetaxel). Subjects on Arm 2 with limited disease may also receive standard systemic therapy&#xD;
      following completion of SBRT to all sites of evident disease, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physicians. All subjects will be followed closely for treatment-related toxicities.&#xD;
      Whole-body PET/CT and CT imaging will be performed prior to study entry, and restaging CT&#xD;
      will be performed every 8 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I component of this study, subjects will be randomized between study arms until&#xD;
      6 subjects have been randomized to Arm 1. Study accrual will then be halted until 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the last study subject begins treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the pre-specified safety criteria are achieved in the Phase I portion of this study, the&#xD;
      study will proceed to phase II. The total sample size (Phase I and Phase II) will be 46&#xD;
      subjects. All 46 subjects will be included in efficacy analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the pre-specified safety criteria are not achieved in the Phase I portion of this study,&#xD;
      the investigators and Celldex will review safety data from this trial as well as other trials&#xD;
      using CDX-301 and CDX-1140 and determine if the experimental treatment regimen should be&#xD;
      altered (e.g., by reducing the CDX-1140 dose). The study protocol would be amended&#xD;
      accordingly, and Phase I component with the new treatment regimen would be added.&#xD;
