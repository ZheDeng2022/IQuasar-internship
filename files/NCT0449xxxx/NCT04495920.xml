  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the residual antimicrobial efficacy of one test&#xD;
      product as defined by the difference between the number of a challenge bacterial species&#xD;
      recovered following exposure to the test product and the number recovered when untreated&#xD;
      (negative control). The challenge bacterial species to be used is Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC&#xD;
      #6538) (S. aureus). Testing will be carried out using a modification of the standardized test&#xD;
      method described in ASTM E2752-10 (2015) Standard Guide for Evaluation of Residual&#xD;
      Effectiveness of Antibacterial Personal Cleansing Products. Bacterial recoveries will be&#xD;
      assayed after application oftest material, using the forearms as a substrate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At least twelve test subjects (aged 18-65 years), with healthy skin will be used in this&#xD;
      study, and will use the test product on one arm, and have the other arm untreated as the&#xD;
      negative control. The test sites on both forearms will be inoculated with suspensions&#xD;
      containing Staphylococcus au re us (A TCC #653 8), immediately after the 30 minute product&#xD;
      drying time, and at approximately 2 hours and 4 hours following test material applications.&#xD;
      The test sites will be sampled using the cup scrub procedure approximately 20 minutes&#xD;
      following each inoculation. The log 10 microbial recoveries of treated versus untreated sites&#xD;
      will be the basis for assessing the residual antimicrobial effectiveness of the test product.&#xD;
