    <textblock>
      Meralgia paresthetica is an entrapment neuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Its&#xD;
      main manifestation is neuropathic pain on the lateral aspect of the thigh. Neural&#xD;
      prolotherapy has shown improvement and relieve of neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy of neural prolotherapy (subcutaneous&#xD;
      perineural injection of dextrose 5% solution) on reliving pain and improvement of function&#xD;
      and quality of life in patients with meralgia paresthetica.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Meralgia paresthetica is a mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (i.e.&#xD;
      lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh). It is known as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the&#xD;
      thigh neuralgia. It is due to a lot of etiologies. It is characterized by neuropathic pain,&#xD;
      tingling, paresthesia and numbness in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The symptoms may&#xD;
      be provoked or worsened by prolonged standing and walking. Sitting may alleviate the pain&#xD;
      because there is reduction of the tension over the nerve, The treatment of meralgia&#xD;
      paresthetica is directed towards the improvement of the symptoms which is mainly pain with&#xD;
      subsequent improvement of function and quality of life, as well as, treatment of the&#xD;
      etiology. The treatment includes conservative and surgical treatment. Conservative treatment&#xD;
      consists of non-pharmacologic treatment and pharmacologic treatment. Surgical treatment takes&#xD;
      place in case of failure of the conservative treatment. Surgical options consist of&#xD;
      neurolysis and neurectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural prolotherapy was reported to improve and relieve of neuropathic pain including that of&#xD;
      meralgia paresthetica. Neural prolotherapy is the subcutaneous perineural injection of&#xD;
      isotonic dextrose (5%) solution especially at the points of fascial penetration of the&#xD;
      sensory nerve. It is the site where the sensory nerve reaches the subcutaneous plane. There&#xD;
      are scanty studies assessed this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy of neural prolotherapy (subcutaneous&#xD;
      perineural injection of dextrose 5% solution) on reliving pain and improvement of function&#xD;
      and quality of life in patients with meralgia paresthetica.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients had clinical evidence of meralgia paresthetica which was based on the&#xD;
             following: (i) the presence of pain, paraesthesia and numbness over the anterior and&#xD;
             lateral aspect of the thigh; (ii) exacerbation of these symptoms on walking, standing&#xD;
             and hip extension; and (iii) meralgia paresthetica was confirmed&#xD;
