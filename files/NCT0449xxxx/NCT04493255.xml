  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and excretion&#xD;
      of E7090 and its metabolites in healthy male participants. Also, to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of a single dose of E7090 in healthy male participants.&#xD;

    <description>The C-SSRS is an interview-based rating scale to systematically assess any suicidality, any suicidal behavior, any suicidal ideation. Any suicidality: emergence of any suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. Any suicidal behavior: when response is &quot;yes&quot; for any these questions- actual attempt to suicide, engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts. Any suicidal ideation: when response is &quot;yes&quot; for any of these questions- wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent to suicide. Number of participants with any suicidality will be reported for this outcome measure.</description>
