    <textblock>
      This study will explore the information needs of patient's with advanced cancer, and their&#xD;
      carers, when making a decision to commence or discontinue parenteral nutrition. Interviews&#xD;
      will be conducted with both patients with advanced cancer, and their carers to determine the&#xD;
      information they need to make a shared decision with the healthcare team.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a type of nutritional liquid that is given directly into a vein,&#xD;
      and is usually given when a person does not have a working gut. This type of nutrition is&#xD;
      managed by a team of healthcare professionals and requires regular monitoring, such as bloods&#xD;
      tests, to allow the team to provide the right balance of nutrients to the individual patient.&#xD;
      This is an important decision, and the benefits, risks and consequences of having this type&#xD;
      of nutrition should be fully explained to the patient and carer, to make sure they can make&#xD;
      an informed decision. The aim of this study is to find out what information both patients and&#xD;
      carers feel they need to be able to make a decision to start, and a later date stop,&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition, with a diagnosis of advanced (incurable) cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not clear if patients and carers get all the information they need before making this&#xD;
      decision, and often the decision is made by a doctor and other healthcare professionals.&#xD;
      However, patients and carers have a right to make decisions about their care. We will&#xD;
      therefore interview patients and carers who have experience of making this decision, or in&#xD;
      the process of making this decision, to find out what information is important to them. Our&#xD;
      aim is to use the results from this research to improve the experience that patients and&#xD;
      carers have in the future.&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited from the inpatient and outpatient setting (intestinal failure&#xD;
        clinic). Carers may be recruited from participating hospitals if they are caring for a&#xD;
        patient under the care of that centre. Carers will also be recruited via social media, and&#xD;
        online support networks.&#xD;
