  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the current use and intention to use of teledermatology in Swiss&#xD;
      dermatology patients, dermatologists, other physicians and medical staff.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telemedicine, the use of telecommunication and information technology to provide clinical&#xD;
      health care from a distance, has become an increasing role in basic medical care&#xD;
      internationally. Telemedicine is particularly suitable for skin diseases. In order to improve&#xD;
      the use of evidence-based telemedicine, the Swiss patients' preferences regarding&#xD;
      teledermatology versus face-to-face consultations and the patients' and physicians'&#xD;
      determinants of acceptance for teledermatology are investigated in this study. Dermatology&#xD;
      patients are asked to complete a newly-created 21-items-survey; Swiss dermatologists, other&#xD;
      physicians and medical staff on telemedicine will complete a similar newly-created,&#xD;
      23-items-questionnaire. A descriptive statistical analysis (e.g. gender, age, place of&#xD;
      residence (city or country), waiting time) will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>Dermatology patients are asked to complete a 21-items-survey while waiting for the doctor's consultation. Following variables will be addressed:&#xD;
Demographic data of telemedicine users and non-users&#xD;
Subjective disease perception of the dermatology patients&#xD;
Use of internet, telemedicine and telemedicine insurance model&#xD;
Patients´ willingness for additional features of telemedicine&#xD;
Advantages and disadvantages telemedicine and face-to-face consultation&#xD;

    <description>To obtain the view of Swiss dermatologists, other physicians and medical staff on telemedicine a 23-items-survey will be completed. Following variables will be addressed:&#xD;
Objective disease perception of the treating dermatologist (regarding the urgency of the patient's medical examination, the functional impairment and cosmetic burden due to patient's disease, the impairment of life quality due to patient's disease and the estimation of the course of the patient's disease)&#xD;
