  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Pakistan, pneumonia and recurrent wheeze in children under five pose significant threats&#xD;
      to children's health. Despite being preventable, more than 90,000 children die each year due&#xD;
      to pneumonia in Pakistan, making it one of the top five countries in the world, with the&#xD;
      highest pneumonia related childhood mortality. The predisposing factors which lead to these&#xD;
      illnesses include lack of hygiene, lack of immunization, overcrowding, household air&#xD;
      pollution, smoking, and poverty. Prompt recognition and timely initiation of treatment is&#xD;
      imperative in children under five with pneumonia and recurrent wheeze and failure to do so&#xD;
      can lead to complications and death. In children under five, among the causes of death due to&#xD;
      these diseases, one is delayed care seeking. It has been identified that around 38% of deaths&#xD;
      due to respiratory illnesses occur in households due to this delayed care seeking which is&#xD;
      defined as delay in care sought for an illness outside home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most of the low middle income countries, carer gender plays an important role in decisions&#xD;
      to seek care. Although in majority of households, the primary caregivers of children under&#xD;
      five are the mothers of those children, decisions with respect to care are often made by&#xD;
      fathers or mothers in law which is a problem as they do not cater to the child in a timely&#xD;
      manner either by not being there or being ignorant of basic management of the illness.&#xD;
      Another contributing factor could be lack of time to take the child for healthcare as the&#xD;
      mothers are usually occupied in their household chores and the fathers are busy working. And&#xD;
      in rare cases where either the mother of a child dies at childbirth (500 per 100,000 live&#xD;
      births) and when fathers are working away from home, it is the secondary caregiver who is&#xD;
      responsible for care seeking of that child. Additionally, due to poverty, most caregivers&#xD;
      cannot afford the cost of travel and secondary care for the child delaying care seeking until&#xD;
      the child is severely ill. The inaccessibility of adequate healthcare within close proximity&#xD;
      may delay care seeking. However a major contributing factor to this delay is impaired carer&#xD;
      perception of the seriousness of the condition. The importance of caregivers' ability to&#xD;
      recognize and seek appropriate care for their children is also one of the recommended key&#xD;
      activities in the World Health Organization's (WHO)and UNICEF's Global Action Plan for the&#xD;
      Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhea [11]. WHO and UNICEF have, therefore, emphasized the&#xD;
      development of innovative, sustainable and cost-effective strategies/interventions to improve&#xD;
      child health. It is important to devise a strategy whereby patients' symptoms are identified&#xD;
      timely and immediate care given at their doorstep. Experimental studies provide the strongest&#xD;
      evidence that illness perceptions can modify behaviors and care-seeking, and several studies&#xD;
      have shown that interventions designed to change illness perceptions can improve health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inaccessibility of adequate healthcare within close proximity may delay care seeking.&#xD;
      However a major contributing factor to this delay is impaired carer perception of the&#xD;
      seriousness of the condition. Although well-proven life-saving tools are available to stop&#xD;
      mortality due to preventable illnesses like pneumonia and recurrent wheeze, the existing&#xD;
      health systems in Pakistan are passive. One of the most impact strategies can be timely&#xD;
      healthcare seeking through community health workers who have been a powerful force to promote&#xD;
      healthy behaviors and extend the reach to the health system by acting as a bridge between the&#xD;
      community and the system. Community-based packaged interventions delivered through CHWs have&#xD;
      been shown to improve care seeking for childhood illnesses. In Pakistan, these CHWs are&#xD;
      referred to as Lady Health Workers (LHWs) enrolled under the National Program for Family&#xD;
      Planning and Primary Healthcare. On average each LHW covers 100-150 households by making&#xD;
      monthly visits and providing basic health services and education. These LHWs could,&#xD;
      therefore, be a useful mode as evidence has shown that health interventions integrating&#xD;
      (CHWs) can lead to positive behavior changes and lower morbidity and mortality rates, while&#xD;
      moving services and information closer to the communities where they are actually needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, our study will explore care-seeking for childhood pneumonia among caregivers of&#xD;
      children under five through a qualitative approach and devise a Care Model to actively find&#xD;
      cases through LHWs and promote appropriate care seeking behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the feasibility of using an android based mobile application by LHWs to&#xD;
      educate caregivers of children under five on prevention of pneumonia in rural Islamabad.&#xD;
