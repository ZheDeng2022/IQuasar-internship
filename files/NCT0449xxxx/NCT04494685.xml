  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of robotic rehabilitation through training on a&#xD;
      robot-assisted orthostatic board and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on&#xD;
      functionality in post-stroke patients. In this randomized controlled trial the patients will&#xD;
      be allocated to a control group (which will receive conventional physiotherapy) or or to&#xD;
      intervention group (which will receive conventional physiotherapy and robotic&#xD;
      rehabilitation). Interventions will occur every day in the hospital phase and three&#xD;
      times/week after discharge, totaling 18 sessions.The groups will be evaluated prior to any&#xD;
      physiotherapy intervention, in the 10h session and at the end of six weeks of treatment (or&#xD;
      18 sessions).The following outcomes will be measured: functionality, peripheral muscle&#xD;
      strength, muscle architecture and echogenicity, spasticity, cardiorespiratory repercussions,&#xD;
      mobility, disability and dependence, quality of life and time of hospital stay.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 3 weeks and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in functionality will be assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Scale. This scale consists of six domains: range of motion, pain, sensitivity, motor function of the upper and lower extremities, balance, coordination and speed. The score for each item ranges from 0 to 2, where 0 = cannot be performed; 1 = partially accomplished; 2 = completely accomplished. The total score ranges from 0 to 266 points and the higher the score the better the functionality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 3 weeks and after 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The change in muscle strength will be assessed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and by test of maximum repetition (1RM)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quadriceps muscle thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in quadriceps muscle thickness will be evaluated for the acquisition of ultrasound images using a high resolution ultrasound device (Vivid-i, GE, USA). In order to verify the thickness of the muscle, the distance between the superficial and deep aponeurosis is measured.The thickness is given in centimeters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Echogenicity of the rectus femoris muscle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in echogenicity will be evaluated for the acquisition of ultrasound images of the rectus femoris muscle using a high resolution ultrasound device (Vivid-i, GE, USA). To check the echogenicity of the rectus femoris an image of the cross-sectional area of the muscle will be taken. The echogenicity measurement is given in an arbitrary unit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after after 3 weeks and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in spasticity will be assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale. This scale consists of an ordinal classification of 5 points for grading the resistance found during passive stretching, with 0 indicating normal muscle tone and 4 severe increase in tone. The higher the score, the greater the spasticity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>After 3 weeks and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in mobility will be assessed using the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), which will be associated with an inertial sensor</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability and dependence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in disability and dependency will be assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale. This instrument has 6 scores, where: 0 = asymptomatic; 1 = symptoms without disabilities; 2 = mild disability; 3 = moderate disability; 4 = moderate to severe disability; 5 = severe disability and 6 = death. The higher the score, the greater the degree of disability and dependence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life indicator</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in quality of life will be assessed using the EuroQol-5D questionnaire. This is a generic instrument that assesses mobility, personal care, usual activities, pain and anxiety/depression. It allows to generate a global index of the value of an individual's health status. The number 1 indicates the best state of health (perfect health) and 0 the worst state of health (death).</description>
