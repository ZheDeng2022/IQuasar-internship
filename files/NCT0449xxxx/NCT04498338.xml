  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of addition of neural mobilization to a&#xD;
      standard post-operative physical therapy program in patients with lumbar laminectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After Laminectomy, patients are suffering from many problems as pain, weakness. This study&#xD;
      was conducted on two groups of patients who underwent lumbar Laminectomy as a surgical&#xD;
      treatment for lumbar canal stenosis. The control group received TENS and strengthening&#xD;
      exercises, while the study group received neural mobilization in addition to the program that&#xD;
      was given to the control group. The outcome measures include pain intensity, nerve root&#xD;
      compression and functional level which were measured pre-treatment and post-treatment through&#xD;
      using visual analogue scale, H-reflex latency and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>

    <description>It was evaluated through visual analogue scale (VAS). Visual analogue scale (VAS) is a 10-cm line with a &quot;0&quot; at the left end for &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 at the right end for &quot;worst possible pain&quot;, each patient was asked to indicate on the line where his pain is in relation to the two extremes by circling the number.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nerve root compression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It was assessed through assessment of latency of H-reflex of S1. The participant was in prone-lying position. The active recording electrode was located on the soleus between the two heads of the gastrocnemius, while reference recording electrode was located on the Achilles tendon. The stimulation was applied at the midline in the popliteal fossa on the tibial nerve.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The functional ability was evaluated by Oswestery disability index (ODI). Oswestery disability index (ODI) is a valid and reliable tool for assessment of functional ability.&#xD;
The minimum value of this scale is 0. The maximum value of this scale is 100. The higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>
