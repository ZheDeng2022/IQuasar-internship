  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open label study is to evaluate longer term tolerability and potential&#xD;
      effectiveness of transcranial ultrasound in people with attention deficit hyperactive&#xD;
      disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary cortical regions thought to be implicated in ADHD include the prefrontal,&#xD;
      orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices. A possible treatment approach for ADHD would&#xD;
      employ a process designed to promote healthier function of the anterior cingulate region. The&#xD;
      anterior cingulate in particular appears to be implicated in the activation of cognitive&#xD;
      control networks, and has been posited as an area of interest for therapeutic research on&#xD;
      ADHD. The subjects in this research study will be recruited through medical practice and&#xD;
      enrolled in an 8-week protocol to undergo 8 consecutive weekly ultrasound sessions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is designed to evaluate for severity of symptoms as specified in the DSM-IV-TR. The ASRS is composed of 18 questions, and uses a scale that ranges from 0-4 based on the individuals mark in either the &quot;never, rarely, sometimes, often, very often&quot; column for a possible total score of 72. The minimum score to qualify for study inclusion is 8 (i.e., 4 or more &quot;symptom-positive&quot; answers), and the maximum possible score is 72. The higher the score, the more indicative of higher severity of ADHD symptoms. Each column is used to describe the severity of the individuals symptoms based on the questions asked. Each participant is asked to make a mark within one column for each question that best describes their answer. The first 6 questions of the scale comprise Part A, which is more generally used as a screening measure. Questions 12-18 comprise Part B, which provides further identifying clues for individual symptoms.</description>

Improvement will be gauged by reduction in overall score (minimally clinically important difference will be 20% for this study).</description>

    <description>On the day of the ultrasound appointment, patients will undergo ten minutes of ultrasound targeting the anterior cingulate. The DWL Doppler ultrasound device enables visual and auditory waveform confirmation of the anterior cerebral artery, and optical tracking technology (e.g., AntNeuro Visor2™ system) may be used in tandem with the Brainsonix ultrasound device to track a patient's brain in virtual space as well as their physical location, thereby ensuring accurate placement.</description>
