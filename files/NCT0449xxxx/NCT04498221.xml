  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre validation study to evaluate whether a new imaging and surgical protocol would&#xD;
      work as well as the current god standard in identifying sentinel nodes in patients with&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer at the back of the mouth and throat is usually discovered after it has spread to lymph&#xD;
      glands in the neck. Treatment therefore involves dealing with both the original tumour (in&#xD;
      the mouth/throat) and the spread cancer in the lymph glands. This type of cancer sometimes&#xD;
      spreads to both sides of the neck, not just the side on which the original tumour was&#xD;
      located. The decision as to whether to treat the other side of the neck as well depends on&#xD;
      various factors including the aggressiveness of the tumour, whether the patient smokes and&#xD;
      whether or not the HPV virus is present in the tumour. This is inevitably inexact, and&#xD;
      assessing the likelihood of the cancer spreading to the other side of the neck always&#xD;
      involves an element of estimation. Some patients end up being treated unnecessarily on both&#xD;
      sides (often with severe and lasting effects on swallowing, meaning they have to use a&#xD;
      feeding tube), while others receive treatment on one side only but the cancer comes back on&#xD;
      the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide more accurate information on which to base the decision as to whether&#xD;
      to treat the other side of the neck. The study will use a procedure known as sentinel node&#xD;
      biopsy (SNB) to establish (with a high degree of accuracy) whether or not the cancer has&#xD;
      spread to the other side of the neck. The study will be in two stages. The first stage is the&#xD;
      imaging stage. A radioactive substance called Lymphoseek will be injected into the tumour.&#xD;
      Lymphoseek moves quickly into the lymph nodes and can then be detected using a handheld gamma&#xD;
      camera. The first nodes that Lymphoseek moves into are the &quot;sentinel&quot; nodes. Patients already&#xD;
      undergo an examination under anaesthetic (EUA); the patients participating in the study will&#xD;
      have the Lymphoseek injected additionally and the sentinel nodes detected during this EUA.&#xD;
      The use of the handheld camera is relatively new; so, all of the patients in the study will&#xD;
      also have a CT scan the next day to double check whether the handheld camera identified the&#xD;
      sentinel nodes correctly. The second stage of the study, the surgery stage, will involve a&#xD;
      new group of patients having the imaging procedure. Those who do have sentinel nodes in the&#xD;
      other side of the neck will have them removed during the EUA. Those nodes will then be&#xD;
      examined thoroughly for signs of cancer. A separate limb of stage one of the study will&#xD;
      involve some patients whose main tumours are easily accessible also having their tumour&#xD;
      injected with Lymphoseek under local anaesthetic in an outpatient clinic. In the study this&#xD;
      will take place several days after the initial injection with Lymphoseek. If this procedure&#xD;
      is found to be acceptable to patients, it would mean that patients could have the Lymphoseek&#xD;
      injected before the EUA, thereby allowing time for the sentinel nodes to be identified by CT&#xD;
      scan so that they can be removed during the EUA. This will provide a way to ensure that, even&#xD;
      if the handheld camera cannot be used, the sentinel nodes can still be removed while the&#xD;
      patient is under anaesthetic for the EUA. If the study is successful, the patient will be&#xD;
      able to have much more accurate information about whether their cancer has, or might, spread&#xD;
      to the other side of the neck, without having to undergo an additional general anaesthetic.&#xD;
