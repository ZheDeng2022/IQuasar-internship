  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The masticatory performance would affect the nutritional status of elderly people. the&#xD;
      prevalence of undernutrition among elderly inpatients is %20-50%. Previous related studies&#xD;
      investigate the masticatory performance with special chewing gum and self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires. This study observes the correlation of masticatory muscles sEMG, nutritional&#xD;
      status, and handgrip force among elderly inpatients.&#xD;

      In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 120 seniors aged 65 and above who are newly&#xD;
      admitted to the Asian University Hospital. Within 24 hours they admitted to the hospital, we&#xD;
      collected the Mini Nutritional Assessment scores, surface electromyography data, handgrip&#xD;
      strength, self-assessment swallowing ability score, and clinical objective data. We performed&#xD;
      the statistics for independent t-test, Pearson correlation analysis, and binary logistic&#xD;
      regression with SPSS 23 software.&#xD;
