      1. Background/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Optimizing procedural and patient outcomes relies heavily on tomographic imaging data&#xD;
           guidance for patients being evaluated for trans-catheter aortic valve replacement or&#xD;
           implantation (TAVR) by providing accurate information of the aortic valve apparatus&#xD;
           (aortic annulus and its pertinent neighboring structures). Though selection of the&#xD;
           trans-catheter heart valve size was initially driven by echocardiographic data, recently&#xD;
           aortic annulus sizing by electrocardiographic gated cardiac computed tomographic&#xD;
           angiography (CCTA) is now widely accepted as the &quot;gold-standard&quot; for this purpose. 8&#xD;
           However, CCTA requires administration of iodinated contrast. Most of the patients being&#xD;
           considered for (TAVR) have chronic kidney disease. In these patients, avoiding contrast&#xD;
           administration and at the same time being able to accurately assess the aortic annulus&#xD;
           apparatus (AVA) 1 2 will be of paramount importance. Also with CCTA, the presence of&#xD;
           significant or exuberant aortic annulus calcification can make the annulus border&#xD;
           delineation challenging, and in some instances practically impossible to demarcate the&#xD;
           boundary of the annulus in some of its sectors. This is due to the blooming and&#xD;
           shadowing artifacts caused by the calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In these patients, when not contraindicated, a non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (CMRI) has been suggested as an alternate method to size the AVA. A&#xD;
           free-breathing non-contrast navigator-gated 3D whole-heart acquisition can also be&#xD;
           obtained to mimic the volumetric acquisition of a CT image. 1 4 However, in this study&#xD;
           by Roos et al that is referenced for this recommendation, the authors used the 3D data&#xD;
           set only to measure coronal and single oblique sagittal dimensions of the aortic valve&#xD;
           annulus. This was adopted because the coronal view is similar to the anterior-posterior&#xD;
           view on aortic root angiography, and the reconstructed sagittal view has the same&#xD;
           orientation as the mid-esophageal long-axis view on trans-esophageal echocardiogram. It&#xD;
           is now established well beyond doubt that this is not the most accurate way to size the&#xD;
           aortic annulus, as the aortic valve annulus is a dynamic complex elliptical or ovoid 3D&#xD;
           entity that is also subject to constant shape deformation across the cardiac cycle in&#xD;
           addition to being influenced by the thoracic and intra-thoracic anatomy or variations.&#xD;
           Ideally, this needs to be done creating a plane that precisely corresponds to the aortic&#xD;
           annulus/basal ring which includes all 3 lowest insertion points of the aortic valve&#xD;
           cusps (hinge points) by multi-planar reconstructions. A review of literature shows that&#xD;
           this method of post-processing CMRI 3D data sets using multi-planar reformats has not so&#xD;
           far been validated against the currently available &quot;gold standard&quot; CCTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In CMRI, the conventional 2-dimensional (2D) breath-hold cine MRI has been used to&#xD;
           assess cardiac anatomy and function. However, this technique requires cooperation from&#xD;
           the patient, and in some cases the scan planning is complicated. However, similar to&#xD;
           standard echocardiography, most MRI sequences are 2D (i.e. the plane of imaging has to&#xD;
           be chosen at the time of the examination and cannot be changed by subsequent&#xD;
           manipulation of the data set).2 On the contrary, 3-dimensional (3D) cardiac MRI can&#xD;
           overcome some of these problems because it requires minimal planning and can be&#xD;
           reformatted in any plane with post-processing. Cardiac MRI using 3D whole heart&#xD;
           acquisition protocol may be a practical option for these patients, as this test is able&#xD;
           to assess the aortic annulus complex without contrast administration, and without the&#xD;
           blooming and shadowing artifacts caused by calcification in some instances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Scope and Duration To assess agreement between cMRI and CCTA, 35 subjects with&#xD;
           aortic valve stenosis who are referred for pre-TAVR imaging will be selected for the&#xD;
           study. The investigators estimate it will take approximately 6 months to reach our&#xD;
           target enrollment of 35 patients. There will not be any follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess if there are measurement differences between contrast-enhanced CT and&#xD;
           non-contrast enhanced cardiac MRI using 3D whole heart acquisition protocol of the&#xD;
           3-pronged aortic annulus complex post-processed by a workstation capable of advanced&#xD;
           image processing, manipulation and optimal multi-planar reformatting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Non-contrast enhanced cardiac MRI using 3D whole heart acquisition protocol is&#xD;
           non-inferior to contrast enhanced CT in the assessment of aortic annulus complex for&#xD;
           pre-TAVR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is a prospective study of 35 patients, men and/or women, with aortic valve&#xD;
           stenosis who are referred for pre-TAVR imaging will be selected for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seen at The Center for Advanced Cardiac Care for aortic stenosis will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study if they are eligible and consent. Upon enrollment the following will be&#xD;
      collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-CCTA vital signs, height, weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standard of care laboratory testing including BUN and Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All females of childbearing age will have a urine pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical risk factor data&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Post CCTA laboratory testing including BUN and Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Non-contrast Cardiac MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Data to be abstracted from surgical procedure will include Valve size, deployment and&#xD;
           positioning details and complications, if present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Risks/Benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1. Risks MRI does not use ionizing radiation (high-energy radiation that can potentially&#xD;
      cause damage to DNA, like the x-rays used CT scans).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No contrast will be used for the MRI protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known harmful side-effects associated with temporary exposure to the strong&#xD;
      magnetic field used by MRI scanners. However, there are important safety concerns to consider&#xD;
      before performing or undergoing an MRI scan (U.S. Food and Drug Administration):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The magnet may cause pacemakers, artificial limbs, and other implanted medical devices&#xD;
           that contain metal to malfunction or heat up during the exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any loose metal object may cause damage or injury if it gets pulled toward the magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dyes from tattoos or tattooed eyeliner can cause skin or eye irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Medication patches can cause a skin burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The wire leads used to monitor an electrocardiogram (ECG) trace or respiration during a&#xD;
           scan must be placed carefully to avoid causing a skin burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Prolonged exposure to radio waves during the scan could lead to slight warming of the&#xD;
           body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCTA will be done as per the established standard practice and is currently the the&#xD;
      standard of care in accurately sizing aortic valve annulus in patients when clinically&#xD;
      indicated. The risks of CCTA include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coming from radiation department&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2. Minimization of Risks Patient safety during this study will be the highest priority. All&#xD;
      diagnostic tests/treatments provided are commonly accepted and FDA approved. The patients&#xD;
      will not incur any psychological, social, legal or economic risks by participating in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3. Benefits Subjects will not directly benefit from this research. The results of this&#xD;
      study may provide important information for the medical imaging options for future valve&#xD;
      replacement patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Statistical Methods and Analyses Assuming a 23.5mm mean difference of the aortic valve&#xD;
      annulus: area between cardiac MRI and CT measurements, a standard deviation of the mean&#xD;
      difference of 7.5mm, a lower equivalence bound of -30mm, a upper equivalence bound of 30mm,&#xD;
      and alpha = 0.05 with 35 patients the study power is estimated to be over 80% (see Figure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis A generalized propensity score (to adjust for pre-operative clinical and&#xD;
      non-clinical factors) approach will be used to account for possible confounding of the&#xD;
      association between MRI and CT and annulus area, annulus perimeter, and maximum and minimum&#xD;
      annulus diameter measurements. Specifically, a general linear (which will account for&#xD;
      clustering of data within patients and will include the propensity score) will be developed&#xD;
      to assess measurement differences between diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, adjusted (by the propensity score) Kappa tests, specificity, and sensitivity will&#xD;
      be used to assess agreement between MRI and CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Data Management The data collection form with the clinical and non-clinical risk factors&#xD;
      and measurements that the investigators will collect for each patient is attached (see&#xD;
      attachment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage: An appropriate database will be created and managed in compliance with HIPAA&#xD;
      regulations. Data will be stored safely in a secure environment, and maintenance for back-up&#xD;
      purposes will be performed on a routine basis to avoid catastrophic data loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Subject Privacy: Patients will be approached discretely and privately by the study&#xD;
      coordinator on location at The Center for Advanced Cardiac Care prior to their procedure. The&#xD;
      discretion of the study coordinator will be used to judge if privacy (from both medical&#xD;
      personnel and other persons in the hospital) is ensured during the consent process. The&#xD;
      patient will be informed that they can stop the consent process at anytime if they feel their&#xD;
      privacy is being compromised, and no information will be collected directly from the patient&#xD;
      after that point. Patients will be informed that participating / not participating in this&#xD;
      study will in no way affect their care and that they are in no way obligated or expected to&#xD;
      participate. If the patient agrees to participate, they will be taken through the informed&#xD;
      consent process. Upon data collection/acquisition, study identifiers will be encrypted to&#xD;
      protect patients' privacy and meet HIPAA regulations, and data will be stored in a secured&#xD;
      database while periodic back-up will protect against catastrophic data loss. All hard copy&#xD;
      material (summary printouts) will be stored by the principal investigator in locked file&#xD;
      cabinets and the disks, diskettes, and other removable storage media files will be safely&#xD;
      stored as per HIPAA regulations. All patient identifiers will be removed from research&#xD;
      related documents and a study specific identifier assigned to each subject. . Only&#xD;
      de-identified data will be used for analysis and only aggregate results will be reported.&#xD;
      Only those directly related to the research will be allowed access to subject information.&#xD;
      Patients will not be identified as research subjects to those individuals they interact with&#xD;
      except for those individuals who need to be made aware of the status for safe conduct of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Data Monitoring An internal audit will occur within thirty days after the first subject is&#xD;
      enrolled and at least annually until study closure. CRFs, source documents, informed consent&#xD;
      forms, and study deviations will be included in the audits. Audit findings will be reported&#xD;
      to the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory documents will be audited by the Baylor Research Institute Department of Research&#xD;
      Compliance upon request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Publication The findings will be presented at a national/international conference and&#xD;
      submitted for peer-review publication. Likely venues for publication include Circulation and&#xD;
      Journal of the American College of Cardiology.&#xD;
