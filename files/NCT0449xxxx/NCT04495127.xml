        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Three years of age or older, and less than or equal to 18 years of age at the time of&#xD;
             obtaining informed consent. BSA greater than or equal to 0.55 m2, and able to swallow&#xD;
             the whole study drug (capsules) without entire contents unpacked from the capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NF1 and inoperable and symptomatic PN who have PN-related morbidities (symptom and/or&#xD;
             complications), as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inoperable PN is defined as PN that cannot be surgically completely removed without&#xD;
             risk for substantial morbidity due to encasement of, or close proximity to, vital&#xD;
             structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A PN is defined as a neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and may&#xD;
             involve multiple fascicles and branches. A spinal PN involves two or more levels with&#xD;
             connection between the levels or extending laterally along the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition to PN, subjects must have at least 1 other diagnostic criterion for NF1 as&#xD;
             follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Six or more café-au-lait macules &gt;5 mm in greatest diameter in pre-pubertal&#xD;
                  individuals and &gt;15 mm in greatest diameter in post-pubertal individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Optic glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Two or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or tibial pseudarthrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. A first-degree relative with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable typical or nodular PN in principle, defined as a lesion of at&#xD;
             least 3 cm measured in one dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ/haematological function&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy (except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, low grade optic pathway gliomas associated with NF1&#xD;
             which does not require systemic treatment or other cancer from which the subject had&#xD;
             been disease free for ≥2 years or which would not have limited survival to &lt;2 years)&#xD;
             or other cancer requiring treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus, serologic status reflecting active&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, or any uncontrolled&#xD;
             active systemic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinically significant ophthalmological findings/conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to undergo MRI and/or contraindication for MRI (i.e. prosthesis or&#xD;
             orthopaedic or dental braces that would interfere with volumetric analysis of target&#xD;
             PN on MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g.&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would adversely&#xD;
             affect the absorption/bioavailability of the orally administered study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving supplementation with vitamin E greater than 100% of the daily recommended&#xD;
             dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving herbal supplements or medications known to be strong inhibitors or inducers&#xD;
             of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzymes unless such products can be safely&#xD;
             discontinued at least 14 days before the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
