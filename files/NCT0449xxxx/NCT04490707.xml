  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Great progress has been witnessed on the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in recent&#xD;
      years. However, elderly patients ineligible for receiving high dose chemotherapy and&#xD;
      allo-HSCT, have high relapse rate and treatment-related complications. Azacitidine (AZA), a&#xD;
      listed hypomethylating agent in China in 2018, is the only approved demethylating drug in the&#xD;
      treatment of AML, following the NCCN guidelines. In addition, lenalidomide(LEN) has been&#xD;
      shown to rapidly enhance cytotoxic T- and natural killer (NK)-cell function and reduce&#xD;
      relapse post-chemotherapy in patients with MM, also has substantial activity as a single&#xD;
      agent in elderly patients with AML. Measurable residual disease (MRD) has been proven to be&#xD;
      highly prognostic in quite a number clinical studies. This study is aimed to validate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety advantages of the maintenance therapy that contain AZA and LEN in elderly&#xD;
      or unfit for intensive therapy patients with AML based on MRD monitoring.&#xD;

      In this study, elderly or unfit for intensive therapy AML patients who had achieved complete&#xD;
      remission(CR) after remission-induction and consolidation chemotherapy were assigned to 3&#xD;
      Arms: (1) Maintenance therapy with AZA combined with LEN（AZA+LEN）: AZA 50mg/m² per day for&#xD;
      days 1-5 and LEN 10mg per day orally for days 6-26 , every 28 days for up to 12 cycles or&#xD;
      progression; (2) Maintenance therapy with AZA only: AZA 50mg/m² per day for days 1-5, every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 12 cycles or progression; (3) Observation or with supporting therapy. MRD&#xD;
      will be assessed by flow cytometry and molecular techniques. The efficacy and safety of the 3&#xD;
      Arms will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
