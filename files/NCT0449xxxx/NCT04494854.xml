  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the perceptions, representations and expe-riences of&#xD;
      malaria prophylaxis in patients born in endemic areas and living in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis could lead to better understanding and communication between the medical&#xD;
      profession and patients in malaria. It would also provide patient-specific responses to their&#xD;
      expectations, as to their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is the most common vector-borne (mosquito-borne) disease in the world. It is caused&#xD;
      by a parasite called Plasmodium, and is transmitted to humans by an Anopheles mosquito bite.&#xD;
      Malaria rages in most intertropical regions and in 91 countries. Hence, almost half of the&#xD;
      world's population is expose. The estimated number of cases was 219 million (CI95 = 203-262)&#xD;
      in 2018, including 200 million in Africa (92%). The number of deaths in 2017 reached 435,000,&#xD;
      of which 93% in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2018, in metropolitan France, the National Reference Center recorded 2,730 reported cases&#xD;
      including one case of indigenous malaria, the other cases were import cases. There were 12.8%&#xD;
      of severe forms and 84.9% of the patients were of African origin and had stayed in Africa,&#xD;
      without taking anti-malaria chemoprophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fight against malaria is therefore a major public health issue in the world and in&#xD;
      France, with in particular the need for better access to pre-trip consultations, in town or&#xD;
      in hospital, and improved key messages deliverance on this frequent and potentially serious&#xD;
      pathology, and also the means of protection (chemoprophylaxis, repellents and mosquito nets).&#xD;
      The role of general practitioners is essential in this fight since they represent the first&#xD;
      source of information for 60% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this effect, Recommendations for good practice for the management of imported malaria&#xD;
      actualized and published in 2018 emphasizes these preventive measures for travelers bound for&#xD;
      endemic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-compliance rate was estimated at 29% in a 2007 study by Pistone et al. in patients&#xD;
      from endemic areas when they are among the most affected patients. These data have not yet&#xD;
      been verified for more than 10 years, and it seems important to actualized this knowledge in&#xD;
      the light of social changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, prevention methods borrowed from herbal medicine are sometimes offered&#xD;
      elsewhere, such as Artemisia herbal teas, despite the scientific data that caused a lack of&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, few studies have explored the reasons for this obstacle to chemoprophylaxis and&#xD;
      classically proposed anti-vector measures and a better understanding could allow a better&#xD;
      delivery of information during our consultations.&#xD;
