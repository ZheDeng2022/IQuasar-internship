  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a common disorder of shoulder joint. SIS has been&#xD;
      accounted for 44-65 % of all shoulder pain. It is believed that one important contributing&#xD;
      factor is scapular dyskinesis. Patients with SIS demonstrates scapular dyskinesis, including&#xD;
      decrease in upward rotation, scapular posterior tilt, and external rotation. Altered muscle&#xD;
      activity of scapular muscles may contribute to scapular dyskinesis, such as increase in&#xD;
      activity of upper trapezius, and decrease in activity of lower trapezius and serratus&#xD;
      anterior. In addition to these changes in neuromuscular control, central nervous system may&#xD;
      be re-organized in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. Evidence has been reported that&#xD;
      center of gravity of motor mapping changes, corticospinal excitability decreases and&#xD;
      inhibition increases in patients with shoulder injuries such as instability, rotator cuff&#xD;
      tendinopathy and SIS. These corticospinal changes are believed to be related to chronicity of&#xD;
      symptoms and lack of treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have applied many types of treatments to SIS, such as manipulation, taping,&#xD;
      and exercises. However, most studies mainly focused on the outcomes of pain and function, few&#xD;
      studies investigated changes in neuromuscular control following treatments. Yet, no study has&#xD;
      addressed how corticospinal system changes following treatment in patient with shoulder&#xD;
      injuries. Motor skill training, which has been widely used in training healthy subjects or&#xD;
      patients with neurological disorders, has been shown to change corticospinal systems,&#xD;
      including increasing excitability and decreasing inhibition. To our knowledge, no study has&#xD;
      integrated the concepts of motor skill learning into a short-term treatment or investigated&#xD;
      the effects of motor skill training on corticospinal systems in patients with SIS. The&#xD;
      purposes of the study are to investigate the effects of short-term motor skill training on&#xD;
      pain, neuromuscular control, corticospinal system in patients with SIS, and also to&#xD;
      investigate whether changes in corticospinal parameters will be related to changes in pain,&#xD;
      function and neuromuscular control.&#xD;
