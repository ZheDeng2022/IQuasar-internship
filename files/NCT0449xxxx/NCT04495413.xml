  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cohort study to examine the effect of age on duration of analgesia in patients receiving&#xD;
      single-shot femoral nerve block prior to surgery, by postoperative phone follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how differences in age can affect the duration of&#xD;
      pain relief from a femoral nerve block. Complete recovery after leg surgery involves healing&#xD;
      of tissues at the surgical site, recovery of muscle strength and range-of-motion. Some pain&#xD;
      is normally experienced after leg surgery. At the hospital, pain is usually treated with pain&#xD;
      medicines, and/or a nerve block procedure. A nerve block involves injecting a local&#xD;
      anesthetic beside the nerves to numb the nerves that supply feeling to the knee joint and&#xD;
      surrounding tissues. The choice as to whether a participant has a nerve block or not is made&#xD;
      by the participant and their surgeon and is not determined by this research study. The study&#xD;
      aim is to find out how long a nerve block can relieve postsurgical pain, and whether that&#xD;
      duration is affected by the age of the participant.&#xD;
