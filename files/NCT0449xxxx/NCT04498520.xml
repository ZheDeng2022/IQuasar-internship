      This phase I trial investigates the side effects and best dose of abexinostat and palbociclib&#xD;
      when given together with fulvestrant in treating patients with breast or gynecologic cancer.&#xD;
      Abexinostat may prevent tumor cells from growing and multiplying and may kill tumor cells.&#xD;
      Palbociclib may prevent or slow the growth of tumor cells when used with other anti-hormonal&#xD;
      therapy. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast and gynecologic tumor cells. Fulvestrant may&#xD;
      help fight breast or gynecologic cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.&#xD;
      Giving abexinostat, palbociclib, and fulvestrant may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      breast or gynecologic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of abexinostat tosylate (abexinostat) and&#xD;
           palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for abexinostat and palbociclib when&#xD;
           combined with fulvestrant at standard dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the pharmacokinetics associated with abexinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the efficacy of abexinostat and palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant&#xD;
           in patients with antiestrogen refractory estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2&#xD;
           negative(-) breast cancer and gynecological metastatic tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as complete response (CR), partial&#xD;
           response (PR), and stable disease (SD) at 6 months and progression free survival&#xD;
           according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess correlations between overall response rate (ORR), CBR at 6 months, and&#xD;
           progression free survival (PFS) with genomic aberrations assessed as cell free tumor&#xD;
           deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histone acetylation on peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess correlations between ORR, CBR at 6 months, and PFS endpoints and peripheral&#xD;
           blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) histone deacetylase (HDAC) gene expression, PBMC&#xD;
           acetylation in vivo and ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of abexinostat and palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive abexinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18,&#xD;
      palbociclib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 1&#xD;
      and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 90 days after completion of treatment or removal from study, or&#xD;
      until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
