      1. Vaginal atrophy is the most common indication in the treatment of vaginal rejuvenation.&#xD;
           Its main manifestation is vaginal relaxation syndrome, which may be the early symptom of&#xD;
           female pelvic floor dysfunction. It is a common gynecological physiological change in&#xD;
           women. Its clinical manifestations include vaginal wall relaxation, decreased&#xD;
           elasticity, poor dryness sensitivity, internal environment disorder, and so on. Vaginal&#xD;
           exhaust, often combined with urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, chronic pelvic&#xD;
           discomfort and other symptoms, seriously affecting patients'health and quality of sexual&#xD;
           life. At present, there are many treatments for vaginal relaxation,vaginal constriction&#xD;
           and laser therapy are the most effective and widely accepted treatments. Laser therapy&#xD;
           with small trauma and short repair time has attracted much attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CO2 fractional laser (Acupulse) stimulates fibroblasts to synthesize and secrete&#xD;
           collagen fibers, elastic fibers, reticular fibers and organic matrix through dot&#xD;
           exfoliation and thermal stimulation, thus thickening the vaginal wall and achieving&#xD;
           long-term vaginal tightening effect. The heat effect of CO2 laser can stimulate&#xD;
           vasodilation, increase blood flow, increase cell oxidation and nutrients, increase&#xD;
           mitochondrial ATP release, activate cell function, enhance vaginal mucosal secretion,&#xD;
           enhance secretion, normalize vaginal PH and bacterial flora, and then reduce the&#xD;
           probability of gynecological infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. It has been reported that CO2 lattice laser can stimulate collagen synthesis and&#xD;
           rearrangement. It has also been reported that CO2 lattice laser may have important&#xD;
           clinical significance in improving the morphology and function of vaginal epithelial&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;

      1. Vaginal atrophy is the most common indication in the treatment of vaginal rejuvenation.&#xD;
           Its main manifestation is vaginal relaxation syndrome, which may be the early symptom of&#xD;
           female pelvic floor dysfunction. It is a common gynecological physiological change in&#xD;

           life. At present, there are many treatments for vaginal relaxation,vaginal constriction&#xD;
           and laser therapy are the most effective and widely accepted treatments. It should be&#xD;
           noted that patients with vaginal constriction need anti-scar training for a long time&#xD;
           after operation to prevent the effect of vaginal entrance narrowing and vaginal wall&#xD;
           scar formation on the quality of life of patients during the repair period. Therefore,&#xD;
           laser therapy with small trauma and short repair time has attracted much attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CO2 fractional laser (Acupulse) stimulates fibroblasts to synthesize and secrete&#xD;
           collagen fibers, elastic fibers, reticular fibers and organic matrix through dot&#xD;
           exfoliation and thermal stimulation, thus thickening the vaginal wall and achieving&#xD;
           long-term vaginal tightening effect. The heat effect of CO2 laser can stimulate&#xD;
           vasodilation, increase blood flow, increase cell oxidation and nutrients, increase&#xD;
           mitochondrial ATP release, activate cell function, enhance vaginal mucosal secretion,&#xD;
           enhance secretion, normalize vaginal Internal environment and bacterial flora, and then&#xD;
           reduce the probability of gynecological infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. It has been reported that CO2 lattice laser can stimulate collagen synthesis and&#xD;
           rearrangement. It has also been reported that CO2 lattice laser may have important&#xD;
           clinical significance in improving the morphology and function of vaginal epithelial&#xD;
           cells. Our center has also passed the clinical observation ethical review of CO2 lattice&#xD;
           laser to improve female vaginal relaxation in 2016, and completed the clinical trial at&#xD;
           the end of 2017. The data further confirm that CO2 lattice laser can improve vaginal&#xD;
           relaxation and is significantly effective for stress urinary incontinence.&#xD;
