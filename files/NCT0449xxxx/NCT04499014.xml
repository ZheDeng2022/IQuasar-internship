  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective study, the efficacy of ultrasonography&#xD;
      (US) and steroid phonophoresis (PH) treatments was evaluated in patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      carpal tunnel syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-seven patients (46 hands) were admitted in this study. Patients were randomly divided&#xD;
      three groups. The first group was ultrasound group, the second group was PH group and the&#xD;
      third group was placebo US group. Continuous ultrasound with a frequency of 1 MHz, an&#xD;
      intensity of 1.0 W/cm2 was used in the US and the PH groups. PH group received 0,1%&#xD;
      dexamethasone. Placebo group received a frequency of 0 MHz, an intensity of 0 W/cm²&#xD;
      ultrasound. Treatments were administered for 5 days a week, a total of 10 sessions. All&#xD;
      patients also wore night splints during treatment. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Boston&#xD;
      Symptom Severity Scale, Functional Capacity Scale, grip strength and&#xD;
      electroneurophysiological evaluations were compared before the treatment, after the treatment&#xD;
      and three months later.&#xD;

    <time_frame>three month</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in pain with Visual Analogue Scale:Patients were asked to express the pain felt by them using 0-10 scales, 0 no pain and 10 the most severe pain faced throughout their life.</description>

    <measure>Boston Symptom Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>three month</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in symptom severity with Boston Symptom Severity Scale:Patients were asked to choose an answer among five answers taking 1- 5 points in the questionnaires with 11 statements. Total point was divided into the number of statements and the score was determined and high scores were interpreted as increased symptom severity</description>

    <measure>Boston Functional Capacity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>three month</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in functional status with Boston Functional Capacity Scale:Patients were asked to choose an answer among five answers taking 1- 5 points in the questionnaires with 11 statements. Total point was divided into the number of statements and average score was determined and high scores were interpreted as functionality deformation in the hands</description>

    <measure>grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>three month</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in strength with grip strength:To assess the grip strength, baseline hydraulic hand dynamometer was used. 3 measurements were made for each patient and the average of them was calculated</description>

    <measure>electroneurophysiological evaluations</measure>
    <time_frame>three month</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline electroneurophysiological measurement:The median nerve motor conduction velocity(m/s) , the median nerve motor distal latency(ms), 2nd finger - palm median nerve sensory distal latency(ms), 2nd finger - palm median nerve sensory conduction velocity(m/s), median sensory nerve conduction velocity(m/s) and median nerve sensory distal latency between the wrist and palm(ms)</description>
