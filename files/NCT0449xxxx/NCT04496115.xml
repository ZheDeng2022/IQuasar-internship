  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety, depression and stress are common during pregnancy. These have been found to&#xD;
      negatively impact mother and child outcomes. When anxiety, depression, and stress are present&#xD;
      in pregnant women, it is therefore important to manage them to improve the outcome of the&#xD;
      mother and her child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pregnancy itself has been shown to increase anxiety, depression and stress, these&#xD;
      issues are further elevated in high-risk pregnancy groups. Mothers at risk of preterm&#xD;
      delivery (less than 37 weeks gestational age), have been found to have higher rates of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and stress compared to uncomplicated term pregnancies. In addition,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and stress symptoms themselves increase the risk for preterm delivery,&#xD;
      creating a vicious cycle for this high-risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness is a tool that has been during pregnancy to reduce depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      stress. Many studies have found mindfulness to be an appropriate management option in normal&#xD;
      term pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there have been no studies that have looked at Mindfulness as a tool for mothers&#xD;
      admitted due to risk of preterm delivery. This study will explore the impact of teaching&#xD;
      mindfulness skills to inpatient mothers at risk of preterm delivery and studying its effects&#xD;
      on maternal depression, anxiety, and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves providing Mindfulness strategies during the mother's inpatient admission&#xD;
      for the risk of preterm delivery for four consecutive weeks. Participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      through informed consent. All participants will be given pre and post participation&#xD;
      questionnaires to examine the impact of mindfulness on anxiety, depression and stress. The&#xD;
      participants will also be encouraged to maintain a weekly mindfulness log. The results of&#xD;
      this research may lead to future studies looking at the impact of mindfulness practice for&#xD;
      high-risk pregnancies. This will also help open up the possibility of offering such courses&#xD;
      for inpatient and outpatient high-risk pregnancies in the future.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety and depression are two of the most common psychological symptoms that manifest in&#xD;
      pregnant women. A recent systematic review found the prevalence of prenatal anxiety to be&#xD;
      18.2% in the first trimester, 19.1% in the second trimester and 24.6% in the third trimester.&#xD;
      A separate systematic review found rates of depression in the prenatal period to be 16.4%.&#xD;
      These symptoms have been found to negatively impact maternal health as well as fetal and&#xD;
      childhood development. It is therefore imperative that anxiety and depression be assessed in&#xD;
      all pregnant mothers and to further implement interventions to improve outcomes for both the&#xD;
      mother and fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant mothers with admission to an inpatient ward due to increased risk for preterm&#xD;
      delivery have been found to experience elevated levels of anxiety, depression and stress&#xD;
      compared to term pregnancies. Furthermore, increased anxiety and depression have been linked&#xD;
      to the risk of preterm labor, creating a vicious cycle. A 2017 study that assessed anxiety&#xD;
      and depression in a population of pregnant mothers at risk of preterm labor found 35.1% to&#xD;
      have anxiety and 69.8% having depressive symptoms. By managing the psychological symptoms&#xD;
      experienced in this cohort of pregnant mothers, the rationale is that the risks associated&#xD;
      with them might be reduced, providing improved maternal and fetal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several studies that have assessed the benefits of mindfulness as a tool in&#xD;
      reducing anxiety, stress and depression specifically in pregnancy. A 2016 meta-analysis found&#xD;
      that mindfulness-based interventions are effective at reducing pregnancy related depression,&#xD;
      stress, and anxiety. A randomized controlled trial assessed pregnant women with high levels&#xD;
      of stress and anxiety after six weeks of mindfulness practice with results demonstrating&#xD;
      larger decreases in pregnancy specific anxiety as compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness has been implemented as an intervention prior to delivery with encouraging&#xD;
      results. It has also been used in the post-partum period in environments such as the Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where parental anxiety, depression and stress are elevated due to&#xD;
      admission of their newborn after birth. Recent studies have shown that when mindfulness is&#xD;
      used in the NICU environment, it assists with reduction of depressive, anxiety and trauma&#xD;
      symptoms as well as improving maternal sleep Mindfulness also helped mothers deal with acute&#xD;
      stressors more appropriately and promoted awareness and reduced stress related emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there have been no studies that have looked at Mindfulness as a tool for mothers&#xD;
      admitted due to risk of preterm delivery. The study being proposed here, would assess the&#xD;
      impact of mindfulness in the prenatal period, in a group of mothers who are experiencing&#xD;
      elevated levels of depression, anxiety and stress due to the risk of preterm delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that pregnant women will experience less depression, anxiety&#xD;
      and stress with mindfulness and will increase their mindful awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a non blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recruitment of participants, randomization into either the mindfulness group or the&#xD;
      control group will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness Group (MG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants within the mindfulness group will be instructed by a mindfulness&#xD;
      practitioner/coach once a week for four weeks in one-on-one sessions. Weekly journals will be&#xD;
      provided to measure adherence. Optional mindfulness audio files may be used to continue&#xD;
      mindfulness practice in between guided mindfulness sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group (CG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants within the control group will receive care as usual without any additional&#xD;
      mindfulness techniques provided during the four-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General Demographic Form: A researcher created maternal demographic data form (age,&#xD;
           educational level, number of gestations, parity, prior experience with mindfulness,&#xD;
           history of depression and anxiety) to be completed by the mother at enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale: 21 item Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale to be&#xD;
           completed by the mother at enrolment and at the end of the four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy Related Anxiety Scale: 10 item Pregnancy Related Anxiety Scale to be completed&#xD;
           by the mother at enrolment and at the end of the four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mindfulness Scales: 15 item Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale and the 13 item&#xD;
           Toronto Mindfulness Scale will be completed by the mother at enrolment and at the end of&#xD;
           the four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mindfulness Weekly Journal: Document recording the duration of mindfulness practice&#xD;
           every day during the four-week intervention to assess adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 info&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be in-person recruitment and data collection, but all in-person interactions will&#xD;
      be put on hold until social distancing requirements have been lifted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be managed using Research Electronic Data Capture, a secure, web-based&#xD;
      software platform, hosted at the University of Alberta. Group demographics were compared with&#xD;
      t-test, chi-square and Mann-Whitney U as appropriate. The scores of the four questionnaires&#xD;
      will be analyzed with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for within group comparison and the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test for between group comparisons. The Spearman correlation test will be used&#xD;
      in the mindfulness group for correlation between the mindfulness scores and the stress,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression scores. 2-tailed p-values will be used.&#xD;
