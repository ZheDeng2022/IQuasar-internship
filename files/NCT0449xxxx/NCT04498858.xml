  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, 34% of the adult population is smoking every day. The links between smoking and&#xD;
      the development of several chronic disorders is well established and smoking is directly&#xD;
      implicated in most of the oral diseases such as cancers of the oral cavity. Thus, dentists&#xD;
      have access to an area of the body that is actively affected and this gives them a central&#xD;
      role in dispensing advice and support regarding smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentists often cite issues such as lack of time or education as a reason for why they do not&#xD;
      offer support for smoking cessation. A brief intervention can increase smoking cessation by&#xD;
      30 to 100% (ie 1-3% in absolute value). The &quot;5A&quot; approach integrates and extends the brief&#xD;
      intervention. It consists in Asking about smoking status, Advising smokers of the benefit of&#xD;
      stopping, Assessing motivation to quit, Assisting smokers in their quit attempt, Arranging&#xD;
      follow-up with stop-smoking services. For practitioners who do not have enough time, a &quot;3A&quot;&#xD;
      approach might be acceptable (Ask, Advice and Act) by providing details of local stop smoking&#xD;
      services and/or prescribing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). This very brief advice can be&#xD;
      delivered in less than one minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigators knowledge, the role of dentists in the French national tobacco-free program&#xD;
      is not yet documented in France while since 2016, dentists can prescribe NRT with some&#xD;
      products taken in charge by the French health insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intervention taking part in the continuing professional development will be developed so&#xD;
      the dentists fell legitimate, motivated and competent to talk with their patients about their&#xD;
      tobacco consumption and to assist them in their smoking cessation process. This intervention&#xD;
      based on the 5/3A approach and prescription of NRT will include a specific training and&#xD;
      provision of management kit, with communication tools and network for appropriate references.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that 5/3A approach is feasible with adequate intervention in dental&#xD;
      practices in France (dentists apply the approach to 90% of their patients) and that the&#xD;
      format, the conditions, the barriers and the lever actions of its implementation are known.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Europe, 29% of individuals are smokers, and tobacco use is directly related to 650,000&#xD;
      mortalities each year across the continent, around 14% of all deaths. In France, 34% of the&#xD;
      adult population is smoking everyday (www.OFDT.fr). The links between smoking and the&#xD;
      development of several chronic disorders is well established and long-term smokers are more&#xD;
      likely to die from a disease directly related to their habit. Smoking is also responsible for&#xD;
      a large burden of evitable morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a dental perspective, smoking is directly implicated in most of the oral diseases&#xD;
      (periodontal diseases, dermatological disorders of the oral mucosa, bad breath,&#xD;
      peri-implantitis…). Smoking is also directly related to the development of potential&#xD;
      malignant lesions of the oral mucosa and cancer of the oral cavity. Thus, dentists have&#xD;
      access to an area of the body that is actively affected and this gives them a central role in&#xD;
      dispensing advice and support regarding smoking cessation. Fifty percent of the EU population&#xD;
      regularly visit a dentist and in France, a survey conducted in 2014 showed that 63.5 % of the&#xD;
      15-75 year-old respondents reported to have visited their dentist in the 12 previous months.&#xD;
      These data show that dentists have access to a large number of smokers with the opportunity&#xD;
      to offer information and support regarding smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentists often cite several issues, such as lack of time or limited education, to explain why&#xD;
      they do not offer support for smoking cessation. A Cochrane review showed that a brief&#xD;
      intervention by health professionals is effective in helping tobacco users to quit. This&#xD;
      'brief' advice in primary care settings has been shown to increase smoking cessation by 1-3%.&#xD;
      Whilst this number seems small, it represents a large number of people from a population&#xD;
      point of view. By referring to stop smoking services, successful cessation increased to 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;5A&quot; approach to smoking cessation is the internationally accepted approach integrating a&#xD;
      &quot;brief intervention&quot; for nicotine users. The 5A protocol can be summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask about and record smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advise smokers of the benefit of stopping in a personalized and appropriate way.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess motivation to quit (using stages of change model).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assist smokers in their quit attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arrange follow-up with stop smoking services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advice from the healthcare practitioner does not have to be focused on the details of&#xD;
      cessation and requires only three minutes. Whilst knowledge of the treatment modalities to&#xD;
      result in cessation are useful, ultimately the specialized stop-smoking services will be able&#xD;
      to discuss any potential issues adequately with the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For practitioners who genuinely do not have time, a 3A approach may be acceptable. As&#xD;
      dentists seem to be content with the first two 'A' in either scenario, it is the addition of&#xD;
      'action' on responses which increases success rates in quitting. This can be summarized as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask and record smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advise patient of personal health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Act on patient's response by providing details of local stop smoking services and/or&#xD;
           prescribing NRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This very brief advice can be delivered in less than one minute and there is an absence of&#xD;
      conclusive evidence to indicate that the 5A approach is more successful than the 3A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors are aware of the need to be pragmatic in the approach to smoking cessation in the&#xD;
      dental setting, therefore advice that the 3A approach is the best brief intervention to be&#xD;
      undertaken by dentists. It is easier to complete than the 5A and, if done properly, both&#xD;
      approaches result in similar rates of smoking cessation. Dentists can choose the most&#xD;
      convenient approach to their practice and refer their patients to specialized care when&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, the effectiveness of a very brief structured counselling for tobacco was&#xD;
      evaluated cessation in Swedish dental clinics. It was observed that a brief and structured&#xD;
      counselling based on the 5A model in dental practice may achieve positive behavioural&#xD;
      modifications among tobacco users, with significant reduction of tobacco consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General dentists are used to deliver preventive messages focused on oral hygiene (tooth&#xD;
      brushing, flossing, reduction of sugar intake…) but they are less likely to deliver general&#xD;
      health-promoting messages. A literature review on the factors associated with the delivery of&#xD;
      lifestyle support in general dental practice has shown that organizational changes in dental&#xD;
      practices to encourage more team working and professional time for lifestyle support may&#xD;
      influence delivery of such messages. It was also observed that dental professionals who are&#xD;
      smokers may require training to develop their beliefs about the effectiveness of smoking&#xD;
      cessation interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, even if they are well positioned to offer tobacco cessation advice and support,&#xD;
      dentists do not always discuss their patient's tobacco use. A study by Smith et al showed&#xD;
      that motivated dentists were particularly good at offering smoking cessation to patients.&#xD;
      However, less than 50% of dental practices involved in the study offered referrals to stop&#xD;
      smoking services. Further studies confirm that dentists are often poor at referring to stop&#xD;
      smoking services, or offering brief interventions at the dental practice. There is therefore&#xD;
      a need to understand the factors, barriers and lever action which influence dentists&#xD;
      'practices toward tobacco cessation advice and support. When it is considered that patients&#xD;
      expect their oral health professionals to assist in cessation attempts, this gives further&#xD;
      reason for dental professionals to understand and implement cessation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By utilizing the 'stages of change' approach to smoking cessation, an individual's&#xD;
      willingness to quit smoking can be ascertained, with provision of knowledge on potential&#xD;
      interventions empowering patients to make their own decisions on cessation modalities. Since&#xD;
      2016, in France, dentists can prescribe nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and it will be&#xD;
      reimbursed to the patients by the French health insurance at a rate of 65%. NRT can reduce&#xD;
      physical cravings and pharmacotherapies can reduce the desire to smoke. Stop-smoking services&#xD;
      can provide smokers with interpersonal support and electronic cigarettes are increasing in&#xD;
      popularity but cannot be recommended as a completely safe way of delivering nicotine.&#xD;
      Interpersonal support in combination with NRT and/or pharmacotherapy is now considered the&#xD;
      safest and most successful method of smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, the role of dentists in the French national tobacco free program is not yet&#xD;
      documented in France while the &quot;Conseil de l'Ordre des Chirurgiens-dentistes&quot; was associated&#xD;
      to this program launched in 2014. Also, the role of dentists was underlined in the HAS&#xD;
      recommendations in 2014 as any other health professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the impact of tobacco smoking on oral health and the frequency of individuals&#xD;
      visiting them, dentists should be made aware and feel legitimate in their first line role in&#xD;
      terms of smokers 'management combining 5/3 A approach, prescription of NRT and reference to&#xD;
      specialized care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous professional training is mandatory and could be an opportunity to improve dentists&#xD;
      'motivation and skills to provide advice and support to their patients. By familiarizing the&#xD;
      dental team with gold-standard cessation interpersonal and NRT support and by providing them&#xD;
      with appropriate communication and reference resources, it can be ensured that smokers are&#xD;
      assisted at every available opportunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea is to develop an intervention that take part in the quality approach of the dental&#xD;
      practice in the context of the continuing professional development so the dentists fell&#xD;
      motivated, legitimate and competent to talk with their patients about their tobacco&#xD;
      consumption and to assist them in their smoking cessation process. This intervention based on&#xD;
      the 5/3A approach and prescription of NRT will include adequate training and provision of&#xD;
      management kit with communication tools and network for appropriate references. To develop&#xD;
      this intervention, it is necessary to have a comprehensive acknowledgement of all the factors&#xD;
      with which the intervention fits, relative to the recommendations, to the health professional&#xD;
      him/herself, the human and organizational environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that 5/3A approach is feasible in dental practices in France&#xD;
      (dentists apply the approach to 90% of their patients) with adequate intervention and that&#xD;
      the format, the conditions, the barriers and the lever actions of its implementation are&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
