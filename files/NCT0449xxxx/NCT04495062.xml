  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition which affects&#xD;
      approximately 3 million people in the UK and 210 million worldwide. The disease is&#xD;
      characterized by progressive air flow obstruction and decline of lung function. COPD is&#xD;
      currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world. The main reason for&#xD;
      hospitalisations associated with COPD is exacerbations (chest infections or a worsening of&#xD;
      the underlying symptoms). Severe COPD exacerbations are the second largest cause of emergency&#xD;
      admissions in the UK. Mild and moderate exacerbations can be managed in the community but if&#xD;
      they are not identified promptly they may progress to breathlessness and in some patients to&#xD;
      respiratory failure. Thus, finding modalities for early detection and diagnosis of&#xD;
      exacerbations is clearly a priority for current and future COPD research. However, these&#xD;
      still do not exist. The aim of this study will be to acquire acoustic respiratory signals&#xD;
      from COPD patients with a small wearable device. These signals will be subsequently used to&#xD;
      carry out engineering research with the objective of trying to find &quot;fingerprints&quot; in them&#xD;
      which could be early indicators of disease exacerbations. If those &quot;fingerprints&quot; were found,&#xD;
      subsequent research could focus on trying to create software methods which, together with the&#xD;
      use of a small wearable device, would aim at automatically detecting exacerbations when they&#xD;
      are at very early stages- prior to the symptoms being evident to the patient- so that&#xD;
      clinical intervention could be triggered, in order to optimize the disease outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a condition characterised by progressive&#xD;
      air-flow obstruction, decline in lung function caused by airway inflammation and damaging of&#xD;
      air sacs. The resulting narrowing of airways makes it harder to breathe in and out. COPD is&#xD;
      currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and in the UK the National Institute&#xD;
      for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) estimates that the total direct cost of COPD to the&#xD;
      NHS is over £800million - out of which £300 million correspond to hospitalisations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is widely acknowledged that anything that improves management and effectiveness&#xD;
      of treatment will not only improve patients' quality of life but also result in savings from:&#xD;
      1) Emergency hospital admissions; 2) Potential GP visit; 3) Loss of productivity due to work&#xD;
      in absenteeism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe COPD exacerbations (periods where there is acute worsening of respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      such as cough, dyspnoea, wheezing, increased sputum production) cause one in eight hospital&#xD;
      admissions. Mild and moderate exacerbations can be managed outside hospital but if not&#xD;
      identified and treated promptly may progress in some patients to respiratory failure. A&#xD;
      significant proportion of these exacerbations will require inpatient treatment and can reduce&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients increasing their morbidity and mortality. Thus, finding&#xD;
      modalities for early detection and diagnosis of exacerbations is clearly a priority in&#xD;
      current and future COPD research, but currently these still do no exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longer term goal of our research is to have a novel acoustic based wearable wireless&#xD;
      technology that will be able to monitor COPD patients for extended periods of time, and&#xD;
      automatically provide early detection of potential exacerbations even prior to symptoms which&#xD;
      can be treated promptly to minimise their likelihood of progression to higher levels of&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a small wearable device which is easy to use and for the first time allows&#xD;
      continuous non-intrusive recordings of respiratory sounds and more specifically has been&#xD;
      designed to optimise transmission of the acoustic signals generated by airflow within the&#xD;
      trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will aim to acquire signals from two groups of COPD patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A group undergoing exacerbations&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A second group of stable, potential exacerbators, COPD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of patients undergoing exacerbations will be recruited from medical wards and&#xD;
      patients who agree to participate in the trial will be fitted with the device during their&#xD;
      inpatient stay. Clinical data will be collected including but not limited to: co-morbidities,&#xD;
      medications, oxygen given; timing of exacerbations medications (antibiotics, steroids,&#xD;
      nebulisers) and observations. Patients will also be given a diary to complete during their&#xD;
      inpatient stay for when they are ambulating, documentation of sputum production as well as&#xD;
      other activities. Patients will also be given the option of taking the device home for&#xD;
      several days whilst recovering from their exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stable patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics and if clinically stable&#xD;
      trained to use a device to take home for a pre-agreed period of time, up to one month. They&#xD;
      will be expected to wear the device at night whilst sleeping and will have support throughout&#xD;
      if needed. They will also be asked to complete a diary which documents amongst other things,&#xD;
      sputum production, any exacerbations, symptoms, exercise and a range of other activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will be given usability questionnaires regarding comfort, usability,&#xD;
      ease of the device and also be invited to attend focus groups to feedback about the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to develop a novel acoustic based wearable technology which will in the&#xD;
      long term monitor COPD patients for an extended time period and automatically provide early&#xD;
      detection of potential exacerbations. This has several benefits including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disease management optimisation resulting in better quality of life and lower severity&#xD;
           of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prompt and early treatment of exacerbations leading to fewer hospital admissions and can&#xD;
           slow disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can potentially result in more personalised treatment and management, with efficient use&#xD;
           of drugs and reduction in treatment cost.&#xD;
