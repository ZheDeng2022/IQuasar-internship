  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical students and medical residents are subject to increased stressors throughout their&#xD;
      education. There is increased depression, anxiety, burnout, and distress in medical trainees&#xD;
      compared to the general population. Globally, roughly 3 out of 10 medical students experience&#xD;
      anxiety. A recent study also found that almost 3 out of 10 medical trainees experience&#xD;
      depression or depressive symptoms and approximately 1 out of 10 have suicidal thoughts. All&#xD;
      of this leads to poorer academics, increased dropout rates as well as reduced empathy and&#xD;
      quality of care in affected trainees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness programs are increasingly being used in medical schools to help deal with&#xD;
      increased levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and burnout. Several studies have looked at&#xD;
      medical students, medical residents, and various other healthcare professionals. These&#xD;
      programs have been found to reduce depression, anxiety and stress while significantly&#xD;
      improving mood, well being and mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although in-person mindfulness programs have shown several benefits, there are limitations to&#xD;
      its use in medical programs. A lack of time, flexibility, accessibility as well as the issue&#xD;
      of cost, impact the uptake of in-person mindfulness programs. A potential alternative to this&#xD;
      is online mindfulness programs. To date, there is limited research regarding medical students&#xD;
      and online mindfulness programs. With that being said, studies focussed on other populations&#xD;
      and online mindfulness have shown reductions in depression, anxiety and stress with&#xD;
      improvements in mindfulness and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study being proposed involves providing online mindfulness to medical students and&#xD;
      residents in an 8-week program that consists of 8, 1-hour sessions with a mindfulness coach.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled through informed consent. All participants will be given pre&#xD;
      and post participation questionnaires to examine the impact of online mindfulness on anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, stress and burnout. The results of this research may lead to future studies&#xD;
      looking at the impact of online mindfulness practice for medical trainees and might also help&#xD;
      open up the possibility of offering such programs in medical schools.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transition to medical school and the subsequent years that follow are a period of&#xD;
      increased stress on trainees. Research shows that there is a higher prevalence of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and burnout amongst U.S. and Canadian medical students compared to the general&#xD;
      population. In addition, distress is consistently higher in medical trainees compared to the&#xD;
      general population and in age matched non-medical students. A recent systematic review found&#xD;
      the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms in medical trainees to be 27.2% and&#xD;
      suicidal ideation to be 11.1%. A separate systematic review found that the prevalence of&#xD;
      anxiety in medical students was 33.8% globally. Increased levels of distress and anxiety lead&#xD;
      to poorer academics and increased dropout rates, as well as a reduced empathy, enthusiasm,&#xD;
      and quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intervention that has been gaining traction in recent years to manage the psychological&#xD;
      strain placed on medical trainees is mindfulness training. A study of 140 second year medical&#xD;
      students participating in a 10-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program reported&#xD;
      significant improvement in mood and reduced psychological distress. Similar results have been&#xD;
      found in randomised controlled trials with health care professionals as well as surgical and&#xD;
      psychiatric residents. Furthermore, a 2017 systematic review of 19 papers looking at the&#xD;
      effectiveness of mindfulness interventions in healthcare professionals found them to decrease&#xD;
      stress, anxiety and depression while improving mindfulness, empathy and mood. These benefits&#xD;
      may potentially continue over the long term based on results from a 2018 longitudinal study&#xD;
      of mindfulness training in medical and psychology students. At the six year follow up with&#xD;
      the intervention group, they reported increased well being, mindfulness, and problem-focused&#xD;
      coping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although in-person mindfulness training has shown several benefits, there are limitations to&#xD;
      implementing these programs in the demanding schedules of medical trainees. In addition to a&#xD;
      lack of time, flexibility, costs, anonymity, and accessibility may limit its effectiveness as&#xD;
      well. A modality that may reduce these limitations is online mindfulness. This format allows&#xD;
      flexibility with regards to when trainees would be able to access the material, it would be&#xD;
      more cost effective and could be accessed from rural and remote areas as suggested in a 2020&#xD;
      pilot study completed with Australian rural medical students. Results indicated significant&#xD;
      reduction in perceived stress and increases in self compassion 4 months after the 8-week&#xD;
      online mindfulness program. Online mindfulness interventions have been studied in several&#xD;
      other populations and a 2016 meta analysis of 15 randomised controlled trials, found online&#xD;
      mindfulness interventions to reduce depression, anxiety, and stress with an associated&#xD;
      increase in well being and mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is limited research looking at online mindfulness as a tool for medical&#xD;
      students and residents. The study being proposed here, would assess the impact of an online&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention on medical trainees with regards to depression, anxiety, stress,&#xD;
      burnout, and mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the potential benefits of online mindfulness on depression, anxiety, stress, and&#xD;
      burnout in medical trainees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the changes in mindfulness level over the course of an online mindfulness program&#xD;
      offered to medical trainees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that medical students and residents that participate in the&#xD;
      online mindfulness program will report reduced depression, stress, anxiety, and burnout as&#xD;
      well as improved mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recruitment, all participants will complete a general demographic form as well as&#xD;
      four scales that measure depression, anxiety, stress, burnout, and mindfulness. The same four&#xD;
      scales will be completed by all participants at the end of the mindfulness training and 3&#xD;
      months after the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online Mindfulness Intervention (OMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be instructed by a mindfulness practitioner/coach online through 8,&#xD;
      1-hour sessions over the course of eight weeks. Trainees will have the ability to retrieve&#xD;
      the online sessions at their convenience. Weekly journals will be provided to measure&#xD;
      attendance and frequency and duration of mindfulness practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Demographic Form: A researcher created demographic data form (age, educational level,&#xD;
      prior experience with mindfulness, history of depression and anxiety) to be completed by the&#xD;
      medical trainees at enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale: 21 item Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale to be&#xD;
      completed by the medical trainees at three time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oldenburg Burnout Inventory for Students: 16 item scale to measure burnout in students&#xD;
      completed at three time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness Scales: 15 item Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale and the 13 item Toronto&#xD;
      Mindfulness Scale will be completed by the medical trainees at three time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness Weekly Journal: Document recording the duration and frequency of mindfulness&#xD;
      practice during the study to assess attendance to the online class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be managed using Research Electronic Data Capture, a secure, web-based&#xD;
      software platform, hosted at the University of Alberta. Group demographics will be compared&#xD;
      with t-test, chi-square and Mann-Whitney U as appropriate. The scores of the four&#xD;
      questionnaires will be analyzed with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for within group&#xD;
      comparison. The Spearman correlation test will be used for correlation between the&#xD;
      mindfulness scores and the stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout scores. 2-tailed p-values&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
