  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that QIV-HD induces an immune response (as assessed by hemagglutination&#xD;
      inhibition [HAI] geometric mean titers [GMTs] and seroconversion rates) that is superior to&#xD;
      responses induced by QIV-SD for the 4 virus strains at 28 days post-vaccination in all&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response induced by QIV-HD and QIV-SD by HAI measurement method&#xD;
           in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of all subjects in each study group.&#xD;

      Study duration per participant will be approximately 28 days including: 1 day of screening&#xD;
      and vaccination, a safety follow-up telephone call and an end of study visit approximately at&#xD;
      Day 8 and 28 after vaccination, respectively.&#xD;
