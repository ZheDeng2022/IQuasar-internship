  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In individuals needing a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), right heart failure (RHF) is&#xD;
      a serious complication post-surgery, associated with worsened outcomes including mortality.&#xD;
      However, predictors of decompensation after LVAD are not well established. Liver dysfunction&#xD;
      pre-LVAD has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes post-LVAD, but the interplay&#xD;
      between liver abnormalities and RHF post-LVAD is not well characterized. Liver stiffness (LS)&#xD;
      is a measure associated with certain types of liver abnormalities (e.g., liver fibrosis;&#xD;
      cirrhosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we hypothesize that elevated LS measured by SWE is associated with increased morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in patients undergoing LVAD implantation and yields increased need for advanced&#xD;
      postoperative HF therapies including the use of right ventricular assist devices (RVAD) for&#xD;
      the management of RHF.&#xD;

      PRESTUDY ASSESSMENTS Note: Assessments that are part of the standard of care and obtained&#xD;
      within 3-4 weeks of prestudy assessment visit, are acceptable as part of the screening tests.&#xD;
      Results of such tests will be acceptable even if obtained prior to the execution of the&#xD;
      Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to entry into the study, the following assessments will be performed to determine if&#xD;
      patient is eligible to continue in the study as per section 4.2 and 4.3 describing the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A signed Patient Informed Consent Form must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A signed Patient Authorization Form (HIPAA) must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. It has been confirmed that the patient meets all inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
           exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of concomitant medications must be obtained within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
           registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENTS DURING STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following evaluations will be performed during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. An assessment of liver stiffness will be performed by shear wave elastography using a&#xD;
      Supersonic Imagine Aixplorer ShearWave™ ultrasound machine. Liver stiffness assessment will&#xD;
      be performed at a baseline visit (i.e., before LVAD placement for those undergoing LVAD&#xD;
      therapy), and if feasible at 1 month and 6 months post-therapy (for those undergoing advanced&#xD;
      therapy [i.e., LVAD or transplant]) or at 1 month and 6 months post-baseline (for those not&#xD;
      undergoing advanced therapy.) FOLLOW UP ASSESSMENTS The duration of patient participation in&#xD;
      the study will be a total of 12 months, which is counted from LVAD placement (or from&#xD;
      baseline, for those not undergoing LVAD therapy). Follow-ups will be performed at 1 month, 6&#xD;
      months, and 12 months, during which the following information will be documented on the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Patients who die or withdraw consent are considered off study and no further&#xD;
      information will be collected.&#xD;
