      A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the effect of Chinese herbal&#xD;
      medicine combined with curcumin defined as a dietary supplement on a study group of women&#xD;
      with endometriosis, compared to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Benefit of pain in women suffering from symptoms of endometriosis patients taking herbal&#xD;
      extract for 4 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structure of the study:A prospective, double-blind, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      (randomized) placebo-controlled trial involving women suffering from endometriosis symptoms&#xD;

      The women will be randomly divided into the following two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Group - Taking a daily dose of dietary supplement extract capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group - take a daily dose of Invo capsules Treatment efficacy will be measured&#xD;
           according to a dedicated patient questionnaire with endometriosis symptoms that assess&#xD;
           quality of life measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic and progressive gynecological disease, with an estimated invention&#xD;
      of between 8-10% of women of childbearing age in the Western world . The disease is&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of tissue resembling endometrial tissue . The tissue cells that&#xD;
      are in the uterine space can settle on different organs in the pelvis. The cells continue to&#xD;
      respond to the hormonal cycle as if they were inside the uterus and in each menstrual can&#xD;
      grow and bleed. At the same time, an inflammatory process can be associated with various&#xD;
      symptoms of pain. Symptoms are not specific but usually cyclical according to menstrual&#xD;
      timing and include: severe menstrual cramps, heavy bleeding, diarrhea and constipation,&#xD;
      infertility, urinary pain, recurrent infections, fainting, intercourse pain, leg pain and&#xD;
      more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current practice is based on the removal of endometriosis lesions in surgery and / or&#xD;
      drug therapy designed to suppress existing lesion activity and prevent lesion recurrence&#xD;
      after surgery. To diagnose endometriosis in a definite way it is necessary to visually&#xD;
      identify the lesions and by biopsy in surgery. In many patients, the symptoms of&#xD;
      endometriosis can be treated pharmacologically and without surgery . Therefore, it is now&#xD;
      widely accepted in many cases to treat pharmacologic anatomy empirically based on an&#xD;
      estimated endometriosis-based diagnosis of appropriate anemia, gynecological examination, and&#xD;
      vaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little has been investigated regarding the integration of endometriosis phenomena&#xD;
      through complementary medicine that includes herbs and acupuncture, despite the vast clinical&#xD;
      knowledge and experience gained. In the present study, we would like to examine the effect of&#xD;
      complementary medicine that would include a combination of herbal remedies for pain symptoms&#xD;
      in women with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the Western world has begun to integrate complementary medicine in various&#xD;
      treatments for chronic diseases and in particular endometriosis . The Chinese language review&#xD;
      included 13 Chinese randomized clinical trials from 1994 to 2000. The studies included 1076&#xD;
      women who received Chinese herbs alone or in combination with recognized drugs . The proposed&#xD;
      mechanism is that the herbs are involved in regulation of the endocrine and immune system and&#xD;
      which improve blood flow and anti-inflammatory activity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of Chinese herbs to affect physiological changes indicates a mechanism of&#xD;
      biological action of the herbs. However, the medicinal plants appear to have lower potency&#xD;
      activity than synthetic drugs. They can contain an anti-inflammatory but less active&#xD;
      ingredient than synthetic steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Rationale Endometriosis is a chronic disease of infertile women. The main treatment&#xD;
      is based on hormone drug therapy and surgical treatment. There are patients who, despite&#xD;
      these treatments, still suffer from symptoms of endometriosis. There are also patients who&#xD;
      are medically balanced but have to stop treatment for various reasons and need another&#xD;
      non-hormonal response. Herbs have been found effective in treating gynecological problems and&#xD;
      especially in chronic pelvic pain. They may relieve the symptoms in those women who wish to&#xD;
      avoid hormone or surgical treatment or who are not symptomatically balanced despite the usual&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study Investigate the effectiveness of treatment of symptoms and quality&#xD;
      of life measures by the use of medicinal plants in women with symptoms of endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Results Primary Endpoints Benefit of pain indices in women suffering from&#xD;
      symptoms of endometriosis between patients taking herbal extract and patients taking Invo for&#xD;
      4 months of treatment. Benefit is defined as a statistically significant improvement in VAS&#xD;
      dimensions that will be examined by a daily journal and medical questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Results Secondary Endpoints Quality-Of-Life Benefit Defined as a statistically&#xD;
      significant improvement in questionnaire indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, a reduction in the use of painkillers and a lack of working days each month between the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research product:Chinese herbal extract and curcumin extract, which appear as nutritional&#xD;
      supplements in the Ministry of Health database, the research product is packed in 800mg&#xD;
      capsules.&#xD;
