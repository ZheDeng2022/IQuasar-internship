  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the cortical developement of perceptual skills&#xD;
      and executive functions over time, in children with cochlear implants aged 10-24 months and&#xD;
      3-7 years compared with normally hearing subjects (NHS). To do this, the investigator will&#xD;
      use functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS) during 4 tasks that engage the childs&#xD;
      perceptual and cognitive skills over a period of 18 months. The performance scores obtained&#xD;
      by each participants as well as the cortical activity will be analysed and decrypted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When confronted with a severe to profound congenital bilateral hearing loss, cochlear&#xD;
      implantation is considered to be the preferential treatment method as it restaures auditory&#xD;
      function and enables language acquisition for communication purposes. When cochlear&#xD;
      implantation is done before 2 and a half years old, better results are obtained in terms of&#xD;
      language, communication and social developement, as well as reading skills. However when a&#xD;
      cochlear implantation occurs between 2 and 5 years of age, speech and language skills do&#xD;
      develop but communication and reading skills are altered. Therefore, when a cochlear implant&#xD;
      is placed before the age of 2 and a half we find ourselves within the maximal cerebral&#xD;
      plasticity window for speech, language and communication developement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into two cohorts, the first aged 10-24 months and the second 3-7 years.&#xD;
      All children will be seen for 5 sessions, spread out at regular intervals, over a period of&#xD;
      18 months and will participate in two perceptual tasks and two cognitive tasks. The children&#xD;
      will also have a speech and language assessment at T-0 and T+12. The cochlear implanted&#xD;
      patients will continue to be seen by the ENT service and the sessions will be organised to&#xD;
      coincide with their natural follow up. As it is a non-interventional study, no follow-up&#xD;
      would be needed. After the study patients will continue to receive the same quality of care.&#xD;

    <description>Functional neuroimaging examination by fNIRS at each follow-up visit for all children of both cohorts: this non-invasive imaging technique involves the installation of a cap carrying electrodes to collect brain activity on the surface of the scalp , during stimulation. It is very insensitive to movement and therefore represents a method particularly suitable for its use in children. In addition, this technique is compatible with the cochlear implant. It will be used during 6 tasks adapted to each cohort</description>
