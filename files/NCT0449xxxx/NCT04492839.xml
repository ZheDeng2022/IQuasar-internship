    <textblock>
      To determine the effect of an intestinal adsorbent on hydrogen and methane breath levels in&#xD;
      patients who have been on long term PPI therapy reporting reflux and abdominal symptoms at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;

      Participants will be recruited either through clinics at the functional gut clinic or through&#xD;
      interest shown to advertising for the study. If the patient is deemed eligible they will be&#xD;
      given atleast 24 hours to review the patient information sheet. If they would like to proceed&#xD;
      with participation they will be given the chance to ask the study team any questions. If they&#xD;
      would still like to proceed the participant will be asked to sign three copies of the&#xD;
      informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be required to visit the clinic twice during the study. The day before&#xD;
      visit 1 the patient will be required to follow a low residue diet as part of preparation for&#xD;
      the hydrogen methane breath. On the day of the first visit participants will complete a&#xD;
      hydrogen methane breath test as per the functional gut clinics test protocol, the patient&#xD;
      will also be asked to fill two questionnaires about their symptoms. Participants will then be&#xD;
      provided with a 10 day bowel and symptom diary and a 10 day supply of blinded the intestinal&#xD;
      adsorbent . Participants will be provided with instructions on how to take the the study&#xD;
      product and training on completing their daily diary. They will be required to take the study&#xD;
      product for 10 consecutive days according to manufacturers instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return for the second and final visit on the final day of consuming the&#xD;
      study product. The day before visit 2 the patient will be required to follow a low residue&#xD;
      diet as part of preparation for the hydrogen methane breath. On the day of the second visit&#xD;
      participants will complete a hydrogen methane breath test as per the functional gut clinics&#xD;
      test protocol, the patient will also be asked to fill two questionnaires about their&#xD;
      symptoms. Once these study procedures are complete the participants will have finished their&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;

    <measure>To determine the effect of Silicolgel on hydrogen and methane breath levels in patients who have been on long term PPI therapy reporting reflux and abdominal symptoms at baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hydrogen and methane breath testing will be used to take readings of participants breath gas levels (hydrogen and methane) as a measure of microbial fermentation.&#xD;
Mean change in cumulative total breath hydrogen and methane, will be determined from baseline HMBT to end of study HMBT. Cumulative total hydrogen and cumulative total methane will be calculated independently of one each other. Breath hydrogen and breath methane will be measured in units of parts per million (ppm). Statistical significance will be determined using a paired t-test (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
Each HMBT samples will be analysed using gas chromatography analysis on the day of the breath test being carried out. Breath carbon dioxide will also be measured in order to verify the validity of each sample and apply a correction factor. A correction factor above 2.5 (CO2 &lt; 2%) is considered an invalid sample.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the effect of Silicolgel on abdominal symptoms in patients who have been on long term PPI therapy reporting reflux and abdominal symptoms at baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS-SSS is a validated questionnaire that will be used to determine severity of abdominal and bowel symptoms. The questionnaire is comprised of 7 questions, 5 of which are scored from 0 to 10. The total of these 5 questions will be calculated and multiplied by 10 to determine symptom severity. Mean difference in scores from baseline IBS-SSS and end of study IBS-SSS will be determined using a paired t-test, to determine significance (p&lt;0.05).</description>

    <description>The Reflux Questionnaire is a validated questionnaire that will be used to determine severity of upper GI symptoms. The questionnaire is made up of 16 questions, each scored 0 to 5. The total of these 16 questions will be calculated to determine symptom severity. Mean difference in scores from baseline reflux questionnaire and end of study reflux questionnaire will be determined using a paired t-test, to determine significance (p&lt;0.05).</description>
