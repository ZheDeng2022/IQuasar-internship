  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of standard pneumonia management guidelines and multiple global&#xD;
      efforts, pneumonia continues to be the leading killer of children under five, accounting to&#xD;
      around 17% of the total under five deaths globally. In Pakistan, pneumonia contributes to 16%&#xD;
      of under five mortality in the country having a well-defined yet poorly functional healthcare&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, there are standard set of guidelines for management of pneumonia patients however,&#xD;
      the management practices of this illness are variable across the country. This could be&#xD;
      attributed to non-availability of work ready graduates which in turn is due to variations of&#xD;
      teaching methods across various institutions. Although the medical students across these&#xD;
      institutions do get exposed to clinical cases in the final year however, this exposure is&#xD;
      also variable. If this clinical experience is coupled with an adjunct capacity building mode&#xD;
      using an online platform. there is a possibility that students could be trained in a better&#xD;
      way.&#xD;

      The investigators plan to use e-learning portal in identification and management of under&#xD;
      five pneumonia cases as it is one of the leading killers of children under five which is&#xD;
      largely managed non-uniformly across the country. The investigators will use videos of&#xD;
      patients under five years of age with pneumonia and allow virtual performance of clinical&#xD;
      skills by medical students in an online platform. Such a platform can prove to be an adjunct&#xD;
      to standard clinical education rather than a substitute. The investigators propose that this&#xD;
      platform will help the medical students to prepare them for a range of clinical challenges as&#xD;
      it is an ideal strategy for the development, refinement, and rehearsal of skills in&#xD;
      recognition in a safe environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To measure final year medical student's theoretical (knowledge) and&#xD;
      applied (virtual clinical performance) learning on under five pneumonia case management in an&#xD;
      e-learning package&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To explore associations between student characteristics and outcomes&#xD;
      following exposure to the e-learning program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This will be a multi-center quasi experimental study with final year medical&#xD;
      students studying in various institutions in the twin cities of Pakistan&#xD;
      (Islamabad/Rawalpindi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the package will be based on the FIRST2ACT Web platform which is an e-learning&#xD;
      platform for medical students which focuses on exposure of the users to different adult&#xD;
      simulated case scenarios in the form of videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three categories of case scenarios, based on WHO classification of pneumonia, will be&#xD;
      presented to the students. Thus case scenarios of patients with no pneumonia, pneumonia and&#xD;
      severe pneumonia will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of study: The study will be conducted in the following three stages all of which will&#xD;
      be mostly conducted electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Piloting of existing resources: The case scenarios will be created of children under five&#xD;
      suffering from pneumonia. The host organization MNCHRN has an archive of different videos of&#xD;
      patients of pneumonia already available which have been developed as a part of another&#xD;
      activity. Consent forms from the caregivers of the patients in the videos including&#xD;
      permission to use them in future for other purposes are in the record. These videos after&#xD;
      testing will be incorporated in the program. If it is felt that the existing content does not&#xD;
      fulfil the purpose, then new videos will be recorded of under five pneumonia cases in a&#xD;
      hospital facility by taking consent from the caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of new cases: If required, new videos showing different types of pneumonia in&#xD;
      under five children visiting a clinic or admitted in a hospital will be recorded. Approval&#xD;
      from the clinic/ hospital will be taken to include their patients and to record videos in&#xD;
      their premises. Consent from the carers/parents to videotape their children would also be&#xD;
      taken. Details on the purpose of the study and their participation will be explained to them&#xD;
      and will also be provided in written form prior to signing the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development and testing of portal: Who, how, where, what framework shall be employed for the&#xD;
      development and implementation of the e-learning package. An expert of IT will be recruited&#xD;
      for the development of portal. Portal will be tested by the research team, medical students&#xD;
      and paediatricians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invitation to institutions to participate: The heads of each institution will be approached&#xD;
      to provide permission for involvement of their final year medical students. Approval and&#xD;
      ethical clearance from institution's research committees will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introductory seminar: After approval, seminars for final year medical students to facilitate&#xD;
      their participation in the study will be conducted in each institution. Purpose of the study&#xD;
      and the use of portal will be explained to them. Information sheets and consent forms will be&#xD;
      distributed to the students at the end of the seminar and they will be given one week to&#xD;
      consider the information and decide if they want to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's consent and enrolment: Name of the student and institution, age, gender, phone&#xD;
      number, email address will be taken from the interested students at the time of enrolment in&#xD;
      the study. Once enrolled, the students will be informed that a login ID to access the e&#xD;
      learning platform will be provided at their email addresses. The same login ID will be used&#xD;
      as the participant's identifier and the means of linking individual data throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following online questionnaires will be filled in by the enrolled students after they log&#xD;
      on to the portal for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic and clinical experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-test self-assessment of knowledge, skills, confidence, and competence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study debriefing: Each participant will be able to access a narrated PowerPoint presentation&#xD;
      on the intervention with instructions within the portal. The briefing will describe the&#xD;
      approach and scenarios in general with examples the participants would see and instructions&#xD;
      on selecting clinical actions and receiving feedback. It will also explain the parameters&#xD;
      (number of attempts and time taken to complete the case scenario) that will be accounted in&#xD;
      the scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure on online clinical cases: This will be an online program; therefore the students&#xD;
      will be able to access it anywhere and anytime they feel convenient provided there is&#xD;
      internet connectivity. In case there is interruption of internet due to electricity shortage,&#xD;
      efforts will be made to keep the interface such that the students takes up from where they&#xD;
      left provided the shortage is not of more than one hour as the student might forget some&#xD;
      components of the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students after log in to the portal will undergo a planned electronic encounter with an under&#xD;
      five patient suffering from pneumonia. For each case, students will have to identify the&#xD;
      category of pneumonia and the appropriate treatment/ management in a timed session The&#xD;
      interface will be developed such that upon login, the student will be given an opportunity to&#xD;
      select cases. Upon clicking on the icon of the age group, the participant will have a screen&#xD;
      popping up showing a typical case of either no pneumonia, pneumonia or severe pneumonia. The&#xD;
      video will run for around thirty seconds to one minute during and after which the students&#xD;
      will try to identify the case and select it from the drop down menu of whether it is no&#xD;
      pneumonia, pneumonia or severe pneumonia. There will be tabs for history, examination,&#xD;
      diagnosis and management. The student will select the best suited response from a range of&#xD;
      options.Based on the selection of the response and the time taken to do so, a score will be&#xD;
      generated. The student can take three attempts for each case scenario. The total score will&#xD;
      be an average of all attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback on the scored performance: Based on the score the student will be provided with&#xD;
      general formative feedback incorporating patient diagnosis and best practice management for&#xD;
      that case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will continue for six months with instructions to log in every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention stage: Participants will complete the knowledge post-test and a&#xD;
      self-evaluation of skills, competence and confidence in managing under five patients after&#xD;
      the intervention. The overall performance of each student will be scored and students will&#xD;
      receive a summarized feedback and provided with links to resources for further self-directed&#xD;
      learning. Finally, they will complete an evaluation of their experience and receive a&#xD;
      printable certificate of completion.&#xD;
