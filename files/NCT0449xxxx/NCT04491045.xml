    <textblock>
      The study is a Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness study that will primarily test the&#xD;
      implementation strategies on provider adoption and implementation quality in three Vietnam&#xD;
      provinces. Secondarily, the effectiveness of the multicomponent collaborative care model for&#xD;
      depression intervention on patient outcomes will be tested. A cluster randomized control&#xD;
      trial design, with a mixed-methods approach, will be used to assess the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      three implementation strategies on both organizational and provider implementation outcomes&#xD;
      and patient effectiveness outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a prevalent and debilitating mental health condition that is relatively common&#xD;
      in almost all countries around the world, including Vietnam, and is one of the largest&#xD;
      burdens of health. Although effective treatments exist, many with depression do not receive&#xD;
      appropriate care. In Vietnam, numerous barriers exist to implementation of evidence-based&#xD;
      mental health services but recently there has been growing recognition of the need to address&#xD;
      the treatment gap. In order to close the treatment gap for depression, within the health care&#xD;
      system, effective depression care needs to be scaled up to a wider network of community&#xD;
      health stations that are supported by the local psychiatric hospitals. However, it is unclear&#xD;
      what the best implementation model is for supporting depression care in primary care&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to compare three different models of implementation support for&#xD;
      depression care in two Vietnam provinces: 1) Supported Implementation when implementation&#xD;
      support is provided and 2) Sustainment Phases, when study funded implementation supports are&#xD;
      withdrawn. The providers in select community health stations (CHSs) within these two&#xD;
      provinces) will receive training workshops and varying levels of implementation support based&#xD;
      on the implementation models (described below) to provide depression care to their patients.&#xD;
      The three models are : 1) Usual Implementation (UI) - a basic depression workshop, limited&#xD;
      technical assistance to set up the program, and implementation toolkits 2) Enhanced&#xD;
      Supervision (ES) - UI + ongoing structured supportive supervision; and 3) Community Engaged&#xD;
      Learning Collaborative (CELC) - ES + community collaborative learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three models will be evaluated based on the RE-AIM framework, which will be assessed&#xD;
      using implementation and patient outcomes across supported implementation phase and&#xD;
      sustainment phase. Both implementation and patient outcomes will be assessed during the&#xD;
      sustainment phase after resources are withdrawn to evaluate the sustainability of the&#xD;
      program. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to inform implementation of&#xD;
      depression care services across Vietnam, and help increase access and quality of depression&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Provider Competence Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Providers will be assessed by their supervisors for their overall competence in delivering the components of depression care every 6 months for 24 months. There are 18 items related to depression care skills (e.g., screening, psychoeducation, behavior activation, problem solving, medication management, etc.), Each item is scored on a 3 point scale from 1 to 3 (1-needs improvement, 2-satisfactory, 3-excellent). A total of 54 points can be obtained, with higher score indicating higher competence. N/A is used when a particular skill is not expected of that provider (i.e., community health workers are not expected to assess or manage medication). These ratings are conducted by supervisors at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months.</description>

    <measure>Patient Depression Scores (PHQ) Change from Baseline to 6 month</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be assessed for depression using self-reported depression measure (PHQ). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Total scores are used and they range from 0 to 27, with PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.</description>

    <description>Supervisor Rated LIFE-DM session adherence and quality. Supervision of groups involve observation of group facilitation by supervisors, who provide adherence and quality ratings of sessions. Each item is assessed on a 4 point scale - 0 (did not do), 1 (delivered but poor), 2 (average), and 3 (excellent). The items are averaged to provide a session speciﬁc score of adherence and quality. Session adherence /quality scores are used to compute provider level adherence and quality averages. Each supervisor was expected to provide ratings for a minimum of 3 assessments out of the 12 group sessions. These session ratings are used to compute the average adherence and quality score for each provider. Higher scores indicate higher adherence and quality.</description>

    <description>Patient - SF-12 - Change in functioning from baseline to 6 months. The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12-item subset of the SF-36v2™ that measures the same eight domains of health (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, Mental Health). It is a brief, reliable measure of overall health status. Scores are calibrated so that 50 is the average score or norm. This norm-based score allows comparison among the three surveys and across the more than 19,000 studies published in the past 20 years.</description>

    <description>Patient - McMaster Family Functioning Scale - Change from baseline to 6 months. This is a 12 item scale (on a 4 point scale). the average score across items is used to determine the degree of problematic family functioning. A score of 2.00 or above indicates problematic family functioning. The higher the score, the more problematic the family member perceives the family's overall functioning.</description>

    <description>The CELC arm is an integration of community engagement and learning collaborative approach which involves province-wide collaborative meetings for commune health stations (6 CHSs for each province) randomized into the CELC implementation condition. CELC CHSs will meet monthly initially for 3 months, followed by bi-monthly meetings for 12 months to engage in continuous quality improvement process, track implementation goals, problem solve implementation barriers, and engage in cross-site learning. This is in addition to usual implementation condition (supervision, workshops, technical assistance, and evidence-based toolkit)</description>

    <description>This is an evidence-based training approach which involves 6-9 months of ongoing group supervision support from psychiatric hospital mental health specialist (psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, or psychologist) for each community health station randomized to the ES condition. Supervision approach is structured and involves observation of sessions, feedback on fidelity and quality. Supervision support will be provided biweekly initially and monthly after completion of one practice case. This is in addition to usual implementation condition (workshops, technical assistance, and evidence-based toolkit)</description>
