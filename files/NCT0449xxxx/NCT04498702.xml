  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of oral APL-1202 administered consecutively for 12 weeks in&#xD;
      subjects with high-risk NMIBC relapsed from intravesical chemo/BCG therapy based on the&#xD;
      recurrence-free rate (RFR) at 12 months after APL-1202 treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial was a single-arm, open-label, multi-center clinical study consisting of two&#xD;
      periods: the dose-escalation and treatment period, and the follow-up and maintenance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-Escalation and Treatment Period APL-1202 was orally administered TID daily and&#xD;
      continuously for 12 weeks. APL-1202 dose was increased from daily 300, 450, 600 to 750mg or&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified 3+3 design was employed: The dose was started at 300 mg and increased to 450 mg,&#xD;
      600 mg and 750 mg if there was no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in 3 subjects after 4-week&#xD;
      consecutive administration of APL-1202. When the dose-escalation study was in progress, the&#xD;
      doses for any newly enrolled subjects would be the starting dose or the highest dose&#xD;
      confirmed with no DLT by the dose-escalation cohort at the time of enrollment. When the MTD&#xD;
      or the 750 mg daily dose was attained as a safe dose, the dose for all subjects in the study&#xD;
      or subsequently enrolled subjects would be MTD or 750 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and Maintenance Period APL-1202 was orally administered at the highest safe dose&#xD;
      proven by the dose-escalation cohort, continuously for 3 months; This period was 12 months.&#xD;
      To fit the 3-month cystoscopy follow-up schedule, the maintenance therapy, starting from&#xD;
      3-month off, was given continuously every other 3 months, resulting in 6 months of dosing in&#xD;
      total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APL-1202 daily administration schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose: within 30 minutes after breakfast; The second dose: within 30 minutes after&#xD;
      lunch, and there should be a 4-hour interval between the first and second doses; The third&#xD;
      dose: taken with a light snack at night before going to bed.&#xD;
