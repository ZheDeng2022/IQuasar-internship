  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance Care Planning (ACP) is a process where patients (and their families if appropriate)&#xD;
      discuss with their doctors and nurses what may happen as their illness progresses, including&#xD;
      how they (and their family) would like to be supported and cared for. The discussion of&#xD;
      expectations and choices for care can then be formally recorded and used to guide and inform&#xD;
      future care. Well documented benefits of ACP include empowering patients and their families&#xD;
      to better understand available choices and make informed decisions regarding future careÍ¾&#xD;
      This ensures care is based on what is important to that patient (and their family) and&#xD;
      prepares all for the end of life. However, few people with a life limiting illness (such as&#xD;
      cancer) have an ACP. Patients and families often find future and end of life care a difficult&#xD;
      subject to discuss, as do doctors/nurses, who fear upsetting patients and families and who&#xD;
      may have limited training/experience in how to prompt and record ACP discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to overcome the barriers in discussing ACP by using the Trajectory&#xD;
      Touchpoint Technique. The technique utilises a range of existing service evaluation and&#xD;
      service design methods found in &quot;service management&quot; and &quot;design systems&quot;. Rich pictures are&#xD;
      used in the form of cartoons on an electronic tablet or printed card, to enable&#xD;
      patients/families to lead discussions. The images are simple and enable people to raise&#xD;
      sensitive and potentially distressing topics at a pace they are comfortable with, rather than&#xD;
      responding to numerous pre-determined questions. The technique was originally designed to&#xD;
      explore the experiences of patients (and their families) of Hospice Care and has been&#xD;
      successfully used in over 200 interviews, demonstrating an ability to sensitively facilitate&#xD;
      difficult conversations whilst enabling rich and detailed discussion.&#xD;

      1.1 BACKGROUND In 2014, academics at the University of Liverpool Management School who are&#xD;
      service quality researchers were approached by East Cheshire Hospice (ECH). ECH provides&#xD;
      specialist palliative care for people with progressive life-limiting illnesses, providing&#xD;
      services to patients, carers and families via inpatient and outpatient units and day&#xD;
      facilities. ECH strives for excellence in service and the patient experience. Anecdotal&#xD;
      stories and other forms of feedback provided plenty of evidence that the work of the hospice&#xD;
      was meaningful. However, ECH did not have any systematic, robust way of capturing these&#xD;
      experiences. Hence, while ECH was often told it had transformed the experience of patient's&#xD;
      at the most critical time in their lives and that it was needed and appreciated by many&#xD;
      service users, there was nothing but anecdotal evidence to back up this feedback. Worried&#xD;
      that such superb feedback could actually lead to complacency, the team at ECH commissioned&#xD;
      the University to undertake a 'deep-dive' of the impact of hospice services upon the&#xD;
      different inpatient and outpatient service users associated with ECH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team, comprising Prof Philippa Hunter-Jones and Dr. Lynn Sudbury-Riley, designed a new&#xD;
      qualitative research technique to follow the user's experience at every touchpoint in their&#xD;
      journey. In 2015, interviews with 38 in-patients, outpatients, visitors and bereaved families&#xD;
      enabled a 'deep-dive' to uncover perceptions of the whole service experience among these&#xD;
      diverse users. Results of this new approach suggested the technique fully captures the&#xD;
      hospice experience and suggests areas for improvements to hospice services. Indeed, the&#xD;
      results of the study have informed the strategy and operations of ECH, and, mindful of&#xD;
      continuous improvement, ECH have requested that the exercise is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other hospices heard of the success of this work and the team were commissioned by Oakhaven&#xD;
      Hospice in Hampshire to work with them, too. Additionally, based on the success of the&#xD;
      project, the project was shortlisted by the school for a REF impact case, and the team were&#xD;
      awarded funding to repeat the project in further hospice and palliative care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Academic Palliative Care Unit on 4Y at RLBUHT was one of the palliative care units to be&#xD;
      evaluated next. From the service evaluation project on 4Y grew the novel idea to use the TTT&#xD;
      as part of the Advanced Care Planning (ACP) conversation lead by clinicians. ACP is not&#xD;
      consistently carried out for all patients that might have a need. There is also not a&#xD;
      consistent way in which ACP is conducted to ensure quality is maintained within the patient&#xD;
      centric approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY Advance Care Planning (ACP) is the process of making choices&#xD;
      and plans in regards of future care for patients with life limiting disease, particularly&#xD;
      those who may lose the capacity to communicate. ACP has been shown to positively impact on&#xD;
      the quality of end-of-life care, yet few (only 6-8%) have a completed formal ACP: a result of&#xD;
      patients' anxieties about discussing future care issues and clinicians' concerns over&#xD;
      responsibility and starting a &quot;difficult&quot; conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will test a new methodology, the Trajectory Touchpoint Technique - a&#xD;
      visual/pictorial technique - that aids difficult conversation. In a recent trial, the&#xD;
      technique has successfully enabled patients to direct in-depth and sensitive conversations&#xD;
      regarding their experiences of Hospice care. This technique exhibits the potential to&#xD;
      overcome barriers in ACP discussions, enabling patients to direct the conversation at their&#xD;
      pace/level of comfort, and empowering clinicians to sensitively facilitate depth and detail.&#xD;
      Therefore the research question is: Is the Trajectory Touchpoint Technique a feasible&#xD;
      intervention to support Advance Care Planning in patients/families with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 THE TRAJECTORY TOUCHPOINT TECHNIQUE The Trajectory Touchpoint Technique uses the concept&#xD;
      of touchpoints; anything that fosters or impacts experiences. Touchpoints are any potentially&#xD;
      important issue that a participant may wish to talk about. It is important to stress that a&#xD;
      touchpoint is only valid if it is considered to be so by the participant. Potential&#xD;
      touchpoints can be big or small, tangible or intangible. Rich pictures, in the form of&#xD;
      cartoons and easy to recognise signs and symbols are used to reference potentially important&#xD;
      touchpoints. Such rich picture methodologies are particularly appropriate for complex&#xD;
      research situations where multiple forces and interactions between those forces are present,&#xD;
      and can capture and elucidate potential influences that may otherwise remain hidden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique uses a qualitative, narrative data collection method and touchpoints are&#xD;
      grouped together into key stages or themes. These groups of cartoon touchpoints are presented&#xD;
      on an I-Pad/Electronic Tablet or printed onto large laminated cards and used as a prompt/aide&#xD;
      memoire to guide discussion. Figure 1 provides an example of one group of touchpoints used to&#xD;
      collect data on the experiences of care in a children's hospice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior use of the technique with over 200 palliative care patients and their families&#xD;
      demonstrates that the cartoons make people smile and help people to relax, even when the&#xD;
      content of the discussion is distressing. Patients and their families are free to choose from&#xD;
      the range of touchpoints, and to add anything else that they may see fit. Importantly, the&#xD;
      pictures guide the discussion, making difficult discussions easier as there is a greatly&#xD;
      reduced need for probing and/or pre-determined clinician led questioning. Touchpoints remind&#xD;
      people of things that they may have otherwise omitted from the discussion. Our experience&#xD;
      suggests that the technique enables a 'deep dive' into the feelings, fears and wishes of&#xD;
      palliative care patients and their families, aids systematic and comprehensive data&#xD;
      collection, yet is very easy to use and understand.&#xD;
