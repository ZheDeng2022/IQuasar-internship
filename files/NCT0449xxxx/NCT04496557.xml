  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label feasibility study. A maximum of 15 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled. All participants will undergo a novel neurofeedback intervention, targeting&#xD;
      down-regulation of deep limbic structures, specifically the amygdalae. Participants will&#xD;
      complete 12 neurofeedback sessions delivered twice weekly over 6 consecutive weeks. The&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered via the PRISM platform.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    The investigators received funding for a near-identical FDA regulated trial before opening this&#xD;
    study to enrollment - the IRB requested closure of the unfunded pilot trial to create a new&#xD;
    submission.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in CAPS-5 score from screening to completion</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit (Week 0), and Post-Intervention Visit (Week 9)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview used to:&#xD;
Make current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD&#xD;
Make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD&#xD;
Assess PTSD symptoms over the past week &quot;1, 2&quot; rule is used to determine a diagnosis: a frequency score of 1 (scale 0 = &quot;none of the time&quot; to 4 = &quot;most or all of the time&quot;) and an intensity score 2 (scale 0 = &quot;none&quot; to 4 = &quot;extreme&quot;) is required for a particular symptom to meet criterion.&#xD;
The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in PCL-5 score from baseline to completion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit (Week 1), and Post-Intervention Visit (Week 9)</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. The self-report rating scale is 0-4 for each symptom. A total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items.</description>

    <description>Neurofeedback sessions targeting down-regulation of deep limbic structures, specifically the amygdala, delievered via PRISM: a non-significant risk device (software) intended to be used in research studies testing the clinical efficacy of an innovative paradigm for EEG-based neurofeedback.&#xD;
The study will include 12 EEG-NF sessions, administered twice per week for a duration of 6 &quot;active&quot; weeks in total. Twice weekly sessions will be held on non-consecutive days. Each session will last 30 minutes.&#xD;
EFP-EEG-NF training: Each NF training session consists of 5 consecutive sequences of NF presentations. During a &quot;watch&quot; condition (60 seconds) participants are instructed to passively view the animation, and are told that that the scenario does not influence their brain activity. In the &quot;regulate&quot; phase (60 seconds) participants are instructed to lower the room's unrest level. A &quot;rest&quot; phase (15 seconds) follows each sequence, allowing participants to relax.</description>
