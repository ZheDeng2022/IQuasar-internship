  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several recent systematic reviews have highlighted how the macrodesign of dental implants can&#xD;
      influence stress distribution and biomechanical and biological behavior in implants&#xD;
      immediately inserted in post-extraction sites. Finite element analyzes have confirmed the&#xD;
      benefit of the inclination of the implant threads in reducing implant displacement in&#xD;
      post-extraction sites, increasing primary stability, and decreasing stress in contact with&#xD;
      the trabecular bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other comparative studies have shown that the design of the threads of the implant does not&#xD;
      affect the distribution of stress in the surrounding bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the need to evaluate the influence of implant macrodesign in the case of implants&#xD;
      inserted in post-extraction alveoli, this study will examine the clinical results of two&#xD;
      different types of implants with different macrodesigns, with the aim of providing scientific&#xD;
      evidence in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will investigate through a randomized controlled trial the effect of thread&#xD;
      macrodesign of X-space implants on primary stability and osseointegration when inserted in&#xD;
      post-extraction sites, as compared to cylindric 2P implants.&#xD;

      Objectives Evaluate the clinical and radiological performance of a new implant geometry&#xD;
      (X-space) with a central and apical thread designed to increase the contact surface with the&#xD;
      alveolar bone and allow a greater insertion torque and better primary stability in&#xD;
      post-extraction implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be done through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimation of the difference in terms of dimensional changes of the alveolar bone&#xD;
           between the following implants placed in fresh post-extraction sites: (1) X-space (test&#xD;
           group), (2) Bone System 2P (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimation of implant failure and success&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimation of primary stability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimation of the following secondary variables: operative and post-operative&#xD;
           complications, pain, and discomfort of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The null hypothesis is that there is no statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternative hypothesis is that the X-space implant is superior to the Bone System 2P&#xD;
      implant in terms of dimensional changes of the vestibular bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even in the event of non-statistical significance, factors concerning clinical significance&#xD;
      and secondary variables will be assessed in order to determine the efficiency of each of the&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design The study will be a randomized clinical trial with two&#xD;
      arms, each arm belonging to one of the two intervention groups. The randomization sequence&#xD;
      will be computer-generated by an independent statistical specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the interventions will be performed by the same surgeon (Prof. Grassi FR) who will be&#xD;
      aware of the type of intervention to be performed only after tooth extraction, therefore&#xD;
      immediately before performing the intervention of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of intervention will be assigned by means of sealed opaque envelopes that will be&#xD;
      open immediately before the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with adequate and exhaustive information for participation in the&#xD;
      study and each patient must sign a detailed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the interventions performed and the procedures followed in this study are in accordance&#xD;
      with the ethical standards of the committee responsible for human experimentation&#xD;
      (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, revised in 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size was determined for a first type error (alpha) 0.05 and a study&#xD;
      power of 0.9 (beta 0.1). The reference variable is the dimensional change of the thickness of&#xD;
      the vestibular crest (measured at the implant platform level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimal effect of interest assessed from previous studies and the researchers' clinical&#xD;
      evaluation was established at 1 mm, while the standard deviation was 0.6 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering a 20% loss at follow-up, the sample size required for each group was determined&#xD;
      at 15 participants, or 30 participants in all.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Procedures foreseen by the study Thirty implants (15 X-Space and 15 Bone System Cylindrical&#xD;
      &quot;2P&quot;) of variable diameter and of adequate length will be immediately inserted in the&#xD;
      post-extraction sites of thirty patients with therapeutic indications for implantation. The&#xD;
      implants (Bone System, Milan) are produced on machining centers and subjected to rigorous&#xD;
      cleaning treatments and high precision dimensional checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ecotek surface of the Bone System implants boasts a long experience of 25 years of&#xD;
      clinical applications, Implant surface treatment is obtained by sandblasting with ruby&#xD;
      corundum and subsequent etching treatment with acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Surgical protocol In all cases, the extractions will be carried out without lifting the&#xD;
      flap and preserving the vestibular wall of the alveolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All implants will be inserted at the crest level and will be closed by a screw. The surgical&#xD;
      procedure requires insertion into the implant tunnel by means of a controlled torque&#xD;
      micromotor (max 50 Ncm), at a speed of 20/25 rpm; for this purpose it is necessary to have a&#xD;
      special driver (40120701) inserted in the contra-angle handpiece; for manual insertion with&#xD;
      controlled torque, a dynamometric ratchet (CRD) with the relative short (40052401) and&#xD;
      standard (40052501) drivers are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the possibility of insertion with a manual screwdriver is maintained, with the usual&#xD;
      tools already used for the other Bone System implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-extraction site will be closed with a collagen membrane and cross suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods Variables to be measured (outcomes) Patients will undergo a CT Cone&#xD;
      Beam examination immediately after implant insertion and 6 months later to evaluate the&#xD;
      morphological and dimensional changes of the alveolar bone horizontally and vertically around&#xD;
      the tooth / implant. All the measurements will be carried out in a computerized program which&#xD;
      will allow to standardize the repeated measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements on the CT Cone Beam exams and the measurements of the secondary variables&#xD;
      will be carried out by an operator not aware of the group to which the patients belong (blind&#xD;
      examiner).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for stopping the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observation of high difference between the techniques, indicating one technique as more&#xD;
           efficient than the others or a technique as much less efficient than the other (ethical&#xD;
           reason).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High number of patients lost at follow-up (greater than expected when calculating the&#xD;
           sample size).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the exit of the subject from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missing presence at the control at 1 and 3 months (for general evaluation and oral&#xD;
           hygiene control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missed presence at check and measures at 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of collaboration at the oral hygiene level (oral hygiene assessment indices)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ongoing presence of periodontal diseases or oral mucous membranes. Ongoing presence of&#xD;
           systemic diseases (or related medical therapies) that may influence bone metabolism and&#xD;
           tissue healing (e.g. Osteoporosis, corticosteroid therapy, immunodepressive therapies,&#xD;
           chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected duration The foreseeable duration of this study is 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical data analysis The statistical analyzes will be carried out by a statistical&#xD;
      analysis expert, on coded and non-identifiable groups. The statistical unit will be the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyzes will be conducted for all demographic variables at the beginning and end&#xD;
      of therapy. Mann-Whitney test will be used for statistical comparison analyzes of continuous&#xD;
      variables between independent groups. In addition, several multilevel regression analyzes&#xD;
      will be conducted to assess the dependence of bone changes on the initial thickness of the&#xD;
      vestibular wall and on various patient-related variables. For statistical tests the p-value&#xD;
      will be established at 0.05.&#xD;
