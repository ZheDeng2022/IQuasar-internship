  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is already used in the work-up for&#xD;
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and could partially replace invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography (CAG) to rule out proximal coronary lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the diagnostic accuracy and yield of pre-TAVI CTA to detect coronary&#xD;
      lesions (≥50% DS and ≥70% DS) in the proximal coronary segments on a per-patient and a&#xD;
      per-segment level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The DEPICT CTA database consists of individual patient data of four studies that&#xD;
      analysed the diagnostic accuracy of pre-TAVI CTA to detect coronary lesions. For this&#xD;
      analysis, diagnostic accuracy was assessed in the left main and the three proximal coronary&#xD;
      segments.&#xD;

      Methods Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy and yield of pre-TAVI CTA to detect&#xD;
      coronary lesions (≥50% DS and ≥70% DS) in the proximal coronary segments on a per-patient and&#xD;
      a per-segment level. The secondary objective was to perform a subgroup analysis of the&#xD;
      individual included studies and to assess the influence of atrial fibrillation and heart rate&#xD;
      on the diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature search and study selection Studies were selected from our previous systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of CTA for the detection of significant&#xD;
      CAD in TAVI work-up [4]. These studies were supplemented with studies that were retrieved by&#xD;
      an updated literature search in OVID MEDLINE (including Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process &amp;&#xD;
      Other Non-Indexed Citations) and OVID EMBASE from January 1, 1946 to October 01, 2019.&#xD;
      Studies were excluded if they were not reporting original data of patients who received both&#xD;
      pre-procedural multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and CAG for the evaluation of CAD in&#xD;
      the work-up of TAVI. The authors of 8 studies were approached to jointly perform a&#xD;
      meta-analysis of individual patient data. The authors of 4 studies could accommodate the data&#xD;
      for a per segment analysis [5-8]. The methodological quality of the included studies was&#xD;
      assessed using the modified Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy Included in&#xD;
      Systematic Reviews-2 criteria (QUADAS-2) [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The data sets included patient characteristics regarding age, sex, body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) and the heart rate during CT-scan. Information about co-morbidities included the&#xD;
      presence of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral atrial&#xD;
      disease, hypertension, a history of smoking, presence of CAD and a history of PCI or coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass grafting. Technical CT scanner information included scanner type, number of&#xD;
      detector rows, number of slices, detector width, CT scanner rotation time, scan protocol and&#xD;
      settings (tube voltage and tube current), contrast agent type and volume, dose length&#xD;
      product, and nitroglycerine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coronary segments were categorized in three categories: lesions &lt;50% DS, lesion ≥50-70%&#xD;
      DS or lesions ≥70% DS), according to the 18-segment coronary model of the Society of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Computed Tomography or the American Heart Association modified 15-segment&#xD;
      model [10,11]. All studies used a cut-off of ≥50% diameter stenosis to determine the presence&#xD;
      of obstructive CAD. Three out of four studies also used a cut-off value of ≥70% DS [5,7,8],&#xD;
      which were used for an additional analysis of the diagnostic accuracy to detect ≥70% DS&#xD;
      proximal obstructive coronary lesions. If a segment had poor image quality or severe motion&#xD;
      artefacts, it was labelled as non-diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data analysis was performed using the statistical software R version&#xD;
      3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Continuous variables were&#xD;
      presented as means with standard deviations (SD). The distribution of continuous variables&#xD;
      was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies&#xD;
      and percentages. The prevalence of proximal lesions of ≥50% DS and of ≥70% DS was computed&#xD;
      from the measurements with invasive CAG, because revascularization with PCI is only&#xD;
      considered in case of a proximal ≥70% DS lesion.(ref ESC guideline) Diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      pre-TAVI CTA, as compared to pre-TAVI CAG, was defined as the sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      positive - (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and was derived from the number of true&#xD;
      positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (TP) and false negatives (FN). The&#xD;
      analysis of the primary endpoint was performed on a per-patient and per-segment level.&#xD;
      Diagnostic accuracy was computed for CTA to detect obstructive proximal coronary lesions of&#xD;
      more than 50% DS and also of ≥70% DS lesions in a subgroup of patients were the data was&#xD;
      available. All non-diagnostic segments were considered as abnormal tests and were labelled as&#xD;
      if there was a lesion. For the per-patient analysis of diagnostic accuracy, patients were&#xD;
      regarded as having proximal obstructive lesions if there was a minimum of one non-diagnostic&#xD;
      segment. Diagnostic yield was defined as the number of patients that would not need an&#xD;
      invasive CAG if pre-TAVI CTA was used as a gatekeeper to rule out obstructive proximal&#xD;
      lesions and was derived from the sum of the negatives (TN + FN). For the subgroup analysis,&#xD;
      we analysed the diagnostic accuracy in the individual included studies and assessed the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy in the subgroups with atrial fibrillation and a heart rate &lt;70 and ≥70&#xD;
      b/min. The diagnostic accuracy in the individual studies and the subgroups was assessed on a&#xD;
      per-patient level for lesions ≥50% DS.&#xD;
