  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase IIa study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      safety, and efficacy of APG-115 as a single agent or in combination with APG-2575 in patients&#xD;
      with T-PLL. The study consists of two parts. A total of 24-36 T-PLL patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In Part 1, 12-18 participants will be enrolled using a 3+3 dose escalation design. Patients&#xD;
      receive APG-115 orally once every day (QD) with meal on Days 1 to 5, and 23 days off in the&#xD;
      28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, the recommended starting dose of APG-115 in combination with APG-2575 in Part 2&#xD;
      will be determined by pooling available dose, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and efficacy&#xD;
      data of Part I, and the consequent results of conducting an integrated dose-response and&#xD;
      exposure-response analyses on the data from Part 1, after discussion between the sponsor and&#xD;
      investigators. APG-2575 will be administered orally once every day (QD) with meal (low fat&#xD;
      meal preferred) in a 28-day cycle following a daily ramp-up schedule.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study consists of Part 1 APG-115 as monotherapy and Part 2 APG-2575 in combination with APG-115 (APG-115 dose fixed). APG-115 and APG-2575 will be orally administrated on 28-day cycles. Totally 12-18 participants will be enrolled using a 3+3 dose escalation design. Patients receive APG-115 orally once every day (QD) with meal on Days 1 to 5, 23 days off on the 28-day cycles.The recommended dose of APG-115 used in combination with APG-2575 will be determined based on the data from Part 1 after discussion between the sponsor and investigators. APG-2575 will be administered orally once every day (QD) with meal (low fat meal preferred) in a 28-day cycle following a daily ramp-up schedule. Dose escalation uses a standard 3+3 design starting from 400 mg to 800 mg (400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg). APG-115 will be given at a fixed dose and started after the daily ramp-up of APG-2575 is completed.</intervention_model_description>

          5. Patients require graft versus host therapy, or require continued treatment with&#xD;
             systemic immunosuppressive agents (calcineurin inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;

             interval (Fridericia) (QTcF) &gt; 470 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who have any conditions or illness that, according to the opinions of the&#xD;
             Investigators or the medical monitor, would compromise patient safety or interfere&#xD;
             with the evaluation of safety and efficacy to the study drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients who have used strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, or moderate or strong CYP3A4&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers within washout period of 14 days or 7 half-lives before the&#xD;
