    <textblock>
      Detecting cancer as early as possible is key to achieving positive outcomes in response to&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment. The current project is aimed at validating a novel blood-based&#xD;
      breast cancer identification test (Syantra DX Breast Cancer) that has been developed by&#xD;
      Syantra Inc. Syantra DX Breast Cancer measures gene expression signatures in whole blood, and&#xD;
      has been retrospectively demonstrated in 780 samples. The test uses proprietary algorithms to&#xD;
      analyse gene expression characteristics from a novel multi-biomarker panel, and then classify&#xD;
      a sample as positive or negative for breast cancer. Based upon test performance in a&#xD;
      retrospective environment, a prospective validation study is being proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to validate Syantra DX Breast Cancer methodology and&#xD;
      biomarker panel using prospective samples, well categorized by diagnostic imaging scores,&#xD;
      pathology outcomes, and subject characteristics.&#xD;

      The current project is aimed at validating Syantra DX Breast Cancer in a UK population.&#xD;
      Results of the UK study will be combined with those from additional sites, including those in&#xD;
      Canada, with additional samples expected from the United States and South Korea. Syantra DX&#xD;
      Breast Cancer measures gene expression signatures in whole blood, and has been&#xD;
      retrospectively demonstrated in 780 samples. The test uses proprietary algorithms to analyse&#xD;
      gene expression characteristics from a novel multi-biomarker panel, and then classify a&#xD;
      sample as positive or negative for breast cancer. Based upon test performance in a&#xD;
      retrospective environment, a prospective validation study is being proposed, and is described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study seeks to evaluate performance of Syantra DX Breast Cancer in prospective samples&#xD;
      and to optimize test methodology and biomarkers. Key to performance of the study is&#xD;
      recruitment of women who have received an abnormal mammography report, and have been&#xD;
      classified under the UK Royal College of Radiologists Breast Group (RCRBG) scoring system in&#xD;
      categories 3 - 5. This will support the ability to employ the test for breast cancer&#xD;
      detection in a screening/call-back environment. To complete the study cohort, additional&#xD;
      women will be recruited from the population who have normal or benign mammography results&#xD;
      (RCRBG category 1 and 2), and/or a recent normal physical breast exam, with no history of&#xD;
      breast cancer. Blood samples will be acquired from all women following completion of an&#xD;
      informed consent procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those with an abnormal mammogram, blood will be drawn before a biopsy is performed. All&#xD;
      sample information will be de-identified, and the samples will be processed and analysed&#xD;
      according to Syantra DX Breast Cancer standard operating procedures. These procedures include&#xD;
      extracting sample RNA and aliquoting for storage in a manner that maintains sample anonymity.&#xD;
      All processing and analysis will be conducted in a blind environment without knowing the&#xD;
      associated RCRBG or pathology outcomes for any samples. Only after testing is complete will&#xD;
      sample classifications be revealed. Syantra DX Breast Cancer results will then be compared to&#xD;
      RCRBG, biopsy and pathology data to determine concordance, and statistics will be calculated.&#xD;
      If or when biomarker panel or test methodology is modified during the performance of the&#xD;
      study, samples will be reanalysed with updated test parameters. This reanalysis will make use&#xD;
      of a de-identified aliquot of sample RNA to ensure that testing is maintained in a blind&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an optional part of the study procedure that is included as 'additional research'. A&#xD;
      specific question seeking approval for the additional research is included on the study&#xD;
      consent form. For individuals who agree to participate in the additional research, material&#xD;
      extracted from their blood sample will be stored for additional investigations.&#xD;
