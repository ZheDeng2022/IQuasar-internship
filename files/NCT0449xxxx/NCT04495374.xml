  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain affects 80% of surgical patients and is one of the main negative symptoms&#xD;
      resulting from surgery. It impairs the recovery of patient since it is related to chronic&#xD;
      pain, nausea and vomiting and longer hospital stay, generating higher cost to the health&#xD;
      system. Thus, the use of new methods to control postoperative pain is recommended and&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia, an opioid-sparing strategies, has been widely used by several&#xD;
      researchers. Studies show that gabapentins have beneficial effects on postoperative pain&#xD;
      control when used as pre-anesthetic medication, also showing a reduction in opioid&#xD;
      consumption, with few adverse effects. Among gynecological surgeries, abdominal hysterectomy&#xD;
      is one of the procedures that generates the highest degree of acute postoperative pain. Thus,&#xD;
      the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of oral pregabalin (300 mg) two&#xD;
      hours before abdominal hysterectomy procedures on postoperative pain. This study is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. Patients submitted to abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy for benign pathologies will be selected and divided into two groups: the placebo&#xD;
      controlled group (P0) and the pregabalin 300 mg group (P1). Group P0 will receive a placebo&#xD;
      tablet one hour before the procedure, while group P1 will receive a 300 mg tablet of&#xD;
      pregabalin identical to the placebo tablet. The reduction of postoperative pain and the best&#xD;
      quality of patient recovery will be evaluated using the Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) and&#xD;
      the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Also, it will be evaluated the consumption of opioids as a&#xD;
      rescue analgesic medication and the presence of adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sample population of this study is 102 female patients (50 already included in the&#xD;
      study), who have undergone abdominal hysterectomy surgery for benign conditions, with or&#xD;
      without joint oophorectomy / salpingectomy. The patients received spinal anesthesia, at&#xD;
      hospital &quot;Santa Casa de Alfenas&quot; - Minas Gerais / Brazil (&quot;Casa de Caridade Nossa Senhora do&#xD;
      Perpétuo Socorro&quot;). All surgeries were performed by the same team of surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were evaluated and followed from the preoperative period, up to 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively, passing through the intraoperative period. During all stages, patients were&#xD;
      assisted by a properly trained multi-professional team, consisting of a doctor, nurse and&#xD;
      nursing technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patient to be included in the study, she must have understood and agreed with the&#xD;
      informed consent form that was explained in detail to all possible candidates in the&#xD;
      preoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blind randomized study. The patients were randomly allocated to 02 groups,&#xD;
      in which Group 1 received medication A (designated in the study as medication 1), whereas&#xD;
      Group 2 received medication B (designated in the study as medication 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants and researchers were blinded as to the use of drug / placebo to avoid&#xD;
      measurement bias. To carry out the blinding process, an external researcher was assigned to&#xD;
      randomize the groups and prepare the pills in opaque and closed envelopes characterized only&#xD;
      by a control identification (A or B), which is known only to this researcher. Patients in&#xD;
      both groups received identical sealed envelopes, 02h before the start of the anesthetic&#xD;
      procedure, only identified as medication A or B, which contained two pills in each envelope.&#xD;
      A second researcher is responsible for collecting data and monitoring the patient from the&#xD;
      intraoperative period up to 24 hours after discharge from the post-anesthetic recovery room&#xD;
      (PARR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, venoclysis was performed with jelco No. 18 or No. 20, and an infusion&#xD;
      of 08 ml.kg-1 of crystalloid solution (lactated ringer). The patients were properly monitored&#xD;
      with pulse oximetry, cardioscope, and non-invasive blood pressure monitor. After monitoring,&#xD;
      patients were premedicated with intravenous (IV) midazolam at a dosage of 0.03 mg.kg1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform spinal anesthesia, the patients were seated on the surgical stretcher by the&#xD;
      nursing team. Asepsis and antisepsis were performed at the puncture site with alcoholic&#xD;
      chlorhexidine solution. After placement of sterile drapes, local anesthesia was performed&#xD;
      with 2.0% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor. The first attempt at subarachnoid puncture was&#xD;
      performed, using the median technique, between the intervertebral levels L3-L4 or L4-L5 or&#xD;
      L5-S1, with a 25 gauge Quincke needle for subarachnoid anesthesia. If there was a technical&#xD;
      difficulty in the puncture, the paramedian puncture technique was chosen. The confirmation of&#xD;
      the correct puncture was based on the aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid. Anesthesia was&#xD;
      performed with the local anesthetic 0.5% bupivacaine at a dosage of 0.3 mg.kg-1, injected&#xD;
      from a 5 ml disposable syringe. After anesthesia, the patients were placed in the supine&#xD;
      position, and the correct level of anesthesia was proven with thermal sensitivity tests using&#xD;
      cotton soaked with alcoholic solution. After the anesthesia reached the sensory level of the&#xD;
      T4 thoracic vertebra, the surgical team was allowed to start the procedure. Prior to the&#xD;
      beginning of the surgical incision, a delayed bladder probe was performed in all patients&#xD;
      according to the surgeon's indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic changes in blood pressure were controlled with the use of vasoactive medications&#xD;
      such as ephedrine or metaraminol. For prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)&#xD;
      ondansetron was administered at a dosage of 4 mg intravenously (IV) 30 minutes before the end&#xD;
      of surgery. Tenoxicam was prescribed for all patients at a dosage of 20 mg IV at regular&#xD;
      intervals every 12 hours for the purpose of anti-inflammatory and analgesic action. For&#xD;
      analgesic relief, dipyrone IV was also prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg.kg-1 at regular&#xD;
      intervals every 6 hours. During the surgery, and also at the end of the surgery, the patients&#xD;
      were evaluated for the degree of sedation using the Ramsay sedation scale as a basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgery, the patients were referred to the post-anaesthesia care unit,&#xD;
      where they were monitored again, and went through the pain assessment process using the&#xD;
      visual analog scale (VAS) in relation to pain at rest and &quot;movement&quot; (the patient was asked&#xD;
      to perform the forced cough movement), through a direct question with scale demonstration.&#xD;
      Pains characterized as mild (0 - 2 VAS) received no medication other than those already&#xD;
      prescribed; pain characterized as moderate (3 - 7 EVA) received IV morphine at a dosage of&#xD;
      0.025 mg.kg-1; and severe pain (8 - 10 VAS) received IV morphine at a dose of 0.05 mg.kg-1&#xD;
      every 01 h until analgesic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To consider themselves able to be discharged from the post-anaesthesia care unit for clinical&#xD;
      follow-up in wards, patients should reach a score ≥ 9 on the modified Aldrete Scale and have&#xD;
      VAS pain scores ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the infirmary, patients were tested at regular intervals for pain intensity, by of a team&#xD;
      of nurses trained and qualified to do so. The patients had pain classified as moderate (VAS ≥&#xD;
      2 &lt;8) or severe (VAS ≥ 8), receiving drugs with morphine IV in the dose of 1 mg and 2 mg&#xD;
      respectively, according to the medical prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 h after discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit, in the ward, all the patient was&#xD;
      assessed by the same examiner who performed an assessment at the post-anaesthesia care unit,&#xD;
      who stratified the patient again from the EVA and assessed using the McGill questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire hospitalization period, the use of central nervous system (CNS) depressant&#xD;
      drugs (example: ketamine, droperidol, promethazine) and / or analgesic drugs that do not&#xD;
      contain any study protocol was avoided. If some patients were medicated with these drugs,&#xD;
      they were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data related to surgery (pre, trans and postoperative) were collected for statistical&#xD;
      analysis, according to Annex II, in which a total duration of surgery in minutes; the total&#xD;
      intravenous medication infused; the values of mean arterial pressure and heart rate in the&#xD;
      pre, intra and postoperative period; a presence or not, as well as a quantity, of PONV in the&#xD;
      post-anaesthesia care unit and after 24h; presence or not of dizziness as a possible side&#xD;
      effect; among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data selected through the study will be digitized and analyzed using the Statistic® 7.0&#xD;
      software. The data will be compared using repeated measures ANOVA, followed by Newman-Keuls&#xD;
      post-hoc, being considered for p &lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative pain assessment, 24 hours after abdominal hysterectomy surgery, in patients who used a single 300mg dose of pregabalin or placebo as preemptive analgesia, using the McGill pain questionnaire, which consists of 20 word groups , and each group can contain from 2 to 6 descriptive words, these descriptors are placed in an increasing order of magnitude in relation to the intensity. The left of each word has a numerical value in an attempt to represent the intensity of the descriptor. For the analysis of the answers, the total number of words chosen in each subgroup by the patient was used to qualify his pain, the minimum value being equal to 0 (zero), if the patient chose not to choose any descriptor, and the maximum value would be 20, as the patient can choose only one descriptor for each subgroup. The quantitative pain index was also evaluated, which represents the sum of the values of each descriptor chosen by the patient, with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum of 78.</description>

        <description>Postoperative pain assessment, 24 hours after abdominal hysterectomy surgery, in patients who used a single 300mg dose of pregabalin or placebo as preemptive analgesia, using the McGill pain questionnaire, which consists of 20 word groups , and each group can contain from 2 to 6 descriptive words, these descriptors are placed in an increasing order of magnitude in relation to the intensity. The left of each word has a numerical value in an attempt to represent the intensity of the descriptor. For the analysis of the answers, the total number of words chosen in each subgroup by the patient was used to qualify his pain, the minimum value being equal to 0 (zero), if the patient chose not to choose any descriptor, and the maximum value would be 20, as the patient can choose only one descriptor for each subgroup. The quantitative pain index was also evaluated, which represents the sum of the values of each descriptor chosen by the patient, with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum of 78.</description>
