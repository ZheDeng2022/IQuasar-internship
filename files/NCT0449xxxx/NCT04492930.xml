  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of engaging in time restricted eating&#xD;
      schedule on body weight, blood glucose, and ketones (breath acetone) in individuals with&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are significant metabolic and weight reduction benefits associated with time restricted&#xD;
      feeding/eating. Time restricted eating splits the day into a period of regeneration&#xD;
      (non-eating or natural fasting) and a period of nourishing. Providing the body a period of&#xD;
      regeneration allows the body to go into ketosis, or the elevation in circulating ketone&#xD;
      bodies, a byproduct of fat metabolism. Breath acetone concentration is a good predictor of&#xD;
      ketosis and loss of body fat. In healthy individuals, low concentrations of breath acetone&#xD;
      are 1 to 2 ppm. Engaging in weight loss via nutritional ketosis (engaging in high-fat,&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate diets, caloric restriction diets, or fasting) increases fat utilization,&#xD;
      resulting in increased formation of ketone bodies and breath acetone concentrations ranging&#xD;
      from 4 to 30 ppm. In individuals with obesity, nutritional ketosis facilitates weight loss&#xD;
      and improves insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and reduces inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effect of participating in two different time restricted&#xD;
      eating schedules for 8 weeks on body weight, blood glucose, and ketones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all eligible participants giving&#xD;
      written informed consent will be randomized to a different time restricted eating schedule&#xD;
      (ie, one group fasts for a longer period of time). In both of these groups, fasting will&#xD;
      begin each evening and end the following morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a remote study. All procedures will be conducted at home.&#xD;
