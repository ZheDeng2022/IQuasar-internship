    <textblock>
      Physical and cognitive rest are recommended as treatment for concussion, but debate persists&#xD;
      about the utility of this recommendation for patients recovering from concussion. In&#xD;
      addition, patient adherence to physical and cognitive rest recommendations after concussion&#xD;
      remains unknown. This study will measure and compare symptom and activity reports in the days&#xD;
      and weeks after a concussion among patients randomly assigned to different incentive-based&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;

      Although physical and cognitive rest are recommended as the hallmark treatment for&#xD;
      concussion, debate persists about the utility of this recommendation for patients recovering&#xD;
      from a concussion. In addition, patient adherence to physical and cognitive rest&#xD;
      recommendations after concussion remains unknown. Objective and timely measures of physical&#xD;
      and cognitive activity will aid in defining the relationship between physical and cognitive&#xD;
      rest and clinical outcomes, such as symptom status, in the days and weeks after a concussion.&#xD;
      Random assignment to incentive-based arms will be used to measure patient engagement with the&#xD;
      study protocol and a dedicated research platform that involves ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment (EMA), in which participants report their real-time symptoms and daily activities&#xD;
      in response to randomly timed prompts, will be used to help assess the rest and recovery&#xD;
      process among pediatric and adult patients after concussion.&#xD;

    <description>This is a study where each participant is sent a short survey (PCSI instrument) three times each day for 21 days. The participant is instructed to reply to each survey within several minutes of receiving the prompt. We are interested in the extent to which participants will adhere to this instruction. Therefore, the outcome of interest is whether or not the participant replied to a given survey prompt. When we evaluate patient adherence in the data, we do this by calculating the % of survey prompts to which a given participant responded. In sum, the outcome is adherence to the survey.</description>

    <description>Subjects start with no money in an account, but they earn a fixed amount with each response. In this arm, each adult report is worth $3.17 so an adult subject can earn up to $200 if he/she responds to all surveys. If an adult completes at least 75% of the reports, he/she will receive an $100 bonus for a total maximum of $300. In this arm, each child report is worth 0.52 cents so a child subject can earn up to $33 if he/she responds to all surveys. If a child completes at least 75% of the reports, he/she will receive a $17 bonus for a total maximum of $50.</description>
