  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implant anchorage is difficult in patient with osteoporotic bone. To improve the implant bone&#xD;
      interface, the ISS stabilization system has been developed. The goal of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy the ISS augmentation compared to the standard PMMA augmentation of&#xD;
      pedicle screws in the treatment of patients suffering from osteoporotic/osteopenic&#xD;
      thoracolumbar fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two phases, a pilot phase followed by a pivotal phase. The data will be used to&#xD;
      measure clinical and radiological performance and usability of both systems.&#xD;
