  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world with a high&#xD;
      postoperative mortality (2 - 6%) as well as a low 5-year survival (40%). Despite advances in&#xD;
      surgery and the use of minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in recent years and adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy after surgery, long-term prognosis has only improved marginally. Epidural&#xD;
      analgesia is commonly used as a part of the perioperative management of patients undergoing&#xD;
      open, colorectal cancer surgery. Not only does it reduce pain and stress, epidurals have been&#xD;
      shown to reduce perioperative inflammation and preserve immunological function, all of which&#xD;
      may be beneficial in perioperative tumorigenesis. In several retrospective studies,&#xD;
      anesthesia and choice of analgesia have shown to improve long-term survival, but no&#xD;
      randomized studies have been published in the literature today. Similarly, the benefits of&#xD;
      propofol anesthesia in comparison to inhalational anesthesia have recently been high-lighted&#xD;
      in relation to cancer surgery, and many patients today request the use of epidurals, total&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia and loco-regional anesthetic technique during surgery, without clear&#xD;
      evidence from prospective studies in the literature. Therefore, the question as to the real&#xD;
      benefit of anesthesia technique in postoperative outcomes and tumor recurrence remain&#xD;
      unanswered, and skepticism abounds amongst both surgeons and anesthesiologists. It is&#xD;
      therefore important to study short- and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing CRC&#xD;
      surgery, comparing epidural vs. no epidural or inhalational vs. total intravenous anesthesia.&#xD;
      However, prospective, randomized studies are costly, require many patients, and the benefits&#xD;
      of choice of anesthesia and analgesia on outcome remain uncertain from the current&#xD;
      literature. There is a clear diffusion in practice across the world in the choice of&#xD;
      anesthesia for patients undergoing CRC surgery, a lack of evidence in the literature and an&#xD;
      absence of guidelines on best practice anesthesia care. We believe that by performing a&#xD;
      large, prospective, observational, international, pragmatic study, with low costs, it will be&#xD;
      possible to answer some of the important questions pertaining to the choice of anesthesia and&#xD;
      analgesia. The clinical trials network at the European Society of Anesthesiology will play an&#xD;
      important role in the success of this study.&#xD;
