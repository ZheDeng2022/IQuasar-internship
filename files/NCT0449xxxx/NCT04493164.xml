  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well CPX-351 and ivosidenib work in treating patients&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that has IDH1 mutation. The&#xD;
      safety of this drug combination will also be studied. IDH1 is a type of genetic mutation&#xD;
      (change). Chemotherapy drugs, such as CPX-351, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Ivosidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. The purpose of this trial is to learn if CPX-351 in&#xD;
      combination with ivosidenib can help to control IDH1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia or&#xD;
      high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) including complete remission (CR), complete&#xD;
      remission with hematologic recovery (CRh), complete remission with incomplete blood count&#xD;
      recovery (CRi), morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), and partial remission (PR) of the&#xD;
      combination of liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) and ivosidenib in&#xD;
      IDH1-mutated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety of CPX-351 in combination with ivosidenib. II. To determine time to event&#xD;
      endpoints including duration of response (DOR), event free survival (EFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) using multiparameter flow cytometry, cytogenetics&#xD;
      and molecular evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate molecular and cellular biomarkers that may be predictive of antitumor&#xD;
      activity and/or resistance to treatment including evaluation of 2HG, IDH1 and other&#xD;
      co-occurring mutations and VAF levels before, during and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5,&#xD;
      and ivosidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients who do not achieve complete&#xD;
      remission may receive a second cycle of induction therapy in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete remission proceed to&#xD;
      consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3, and ivosidenib PO&#xD;
      QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ivosidenib PO QD for up to 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are experiencing clinical benefit and who&#xD;
      have not experienced excessive toxicity after completion of 2 years of maintenance may be&#xD;
      eligible to continue therapy after discussion with the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then monthly for 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
