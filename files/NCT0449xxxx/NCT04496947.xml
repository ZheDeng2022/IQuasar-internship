  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The plot study aims to evaluate the effect of 8 weeks of stress reducing intervention on&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in adults, as quantified by positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) with fluorine-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in individuals with increased psychosocial&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled imaging study will be performed to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      mindfulness-based stress reduction via a mind body program on arterial inflammation in&#xD;
      individuals with self-identified high levels of stress. Individuals will undergo baseline&#xD;
      Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron emission tomography / magnetic resonance imaging and will then be&#xD;
      randomized to the stress-reduction intervention group or no intervention groups by blocks of&#xD;
      2:1, with stratification by age and sex. The stress reduction sessions focus on developing an&#xD;
      understanding of stress physiology and the physiology of the relaxation response, on&#xD;
      developing a regular practice of eliciting the relaxation response, and on learning cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral and positive psychology/resilience skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period, patient acceptability for the study will be assessed based on&#xD;
      medical history, concomitant medications, physical examination, and clinical laboratory test&#xD;
      results. Acceptability for study participation will be confirmed for subjects who identify as&#xD;
      having increased levels of stress and/or a Perceived Stress Scale score &gt;5. Once the patient&#xD;
      has passed screening, they will undergo baseline imaging followed by randomization and group&#xD;
      assignment. Approximately 12 weeks after randomization, all individuals will return for&#xD;
      follow-up imaging and evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, 2 Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron emission tomography / magnetic resonance imaging scans&#xD;
      will be performed throughout the study for baseline and follow up to assess the&#xD;
      intervention's impact on the brain and arterial inflammation, along with changes in related&#xD;
      positron emission tomography / magnetic resonance imaging imaging parameters. Perceived&#xD;
      Stress Scale will be delivered prior to Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron emission tomography /&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging, during both imaging visits to measure perceived psychological&#xD;
      stress. During both imaging sessions, subjects will be exposed to overt faces to measure&#xD;
      signals during brain imaging.&#xD;
