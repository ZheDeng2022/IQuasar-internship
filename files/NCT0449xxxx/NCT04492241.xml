      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study on participants&#xD;
      with Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ginkgo Leaf&#xD;
      Extract and Armillariella Mellea Powder Oral Solution.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cognition and locomotion are two human abilities controlled by the brain. Their decline is&#xD;
      highly prevalent with aging, and is greater than the simple sum of their respective&#xD;
      prevalence, suggesting a complex age-related interplay between cognition and locomotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis has provided evidence that poor gait&#xD;
      performance predicts dementia and, in particular, has demonstrated that &quot;motoric cognitive&#xD;
      risk&quot; (MCR) syndrome, which has been described in cognitively healthy individuals and&#xD;
      combines subjective cognitive complaint with objective slow gait speed, is a pre-dementia&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCR as a relatively new recognised clinical syndrome is with a high prevalence calculated&#xD;
      around 10% in world population aged 60 and above. MCR syndrome predicts mild and major&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorders. MCR syndrome does not rely on a complex and time-consuming&#xD;
      assessment, making it applicable to the aging population. Thus, MCR syndrome seems to be a&#xD;
      good syndrome to identify individuals at risk of mild and major neurocognitive disorders in&#xD;
      any type of healthcare setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ginkgo Leaf Extract and Armillariella Mellea Powder Oral Solution has proven efficacy for&#xD;
      cognitive function deterioration in preliminary studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      its efficacy and safety for MCR.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of ADAS-Cog</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) test is one of the most frequently used tests to measure cognition in research studies and clinical trials for new drugs and other interventions.The test administrator adds up points for the errors in each task of the ADAS-Cog for a total score ranging from 0 to 70. The greater the dysfunction, the greater the score. A score of 70 represents the most severe impairment and 0 represents the least impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Falls</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Fall refers to sudden, involuntary, unintentional body position change, falling to the ground or lower plane. Falls include the following two types: (1) falls from one plane to another; (2) falls on the same plane.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of each items from ADAS-Cog</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog): A score of 70 represents the most severe impairment and 0 represents the least impairment. The 12 items of ADAS-Cog applied in this study: Word Recall, Commands, Constructional Praxis, Naming, Ideational Praxis, Orientation, Word Recognition, Remembering Word Recognition Test Instructions, Comprehension of Spoken Language, Word-Finding Difficulty, Spoken Language Ability, Concentration/Distractibility</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of change of ADAS-Cog score 4 or more</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog): A score of 70 represents the most severe impairment and 0 represents the least impairment. Comparing to baseline, the percentage of ADAS-Cog score decreased 4 or more</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TMT-A Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A &amp; B. Both parts of the Trail Making Test consist of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. In Part A, the circles are numbered 1 - 25, and the patient should draw lines to connect the numbers in ascending order.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TMT-B Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A &amp; B. Both parts of the Trail Making Test consist of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. In Part B, the circles include both numbers (1 - 13) and letters (A - L); as in Part A, the patient draws lines to connect the circles in an ascending pattern, but with the added task of alternating between the numbers and letters (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C, etc.).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Activities Questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Sum scores (range 0-30). Cutpoint of 9 (dependent in 3 or more activities) is recommended to indicate impaired function and possible cognitive impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>ADL self-performance measures what the resident actually did (not what he or she might be capable of doing) within each ADL category over the prior seven days, according to a performance-based scale. ADL self-performance coding ranges from 0 (independent) to 4 (total dependence) and is coded as 20 items. The total ADL score is a very important component of the RUG categories and is calculated from the seven days immediately preceding and including the date of the assessment. Chang- es, including improvements and declines in function that have occurred since the assessment date are not considered when coding the MDS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was developed and cross- validated with the standard NPI to provide a brief assessment of neuropsychiatric symptomatology in routine clinical practice settings. The NPI-Q is designed to be a self-administered questionnaire completed by informants about patients for whom they care. Each of the 12 NPI-Q domains contains a survey question that reflects cardinal symptoms of that domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dementia Conversion Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as conversion rate of MMSEâ‰¤23 at 6 month. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is commonly used in medicine and allied health to screen for dementia.&#xD;
It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment. The MMSE's purpose has been not, on its own, to provide a diagnosis for any particular nosological entity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Single-task gait speed test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The test can be performed with any patient able to walk 4 metres using the instructions below:&#xD;
Instruct the patient to walk at their normal pace. Patients may use an assistive device, if needed.&#xD;
Ask the patient to walk down a hallway through a 1-metre zone for acceleration, a central 4- metre &quot;testing&quot; zone, and a 1-metre zone for deceleration (the patient should not start to slow down before the 4-metre mark).&#xD;
Start the timer with the first footfall after the 0-metre line.&#xD;
Stop the timer with the first footfall after the 4-metre line.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
