        The study will include adult patients aged 18 years and older, diagnosed with HR+/HER2-&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are represented in the Vector Oncology Data Warehouse who meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria will be eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of female breast cancer with evidence of metastatic disease or advanced&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis (confirmed by clinical review) of advanced or metastatic breast cancer at&#xD;
             any time, defined as breast cancer at stage IIIb, stage IIIc, or stage IV or&#xD;
             identified as having distant metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Indication in the record of ER or PR positive disease, or absence of any indication of&#xD;
             ER and PR negative disease (ie, patients are eligible without affirmative indication&#xD;
             of ER/PR+ status as long as ER/PR- indication is not present).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of a palbociclib plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) or palbociclib plus fulvestrant&#xD;
             regimen on 2/3/2015 or later in the advanced and metastatic setting. Data collection&#xD;
             will prioritize accrual of patients with 1L use of palbociclib plus AI and with 2L use&#xD;
             of palbociclib plus fulvestrant before collecting other use of palbociclib users.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years at A/MBC diagnosis.&#xD;
