  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laminoplasty and laminectomy are useful surgical procedures for the management of various&#xD;
      conditions pertaining the spinal cord such as myelopathy, radiculopathy, neoplasm, stenosis,&#xD;
      disc herniation, hematoma, abscess, traumatic injuries, etc. Both are generally effective&#xD;
      procedures that decompress the spinal cord by expanding the space available for the spinal&#xD;
      cord. Both procedures provide good neural decompression and functional improvement after&#xD;
      surgery, thereby preventing catastrophic cord injury. However, patients undergoing these&#xD;
      procedures experience severe pain in the postoperative period; this may lead to the increase&#xD;
      in postoperative morbidity and complications. Suboptimal analgesic therapy causes discomfort&#xD;
      to the patient and could increase the incidence of postoperative complications, prolong&#xD;
      hospital stay and increase health expenses. The extensive exposure to multiple levels in&#xD;
      spine surgeries lead to postoperative pain caused by muscular dissection and requires&#xD;
      adequate pain relief to hasten rehabilitation, so that the incidence of chronic pain is&#xD;
      significantly decreased. This pain is usually treated with intramuscular, epidural or IV-PCA&#xD;
      (Intravenous- Patient Controlled Analgesia) opioids. Several oral analgesics, intermittent&#xD;
      intravenous and intramuscular injections and PCA with several systemic side effects, have&#xD;
      long been used for the control of postoperative pain. In 1953, Lewis et al. established that&#xD;
      local infiltration is a reliable pain relief technique for postoperative pain, with the&#xD;
      advantages of safety, simplicity and low cost. The intraoperative injection of 40 mg of&#xD;
      methylprednisolone via the intra-buccal approach into the masseter muscle has found to have&#xD;
      significantly reduced swelling, trismus and postoperative pain associated with the surgical&#xD;
      extraction of impacted lower third molars. A single, preoperative dose of Methylprednisolone&#xD;
      125 mg IV before Total Knee Arthroplasty led to improvement of postoperative analgesia and&#xD;
      immediate recovery, when combined with an extensive, multimodal oral and local infiltration&#xD;
      analgesic regime. Preemptive administration of bupivacaine or bupivacaine plus&#xD;
      methylprednisolone to the paravertebral muscles in patients undergoing lumbar discectomy has&#xD;
      been proved to provide effective analgesia in the early postoperative period, when compared&#xD;
      to patients who received no local anesthetic or steroid. The infiltration of levobupivacaine&#xD;
      and bupivacaine plus methylprednisolone in single distance-single site, lumbar disc surgery&#xD;
      established that postoperative analgesic requirement was significantly lower and the first&#xD;
      analgesia demand time was also significantly later in the local anesthesia plus&#xD;
      methylprednisolone group, compared to the control group. A randomized controlled trial of a&#xD;
      larger scale, with a longer follow-up period, could provide a more significant data.&#xD;
      Therefore this study has been designed as a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded&#xD;
      endpoint (PROBE) study with a 1 month follow-up period, to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      methylprednisolone plus ropivacaine versus ropivacaine alone, administered before wound&#xD;
      closure, for providing analgesia after laminoplasty and laminectomy.&#xD;
