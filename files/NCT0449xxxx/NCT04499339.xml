  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare hematologic malignancy of aberrant plasma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a high and currently unmet medical need for novel, innovative treatment concepts to&#xD;
      improve the therapeutic outcome and prognosis of patients suffering from MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is definitive evidence that MM is susceptible to immune-based therapies from&#xD;
      pre-clinical investigations and early clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARAMBA-1 is a first-in-human clinical trial of adoptive immunotherapy with autologous&#xD;
      signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells&#xD;
      in patients with advanced MM that have exhausted conventional therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CARAMBA-1 clinical trial is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter clinical trial&#xD;
      which combines a phase I dose-escalation part with a phase IIa dose-expansion part to assess&#xD;
      feasibility, safety and anti-myeloma activity of SLAMF7 CAR-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CARAMBA project and the CARAMBA-1 clinical trial are supported by the European Union in&#xD;
      the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.&#xD;

&#xD;
      SLAMF7 CAR-T cells are manufactured using virus-free gene-transfer using the Sleeping Beauty&#xD;
      transposon system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAR-T cell product is formulated to contain equal proportions of CD8 cytotoxic and CD4&#xD;
      helper SLAMF7 CAR-T cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is willing and able to adhere to the protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient with diagnosis of MM who has been treated with at least 2 prior lines of&#xD;
             treatment, including at least one cycle of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous&#xD;
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if the patient was eligible, and exposure to&#xD;
             an immunomodulatory imide drug (e.g. lenalidomide and/or pomalidomide), a proteasome&#xD;
             inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (Note: Induction therapy, up to 2 cycles of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous&#xD;
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and subsequent consolidation and/or&#xD;
             maintenance therapy are considered one line of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least one of the following subcriteria must be measured in the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum M-protein greater or equal to 0.5 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urine M-protein greater or equal to 200 mg/24 h&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level greater or equal to 10&#xD;
                  mg/dL (100 mg/L) provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A biopsy-proven evaluable plasmacytoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone marrow plasma cells &gt;10% of total bone marrow cells (&gt;30% if bone marrow&#xD;
                  plasma cells are the only marker of measurable disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients previously treated with an anti-SLAMF7 antibody are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Karnofsky performance status ≥60%. If patient has a Karnofsky performance status &lt;60%&#xD;
             (e.g. after a spinal cord injury) but is judged to be medically fit by the&#xD;
             investigator, patient is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patients of childbearing potential must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. have a negative pregnancy test (blood) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact or agree to use, and&#xD;
                  be able to comply with, effective measures of contraception without interruption,&#xD;
                  from screening through 1 year following the investigantional medicinal product&#xD;
                  (IMP) infusion. A highly effective method of contraception or birth control&#xD;
                  (failure rate less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly) must be&#xD;
                  practiced. The patient should be informed of the potential risks associated with&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant while enrolled in this clinical trial. Reliable methods for&#xD;
                  this trial are: combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal&#xD;
                  contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal,&#xD;
                  transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition&#xD;
                  of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable), intrauterine device, intrauterine&#xD;
                  hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, sexual abstinence or&#xD;
                  vasectomized sexual partner. Abstinence is only accepted as true abstinence: when&#xD;
                  this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. (Periodic&#xD;
                  abstinence [e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods and&#xD;
                  withdrawal] are not acceptable methods of contraception.) Postmenopausal (no&#xD;
                  menses for at least 1 year without alternative medical cause) or surgically&#xD;
                  sterile female patients (tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy)&#xD;
                  may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Agree to abstain from breast feeding during the study participation and for 1&#xD;
                  year after the IMP infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male patients must practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual&#xD;
             contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential for at least 1&#xD;
             year after IMP infusion, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has undergone a prior allogeneic stem cell transplant with either standard or&#xD;

             reduced intensity conditioning &gt;12 months, and suffers on chronic Graft-versus-Host&#xD;
             Disease and/or is on systemic immune-suppressants.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. in second relapse that subsequently achieves a complete response that is&#xD;
                  considered being a candidate for an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, unless&#xD;
