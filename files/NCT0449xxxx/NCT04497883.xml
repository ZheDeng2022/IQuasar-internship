  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability&#xD;
      of maribavir administered as a single oral dose in healthy, adult participants of Japanese&#xD;
      descent and matched, healthy, adult, non-Hispanic, Caucasian participants. In addition, this&#xD;
      study will assess the dose-proportionality of PK of maribavir in healthy, adult participants&#xD;
      of Japanese descent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two cohorts, Cohort A and Cohort B. Cohort A consists of 12&#xD;
      participants of Japanese Descent. Cohort B consists of 12 non-Hispanic, Caucasian&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Japanese participants there will be three treatment periods. In Treatment Period 1, they&#xD;
      will receive maribavir as a single 400 mg oral dose. In Treatment Periods 2 and 3, all&#xD;
      Japanese participants will receive maribavir as a single oral dose of either 200 mg or 800&#xD;
      mg, depending upon randomization assignment. For the non-Hispanic, Caucasian group there will&#xD;
      be only one treatment period and they will receive maribavir as a single 400 mg oral dose.&#xD;
