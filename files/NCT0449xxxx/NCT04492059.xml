  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of utilizing blood flow restriction (BFR)&#xD;
      therapy in the rehabilitation of Achilles tendon rupture (ATR). Muscle atrophy occurs&#xD;
      following Achilles tendon rupture, whether managed non operatively or operatively, which has&#xD;
      implications on patient outcomes. The goal of physical therapy in the perioperative period is&#xD;
      to regain and ultimately return to activity. BFR has been proposed to reduce atrophy and&#xD;
      maintain strength, which would theoretically mitigate the deconditioning effects of an injury&#xD;
      on surrounding musculature. BFR is proposed to work by restricting arterial inflow leading to&#xD;
      an oxygen depleted environment and the ability to induce muscle adaption at lower maximum&#xD;
      repetition via reactive hyperemia and induction of growth cytokines, thus leading to muscle&#xD;
      hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this investigation is to determine if using BFR as an adjunct in physical therapy&#xD;
      following ATR would reduce muscular atrophy and lead to increased and expedited strength&#xD;
      gains. Additionally, the investigators would like to determine if BFR accelerates the&#xD;
      rehabilitation process and allows patients to perform standard rehabilitative functional&#xD;
      tests and return to play sooner. Furthermore, the investigators will investigate patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes metrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the BFR group will have significantly greater strength&#xD;
      gains at all time points in both non operatively and operatively treated ATR. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that BFR has potential in increasing Achilles tendon stiffness, tendon&#xD;
      cross-sectional area, muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy. However, there is a lack of&#xD;
      evidence regarding the use of BFR in both the pre and postoperative period specifically&#xD;
      relating to ATR. The investigators believe that the use of BFR in the perioperative period&#xD;
      surrounding an Achilles tendon rupture and ATR has the potential to significantly decreased&#xD;
      muscle atrophy, improve patient satisfaction and lead to earlier return to sport.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following diagnosis of ATR, attending surgeons will discuss treatment options with the&#xD;
      patient and determine their course of treatment to be operative or non-operative. Patients&#xD;
      will then be randomized via computer to prospectively undergo ATR rehabilitation using&#xD;
      conventional therapy or conventional therapy with a BFR adjunct by physical therapists&#xD;
      already trained in BFR with extensive experience in ATR rehabilitation. There will be no&#xD;
      incentive provided for participation by the therapists and the therapists may opt out of&#xD;
      using BFR at any point. Treatment groups will undergo similar protocols with the only&#xD;
      difference being the use of BFR as an adjunct to their rehabilitation. The protocol for using&#xD;
      the BFR cuff will be similar to previous studies examining BFR in lower extremity injuries,&#xD;
      with adaptation to the postoperative protocol specific to the Achilles tendon. More&#xD;
      specifically the physical therapists will be provided with a tourniquet that includes a&#xD;
      pressure monitor. The skin will be protected with a sleeve and the cuff will be placed in the&#xD;
      thigh well proximal to the knee joint. The investigators will begin by determining the&#xD;
      patient's limb occlusion pressure, which is conducted automatically by the cuff via built in&#xD;
      doppler. Once this is done the cuff will be inflated to 80% of the limb occlusion pressure,&#xD;
      which is the currently accepted recommendation in the literature and sufficient to achieve&#xD;
      the desired effect of blood flow restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For non-operative candidates the investigators will begin their rehabilitation and physical&#xD;
      therapy immediately following their initial office visit. Participants will have follow-up&#xD;
      appointments at two-weeks, six-weeks, three-months and six-months. During these follow-up&#xD;
      appointments the investigators will assess calf strength, calf circumference, ankle range of&#xD;
      motion, current pain and function level. Additionally, the investigators will conduct testing&#xD;
      at the end of the therapy sessions to ensure patients are prepared to return to sports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For operative candidates the investigators will schedule their surgery at the earliest&#xD;
      convenience and availability following their initial office visit. Participants will begin&#xD;
      their rehabilitation and physical therapy immediately following their surgery. Participants&#xD;
      will have follow-up appointments at two-weeks, six-weeks, three-months and six-months. During&#xD;
      these follow-up appointments the investigators will assess calf strength, calf circumference,&#xD;
      ankle range of motion, current pain and function level. Additionally, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct testing at the end of the therapy sessions to ensure patients are prepared to return&#xD;
      to sports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both operative and non-operative rehabilitation, therapy will consist of a structured&#xD;
      program progressing from range of motion to strength training and then functional tests. Both&#xD;
      those randomized to conventional therapy and those randomized to conventional therapy with&#xD;
      BFR adjunct will follow the same protocol with the only variable being the use of BFR. Again,&#xD;
      the BFR group will have the cuff inflated per protocol outlined above, this will be under the&#xD;
      guidance of trained physical therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout this protocol patient will have their initial/pre-operative visit to establish&#xD;
      care and set up surgery and follow-up appointments at two-weeks, six-weeks, three-months and&#xD;
      six-months. All data collection and testing during these follow-up appointments will be&#xD;
      obtained with a handheld device and will add less than five minutes to clinic visits.&#xD;
