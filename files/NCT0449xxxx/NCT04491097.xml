  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenitally missing tooth is one of the most common anomalies in human dentition. The&#xD;
      treatment options of lateral incisor agenesis are closing the space with orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment, implant treatment, conventional fixed dental prosthesis (FDPs) and resin-bonded&#xD;
      fixed dentures (RBFDs). RBFDs are used frequently for single tooth absence in the anterior&#xD;
      region due to their minimal invasive properties, high clinical success and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. With the development of new and stronger materials, RBFDs with metal framework&#xD;
      have been replaced by glass ceramic, lithium disilicate, fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) and&#xD;
      zirconia. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of CAD/CAM&#xD;
      single-retainer monolithic zirconia ceramic RBFDs which cemented with two different resin&#xD;
      cements.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of CAD/CAM single-retainer&#xD;
      monolithic zirconia ceramic RBFDs which cemented with two different resin cements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes 20 patients. Most of the patients have been recruited from the Istanbul&#xD;
      Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul. The patients were selected from individuals&#xD;
      who have unilateral or bilateral congenitally missing maxillary lateral teeth and wanted to&#xD;
      be treated a restoration or undergoing orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving their consent to take part in the study no preparations were made on abutment&#xD;
      teeth for RBFDs. Digital impressions were taken with an intraoral digital scanner. The RBFDs&#xD;
      were designed using a CAD software, milled and presintered zirconia blocks (KatanaTM Zirconia&#xD;
      HT, Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc, Tokyo, Japan). RBFD was adhesively bonded to abutment teeth&#xD;
      with one of the two different resin cements (Panavia F2.0 or Panavia V5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control procedure is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restoration is evaluated according to presence of mobility or debonding and fracture at&#xD;
      the connector area. Gingival harmony and periodontal tissues around the restorations were&#xD;
      also examined. Mobility of the abutment tooth was checked in the clinical examination and&#xD;
      alveolar bone was examined with periapical x-ray. The controls will take place after two&#xD;
      weeks, one year, two years, three years and five years.&#xD;

    <description>The survival was evaluated as described in the studies of Chai et al. (1). They described the survival as &quot;the period of time starting at the cementation of the restoration and ending when the restoration was shown to have irreparably failed&quot;. The fracture was evaluated according to the study of Heintze and Rousson (2). They made a classification for fracture of zirconia restorations. Three grades of fracture treatment were assigned to this classification:&#xD;
(1) Grade 1: Fracture surfaces were polished. (2) Grade 2: Fracture surfaces were repaired with resin-based composite. (3) Grade 3: Severe chipping fractures required replacement of affected prostheses.&#xD;
