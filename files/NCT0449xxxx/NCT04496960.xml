      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An autoimmune disease is one in which the immune system attacks a person s own body.&#xD;
      Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease. It often involves multiple systems and&#xD;
      organs of the body. Researchers are trying to find new, more effective and safe treatments&#xD;
      for SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of tofacitinib in people with SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-75 with SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened on a separate protocol. They will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and dental history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicine review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram to test the heart s electrical activity (Participants will lay on a&#xD;
           table. Sticky pads will be placed on their body.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exam and test for dry eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral, head, and neck exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque collection (Dental plaques and tongue and mucosal scrapings will be collected&#xD;
           using a small tongue depressor.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary gland ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minor salivary gland biopsy (The lower lip will be numbed. Several tiny salivary glands&#xD;
           will be removed through a small incision.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat some of the screening tests during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take capsules of the study drug or a placebo by mouth for 168 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have tests to measure blood pressure and the speed of blood flow through&#xD;
      the organs. They will also have a test that examines the function and reaction of the blood&#xD;
      vessels. For these tests, they will wear blood pressure cuffs and other sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires about their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 9 study visits over 28 weeks. They may be contacted by phone between&#xD;
      study visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study represents an innovative investigative measure of the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      JAK inhibition in patients with primary Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s Syndrome (SS). Secondary&#xD;
      objectives will include investigating the effects of tofacitinib on&#xD;
&#xD;
      target tissues (e.g., salivary glands), systemic inflammation, and on vascular function in SS&#xD;
      subjects. We also aim to identify biomarkers of response that may be useful as endpoints in&#xD;
      future studies.&#xD;

    <measure>ESSDAI</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ESSDAI was developed to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials involving Sjogren s Syndrome patient cohorts and allows for assessment/scoring of major domain activity relevant to a SS population.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in salivary flow rates</measure>
    <time_frame>week 24</time_frame>
    <description>salivary flow rates are an objective measure of organ function. Low salivary flow is a primary feature of SS and may be used as a non-invasive measure of therapeutic intervention. Studying the effects of tofacitinib versus placebo via randomized trial provides the best opportunity to show causality and association.</description>
