  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to elucidate whether impairments of cognitive control,&#xD;
      performance-monitoring, and value-based decision-making and dysfunctional interactions&#xD;
      between underlying brain systems are mediating mechanisms and vulnerability factors for daily&#xD;
      self-control failures and addictive disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Failures of self-control during conflicts between long-term goals and immediate desires are a&#xD;
      key characteristic of many harmful behaviors, including unhealthy eating habits, lack of&#xD;
      exercise and problematic substance use, which often have adverse personal consequences and&#xD;
      incur great societal costs. The project aims to elucidate neurocognitive mechanisms mediating&#xD;
      deficient self-control, both in daily self-control failures and in substance use disorders&#xD;
      and behavioral addictions, which are characterized by a loss of control despite awareness of&#xD;
      adverse consequences. A prospective cohort study was launched using a multi-level approach&#xD;
      that combines (i) a comprehensive clinical assessment, (ii) behavioral task batteries&#xD;
      assessing cognitive control and decision-making functions, (iii) task-related and resting&#xD;
      state fMRI, and (iv) Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment of daily self-control&#xD;
      failures. From a representative community sample, three groups of participants were recruited&#xD;
      (each n = 100; age 20 - 26) with (a) symptoms of non-substance related and (b)&#xD;
      substance-related addictive disorders and (c) syndrome-free controls. Participants are&#xD;
      invited to yearly clinical follow-up assessments and further multi-level assessments 3 and 6&#xD;
      years after initial recruitment. Results obtained so far (until 06/2020) provide converging&#xD;
      evidence that task performance as well as brain activity in monitoring, control, and&#xD;
      valuation networks is reliably associated with the propensity to commit real-life&#xD;
      self-control failures. Results support a process model, according to which deficient&#xD;
      performance-monitoring leads to an insufficient recruitment of control networks, which&#xD;
      attenuates the impact of long-term goals on neural value signals and increases the likelihood&#xD;
      of self-control failures. In the final funding period (until 06/2024), the clinical follow-up&#xD;
      period will be extended to 7 years. In addition, stress markers will be assessed as possible&#xD;
      moderators of self-control. With the cross-lagged panel design it is expected to make a&#xD;
      substantial contribution to the central unresolved question whether dysfunctions of cognitive&#xD;
      control are causally involved in the development and trajectories of self-control failures&#xD;
      and addictive behaviors, as well as to the disputed question of communalities and differences&#xD;
      between different addictive disorders. Thereby, the project will to contribute to&#xD;
      mechanism-based models of self-control impairments as a foundation for improved prevention&#xD;
      and therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The Value-Based Decision-Making (VBDM) battery of the Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 940 including four decision-making tasks with a Bayesian adaptive algorithm was used to adaptively assess impulsive decision-making. For the delay and probability discounting tasks, a hyperbolic value function was used describing that the subjective values of delayed (or probabilistic) reward decline hyperbolically according to the discounting rate k. For the mixed gambles task, a simple linear function was used in which loss aversion (λ) is the relative weighting of losses to gains in the participant's. Individuals with higher impulsive decision-making are assumed to display higher k values in the delay discounting task, lower k values in probability discounting tasks, and lower λ values in the mixed gambles task.</description>
