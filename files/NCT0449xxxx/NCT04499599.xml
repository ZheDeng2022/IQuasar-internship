    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how Fast Bar(TM), a specially formulated energy bar, affects the&#xD;
      physiological condition in participants after an overnight fasting. Participants will fast&#xD;
      for 19 hours (Fast Group), consume a breakfast Bar (Breakfast Group) or a Fast Bar(TM) (Fast&#xD;
      Bar Group) after an approximately 15-hour overnight fasting. Participants will be assessed&#xD;
      for physiological parameters associated with fasting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interest in fasting-based programs (i.e. intermittent fasting) for improvement of health and&#xD;
      longevity continues to grow. While benefits of intermittent fasting have been convincingly&#xD;
      demonstrated in rodent models, the more limited data in humans is less clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-term fasting (e.g. 12 to 48 hours in duration) utilized in many intermittent&#xD;
      fasting programs are considered safe, but some individuals may find them subjectively&#xD;
      difficult. As such, the question of whether the benefits of fasting can be obtained while&#xD;
      small amounts of food are consumed is of substantial interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One commercially available product that is designed to be consumed during periods of&#xD;
      intermittent fasting is the Fast Bar™,which stems out of the well-researched&#xD;
      fasting-mimicking diet to assist prolonged fasting. The unique formulation of the Fast Bar™&#xD;
      is hypothesized to minimize deviations in metabolic biomarkers associated with a fasting&#xD;
      state. This may allow for extension of a fasting period through reduced subjective difficulty&#xD;
      of fasting.The objective of this study is to evaluate the metabolic and subjective effects of&#xD;
      consuming a novel food product (Fast Bar™) after a short period of fasting.&#xD;
