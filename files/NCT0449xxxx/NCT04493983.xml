  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of cellular changes in response to ischemia and a following period of reperfusion,&#xD;
      damages to organs and different tissues occur. There are several ongoing studies to enlighten&#xD;
      the pathophysiological processes underlying these damages inflicted by ischemia/reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gases (CO2) with low water content are used in pneumoperitoneum, which is a procedure to&#xD;
      inflate the abdominal cavity with an appropriate gas for laparoscopic operations. In the&#xD;
      current literature, it was shown that due to a restricted blood flow during the gas&#xD;
      insufflation, ischemia develops and with the reperfusion of the organ in deflation period,&#xD;
      oxidative stress and inflammation increases, leading to ischemia/reperfusion-related organ&#xD;
      and tissue damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, biomarkers for ischemia/reperfusion-inflicted damage will be evaluated&#xD;
      in a biochemical and histopathological perspective in biopsy samples of ovaries from a young&#xD;
      patient group in which hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy will be performed,&#xD;
      laparoscopically.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy, after the induction of anesthesia, an umbilical&#xD;
      skin incision was performed. Pneumoperitoneum was established using dry, nonheated CO2&#xD;
      insufflation through a Veress needle. A 10-mm trocar was inserted into the abdominal cavity&#xD;
      through the umbilical incision for the laparoscope. Subsequently, three 5-mm ancillary&#xD;
      trocars, 2 on the lower abdominal quadrants and 1 on the left upper quadrant, were introduced&#xD;
      to the abdominal space under direct optic visualization. IAP was set at 14 mm Hg and&#xD;
      maintained with a gas insufflator (Endoflator; Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen,&#xD;
      Germany)Immediately after the port placement, unilateral oophorectomy was performed, and&#xD;
      ovarian biopsies were obtained. The operation continued with ligation and transection of the&#xD;
      contralateral utero-ovarian ligament and the bilateral round ligaments. The contralateral&#xD;
      infundibulopelvic ligament, which contains the main vascular supply for the contralateral&#xD;
      ovary, remained intact. Subsequently, anterior and posterior leaflets of the broad ligament&#xD;
      were identified and dissected, and the bladder was placed away from the lower uterine&#xD;
      segment. The uterus removed from vaginal way after necessary steps. After desufflation, the&#xD;
      cuff closure procedure was performed vaginally. At the end of the closure, pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      was reestablished, the remaining contralateral ovary was removed immediately, and biopsies&#xD;
      were obtained for histologic analyses.&#xD;
