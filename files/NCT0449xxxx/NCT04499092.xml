  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquired brain lesions (GCLA) represent one of the most important cause of disability and&#xD;
      mortality during the pediatric age, also in the western Countries. The important medical&#xD;
      progresses of the last decade in the medical field have increased the percentages of&#xD;
      survival, also in the most severe clinical pictures. On the other hand, a brain lesion&#xD;
      reported in the first years of life presents with a more dramatic impact on the cognitive and&#xD;
      neurological development of the patients and it can significantly interfere with the same&#xD;
      quality of their life. Recent studies suggest that a brain damage in this stage of the life&#xD;
      is related to more persistent sequelae in comparison of the same lesion reported by an adult&#xD;
      patient, because of the neurological immaturity at the moment of the insult. Furthermore, in&#xD;
      most cases, the brain lesion is related not only to motor and sensorial deficits but also to&#xD;
      very important behavioral and cognitive problems, that can arise immediately after the acute&#xD;
      phase, or also several years after the pathological event.&#xD;

      The aims of the present study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To contribute to the adaptation of the Italian version of the Coma Recovery Scale&#xD;
           (CRS-R) for the pediatric age, with specific differentiation and taking into account the&#xD;
           age of the patients and the specific learning that characterize each developmental&#xD;
           stage;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As regards the patients with an adequate cognitive profile, to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
           of a traditional multifunction neuropsychological treatment (cognitive functions are&#xD;
           stimulated at the same time) vs a sequential treatment (cognitive functions are&#xD;
           stimulated step by step).&#xD;

    <description>Continuous Performance Test 2nd Edition (CPT, Conners, 2000): is a neuropsychological test that measures a person's sustained and selective attention. Sustained attention is the ability to maintain a consistent focus on some continuous activity or stimuli, and is associated with impulsivity. Selective attention is the ability to focus on relevant stimuli and ignore competing stimuli. This skill is associated with distractibility</description>

    <description>Developmental Age Neuropsychological Evaluation Battery (DANEB, Gugliotta et al. 2005) is a test battery for the neuropsychological evaluation of the main cognitive functions (language, visual perception, memory, neuro-motor associations, attention, higher executive functions, reading, writing and calculation) in children from 5 to 11 years old. It helps analyze the development of cognitive functions and the detection of developmental or acquired cognitive pathologies.</description>

    <description>Digit Sequencing or Digit Span test (Blackburn, 1957) is one of the main tools developed to measure one's verbal working memory. The test was originally designed to test working memory and attention, as part of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale. Usually, the examiner reads a list of numbers, and the participant repeats them until an incorrect answer is given.</description>
