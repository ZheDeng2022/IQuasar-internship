  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is brainwave entrainment a feasible tool for managing long-term pain in a patient population&#xD;
      in the home-setting? Long-term pain affects 4 in 10 people in the UK and can impact on all&#xD;
      aspects of life. Many people find that their pain is not well controlled on the treatments&#xD;
      that are currently available, or they experience unpleasant side-effects from painkillers.&#xD;
      There is therefore an urgent need for new safe and effective treatments for long-term pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One new approach to treatment is to target alpha brainwaves - rhythmic brain activity that is&#xD;
      known to be associated with reduced pain. Alpha brainwaves can be increased by looking at&#xD;
      flashing lights or listening to rhythmic sounds at the same rhythm as the brainwaves. This is&#xD;
      known as &quot;brainwave entrainment&quot; (BWE) and can be delivered through a smartphone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the suitability, acceptability and benefits of the brainwave&#xD;
      entrainment smartphone application for people with long-term pain, and to inform the design&#xD;
      of a future larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit 40 participants. Individuals may be eligible if they are&#xD;
      over 18 years old and have suffered persistent pain for longer than 3 months. Participants&#xD;
      will attend a 3-hour session in the laboratory in either Manchester or Leeds. They will&#xD;
      undergo brainwave entrainment for different lengths of time whilst their brain activity and&#xD;
      pain levels are recorded to determine the most effective &quot;dose&quot; of entrainment for that&#xD;
      individual. They will then use the smartphone application at home 3 times a day for 4 weeks,&#xD;
      and will complete pain, sleep, fatigue and quality of life questionnaires. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, the investigators will conduct interviews to gain in-depth feedback. The total&#xD;
      duration for each participant is around 7 weeks. This study is funded by a Leeds Cares&#xD;
      Clinical Research Fellowship.&#xD;

      Primary Question/Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal research objectives are two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Firstly, to understand the dose-response of alpha BWE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondly, to test the feasibility of using alpha BWE technology for managing chronic&#xD;
           pain in the home environment and to inform the design of a future clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Question/Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify any issues with recruitment or retention of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the acceptability and usability of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the acceptability of the outcome measures and methods of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gain an understanding of the effect size in order to calculate how many participants&#xD;
           will be required for a future clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 participants will be recruited from musculoskeletal, rheumatology and&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinics in Leeds Teaching Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Trust and&#xD;
      Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-stage feasibility study incorporating electroencephalography (EEG),&#xD;
      quantitative outcome measures and qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant's involvement is estimated to last a minimum of 7 weeks (this may be longer&#xD;
      depending on the availability of the participant to attend laboratory sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted across two sites: University of Manchester and University of&#xD;
      Leeds. Two NHS sites will act as Participant Identification Centres (PICs): Leeds Teaching&#xD;
      Hospitals Trust and Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be comprised of two studies: 1) a laboratory-based study followed by 2) a&#xD;
      home-based study. All participants will be involved in both studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants may be approached and provided with a flyer and Participant&#xD;
      Information Leaflet from musculoskeletal, rehabilitation and pain clinics at the two PICs, or&#xD;
      may find out about the study from flyers placed in relevant NHS clinics or other relevant&#xD;
      settings such as support groups. The participant will then contact the research team by phone&#xD;
      or email on the contact details provided to discuss the study further, go through the&#xD;
      screening process and arrange a convenient time for them to attend the laboratory if they&#xD;
      wish to proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend either the University of Manchester laboratory in Salford Royal&#xD;
      Hospital, or the University of Leeds laboratory in the School of Biological Sciences,&#xD;
      University of Leeds, whichever is more convenient. They will be given opportunity to ask any&#xD;
      questions before signing the consent forms. They will complete the following questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographics form (5-10 mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (5-10 mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multidimensional Fatigue Index (MFI) (5-10 mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) (5-10 mins) Baseline EEG will be recorded for 7 minutes.&#xD;
           The participant will then undergo 4 blocks of visual or auditory rhythmic stimulation (3&#xD;
           blocks of 10Hz visual stimulation lasting 5, 15 and 30 minutes and 1 block of&#xD;
           non-entraining visual stimulation lasting 10 minutes) with 10-minute breaks in between&#xD;
           as a wash-out period. EEG will continue to be recorded during these breaks. Participants&#xD;
           will complete a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain intensity and unpleasantness&#xD;
           before and after each block (&lt;1 min). EEG will be recorded throughout stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be introduced to the smartphone app, shown how to use it and given the&#xD;
      opportunity to practice (30 mins). Participants will be provided with a smartphone with the&#xD;
      BWE app pre-downloaded, a Virtual Reality (VR) headset and set of earphones to use for the&#xD;
      duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated total laboratory time is 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to record NRS 3x a day and Brief Pain Index (BPI) short form (5-10&#xD;
      mins) 1x a day for 1 week at home to get baseline pain levels. After this period, they will&#xD;
      be contacted by phone or email by a researcher to remind them to begin using the stimulation.&#xD;
      They will then use the stimulation 3x a day for the specific duration that was identified as&#xD;
      the optimum for them during the laboratory-based study (i.e. 5, 15 or 30 minutes, based on&#xD;
      clinical pain ratings) for 4 weeks. They will record NRS for pain intensity and&#xD;
      unpleasantness before and after each stimulation and BPI at the end of each day. This will be&#xD;
      followed by a further week of baseline pain ratings with NRS 3x a day and BPI once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this, the participant will attend the laboratory at a pre-arranged time to complete&#xD;
      the following questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSQI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MFI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EQ-5D (see study 1 for timings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also participate in a semi-structured interview (&lt;45 minutes) with a researcher.&#xD;
      The interview will be based around a topic guide, however the semi-structured approach will&#xD;
      allow for trajectories in the conversation according to any significant or relevant topics&#xD;
      that may arise. The topic guide will be designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Elicit participants' experiences of interacting with the app including factors affecting&#xD;
           usability, adherence, the extent to which there has been any change in symptoms, any&#xD;
           side effects and overall perceived usefulness and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore any feasibility and process issues including factors affecting completion of&#xD;
           outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview will be audio-recorded and then transcribed verbatim with any identifiable data&#xD;
      removed from the transcripts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flyers advertising the study will be placed in relevant rheumatology, musculoskeletal and&#xD;
      rehabilitation NHS clinics in Leeds and Manchester and in non-clinical settings (including&#xD;
      support groups). Potential participants may be approached by clinicians in NHS clinics in the&#xD;
      PICS, or they may contact the study team by telephone or email on the contact information&#xD;
      provided on leaflets. Their eligibility for the study will be assessed by telephone.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a verbal explanation and a Participant Information Leaflet&#xD;
      (PIL) explaining the study, either in person or by email/post. They will have a minimum of 24&#xD;
      hours to decide whether to participate, at which point an initial meeting will be scheduled&#xD;
      at a convenient date and time for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from participants when they attend the laboratory&#xD;
      for the initial meeting. Participants will have the opportunity to ask any further questions&#xD;
      prior to consenting. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the participant for&#xD;
      their records and the original copy will be securely filed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same intervention, however for study 1, the order in which&#xD;
      the four sessions of stimulation (5, 15, 30 mins of alpha frequency and 10 mins of&#xD;
      non-entraining stimulation) are delivered will be randomised using computer generated random&#xD;
      numbers. A single research assistant who is not involved in delivery of the intervention will&#xD;
      be responsible for the randomisation process. Neither the researcher delivering the&#xD;
      intervention nor the participant will know the selected sequence at the start, however, it&#xD;
      will not be possible for either the researcher or the participant to be completely blinded,&#xD;
      given that the differences in duration of stimulation are likely to be quite apparent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis EEG data will be analysed using BrainVision Analyzer 2.0. Source&#xD;
      localisation will be estimated using low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) using&#xD;
      LORETA-KEY software. Appropriate statistical analysis will be carried out using SPSS&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview findings will be explored with thematic content analysis using a Template Analysis&#xD;
      approach. This involves the definition of a priori themes relevant to the research question.&#xD;
      Two researchers will separately review and code an initial five transcripts based on the a&#xD;
      priori themes, before coming together to organise the emerging themes into meaningful&#xD;
      clusters and create an initial coding template by which to analyse the rest of the&#xD;
      transcripts (modifying and revising the template as further themes emerge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit a total of 40 participants who will take part in both work&#xD;
      package 1 and 2. As a feasibility study, one of the key aims is to gain data on effect size&#xD;
      in order to calculate sample size for a future clinical trial. Therefore, the sample size is&#xD;
      based on previous studies as well as considering pragmatics such as funding, equipment and&#xD;
      time available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE The study will be subject to the audit and monitoring&#xD;
      regime of the Universities of Manchester and Leeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS AND ADVERSE EVENTS This study uses alpha frequency brainwave&#xD;
      entrainment, which has no known significant side effects or risks. Therefore, the anticipated&#xD;
      risk to participants is considered to be very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no anticipated risks to the researchers. There will be two-weekly debriefs with the&#xD;
      whole research team to address any potential issues. There will be no lone-working for any&#xD;
      team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL and REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approvals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in full conformance with all relevant legal requirements and the&#xD;
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the UK Policy&#xD;
      Framework for Health and Social Care Research 2017. The study will be approved by NHS&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee and Health Research Authority prior to commencement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks and burden to participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the rhythmic flashing lights of the visual stimulation, individuals with a history of&#xD;
      epilepsy or seizures will be excluded from the study, to mitigate the risk of triggering&#xD;
      seizures. Those with sensitivity to flashing lights or a history of migraines or recurrent&#xD;
      headaches will also be excluded. The brightness of the visual stimulation and the volume of&#xD;
      auditory stimulation will be adjustable, to ensure it is comfortable. There are no known side&#xD;
      effects from using this technology, however participants will be instructed to stop using it&#xD;
      if they were to experience any adverse symptoms and to inform the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential burden may arise from the inconvenience of attending the laboratory for&#xD;
      face-to-face meetings. These have purposefully been kept to only 2 meetings to reduce this&#xD;
      burden as much as possible. Data collection may be considered burdensome. Questionnaires at&#xD;
      the beginning and end of the study will be completed with a researcher on hand to provide&#xD;
      support. Although the NRS for pain takes seconds to complete, this will require participants&#xD;
      to remember to record their pain scores three times a day. Participants will be provided with&#xD;
      a clearly laid out booklet to assist them. Part of the feasibility aspect of this study is to&#xD;
      assess how easy and acceptable the data collection measures are, so participants' feedback on&#xD;
      the level of burden will be ascertained in the final interview and will guide future study&#xD;
      design. Participants may perceive some burden from the final interview. It is not anticipated&#xD;
      that the content will be upsetting for participants, however it is recognised that&#xD;
      potentially sensitive topics may arise, including discussion of chronic pain and other&#xD;
      symptoms. Participants will be informed that they do not have to answer any questions that&#xD;
      they are uncomfortable with and they may leave the interview at any time without needing to&#xD;
      give a reason.&#xD;
