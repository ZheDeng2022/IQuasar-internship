        The study employs a cohort design, using open and rolling recruitment of MHP participants&#xD;
        at multiple locationssites nationally. We will recruit from mental health therapy&#xD;
        practices, schools (using school based MHPs), community mental health agencies, or&#xD;
        colleges/universities (counseling centers). Participating MHPs will begin enrolling client&#xD;
        participants after completing the online protocol training and brief human subject's&#xD;
        protection training. Recruitment will continue on a rolling basis until 2000 client&#xD;
        participants have been enrolled and 6000 sessions have been recorded.&#xD;
