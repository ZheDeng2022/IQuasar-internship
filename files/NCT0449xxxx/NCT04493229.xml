  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect that a dose of intramuscular (IM) oxytocin (naturally&#xD;
      occurring hormone) has on fear of pain and movement and trust in the physical therapist&#xD;
      during outpatient rehabilitation after total knee replacement has been performed.&#xD;
      Investigators will ask participants to answer questions about fear of pain and movement&#xD;
      before several outpatient physical therapy session and investigators will ask participants&#xD;
      questions about trust of the physical therapist several times after the outpatient physical&#xD;
      therapy sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine feasibility of this study design and identify&#xD;
      barriers that altered design could bring to overcome these barriers in the design of a large,&#xD;
      pragmatic, multi-center clinical trial. It is also designed to estimate the effect size and&#xD;
      variance of the main outcome measures, trust and fear, in patients undergoing rehabilitation&#xD;
      after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The study team hypothesizes that intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      oxytocin, in a dose and time determined by a series of previous studies under this grant to&#xD;
      target the brain, will enhance trust and reduce fear and that these will be associated with&#xD;
      improved outcomes. Again, the study is not designed to test this hypothesis, but to gather&#xD;
      the critical data necessary to test it in a large, multi-center clinical trial that would&#xD;
      follow this grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that have decided to undergo unilateral TKA, will come to the Pain Clinical&#xD;
      Research Unit at least 48 hours prior to surgery to confirm consent and complete a series of&#xD;
      questionnaires. Participants surgery, anesthesia, and postoperative medication and therapy&#xD;
      treatment will be routine. On the first outpatient study visit participants will complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire of fear about pain and receive an intramuscular injection of oxytocin or&#xD;
      placebo in a randomized, double blind manner. At the end of this session participants will&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire assessing the degree of trust in the therapist. Physical therapy be&#xD;
      will routine, and the fear and trust questionnaires will be completed at the 2nd, 4th, 8th,&#xD;
      and last physical therapy session as well as routine measures of progress and function. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure is assessment of effect size and variability of the trust and fear&#xD;
      questionnaires on the 1st and 2nd visit.&#xD;
