  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quadratus lumborum block is widely used in abdominal surgery for post-operative&#xD;
      analgesia. It is now also used for pain relief after hip surgery. Under the traditional&#xD;
      blocking method, a high concentration of long-acting local anesthetic is used in order to&#xD;
      achieve a long-term blocking effect. However, this is also likely to cause the patient's&#xD;
      quadriceps weakness during the block period, increasing the risk of the patient falling&#xD;
      during rehabilitation. It also increases systemic local anesthetic poisoning and may even&#xD;
      trigger the risk of serious side effects such as cardiac arrest. Ropivacaine is a novel&#xD;
      long-acting topical amine anesthetics that lasts long and has anesthetic and analgesic&#xD;
      effects. Its pharmacological characteristics are low cardiotoxicity, sensory block and motor&#xD;
      block separation at low concentrations more obvious, and with the external peripheral&#xD;
      vasoconstriction. Therefore, the drug is especially suitable for postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid for the treatment of a wide range of symptoms&#xD;
      including rheumatic diseases, certain skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral edema, and may also be combined with antibiotics for&#xD;
      tuberculosis patients. It is becoming more common to use steroids as an adjuvant to local&#xD;
      anesthetics in peripheral nerve block. Steroids have neurological blockade effects by&#xD;
      blocking the nociceptive transmission of pith-type C-fibers and inhibiting the release of&#xD;
      ectopic neurons. Dexamethasone, as a local anesthetic adjuvant in peripheral nerve block, has&#xD;
      also been widely studied recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the incidence of long-acting topical anesthetics from the nerve block in&#xD;
      the quadratus lumborum block, reducing the local anesthetic concentration is a feasible&#xD;
      method. However, this will also result in a shorter time to neurological block. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that the addition of Dexamethasone 5 mg to low concentrations&#xD;
      (0.25%) of Ropivacaine would prolong postoperative analgesia. Therefore, the purpose of this&#xD;
      study was to compare the postoperative analgesia and the side effects of postoperative&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum block with the addition of Dexamethasone 4mg to Ropivacaine (0.25%) in low&#xD;
      concentrations and Ropivacaine (0.5%) alone.&#xD;

      Assessment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The intensity of pain was assessed using a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) to&#xD;
           quantify their degree of pain; where 0 means no pain and 10 the worst pain imaginable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The analgesic activity was assessed using standard measures during the 48-hour treatment&#xD;
           period: baseline pain intensity, time to rescue medication, and overall patient&#xD;
           evaluation of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Record the hemodynamic parameters during the 60-minute observation period in the&#xD;
           anesthesia recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The severity of postoperative side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus) was quantified&#xD;
           using different scales. Other side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness, are also&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Motor block is assessed using Modified Bromage Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Pharmacokinetics: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. analgesic activity and duration of action&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patient satisfaction&#xD;
