      The main objective of this study is to observe the overall survival of Rituximab Biosimilar&#xD;
      HLX01 and MabThera in Combination With CHOP, in previously untreated subjects with CD20+&#xD;
      DLBCL. The secondary objective of this study is to observe the progression-free survival of&#xD;
      Rituximab Biosimilar HLX01 and MabThera in Combination With CHOP, in previously untreated&#xD;
      subjects with CD20+ DLBCL.&#xD;

      1. Enrollment:407 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The inclusion criteria of this study: subjects who have participated in Phase III&#xD;
           clinical trials.Phase III clinical trial（NCT02787239） has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The exclusion criteria: ①Subjects died; ②Subjects are unwilling to participate in&#xD;
           follow-up study; ③ the investigator judges that the subject is not suitable for&#xD;
           participating the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Duration and method of follow-up: 2-10 years (2020-2027)after the end of the Phase III&#xD;
           trial and follow up the subjects by the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analysis method: For progression-free survival and overall survival (OS),&#xD;
           the median time and its 95% confidence intervals will be calculated by the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
           method.The Log-Rank test will be used for finding the difference between groups. The&#xD;
           efficacy will be analyzed by SAS9.4 , and all hypothesis tests are two-sided. The&#xD;
           confidence level of all confidence intervals is 95%. P value less than 0.05 was regarded&#xD;
           as statistically significant.&#xD;
