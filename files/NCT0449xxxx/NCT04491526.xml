  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative urinary retention (POUR) is a common complication after inguinal hernia repair&#xD;
      with a reported incidence up 34%. It can be described as the inability to initiate urination&#xD;
      or properly empty one's bladder following surgery. It is usually self-limited, but it&#xD;
      requires the use of catheterization to empty the bladder in order to prevent further injury&#xD;
      to the bladder or kidneys and to relief the discomfort of a full bladder. Tamsulosin is a&#xD;
      medication that is commonly used in men with urinary symptoms related to an enlarged&#xD;
      prostate. There is some evidence to suggest that it may also potentially be beneficial for&#xD;
      preventing post-operative urinary retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if tamsulosin (&quot;TAMSULOSIN Mepha Ret Depocaps 0.4&#xD;
      mg&quot;) is effective in preventing post-operative urinary retention following endoscopic total&#xD;
      extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair and its impact on hospital length of stay.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this RCT subjects are randomly and parallel assigned to one of two groups: one (the&#xD;
      experimental group) receiving &quot;Tamsulosin 0.4 mg&quot;/ day, 5 days prior to the day of&#xD;
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair surgery, at the day of surgery and for 1 day following&#xD;
      surgery. (5+1+1), and the other (the control group) receiving one placebo capsule matching&#xD;
      the active study drug per day from 5 days prior to the day of surgery, at the day of surgery&#xD;
      and for 1 day following surgery. (5+1+1). There will be effective (concealed) randomization&#xD;
      of the subjects to the intervention/control groups (to eliminate selection bias and minimize&#xD;
      confounding variables). Both groups will be treated identically in all respects except for&#xD;
      the intervention being tested and to this end patients, investigators, care providers and&#xD;
      outcomes assessors will be blinded to which group an individual is assigned. Group assignment&#xD;
      will be performed using a covariate-adaptive allocation procedure to provide a balance for&#xD;
      selected covariates (Site, IPSS-Score, Age, &quot;uni- or bilateral surgery&quot; and &quot;history of&#xD;
      prostate or bladder surgery&quot;. To achieve that; Minimization, first described by Taves [and&#xD;
      expanded by Pocock and Simon [the most commonly used covariate-adaptive randomization method&#xD;
      will be applied. It achieves the balance in treatment assignments across factor levels by&#xD;
      choosing the allocation for the new subject that would lead to the smallest degree of&#xD;
      imbalance possible across the set of his baseline characteristics. The two groups are then&#xD;
      followed up to 3 days after surgery to see if there are any differences between them in&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes. Patients are analyzed within the group to which they were&#xD;
      allocated, irrespective of whether they experienced the intended intervention (intention to&#xD;
      treat analysis). This RCT is designed as a superiority trial and aims to demonstrate the&#xD;
      superiority of Tamsulosin in prevention of POUR compared to placebo. We anticipate the&#xD;
      detection of a 65% relative risk reduction of POUR in the experimental group in comparison&#xD;
      with the placebo group. To detect a 65% reduction of POUR in the experimental group (2.9%&#xD;
      anticipated) in comparison with the placebo group (8.3% anticipated) and to assure a study&#xD;
      power of 80% with a Fisher's Exact Test and a significance level of 5% and adjusting for a&#xD;
      drop-out rate of 2% we need 634 patients in total; 317 in each group. Our target population&#xD;
      consists of male patients â‰¥ 60 yrs, scheduled for elective endoscopic inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
      The studied sample is appropriate to the hypothesis being tested so that any results will be&#xD;
      appropriately generalizable.&#xD;
