  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research aims to evaluate the immediate effect of the muscle energy technique (TEM) on&#xD;
      postural control responses in the elderly and young adults. The sample will be selected for&#xD;
      convenience, being participants of both sexes, young and old. Evaluation of postural control&#xD;
      through the force platform will be performed during the unipodal and semi-tandem balance&#xD;
      tests. The main parameters of postural control will be calculated using the pressure center&#xD;
      derivative. After the balance tests, the participants will be submitted to TEM and&#xD;
      immediately afterwards reassessed on the force platform.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is considered a dynamic and progressive process, in which morphological, functional and&#xD;
      biochemical changes occur. One of the factors associated with old age is the decrease in the&#xD;
      ability to balance posture and the high risk of falls. The literature brings the benefits of&#xD;
      physical exercise in improving balance and preventing falls. However, few studies point to&#xD;
      the benefits of flexibility techniques and their relationship with balance. The objective of&#xD;
      this research is to evaluate the immediate effect of the muscle energy technique (TEM) on&#xD;
      postural control responses in the elderly and young adults. The sample will be selected for&#xD;
      convenience, with 50 participants of both sexes, young people between 18 and 35 years old and&#xD;
      elderly people between 60 and 85 years old. Evaluation of postural control will be performed&#xD;
      through the force platform during the unipodal and semi-tandem balance tests (2 repetitions&#xD;
      of 30 seconds each, with rest of 30 seconds between them). The main parameters of postural&#xD;
      control will be calculated using the pressure center derivative. After the balance tests, the&#xD;
      participants will be submitted to TEM and immediately afterwards reassessed on the force&#xD;
      platform. An analysis of variance will be used to compare the effects between groups (young&#xD;
      versus elderly) and intervention (pre- and post-TEM) and the effects of interaction on the&#xD;
      main variables of postural control. A beneficial effect of TEM is expected, especially in the&#xD;
      elderly group. The results found in this study will contribute to the use of TEM and the&#xD;
      increase of relevant clinical information to benefit the ability to balance in the elderly,&#xD;
      in order to reduce the risk of falls.&#xD;

    <description>Group of older (G1) - The muscular energy technique (TEM) based on Chaitow's proposal will be applied to the postural posterior muscles of the lower limbs such as gastrocnemius, soleus, ischiostibials, gluteus medius and paravertebral. During TEM, the contraction will be maintained from 7 to 10 seconds, against the resistance imposed by the therapist. After relaxation, range of motion will be gained until your new restriction barrier. This process will be repeated for 3 times.</description>
