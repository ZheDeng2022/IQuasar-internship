  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium has been long considered as a major contributor to cognitive impairments following a&#xD;
      critical illness. Currently, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic prevention and&#xD;
      treatment strategies are used in the intensive care unit, despite these strategies remaining&#xD;
      controversial. However, with previous studies showing the feasibility of using virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) within the critical care setting, the investigators propose to use this&#xD;
      technology to investigate the effect of 360-degree immersive virtual reality stimulation on&#xD;
      the incidence of delirium in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation will be provided for 30 minutes, three times a day, evenly spaced between 7:00 AM&#xD;
      and 7:00 PM, using a commercially available head-mounted display. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that by providing relaxing virtual environments to patients through a&#xD;
      head-mounted display and headphones, the incidence of delirium will be lower compared to the&#xD;
      control group receiving no VR stimulation. Secondary outcomes will include evaluating the&#xD;
      movement patterns and intensity between the intervention and control group, and between&#xD;
      patients with and without delirium, using inertial measurement units and an under mattress&#xD;
      bed sensor. It is hypothesized that it will be possible to detect difference in movement&#xD;
      patterns between groups and identify patterns indicating the presence or absence of delirium.&#xD;
      Secondary objective also include the evaluation of the effect of VR on duration of delirium.&#xD;
      Here it is hypothesized that the duration of delirium will be shorter in participants&#xD;
      receiving the VR stimulation compared to those in the control group. Physiological parameters&#xD;
      (e.g. heart rate, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, etc.) will also be recorded during the&#xD;
      stimulation to further understand what, if any, effect VR has.&#xD;

    <description>Delirium will be assessed 3 times a day using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. The screening will be conducted by trained critical care nurses. If a score greater than or equal to 4 is recorded, this will count as an incidence of delirium.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded during entire stay in the ICU (to a maximum of 14 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of delirium will be evaluated per 8 hour periods, or as needed, while patients are in the ICU. If the participant is assessed as delirious during any of the assessments during an 8 hour span, the entire period will count as delirious.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Functioning</measure>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Compared between quality pre-admission to 6-months post-discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is examined via the EQ-5D questionnaire (official name, not abbreviated). The five-level version (5L) will be used. The five levels of the scale, scored from 1 to 5 are: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to/extreme problems. The numbers for the five dimensions are subsequently combined to create a unique 5-digit code which represents the respondent's overall health state. This means an index of 11111 is the best possible health, and 55555 is the worst possible health.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Once a day for the duration of the patient's time in the ICU (to a maximum of 14 days).</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item System Usability Scale is used to collect data on the user's (nurse providing VR stimulation) subjective usability assessments. There are five response options per question; from Strongly disagree (1) to Strongly agree (5). For each odd numbered question, subtract 1 from the score. For each even numbered question, subtract the score from 5. Add up the new values calculated and multiply this total by 2.5. This gives a final score from 0 - 100 (this is not a percentage, but values can be normalized to produce a percentile ranking). A score above 68 is considered above average, and below 68 is below average.</description>
