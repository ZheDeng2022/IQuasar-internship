      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic or refractory/recurrent small bowel and colorectal cancers cannot be cured and are&#xD;
      often not helped by standard treatments. Researchers want to find better treatments by&#xD;
      testing a combination of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if a new combination of immunotherapy drugs can shrink tumors in people with&#xD;
      advanced small bowel and colorectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have advanced metastatic or refractory/recurrent small bowel&#xD;
      and/or colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened on a separate protocol. They will have a physical exam and&#xD;
      medical history. They will have imaging scans. They will have blood and urine tests. Their&#xD;
      heart function will be measured. They may have a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat some of the screening tests during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be put into study groups. Each group will get a combination of the&#xD;
      following drugs: CV301 vaccine (MVA-BN-CV301 and FPV-CV301), M7824, and N-803. Some will also&#xD;
      get NHS-IL12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the CV301 vaccines by injection under the skin. They will get M7824 by&#xD;
      intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. They will get N-803 by injection under the skin every 2&#xD;
      or 4 weeks. They may get NHS-IL12 by injection under the skin every 4 weeks. They will take&#xD;
      the study drugs for up to 1 year. They will visit the NIH every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment ends, participants will go to the clinic for a 28-day follow-up visit or have&#xD;
      a telephone call. They will be contacted every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months&#xD;
      after that for the rest of their life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic or refractory/recurrent small bowel and colorectal cancers are incurable and&#xD;
           poorly palliated by standard therapies. There is an unmet need for active treatments for&#xD;
           these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To date immunotherapies including anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 inhibitors have proven largely&#xD;
           ineffective for the vast majority of these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (&gt;95% of these cancers) the&#xD;
                response rate to checkpoint inhibitors has been &lt;5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preclinical studies suggest that the use of different combinations of multiple&#xD;
                immunotherapy agents may improve anti-tumor efficacy. These studies have employed&#xD;
                (1) a vaccine targeting a tumor associated antigen, (2) an IL-15 superagonist&#xD;
                (N-803, also known as ALT-803), (3) an anti-PD-L1 MAb or a bifunctional fusion&#xD;
                protein targeting PD-L1 and TGF beta (M7824), and (4) a tumor targeted&#xD;
                immunocytokine (NHS-IL12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.1) of the combination of (1) CV301, a poxviral based vaccine targeting CEA and&#xD;
      MUC1, (2) N-803 and (3) M7824; and of the combination of (1) CV301, (2) N-803, (3) M7824 and&#xD;
      (4) NHS-IL12 (M9241) in subjects with advanced checkpoint naive MSS small bowel and&#xD;
      colorectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;= 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
           small bowel or colorectal adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the patient declines standard&#xD;
           treatment after appropriate counseling has been provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase II trial of combination immunotherapy, with a brief dose escalation&#xD;
           portion for Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial will be conducted using a Simon optimal two-stage design in each Phase II Arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be enrolled on the following arms in sequential order: (1) Arm 1: CV301 +&#xD;
           M7824 + N-803, (2) Arm 2A and Arm 2B: CV301 + M7824 + N-803 + NHS-IL12; N-803 dose level&#xD;
           will be evaluated in Arm 2A prior to further enrollment in Arm 2B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first six patients on arm 1 will be evaluable for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)&#xD;
           and accrual will only continue to 9 patients on that arm if less than 2 out of the first&#xD;
           6 patients experience a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Arm 2B, patients will receive 4 drug treatments (CV301 + M7824 + N-803 + NHSIL12),&#xD;
           but the dose level of N-803 will first be determined during a 3-level dose escalation&#xD;
           portion, Arm 2A. Following determination of the MTD or highest safe dose evaluated, the&#xD;
           6 patients at that dose level will be included among the initial 9 patients for the&#xD;
           first stage of that arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If two or more out of nine patients have objective responses on a given arm that arm&#xD;
           will be expanded to enroll 20 evaluable patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with prior investigational drug, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or any prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy (except for palliative bone directed therapy) within the past 28 days&#xD;
             prior to the first drug administration except if the investigator has assessed that&#xD;
             all residual treatment-related toxicities have resolved or are minimal and feel the&#xD;
             participant is otherwise suitable for enrollment. Additionally, current therapies&#xD;
             (e.g., maintenance capecitabine) may be continued where in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator stopping such therapies may increase the risk of disease progression.&#xD;
             Also, participants may continue adjuvant hormonal therapy in the setting of a&#xD;
             definitively treated cancer (e.g. breast).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with microsatellite unstable or mismatch repair deficient disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Major surgery within 28 days prior to the first drug administration (minimally&#xD;
             invasive procedures such as diagnostic biopsies are permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known life-threatening side effects resulting from prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy&#xD;
             (e.g., colitis, pneumonitis, fulminant hepatitis which led to permanent&#xD;
             discontinuation of prior checkpoint therapy). Autoimmune toxicity which was not life&#xD;
             threatening (e.g., arthritis) or did not lead to discontinuation of prior checkpoint&#xD;
             therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known active brain or central nervous system metastasis (less than a month out from&#xD;
             definitive radiotherapy or surgery), seizures requiring anticonvulsant treatment (&lt;3&#xD;
             months) or clinically significant cerebrovascular accident (&lt;3 months). In order to be&#xD;
             eligible participants must have repeat CNS imaging at least a month after definitive&#xD;
             treatment showing stable CNS disease. Participants with evidence of intratumoral or&#xD;
             peritumoral hemorrhage on baseline imaging are also excluded unless the hemorrhage is&#xD;
             grade &lt;= 1 and has been shown to be stable on two consecutive imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because these drugs have not been tested&#xD;
             in pregnant women and there is potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with these immunotherapies, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory&#xD;
             agent with exception of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diabetes type I, eczema, vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid&#xD;
                  disease or other mild autoimmune disorders not requiring immunosuppressive&#xD;
                  treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the&#xD;
                  steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at&#xD;
                  doses &lt;= 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Administration of steroids for other conditions through a route known to result&#xD;
                  in a minimal systemic exposure (topical, intranasal, intro-ocular, or inhalation)&#xD;
                  is acceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects on systemic intravenous or oral corticosteroid therapy with the&#xD;
                  exception of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (&lt;= the equivalent of&#xD;
                  prednisone 10 mg/day) or other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or&#xD;
                  cyclosporin A are excluded on the basis of potential immune suppression. For&#xD;
                  these subjects these excluded treatments must be discontinued at least 1 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to enrollment for recent short course use (&lt;= 14 days) or discontinued at&#xD;
                  least 4 weeks prior to enrollment for long term use (&gt; 14 days). In addition, the&#xD;
                  use of corticosteroids as premedication for contrast-enhanced studies is allowed&#xD;
                  prior to enrollment and on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with a history of serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as&#xD;
             cardiac or pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, bleeding diathesis or recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) clinically significant bleeding events or other illness considered by the&#xD;
             Investigator as high risk for investigational drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects unwilling to accept blood products as medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of second malignancy within 3 years of enrollment except for the following:&#xD;
             adequately treated localized skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, superficial&#xD;
             bladder cancer, or other localized malignancy which has been adequately treated or&#xD;
             malignancy which does not require active systemic treatment (e.g., low risk CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with a known severe hypersensitivity reaction to a monoclonal antibody (grade&#xD;
             &gt;= 3 NCI-CTCAE v5) will be evaluated by the allergy/immunology team prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
