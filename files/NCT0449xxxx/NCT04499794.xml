  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of ALK inhibitors in the first-line cancer treatment can significantly&#xD;
      increase the PFS and ORR of patients those with EML4-ALK fusion. The contemporary clinical&#xD;
      ALK fusion detection are mainly via FISH and ICH while biopsies are needed. For locations&#xD;
      where are difficult to take biopsies, these routine examinations can hardly been adopted.&#xD;
      Apart from these, part of ALK fusion patients are resistant to ALK inhibitors, also making an&#xD;
      accurate and efficient prognostic indicator for efficacy evaluation and identifying high-risk&#xD;
      recurrent population an urgent priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bilayer membrane structure of exosome helps maintain its internal genetic stability,&#xD;
      making detection of EML4-ALK fusion via plasma exosomes in advanced NSCLC patients a feasible&#xD;
      way, which might provide a non-invasive and more convenient approach for NSCLC diagnosis and&#xD;
      efficacy monitoring. Firstly, this study will evaluate the performance of exosome EML4-ALK&#xD;
      fusion detection in NSCLC diagnosis, which sensitivity and specificity would be compared with&#xD;
      the FDA approved IHC (ALK [D5F3] CDx Assay) test. Subsequently, this study would monitor the&#xD;
      dynamic changes of EML4-ALK fusion in exosome examination diagnosed ALK fusion positive NSCLC&#xD;
      patients both before and after treatment. It aims to prospectively evaluate the potential&#xD;
      value of this approach on efficacy and prognosis prediction in NSCLC therapy and determining&#xD;
      whether exosome ALK fusion could assess the curative effect more accurately than imaging&#xD;
      examination and tumor markers. Thirdly, FISH diagnosed EML4-ALK positive NSCLC patients will&#xD;
      be divided into the positive or negative subgroup according to their post-treatment exosome&#xD;
      ALK fusion expression which were determined at 2-3 months after ALK inhibitor were adopted.&#xD;
      The prognostic value of monitoring exosome EML4-ALK fusion expression is assessed through the&#xD;
      comparison of patients PFS and OS.&#xD;
