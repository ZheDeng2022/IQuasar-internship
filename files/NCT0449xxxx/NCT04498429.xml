    <textblock>
      Physical therapists frequently use manual cueing as a tool to improve movement quality in&#xD;
      persons recovering from stroke but evidence to support its effectiveness is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this graduate student research study is to determine the immediate and&#xD;
      carryover effects of an integrated verbal and manual facilitation approach used by physical&#xD;
      therapists during sit to stand training on the midline alignment, muscle activation and&#xD;
      quality of movement in chronic stroke survivors with hemiplegia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few decades, the profession of physical therapy has heavily relied on manual&#xD;
      facilitation to improve motor control and functional movement in persons recovering from&#xD;
      stroke or other neurological impairments. In the 1950's, Berta Bobath created&#xD;
      Neuro-Developmental Treatment (NDT), a systematic problem-solving approach that is one of the&#xD;
      most widely used methodologies in neurorehabilitation. NDT relies heavily on verbal and&#xD;
      tactile facilitation as an integrated approach to improve motor control in persons with&#xD;
      hemiplegia. However, current systematic reviews have stated that adequate evidence for the&#xD;
      effectiveness of neuro facilitation is lacking. In the current climate of evidence-based&#xD;
      practice, neurologic physical therapists no longer blindly accept the use of traditional&#xD;
      interventions and instead rely on peer-reviewed research studies to support their clinical&#xD;
      decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the question remains for many physical therapists: are skilled manual cues really an&#xD;
      essential ingredient in the post-stroke recipe? Most practicing neurologic physical&#xD;
      therapists would claim that their hands are their most valuable tools and that the way in&#xD;
      which they use their hands has a direct effect on movement patterns and functional outcomes&#xD;
      with their patients. Ploughman and colleagues reported that manual tactile cues during gait&#xD;
      had &quot;robust but short-lived impacts on cadence and time in double support&quot; during gait but&#xD;
      their findings are merely a step in the right direction. An integrative approach of both&#xD;
      manual and verbal cues have anecdotally shown to be effective to treat impairments from&#xD;
      stroke but there continues to be a dearth of evidence to accurately support the pervasive use&#xD;
      of manual facilitation by physical therapists. While support for manual tactile cueing is&#xD;
      merely beginning to move in the right direction, strong evidence exists that task specific&#xD;
      training can improve functional outcomes by focusing training on desired movements and&#xD;
      activities. But what part does manual cueing truly play in task specific training? Sit to&#xD;
      stand is an essential activity of daily living that is often impaired in stroke survivors and&#xD;
      is commonly trained by physical therapists from both task specific training and NDT schools&#xD;
      of thought. Physical therapists need further clarification as to which methods are most&#xD;
      effective for facilitating maximum learning and recovery during this functional task in order&#xD;
      to craft an ideal recipe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training correct movement patterns in order to improve functional independence is important&#xD;
      at every stage of recovery after stroke. Kerr et al. suggested that successful sit to stand&#xD;
      movements require proper training of the critical timing of events as well as improving&#xD;
      synergistic activation of the appropriate lower limb musculature. Ultimately, asymmetry can&#xD;
      lead to a conditioned suppression of available movement termed &quot;learned non-use&quot;. Continual&#xD;
      reinforcement of poor movement strategies thus leads to passive suppression of maximally&#xD;
      efficient normal movements unless the stroke survivor is actively retrained to unlock masked&#xD;
      abilities over time. Teasell and colleagues confirmed the importance of skilled&#xD;
      rehabilitation throughout all phases of recovery including the chronic stroke phase, though&#xD;
      this important population regularly experiences fewer opportunities to participate in therapy&#xD;
      as time progresses. Measurable gains may be slower at this stage but the ability to perform&#xD;
      essential mobility tasks remains just as important to the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the purpose of this graduate student research study is to determine the immediate and&#xD;
      carryover effects of an integrated verbal and manual facilitation approach during sit to&#xD;
      stand training on the midline alignment, muscle activation and quality of movement in chronic&#xD;
      stroke survivors with hemiplegia. By determining the essential ingredients that lead to an&#xD;
      ideal recipe for success, physical therapists may have more evidence-based tools available to&#xD;
      maximize the independence, quality of life and confidence of their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Session 1: All participants will complete the initial paperwork and then be&#xD;
      randomized into Verbal Cueing Group or Verbal + Manual Cueing Group using envelopes that are&#xD;
      predetermined from a random number table. Height will be assessed using a stadiometer and&#xD;
      weight using a scale. Subjects will then have trajectory markers and surface&#xD;
      electromyographic (EMG) sensors placed according to the chart. This includes 24 individual&#xD;
      marker trajectories, two thigh clusters and two shank clusters of four trajectories each for&#xD;
      a total of 40 markers and 6 surface EMG sensors that will be placed on major muscle groups of&#xD;
      the lower extremities. Once the setup has been completed and verified, the subject will&#xD;
      perform two static standing trials, followed by two initial sit to stand (STS) trials to&#xD;
      determine their baseline variables. This format will be followed by both the Verbal Cueing&#xD;
      and the Verbal + Manual Cueing throughout the treatment session. The first 5 repetitions of&#xD;
      both groups will include part to whole task practice of partial sit to stand using scripted&#xD;
      verbal cueing to facilitate understanding of the task. The goal of both groups is to improve&#xD;
      midline orientation and alignment during the task of moving from sitting to standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 5 repetitions, the subject will perform two sit to stand trials on their own&#xD;
      following the clinician's scripted verbal commands. Next, five Manual + Verbal Cueing or&#xD;
      Verbal Cueing trials will commence followed by another two PostCue trials. This repeated&#xD;
      sequence of 5 cued trials followed by 2 assessment trials will continue for a total of 40 sit&#xD;
      to stand trials. After a 5-minute rest period the subject will then be asked to perform two&#xD;
      additional STS to determine retention of learning over that interval. Next, two isometrically&#xD;
      resisted sit to stand trials will be performed for EMG normalization. Once the EMG&#xD;
      normalization is completed, the subject will then be told they are done and may get up to&#xD;
      leave. When they get up to leave, their sit to stand activity will also be discretely&#xD;
      recorded for comparison to their last knowingly observed trial. This is based on the Actual&#xD;
      Amount of Use Test (AAOUT) in which subjects are observed under normal circumstances to&#xD;
      assess whether the learning was integrated into functional use when the subject doesn't think&#xD;
      they are being observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of session #1, the investigator will ask the subject what strategy most helped&#xD;
      them achieve midline. Based on their feedback, the investigator will create and issue a home&#xD;
      exercise program (HEP) handout that incorporates that subjective report. Examples include&#xD;
      statements such as, &quot;Feeling the pressure through my left leg&quot;, &quot;Leaning to my left&quot; or &quot;Once&#xD;
      I felt the movement you requested I understood what you wanted me to do&quot;. This cue will be&#xD;
      placed on a brightly colored card that will be placed near where the subject practices&#xD;
      sitting to standing most often in their home environment. The card will also contain an easy&#xD;
      to mark log to encourage practice of the STS task over the next 3-5 days. The subject will be&#xD;
      instructed to perform the exercises at the times specified on the card using the subject's&#xD;
      subjective to help encourage maximal midline orientation. Permission will be obtained to text&#xD;
      the subject on a regular basis to remind them to perform the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2: Participants who choose to return will come back within 3 to 5 days of Session #1.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to bring their HEP card to verify compliance via the practice log.&#xD;
      After placement of the trajectory markers (but not the EMG), subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      perform two trials of sit to stand, regardless of their original group. They will then be&#xD;
      assessed with the AAOUT test in the same manner as the end of session #1. Afterward,&#xD;
      participants in the Verbal Cueing group will be offered the Integrated Cueing approach if&#xD;
      they so choose.&#xD;
