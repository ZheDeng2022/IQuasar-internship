      To determine efficacy and safety profile of dexamethasone 0.4mg lacrimal insert in dry eye&#xD;
      related ocular surface inflammation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies showed that dexamethasone and loteprednol topical drops have led to&#xD;
      favorable results. However, the requirement of frequent instillation of drops by the patients&#xD;
      is problematic causing discomfort and blurring of vision and requires remembering and&#xD;
      dexterity for instillation, poor compliance is not uncommon. In addition Investigators&#xD;
      believe that instillation of drops disturbs the homeostasis of the natural tear film due to&#xD;
      physical and chemical trauma due to large drop volume (50 microliters) hammering on the eye&#xD;
      surface (which can only hold 7 to 10 microliters). Particularly washing away of the mucin&#xD;
      layer that holds all the &quot;good ingredients&quot; in the tears is harmful to the ocular surface.&#xD;
      Therefore, &quot;dropless&quot; treatment of dry eye is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dextenza® (dexamethasone ophthalmic insert, Ocular Therapeutix Inc., Bedford, MA) is a&#xD;
      corticosteroid intracanalicular insert approved by US-FDA in November 2018 for the treatment&#xD;
      of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. It is inserted into the lower lacrimal punctum&#xD;
      and into the canaliculus. A single insert releases a 0.4 mg dose of dexamethasone for up to&#xD;
      30 days following insertion. Dextenza® is resorbable and does not require removal.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that Dextenza® could mimic short-term topical steroid use in a&#xD;
      tapering manner in patients with clinically significant dry eye and show efficacy in&#xD;
      improving its symptoms and signs, as was previously shown with other steroid preparations. If&#xD;
      proven, the use of Dextenza® may shift paradigms in the management of the clinically&#xD;
      significant ocular surface disease. To test this hypothesis, investigators propose to study&#xD;
      the effects of Dextenza® in the treatment of clinically significant dry eye.&#xD;

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>OSS will be graded according to the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) grading system. Conjunctival staining will be evaluated 1st, using a neutral density filter over the light source after instillation of lissamine green dye. The nasal and temporal conjunctiva, within the interpalpebral fissure, will be graded separately (maximum score of 3 and minimum of 0 for each area). Corneal staining will be evaluated using the cobalt blue filter at least 2 minutes after instillation of fluorescein dye. Maximum possible fluorescein score (the punctate epithelial erosions grade + any extra points for modifiers [central staining, confluent staining, and filaments]) will be 6 and minimum of 0. The total possible maximum OSS, derived by summing the corneal and conjunctival scores, will be 12 for each eye.&#xD;
The difference between the average corneal staining in the treated arm versus the average corneal staining in the sham arm will be compared statistically.</description>
