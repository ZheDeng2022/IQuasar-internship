  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this program is to allow access to nilotinib for eligible patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). The patient's Treating Physician should follow the&#xD;
      suggested treatment guidelines and comply with all local health authority regulations. The&#xD;
      requesting Treating Physician submitted a request for access to drug (often referred to as&#xD;
      Compassionate Use) to Novartis which was reviewed and approved by the medical team&#xD;
      experienced with the drug and indication. Please refer to the latest Investigator's Brochure&#xD;
      (IB) or approved label for overview of drug including: non-clinical and clinical experience,&#xD;
      risk and benefits. Novartis will continue to provide any new safety information to the&#xD;
      Treating Physician as they emerge.&#xD;

    <description>Nilotinib is recommended to be administered orally on a continuous schedule at a dose of 400 mg twice daily. The patient should be instructed to take each morning dose of nilotinib 2 hours after a light breakfast (e.g., toast and jam), with no oral intake other than water for 1 hour after dosing. It is recommended that the patient take nilotinib doses every 12 hours with a glass of water. The evening dose of nilotinib should be taken at least 2 hours after dinner with no oral intake other than water for 1 hour after dosing.</description>
