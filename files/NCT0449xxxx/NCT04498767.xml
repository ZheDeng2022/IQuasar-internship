  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open-label multicentre Phase III superiority study of the effect of&#xD;
      adding SBRT to the standard of care treatment on overall survival in patients with rare&#xD;
      oligometastatic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between current standard of care treatment vs.&#xD;
      standard of care treatment + SBRT to all sites of known metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess if the addition of stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SBRT) to standard of care treatment improves overall survival (OS) as compared&#xD;
      to standard of care treatment alone in patients with rare oligometastatic cancers.&#xD;

    <description>Radiotherapy for patients in the standard arm should follow the principles of palliative radiotherapy as per the individual institution, with the goal of alleviating symptoms or preventing imminent complications. Recommended dose fractionations in this arm will include 8 Gy in 1 fractions, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, and 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Patients in this arm should not receive stereotactic doses or radiotherapy boosts, unless there is a clearly known clinical benefit (e.g. stereotactic radiation to a new brain metastases when all disease is controlled on systemic therapy).&#xD;
Systemic therapy will be pre-specified based on the standard of care approach for that patient, and it may include cytotoxic, targeted, hormonal, or immunotherapy.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Arm 2: Standard of Care + SBRT</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The experimental arm consists of SBRT (and standard of care systemic therapy). Each lesion may be treated with 1, 3, or 5 SBRT fractions of 16-24 Gy, 24-33 Gy or 25-40 Gy, respectively, depending on the local practice and size &amp; location of oligometastases. Three-fraction regimens will deliver a fraction every second day, and five-fraction regimens are delivered daily. All treatments must be completed within 2 weeks (10 working days) in order to avoid delays in starting systemic therapy.&#xD;
Patients treated with prior or concomitant systemic therapy are eligible for this study. Use of chemotherapy regimens, targeted therapy or immunotherapy containing potent enhancers of radiation damage (e.g. gemcitabine, doxorubicin) can be postponed or interrupted for a duration of one month after radiation.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed malignancy with metastatic disease detected on imaging.&#xD;
             Biopsy of metastasis is preferred, but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Controlled primary tumour, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  at least 3 months since original tumour treated definitively, with no progression at&#xD;
             primary site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total number of oligometastases of 1-5 including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain metastases amenable to radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy&#xD;
             patient who had neurosurgical resection before trial inclusion are allowed and&#xD;
             resected brain metastases count to the total number of oligometastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All sites of disease can be safely treated based on the judgement of an experienced&#xD;
             radiation oncologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG score 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before patient randomization, written informed consent must be given according to&#xD;
             ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary cancer of prostate, breast, lung or colorectal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical comorbidities precluding radiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  These include interstitial lung disease in patients requiring thoracic radiation,&#xD;
             Crohn's disease in patients where the GI tract will receive radiotherapy, or&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis where the bowel will receive radiotherapy and connective tissue&#xD;
             disorders such as lupus or scleroderma.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Brain metastases only, without extra-cerebral metastases&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinical or radiologic evidence of symptomatic spinal cord compression. Patients can&#xD;
             be eligible if surgical resection has been performed, but the surgical site counts&#xD;
             toward the total of up to 3 metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease that invades any of the following: GI tract (including oesophagus,&#xD;
             stomach, small or large bowel), mesenteric lymph nodes, or disseminated skin&#xD;
             metastases and lymphangiosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially&#xD;
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions&#xD;
             should be discussed with the patient before randomization in the trial&#xD;
