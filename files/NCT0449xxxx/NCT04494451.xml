  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized controlled trial we aim to evaluate the impact of vitamin C on&#xD;
      AKI outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and MDR infections. We also aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of iv vitamin c on systemic hemodynamics (cardiac output and systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistive index, extravascular lung water and lung permeability index), endothelial function&#xD;
      and coagulation, microcirculation (as assessed by lactate clearance and central venous oxygen&#xD;
      saturation), mitochondrial function, 28-day mortality and vasopressor, ventilator and RRT&#xD;
      free days in the ICU. The safety and side-effects of vitamin c would also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suspected (nosocomial acquisition) or proven MDR infections would be screened&#xD;
      and randomized to two groups who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Will receive iv vitamin C (25 mg/kg or max. 1.5 gram every 6 hourly) for maximum 5&#xD;
      days along with iv antibiotics as per institutional protocol Group 2: iv antibiotics alone&#xD;

      Aim &amp; Objectives Primary To evaluate the impact of vitamin C on AKI outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis and MDR infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives To assess the effects on systemic hemodynamics (cardiac output and&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistive index, extravascular lung water and lung permeability index)&#xD;
      Impact of Vitamin C on endothelial function and coagulation Improvement in microcirculation&#xD;
      as assessed by lactate clearance and central venous oxygen saturation To assess the effects&#xD;
      on 28-day mortality. Improvement in SOFA scores in both groups Vasopressor, ventilator and&#xD;
      RRT free days in the ICU Incidence of adverse effects in both groups Prevalence of vitamin C&#xD;
      deficiency in cirrhotics with sepsis and impact of exogenous vitamin C in improving&#xD;
      endogenous levels of ascorbate and norepinephrine levels Impact of vitamin C on oxidative&#xD;
      stress by evaluation of mitochondrial bioenergetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B) Methodology Patients with suspected (nosocomial acquisition) or proven MDR infections&#xD;
      would be screened and randomized to two groups as under Group 1: Will receive iv vitamin C&#xD;
      (25 mg/kg or max. 1.5 gram every 6 hourly) for maximum 5 days along with iv antibiotics as&#xD;
      per institutional protocol Group 2: iv antibiotics alone All patients with nosocomial&#xD;
      bacterial infections or septic shock would be screened for randomization would be considered&#xD;
      for enrolment in the trial. Nosocomial infection would be defined as infections developing&#xD;
      after 48 hours of hospitalization. Following this, patients meeting the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be screened and randomized to the two treatment groups. Standard of&#xD;
      care for management of antibiotics, fluids and vasopressors would be as per institutional&#xD;
      guidelines. At baseline, blood and urine sample would be stored for all patients for&#xD;
      performing mitochondrial bioenergetics, endotoxin, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-IB,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IL-1O) and urine biomarkers (urine NGAL and cystatin C) and markers of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction(von willebrand factor and ADAMTS). Following randomization patients&#xD;
      would be allocated to receive intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g every 6 h or 25 mg/kg for 5 days)&#xD;
      along with intravenous antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cirrhosis with MDR infections (nosocomial acquisition) or culture-proven&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted on patients admitted to Department of Hepatology from June&#xD;
           2020 to December 2020 at ILBS, New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group will comprise of patients critically ill cirrhotics with suspected or proven&#xD;
           MDR infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted on patients admitted to Department of Hepatology from June&#xD;
           2020 to December 2020 at ILBS, New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group will comprise of patients critically ill cirrhotics with MDR infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size calculation: Currently there are lack of studies investigating the incidence and&#xD;
      outcomes of AKI in this context. The study will be designed as a pilot RCT with an aim to&#xD;
      enrol 50 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed cytokine profile, endotoxin assay, markers of endothelial dysfunction and&#xD;
      bioenergetics would be performed in a subset of 15 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: IV Vitamin C&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Assessment: Hourly till the patient is in the intensive care unit then every 7&#xD;
      days for 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All variables shall be expressed in mean (sd) or median (range)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables will be compared by Mann- Whitney U test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Categorical variables we will use Chi-Square or Fisher's test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival analysis will be done using Cox-proportional regression analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actuarial probability of survival shall be calculated by Kaplan- Meier graph and compared by&#xD;
      log- rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Effects: Any allergic reactions, drop in hemoglobin or development of kidney stones&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rule of the study: Any untoward adverse effects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues in the study and plans to address these issue The study is designed to&#xD;
      demonstrate the efficacy of intravenous vitamin C in improving AKI outcomes in cirrhotics&#xD;
      with MDR infections. Vitamin C is been routinely used in this indication with no major&#xD;
      adverse effects. However, head-to-head comparison is needed to identify the evidence and&#xD;
      benefits of using this drug in this indication. Only minor side effects like nausea,&#xD;
      diarrhea, abdominal bloating, cramps and precipitation of kidney stones have been observed&#xD;
      with the drug.&#xD;
