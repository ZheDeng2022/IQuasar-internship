  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and results in 8-25% acute&#xD;
      malignant bowel obstruction. Since Dohmoto et al. first applied and reported the&#xD;
      self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) in the treatment of colorectal stenosis, they have been&#xD;
      widely used not only as an alternative treatment as a bridge to surgery (BTS), but also as a&#xD;
      mean of palliative option for stenosing lumen in clinical practice. Numerous publications&#xD;
      have reported that the stent placement technique showed 75% to 100% technical success rates&#xD;
      and 84% to 100% clinical success rates. However, it is sometimes difficult to place due to&#xD;
      the distorted anatomy or acute angulations in patients and other conditions with poor&#xD;
      endoscopic visualization with the normal colonoscope. The aims of this study were to present&#xD;
      our results with two novel SEMS implantation techniques.&#xD;

    <description>The self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) implantation was conducted using an ultrafine endoscope (UFE) (GIF-XP260NS; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The UFE researched the stricture, and a guidewire was inserted into the endoscopic working channel. The guidewire was left. And the endoscope was withdrawn. The normal colonoscope was exchanged under the reverse guidance of the guidewire. Finally, a metal, uncovered SEMS was placed along the guidewire.</description>
