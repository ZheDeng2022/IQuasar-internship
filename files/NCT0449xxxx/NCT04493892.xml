      The purpose of this study is to reduce use of personal care products that contain endocrine&#xD;
      disrupting chemicals among women. For this pilot intervention, the investigators focus on the&#xD;
      hair care product class of personal care products, the reduction in use of&#xD;
      phthalate-containing Hair Care Products (HCPs) and use among pregnant Women of Color (WOC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDC) disrupt reproductive development and increase cancer risk&#xD;
      through their ability to have a direct, indirect, or interactive action on cellular processes&#xD;
      within the mammary tissues. EDCs may have the most influence during periods of dynamic&#xD;
      structural and functional changes in the mammary glands, such as during pregnancy and the&#xD;
      postpartum windows. Hair care products (HCPs) are a class of personal care products (PCPs)&#xD;
      that contain EDCs; there are stark differences in HCP use by race. Differences in hair&#xD;
      texture may explain differences in use. Nevertheless, of major concern, clinical,&#xD;
      epidemiological, and laboratory studies have suggested HCPs are associated with earlier&#xD;
      pubertal events, where the timing of pubertal maturation is an established risk factor for&#xD;
      breast cancer (BC) risk. Additional studies have shown that compared to infrequent users,&#xD;
      women classified as moderate or frequent users of PCPs had a 10-15% higher BC risk, dark hair&#xD;
      dye is associated with a 52-72% increased BC risk, a history of chemical relaxer or&#xD;
      straightener use is associated with a 64-74% increase in BC risk, and in 454 Mexican women&#xD;
      (233 cases) urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (MEP) were positively associated&#xD;
      with BC, with stronger associations observed for pre-menopausal women. Evidence is emerging&#xD;
      on EDC exposures across the pregnancy/postpartum periods. This is of importance because while&#xD;
      pregnancy is associated with a long-term reduced risk of BC, it also confers an increased&#xD;
      risk of BC for at least a decade after birth. EDC exposure during this period of increased&#xD;
      risk could promote 'activation' effects for BC following pregnancy. In pregnant women, PCP&#xD;
      use is correlated with higher concentrations of urinary phthalates, urinary metabolite&#xD;
      concentrations vary by PCP type, and urinary metabolite concentrations differ by&#xD;
      sociodemographic factors and across racial and ethnic populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, few studies examine HCP-associated EDC exposure across the&#xD;
      pregnancy/postpartum periods and no study has implemented a behavioral intervention. An&#xD;
      intervention during pregnancy on EDC exposures and HCPs could have intergenerational health&#xD;
      implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intervention to reduce phthalate exposures during the pregnancy/postpartum window would&#xD;
      have both fetal/early and maternal health implications. First, behavioral changes during&#xD;
      pregnancy could mitigate EDC exposures that exert in utero effects that may program long term&#xD;
      risk for hormone-related disease for the child. Second, behavioral changes could reduce&#xD;
      'activation' effects for BC following pregnancy. Pregnant women are primed to change&#xD;
      behaviors for their babies' health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose an educational intervention for prenatal women of color&#xD;
      in Northern Manhattan on HCPs and EDC exposures with an assessment of behavioral change via&#xD;
      self-report and urinary phthalate concentrations.&#xD;
