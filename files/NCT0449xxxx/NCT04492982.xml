  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), college aged respondents&#xD;
      between 18 and 25 years old reported the highest alcohol use rates (over 58%) as well as the&#xD;
      highest rates of binge drinking of any age group. High alcohol use/abuse in college students&#xD;
      is associated with myriad negative consequences, including fatal and nonfatal injuries and&#xD;
      overdoses, impaired academic and vocational performance, violence and other crime, legal&#xD;
      problems, unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, and social problems. The&#xD;
      National Comorbidity Survey underscores that use initiated in this period is not just&#xD;
      experimental and recreational but may have lasting effects on consumption trajectories: For&#xD;
      the majority of adults diagnosed alcohol use disorders, onset occurred during emerging&#xD;
      adulthood. During this stage of development, vast changes in emotion regulation (ER) take&#xD;
      place, particularly age-related shifts in the strategies used to manage distress that may&#xD;
      lead to alcohol use/abuse (i.e., emotion suppression, inhibitory control, and cognitive&#xD;
      reappraisal. Substantial evidence suggests that deficits in ER are strongly related to&#xD;
      patterns of alcohol use in young adults. In particular, deficits in the self regulation of&#xD;
      discomfort and distress, called distress tolerance, predict alcohol use - specifically,&#xD;
      motivation and urgency for use, escalations in consumption, and the development of dependence&#xD;
      that may be indicative of alcohol use disorders. Emerging adults who turn to alcohol as a way&#xD;
      of coping with distressing emotions are most at risk for heavy alcohol use into adulthood and&#xD;
      more severe negative alcohol consequences. Given the variable effectiveness of existing&#xD;
      approaches for reducing college students' alcohol use, The investigators contend that&#xD;
      interventions may be differentially effective depending on individual characteristics. In&#xD;
      particular, students with difficulties in managing distress and discomfort may benefit from&#xD;
      more intensive interventions that promote effective ER compared to treatment as usual;&#xD;
      further, other background characteristics may predict the efficacy and acceptability of each&#xD;
      type of ER intervention. In this R34, investigators will test the acceptability/ feasibility&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of two complementary interventions (Yoga and Distress Tolerance) on&#xD;
      preventing alcohol use in a randomized controlled trial of 180 high-risk college students&#xD;
      relative to treatment as usual. Investigators will assess participants' alcohol use&#xD;
      (self-report and biomarker measures) and emotion regulation (ER) at baseline along with&#xD;
      physiological discomfort sensitivity and psychosocial predictors of treatment efficacy over&#xD;
      time, including a post-treatment follow-up. Study aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test feasibility/acceptability of two ER interventions among high-risk emerging adults&#xD;
           by documenting rates of recruitment, retention, adherence, and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine trends in intervention acceptability based on baseline characteristics (i.e.,&#xD;
           associations between participant retention and participant-rated acceptability and age,&#xD;
           gender, family characteristics/dynamics, and predispositions to discomfort tolerance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test preliminary efficacy of the ER interventions on measures of ER and alcohol use.&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Participants in both intervention groups will see greater improvements in ER&#xD;
           and alcohol use outcomes compared to the TAU control group.&#xD;
