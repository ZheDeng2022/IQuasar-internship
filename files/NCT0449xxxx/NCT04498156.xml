    <textblock>
      In this survey study, researchers want to find out more about how physicians are treating&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with reduced kidney function (chronic kidney disease, CKD) and high blood&#xD;
      sugar level (type 2 diabetes); what physicians know about the different treatment options&#xD;
      available; and how they use this knowledge to treat their patients successfully.&#xD;
      Additionally, researchers want to gather information about patient's awareness of their&#xD;
      disease and which criteria they consider important for their treatment of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will survey a total of 150 patients with type 2 diabetes: 50 patients with mild&#xD;
      CKD; 50 patients with moderate CKD; and 50 patients with severe CKD. Patients eligible for&#xD;
      this study can be male or female and should be at least 18 years old. In addition, a total of&#xD;
      150 physicians will be surveyed. Physicians eligible for this study may be general&#xD;
      practitioners, endocrinologist, or nephrologists.&#xD;

      The primary objective in this study is to assess the awareness, values and preferences of&#xD;
      patients and physicians with respect to the risks, consequences and management of chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives aim to assess awareness of available CKD treatments, referral tools and&#xD;
      communication between patients and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both patients and physicians will complete a survey that consists of various questions&#xD;
      regarding the knowledge of disease, values and treatments, patient-physician interaction,&#xD;
      physician referral tools and disease risk management.&#xD;
