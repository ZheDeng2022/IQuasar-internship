  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of radial shock wave therapy in neck pain. For&#xD;
      this objective, subjects recruited will be allocated in an experimental group or a placebo&#xD;
      group. Both groups will receive one manual therapy and radial shock waves therapy (real for&#xD;
      experimental group, a sham device for placebo group) session per week along one month. Neck&#xD;
      pain, neck function, temporomandibular pain, temporomandibular function and quality of life&#xD;
      measured will be performed before the intervention, after the last treatment and at one month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is defined as discomfort or more intense forms of pain that are localized to the&#xD;
      cervical region. The multifactorial etiology of neck pain includes trauma, ergonomic factors&#xD;
      such as inappropriate postures, repetitive movements, strong physical activity, individual&#xD;
      factors such as age, BMI, genetic factors, behavioral factors, and psychosocial factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of cervicalgia ranges from 16.7 to 75.1%, of which 50% will resolve within a&#xD;
      short time and the other half will suffer pain for a longer time. There is a higher&#xD;
      prevalence in widows and separated, people with few economic resources, jobs that involve&#xD;
      physical effort, low educational level, anxiety and depression. Furthermore, there is a high&#xD;
      relationship between cervical pain and temporomandibular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this study, the investigators are going to carry out a non-invasive, analgesic,&#xD;
      antiinflammatory treatment and without negative side effects for the patient through radial&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock waves (rESWT), and manual therapy (TM). Among the effects produced by&#xD;
      shock waves the investigators find that they improve circulation due to increased blood flow&#xD;
      and oxygenation, at tissue level the permeability of the membrane increases and its metabolic&#xD;
      process, therefore facilitating the activation of tissue regeneration processes experiencing&#xD;
      dystrophic changes. Furthermore, shock waves cause anti-inflammatory effects and muscle&#xD;
      relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the capacity of the shock waves to improve the&#xD;
      alterations due to neck pain. To meet the above objective, a single-blind randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial study has been designed. The selected subjects will be of legal age diagnosed with neck&#xD;
      pain and those subjects that due to their own characteristics are not able to carry out the&#xD;
      study will be excluded. Subjects will receive a weekly physical therapy session for four&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects will be randomly assigned to two groups: T1 intervention group consisting of&#xD;
      subjects who will receive manual therapy treatment and shock waves and T2 placebo group in&#xD;
      which the subjects will receive manual therapy and placebo shock waves.&#xD;

    <description>Neck Disability Index. The Neck Disability Index is a questionnaire that assesses disability produced by neck pain. It consists of ten questions with six different answers that are ordered from least to most disability, with 0 corresponding to no disability and 5 corresponding to greatest disability. The result is the sum of the answers, ranging from 0 to 50. The categorization of the final result is as follows: &quot;no disability&quot; if the result is between 0 and 4, &quot;moderate disability&quot; between 15 and 24, and &quot;complete disability&quot; between 35 and 50.</description>
