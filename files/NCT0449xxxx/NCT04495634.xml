      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate stationary head CT (s-HCT) as a diagnostic&#xD;
      tool in patients with known head trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants will be 50 people who have had either a head trauma or a brain&#xD;
      bleed and have undergone a head CT in the past 24 hours or who will undergo a CT scan of the&#xD;
      head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): This investigation will be a single arm, prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
      Participants will have one single visit, which will include the s-HCT scan. No follow-up is&#xD;
      required. All images will be de-identified before inclusion within a reader study. The&#xD;
      investigators will perform a reader study with physician readers comparing the acquired&#xD;
      imaging s-HCT images and conventional head CT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This investigation will be a single arm, prospective clinical trial evaluating stationary&#xD;
      head CT (s-HCT) as a diagnostic tool in patients with known head trauma. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that a stationary head CT (s-HCT) system based on the carbon nanotube linear&#xD;
      array x-ray source can provide diagnostic quality head CT images. Patients included in the&#xD;
      study will be 50 people who have had either a head trauma or a brain bleed and have undergone&#xD;
      a head CT in the past 24 hours or who will undergo a CT scan of the head.&#xD;

    <description>The system consists of a total of three x-ray sources and nine x-ray detectors with an estimation of approximately 150 projection angles per slice, with less than a minute per slice reconstruction. Radiation dose will be configured as to not exceed that of a conventional head CT, or 2 mSv. The subjects will be positioned on a medical procedure table that will move the subject through the scanning system at the rate of roughly 1 cm per second, during which the necessary x-ray projections will be acquired. The head will be positioned in a carbon fiber head holder from a clinical CT scanner that is secured to the table.</description>
