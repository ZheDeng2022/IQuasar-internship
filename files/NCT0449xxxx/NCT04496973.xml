      The purpose of this Parkinson's Disease Registry is to assist with recruitment of willing&#xD;
      participants into future Parkinson's disease research studies at the University of Delaware.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for Parkinson's Disease research due to its increasing global&#xD;
      prevalence. Participant recruitment is a significant challenge to the success of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease research and we need your help more than ever in moving the field forward and&#xD;
      improving the lives of people who have Parkinson's disease. Recruitment of study participants&#xD;
      can be facilitated by maintaining registries of people who agree to be contacted for future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the University of Delaware Participant Recruitment Registry for Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease Research is to create a registry that includes the contact information and basic&#xD;
      health information pertaining the participant's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The&#xD;
      registry will streamline recruitment and enrollment in a variety of research studies focusing&#xD;
      on topics such as, but not limited to: brain changes in Parkinson's disease, balance and gait&#xD;
      in Parkinson's disease, exercise and its effect on motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be in the registry individuals must have a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, have&#xD;
      an interest in participating in research studies, and be willing to allow the Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease Team access to their medical history from their medical provider(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To become a member of this registry, primary information including contact information and&#xD;
      some general medical information from a health provider are needed. Medical information will&#xD;
      be evaluated to confirm Parkinson's disease diagnosis and to determine if a potential&#xD;
      participant is eligible to become a member of the registry.&#xD;
