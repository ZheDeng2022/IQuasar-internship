  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) is a common pathology affecting between 4 and 8% of the general&#xD;
      population. It aggravates morbidity and cardio-metabolic mortality and is responsible for&#xD;
      accidents related to vigilance disorders. It is estimated that 80%% of SAS cases are not&#xD;
      diagnosed and therefore not treated. It is however impracticable to propose a diagnostic test&#xD;
      of polygraphy (PG) or polysomnography (PSG) to every patient because of the cost and&#xD;
      insufficient availability of these exams. It would therefore be useful to carry out a&#xD;
      screening test before directing the patient to a complete test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several simplified polygraph systems with 2 or 3 channels have been proposed (nasal cannula,&#xD;
      oximetry, heart rate) but they generally record only one night and remain intrusive enough to&#xD;
      perturb the sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Withings HWA09 is a wrist-worn watch, which allows screening of SAS from four signals:&#xD;
      movement, heart rate, breathing rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). The objective of the&#xD;
      present study is to validate the diagnostic performance of the Withings HWA09 for the&#xD;
      detection of SAS compared to PSG.&#xD;

      Subjects are patients having a prescription for a one-night polysomnographic consultation in&#xD;
      order to diagnose potential sleep disorders. The investigator will collect the consent before&#xD;
      including any patient in this study. The study last one night per patient, during which&#xD;
      saturation signal recordings and the sleep apnea detection will be made by the HWA09 watch,&#xD;
      in comparison to the polysomnography.&#xD;
