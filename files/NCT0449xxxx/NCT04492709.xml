  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice, AZD5718 will be co-administered with CYP3A substrates. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      important to determine the impact of AZD5718 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CYP3A4&#xD;
      substrates. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of AZD5718 on the&#xD;
      PK of midazolam, a known sensitive CYP3A4 substrate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, fixed sequence, open-label study in healthy subjects, performed at a&#xD;
      single study center. This study will consist of 3 treatment periods to assess the PK of&#xD;
      midazolam when administered alone and in combination with multiple doses of AZD5718.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three treatment periods during which subjects will be resident from the day before first&#xD;
           dosing (Day -1) until at least 24 hours after last dosing (Day 7); discharged on the&#xD;
           morning of Day 8, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final Follow-up Visit within 5 to 7 days after the last administration of&#xD;
           investigational medicinal product (IMP).&#xD;
