  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine whether a brief, therapeutic interview can help&#xD;
      patients improve their pain and health by addressing psychological issues that are known to&#xD;
      drive chronic musculoskeletal pain. This randomized, controlled trial tests the efficacy of a&#xD;
      brief, one-session therapeutic interview for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and&#xD;
      histories of childhood adversity. Adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain will be randomized&#xD;
      to either a therapeutic interview condition or a waitlist control condition. The therapeutic&#xD;
      interview will be 90-minute session during which participants will be encouraged to disclose&#xD;
      stressful experiences, express important emotions, and identify connections between their&#xD;
      life stress and their pain, which we hope will increase their psychological attributions for&#xD;
      pain and reduce their pain, interpersonal problems, and psychological distress. The study&#xD;
      will compare the therapeutic interview condition to a delayed interview condition and will&#xD;
      follow patients for 5 weeks to identify changes in response to the interview. Participants in&#xD;
      the therapeutic interview condition are expected to show more improvement on pain severity,&#xD;
      pain interference, psychological distress, interpersonal function, and psychological&#xD;
      attitudes toward pain at follow-up, relative to participants in the delayed interview&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a brief, one-session&#xD;
      therapeutic interview for patients who are seeking biomedical care for their chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain and who also have self-reported trauma histories. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either a therapeutic interview condition or a waitlist control condition and&#xD;
      and will follow patients for 5 weeks to identify health and attitude changes in response to&#xD;
      the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain and reported histories of&#xD;
      childhood adversity. Participants will be adults with primary musculoskeletal pain such as&#xD;
      low back pain, neck pain, and fibromyalgia. In addition, only those patients who also report&#xD;
      a significant history of childhood adversity will be eligible for this study, as determined&#xD;
      by a score of 4 or higher on the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Scale. Patients will be&#xD;
      excluded if they: a) have a current psychotic disorder or b) are unable to communicate in&#xD;
      English, or c) are scheduled for an upcoming surgery within the next 2 months. Participants&#xD;
      will be allowed to engage in this study regardless of current medication use or engagement in&#xD;
      other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are interested in participating will complete a brief online screening to&#xD;
      determine eligibility and will be provided with basic information about the study. Once&#xD;
      consented, baseline measures will be completed online, and participants will be randomized,&#xD;
      1:1, to the therapeutic interview condition or waitlist control condition. Those who are&#xD;
      randomized to the therapeutic interview condition will complete their interview as soon as&#xD;
      possible after completing baseline measures. The interview will be conducted either in-person&#xD;
      at the Stress &amp; Health Laboratory at Wayne State University, or remotely via a secure&#xD;
      telehealth platform (depending on COVID-19 restrictions). Follow-up measures will be&#xD;
      administered at five weeks after the interview (or at the equivalent time for the waitlist&#xD;
      group). Participants in the waitlist control condition will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      receive the therapeutic interview after completion of the follow-up measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic interview will be a one-session interview lasting approximately 90 minutes.&#xD;
      The interview will be conducted by trained interviewers (i.e., clinical psychology graduate&#xD;
      students). The goals of the therapeutic interview are to promote awareness of the role of&#xD;
      trauma and interpersonal stress in pain, to encourage experience of emotions associated with&#xD;
      interpersonal stressors and conflicts, and to encourage more adaptive interpersonal&#xD;
      communication in current relationships. The interview has five primary components. The first&#xD;
      component involves eliciting a brief pain history from the participants. The next component&#xD;
      explores participants' stressful life experiences, including those that occurred during their&#xD;
      childhood and those that might be affecting their current life. The next component will&#xD;
      introduce participants to a model of emotions that illustrates how suppressing important,&#xD;
      healthy feelings in relationships can lead to symptoms (e.g. anxiety, pain, stress).&#xD;
      Participants will be encouraged to identify the feelings that are most difficult for them to&#xD;
      express in relationships and the ways in which avoiding these feelings leads to prolonged&#xD;
      stress or worse pain. The next component involves encouraging participants to identify key,&#xD;
      conflictual relationships and to express their previously avoided, healthy feelings (e.g.&#xD;
      assertion, tenderness, grief). The final and 5th component will explore how the interview&#xD;
      affected their beliefs about the role of stress and emotions in pain. The interviewer will&#xD;
      provide a summary of their strengths and areas for improvement related to their emotions and&#xD;
      interpersonal functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be clinical outcomes that reflect changes in pain severity and pain interference,&#xD;
      pain-related anxiety, and emotional distress. There will be behavioral outcomes that capture&#xD;
      changes in patients' interpersonal assertiveness, substance use, and adaptive affective&#xD;
      functioning (defined as one's cognitive, behavioral, and emotional responses to one's healthy&#xD;
      feelings or needs). Finally, there will be attitudinal outcomes that reflect changes in&#xD;
      patients' attributions about the role of psychological and brain-based factors in pain.&#xD;
