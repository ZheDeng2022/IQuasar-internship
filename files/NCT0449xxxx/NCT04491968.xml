  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to rigorously examine the impact of online MORE, delivered&#xD;
      through video conference, on opioid use and chronic pain among individuals receiving&#xD;
      methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). This study is a randomized controlled trial to test&#xD;
      the efficacy of online MORE on opioid use and chronic pain immediately after treatment and&#xD;
      8-weeks post-treatment as compared to treatment as usual (TAU) among 154 individuals in MMT.&#xD;
      Further, mediators (i.e., metacognitive awareness, negative emotion regulation, and natural&#xD;
      reward processing) and moderators (i.e., gender, race, income, mental health, trauma, and MMT&#xD;
      phase) of treatment response will be explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 2-arm individually randomized controlled trial design in which outcomes of&#xD;
      MMT patients randomized to MORE are compared to outcomes of those randomized to treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU). In this study (N=154), the investigators will randomize MMT patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain to MORE (n=77) or TAU (n=77). The purpose of this study is to determine MORE's&#xD;
      efficacy for increasing opioid abstinence relative to TAU. Individuals with pain who are&#xD;
      receiving MMT for an opioid use disorder (OUD) will be recruited from two methadone clinics&#xD;
      in New Jersey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through flyers posted in the clinics, being approached by&#xD;
      research assistants in the waiting room of their usual methadone clinic, and referral by&#xD;
      clinic staff. The number of individuals who contact the study staff through the flyers or&#xD;
      referral and who are approached by study staff in the clinics will be tracked. Number of&#xD;
      individuals who refuse study participation and who consent to the study will also be tracked.&#xD;
      If an individual is interested in study participation, a trained research assistant will lead&#xD;
      the individual through the informed consent process in a private space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since MORE is a closed group, the cohorts of 14 participants at each site will be randomized&#xD;
      to TAU or MORE. Once 14 participants at a particular clinic are enrolled and randomized the&#xD;
      MORE group will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the MORE condition will participate in eight, weekly, two-hour&#xD;
      group sessions, co-led by a clinic and study counselor. Each session will contain 7&#xD;
      participants and take place remotely, by video conference. Attendance at each session and&#xD;
      reasons for missing sessions will be recorded. Participants randomized to the control&#xD;
      condition will continue receiving treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will partake in a total of three interviews lasting up to 90 minutes&#xD;
      and occurring, remotely, at baseline, 8- and 16- weeks post-baseline by telephone or video&#xD;
      conference. Each participant will also complete a urine or saliva drug screen at each&#xD;
      assessment. All attempts to reach participants to schedule follow-up assessments will be&#xD;
      tracked. Participants will also complete cognitive testing (for approx. 30-45 minutes) at&#xD;
      baseline and 8-weeks and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) conducted via smartphones or&#xD;
      tablets, which will be provided to each participant by study staff. EMA participation will&#xD;
      require the participant to respond to twice-daily prompts in which they will be asked a&#xD;
      series of brief questions regarding their current mood and exposure to opioid triggers.&#xD;
      Additionally, subjects will be asked to initiate responses when they experience serious&#xD;
      craving or relapse to opioid use. Each EMA assessment will last approximately 3-5 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>The Mindfulness Oriented Recovery Enhancement arm will participate in eight, weekly, two-hour group sessions.MORE sessions involve mindfulness training to prevent opioid relapse and reduce pain, cognitive reappraisal to decrease negative affect and regulate opioid craving, and savoring to augment natural reward processing and evoke positive emotion. Each session begins with a mindful breathing meditation, followed by a debriefing session. The therapist then debriefs participants' homework practice of using mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring skills to cope with pain and enhance well-being in everyday life. During this debrief of the homework. Next, new psychoeducational material is introduced. Sessions culminate with an experiential exercise, and close with a brief mindful breathing meditation. Participants are asked to practice 15 minutes of mindfulness/reappraisal/savoring skills each day.</description>

    <description>In the methadone programs, clients typically come to the clinic regularly to get their methadone dose.

    <ipd_description>Analyses of data generated from this project will be shared with the scientific community through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific meetings. The proposed research will include data from approximately 154 individuals in methadone maintenance treatment. The final dataset will include self-reported demographic and behavioral data from interviews with the subjects and laboratory data from urine or saliva specimens provided. Because we will be following study participants, we will be collecting identifying information. The final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing.</ipd_description>
