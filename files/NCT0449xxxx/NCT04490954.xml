  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared with MRI or CT, brain biological electrical impedance tomography were performed on&#xD;
      patients with supratentorial tumors and healthy people . The AUC (area under the curve) of&#xD;
      ROC, which is associated with the increased maximum and the difference between left and right&#xD;
      equilibrium of impedance value, is calculated. The specificity of brain biological electrical&#xD;
      impedance tomography in screening supratentorial tumors are evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the changes of parameters detected by brain biological electrical impedance&#xD;
      tomography, the enrolled brain tumor patients with cerebral edema were paired with themselves&#xD;
      and intravenous infusion of mannitol so that the sensitivity of this device in monitoring&#xD;
      cerebral edema can be evaluated.&#xD;
