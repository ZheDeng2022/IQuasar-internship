  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an interventional study in which 60 women estimated to enroll according to random&#xD;
      allocation and divided into two groups. The study group will receive aerobic exercise in&#xD;
      addition to diet restriction while the control group will receive diet recommendations. the&#xD;
      aerobic exercise in form of treadmill training intensity of exercise moderate intensity,&#xD;
      target heart rate (THR) will be 50-60% of heart maximum (HR MAX), time of session 40 min&#xD;
      initial 10 min warm up exercise on treadmill in low intensity and active phase 20- 30 min&#xD;
      intensity will increase until patient reach to THR then intensity decrease until session will&#xD;
      be ended by cooling down phase for 10 min . The volunteers will perform exercise 3 times per&#xD;
      week for 12 weeks .different functions and markers will be measured and sex hormones&#xD;
      (estradiol ,testosterone. sex hormone binding globin ) pre and post&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to determine the effect of aerobic exercise and diet on sex hormones and different functions&#xD;
      and markers, and if is there correlation between two factors effect in postmenopausal elderly&#xD;
      women&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, accounting for more&#xD;
      than 50% of all dementia types. Its twice more common in females which could be due to&#xD;
      increased longevity and sex difference in brain size .Estrogen has neurotrophic action in&#xD;
      areas involved in memory and cognition. Post-menopausal women are at increased risk than&#xD;
      their male counterpart. Women with Alzheimer have lower endogenous estrogen level which lead&#xD;
      to the hypothesis that estrogen could be neuroprotective. Estrogen and androgen receptors are&#xD;
      widely distributed throughout the brain e.g. in the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hypo-thalamus&#xD;
      and also in the hippocampus which is important for cognitive functioning. There are shown&#xD;
      clear associations between sex hormones and activities in memory, emotional and rewarding&#xD;
      circuits in the brain measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, several&#xD;
      significant correlations were found between serum hormone levels and spatial ability. High&#xD;
      absolute estrogen levels, a high estrogen/testosterone ratio and increasing levels during&#xD;
      estrogen treatment were all associated with lower spatial ability. This is in agreement with&#xD;
      many previous reports of sex differences where women in general tend to perform worse than&#xD;
      men in this specific aspect of cognitive function. In menstruating women, a deterioration of&#xD;
      spatial ability was demonstrated during high levels of circulating estrogen, and it was&#xD;
      improved during the menstrual phase of the cycle when hormone levels are lowest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no correlation between sex hormones and different functions and markers in response&#xD;
      to aerobic exercise and diet in elderly postmenopausal women&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there correlation between sex hormones and different functions and markers in elderly&#xD;
      postmenopausal women in response to aerobic exercise and dietary restriction?&#xD;
