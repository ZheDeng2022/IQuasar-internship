  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are a burgeoning public health concern, yet only a small minority of&#xD;
      smartphone apps that claim to facilitate healthy eating and weight loss incorporate&#xD;
      evidence-based principles. Such innovations are important as humans fundamentally cannot&#xD;
      accurately estimate portion size. Indeed, portion size estimation errors account for ~50% of&#xD;
      the error in self-reported food intake, and data from our laboratory has demonstrated that&#xD;
      extensive training results in only modest improvements in portion size estimation accuracy&#xD;
      and that portion size estimates remain inaccurate. Our long-term goal is to create simple and&#xD;
      accessible interventions that assist individuals with weight control. In particular, we aim&#xD;
      to provide easy-to-use phone apps that allow participants to monitor the portion sizes of the&#xD;
      foods they consume. These apps guide participants on appropriate portion sizes and provide&#xD;
      recommendations of food groups that should be consumed. To that end, we have developed the&#xD;
      PortionSize app. We propose to improve the accuracy of portion size measurement, as it is&#xD;
      poorly determined by self-report measures. This will occur via the development of the&#xD;
      PortionSize smartphone app and this pilot study will test the usability as well as&#xD;
      preliminary validity and reliability of the app functionality.&#xD;
