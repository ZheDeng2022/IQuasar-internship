  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of biomarker evaluation and safety of pre-incisional ketorolac for&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgical resection for non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. There is significant promise in the use of preoperative ketorolac to decrease the&#xD;
      inflammatory response after surgical resection of tumors, thereby potentially reducing the&#xD;
      risk of distant metastatic tumor spread and improving survival. A total of 56 patients (28&#xD;
      per disease site) will be enrolled into the experimental arm and will receive ketorolac prior&#xD;
      to surgery. About 10 patients will be allocated randomly into a control group, for each&#xD;
      disease site, for a total of 76 patients enrolled. The research will advance scientific&#xD;
      knowledge by studying the safety of a preoperative dose of ketorolac prior to major surgical&#xD;
      resection, which needs to be assessed prior to proceeding with a larger phase II study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate traditional efficacy endpoints such as recurrence and overall survival.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is a cornerstone of standard-of-care treatment for early-stage non-small&#xD;
      cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Yet despite optimal treatment,&#xD;
      many of these patients will develop cancer recurrence within the first few years. For&#xD;
      example, the 5-year survival rate for patients with stage I/II NSCLC is only around 55%. As a&#xD;
      result, more effective treatments that decrease cancer recurrence and increase survival are&#xD;
      still needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery induces inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis. Although these processes&#xD;
      are important for wound healing in response to tissue injury caused by surgery, they also&#xD;
      support the survival, growth and dissemination of any remaining cancer cells and can lead to&#xD;
      systemic recurrence soon after surgery. Surgical trauma increases the production of&#xD;
      prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which have tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive activities,&#xD;
      and reduces the activity of natural killer cells, which impairs the ability of the immune&#xD;
      system to keep cancer cells in check. However, if given just before tissue injury,&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be able to block the production of&#xD;
      prostaglandins/thromboxanes and boost the activity of natural killer cells, and thereby&#xD;
      decrease the risk of cancer recurrence. NSAIDs such as ketorolac are already routinely given&#xD;
      to cancer patients postoperatively for pain management and are sometimes given&#xD;
      intraoperatively (immediately before or during surgery) to prevent postoperative pain. A&#xD;
      retrospective clinical analysis found that intraoperative intravenous ketorolac or diclofenac&#xD;
      (another NSAID), when added to standard of care for patients with stage I/II NSCLC, was&#xD;
      associated with decreased risks of distant recurrence and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is significant promise in the use of preoperative ketorolac to decrease the&#xD;
      inflammatory response after surgical resection of tumors, thereby potentially reducing the&#xD;
      risk of distant metastatic tumor spread and improving survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened and recruited during the preoperative period by the responsible&#xD;
      medical and surgical team. Blood will be drawn preoperatively and then at the end of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Participants will be randomized to either preoperative ketorolac group or&#xD;
      a concurrent control group who will not receive preincisional ketorolac. The concurrent&#xD;
      control group is to obtain untreated biologic samples for biologic correlative studies and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints. These patients will not be compared to the investigational cohort in&#xD;
      regards to the primary endpoint of safety. Patients will be randomized on the day of surgery&#xD;
      to either the experimental or control arms and participants will be followed or 28 days.&#xD;
      Medical records will be reviewed at 1 and 2 years post-surgery for survival assessment.&#xD;
