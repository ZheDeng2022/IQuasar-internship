  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse is higher in the United Kingdom (UK) Armed Forces (AF) than the general&#xD;
      population. Previous research has shown that interventions delivered via smartphone are&#xD;
      efficacious in promoting self-monitoring of alcohol use, have utility in reducing alcohol&#xD;
      consumption and have a broad reach. The main objective of this participant blinded&#xD;
      (single-blinded) Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) is to assess the efficacy of a 28-day&#xD;
      brief alcohol intervention delivered via a smartphone app (Drinks:Ration) in reducing weekly&#xD;
      self-reported alcohol consumption between baseline and 3-month follow-up among veterans who&#xD;
      drink at a hazardous or harmful level and are receiving, or have received, support for mental&#xD;
      health symptoms in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a two-arm single-blinded Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), a smartphone app&#xD;
      which includes interactive features designed to enhance participant motivation and&#xD;
      personalised messaging is compared to a smartphone app which only provides Government&#xD;
      guidance on alcohol consumption. The trial will be conducted in a veteran population who have&#xD;
      sought help through Combat Stress; a UK veteran's mental health charity. Recruitment, consent&#xD;
      and data collection is performed automatically through the Drinks:Ration platform. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is change in self-reported weekly alcohol consumption between baseline (day&#xD;
      0) and 3-month follow-up (day 84) as measured using the Time-Line Follow back for Alcohol&#xD;
      Consumption; secondary outcome measures include 1) change in baseline to 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      (day 84) Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test score, and 2) change in baseline to 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up (day 84) World Health Organisation Quality of Life-BREF score to assess Quality of&#xD;
      Adjusted Life Years. Process evaluation measures include 1) app usage, and 2) usability&#xD;
      ratings as measured by the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire. The primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will also be re-assessed at 6-month follow-up (day 168) to assess the longer-term&#xD;
      benefits of the intervention and reported as a secondary outcome. The study will begin&#xD;
      recruitment in September 2020 and is expected to require 12 months to complete. Study results&#xD;
      should be published in 2022.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse is common in the United Kingdom (UK) Armed Forces (AF), with the prevalence&#xD;
      rates higher in the AF than the general population. Research indicates that the trend&#xD;
      continues after personnel leave service ('veteran' or 'ex-serving' are used interchangeably&#xD;
      in the UK). It has been estimated that more than 50% of those who have left the AF meet the&#xD;
      criteria for hazardous alcohol use, a score of eight or above on the Alcohol Use Disorders&#xD;
      Identification Test (AUDIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last two decades has seen a proliferation in the use of digital technologies to support&#xD;
      brief intervention management and treatment of alcohol misuse in the general public, yet&#xD;
      little attention has focused forwards the AF community. In the late 1990's interventions were&#xD;
      commonly delivered via a computer using CD-ROM-based programmes, but with the advent of the&#xD;
      World Wide Web many new opportunities arose to harness increase reach, provide real-time&#xD;
      monitoring, and offer personalised treatment. This includes the use of Short Message Service&#xD;
      (SMS) which have been shown to be effective in encouraging people to change their behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) is to assess the efficacy of a 28-day brief&#xD;
      alcohol intervention delivered via a smartphone app (Drinks:Ration) in reducing self-reported&#xD;
      weekly alcohol consumption between baseline and 3 months (day 84) among veterans who drink at&#xD;
      a hazardous or harmful level and are receiving, or have received, support for mental health&#xD;
      symptoms in a clinical setting.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a two-arm participant blinded (single-blinded) RCT, comparing a smartphone app (control arm) which includes feedback on baseline self-reported alcohol consumption, with a smartphone app (intervention arm) that includes individualised normative feedback, plus features designed to enhance participant motivation, app interactive feedback and self-efficacy in modifying their alcohol consumption. In this study, both the control and intervention arms will be delivered via one smartphone app known as Drinks:Ration. Participants in the control arm are given access only to alcohol consumption feedback based on publicly available health guidance and reminder messaging to consult the feedback. Those in the intervention arm are given full access to the app which includes all theoretically driven components and messaging (discussed further in Intervention section). Both arms will be asked to use the app for 28-days.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Care Provider)</masking>
    <masking_description>Randomisation occurs when a quick response (QR) code is generated and a unique proxy identifier and participant gender is assigned. At this point, participants are automatically randomised to receive the control or intervention arm and are blinded. Block randomisation, of size 2, will be used to ensure equal gender distribution across both conditions. The randomisation procedure is done automatically by the Drinks:Ration platform with no human involvement except to provide a proxy identifier and gender.</masking_description>

    <description>Drinks:Ration (www.drinksration.app; formerly called InDEx) app has been developed following the Medical Research Council Complex Intervention Guidelines and using co-design methodology by the King's Centre for Military Health Research (at King's College London) and the University of Liverpool, supported by experts in smartphone app development, epidemiology, addiction psychiatry, and military mental health. The app is designed to support veterans drinking at a hazardous or harmful level by providing detailed advice and support over a minimum of 28-day period. The app is theoretically underpinned to enhance participants motivation and self-efficacy in modifying their alcohol consumption by means of Behaviour Change Theory in the content displayed, and the messaging sent to participants.</description>
