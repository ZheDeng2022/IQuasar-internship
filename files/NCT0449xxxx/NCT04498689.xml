  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is intended to investigate the objective response rate (ORR) and the&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients with histologically- or&#xD;
      cytologically-confirmed metastatic pancreatic cancer after treating with the combination of&#xD;
      camrelizumab, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, and to investigate the overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      and the adverse event (AE) of the patients with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer after treating with the combination of camrelizumab, gemcitabine&#xD;
      and nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;

      This a prospective, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 studye evaluating the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of camrelizumab, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are ORR and PFS, and the secondary are OS and adverse events.&#xD;
