  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Importance: Concussion underreporting leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment, resulting&#xD;
      in prolonged recovery. Athletes' report of concussion symptoms is therefore an important&#xD;
      component of risk reduction. Numerous educational interventions to improve concussion&#xD;
      knowledge and reporting exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluate the comparative efficacy of three concussion education programs in&#xD;
      improving concussion-reporting intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized clinical trial conducted from August 2018 to October 2018, with assessment&#xD;
      before, immediately after, and one-month after educational intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Improvement in concussion reporting intention among athletes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>All primary and secondary outcomes, besides those related to concussion knowledge, were assessed based on athlete responses, on a 10-point Likert type scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 10=strongly agree, to specific questions related to that domain. A composite measure for each outcome was created by summing athletes' responses and dividing by the number of questions asked, resulting in outcomes scaled from 1 to 10.&#xD;
A composite measure created based on the inverse of athlete responses to five questions about their concussion-reporting intention (i.e., whether they would continue playing with a concussion during &quot;the beginning of the season,&quot; &quot;a practice,&quot; &quot;the middle of the season,&quot; &quot;during a championship game,&quot; and &quot;at the end of the season&quot;).</description>

    <description>Athletes answered 23 True/False questions to assess their concussion knowledge modified from previously utilized concussion educational assessments (Rosenbaum et al., 2010). A composite measure of athlete concussion knowledge was created by summing athletes' correct responses and dividing by the number of questions asked.&#xD;

    <description>All primary and secondary outcomes, besides those related to concussion knowledge, were assessed based on athlete responses, on a 10-point Likert type scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 10=strongly agree, to specific questions related to that domain. A composite measure for each outcome was created by summing athletes' responses and dividing by the number of questions asked, resulting in outcomes scaled from 1 to 10.&#xD;
A composite measure created based on athlete responses to six questions about their attitudes towards concussion reporting (i.e., the extent to which an athlete who reports a concussion would be &quot;better off in the long run,&quot; &quot;back on the field much faster,&quot; &quot;proud even if teammates call me weak,&quot; &quot;better off avoiding participation with signs and symptoms of a concussion,&quot; not &quot;better off hiding symptoms from a doctor to not stay out as long,&quot; and not &quot;better off toughing it out because concussions are just another injury&quot;).</description>

    <description>All primary and secondary outcomes, besides those related to concussion knowledge, were assessed based on athlete responses, on a 10-point Likert type scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 10=strongly agree, to specific questions related to that domain. A composite measure for each outcome was created by summing athletes' responses and dividing by the number of questions asked, resulting in outcomes scaled from 1 to 10.&#xD;
A composite measure created based on athlete responses to two questions assessing perceived reporting norms (i.e., the extent to which the athlete worried &quot;my teammates would think less of me&quot; if he reported a concussion, or needed to &quot;hide my symptoms from my coach&quot;).</description>

    <description>All primary and secondary outcomes, besides those related to concussion knowledge, were assessed based on athlete responses, on a 10-point Likert type scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 10=strongly agree, to specific questions related to that domain. A composite measure for each outcome was created by summing athletes' responses and dividing by the number of questions asked, resulting in outcomes scaled from 1 to 10.&#xD;
A composite measure created based on athlete responses to six questions about their perceived ability and confidence with concussion reporting (i.e., confidence in my ability &quot;to report a concussion,&quot; &quot;to help my teammate report a concussion,&quot; &quot;to report symptoms of a concussion,&quot; &quot;to help my teammate report symptoms of a concussion,&quot; &quot;to report symptoms of a concussion, even if I don't think they're that bad,&quot; and &quot;to help my teammate report symptoms of a concussion, even if I don't think they're that bad&quot;).</description>
