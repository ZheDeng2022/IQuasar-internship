        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed and dated written Informed Consent Form (ICF) in accordance with ICH-GCP and&#xD;
             local legislation prior to admission to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients ≥18 years of age or over the legal age of consent in countries where that is&#xD;
             greater than 18 years at the time of signature of the ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented surgically unresectable&#xD;
             locally-advanced or metastatic Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with loco-regional anal cancer as initial diagnosis must have unresectable&#xD;
             progressive locally advanced or metastatic SCCA after failure of at least one line&#xD;
             (but not more than two lines) of previous systemic treatment unless ineligible for or&#xD;
             intolerant to this systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with metastatic anal cancer as initial diagnosis (no prior treatment for&#xD;
             loco-regional cancer) must have failed one line of previous systemic treatment&#xD;
             (chemotherapy ± radiotherapy) for the metastatic anal cancer unless ineligible for or&#xD;
             intolerant to this systemic treatment. (Patients with metastatic anal cancer as&#xD;
             initial diagnosis who have received two or more lines of systemic treatment for the&#xD;
             metastatic anal cancer are not eligible for the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All patients must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 0 to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. All patients must be willing to undergo blood testing for human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) presence in the blood if not tested within the past 6 months prior to signature&#xD;
             of ICF for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For patients confirmed as HIV positive, all of the following (a-d) applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. CD4+ count ≥ 250 cells/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Undetectable viral load (local lab assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Must be currently receiving Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. A HIV/Infectious Diseases specialist must be consulted or patient must be under&#xD;
                  the care of the HIV/Infectious Diseases specialist&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must be willing to allow programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status&#xD;
             assessment by one of following options.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Preference is given to fresh tumour biopsy sample collection at baseline before&#xD;
             receiving first trial medication. In case a fresh tumour biopsy cannot be obtained&#xD;
             (e.g. inaccessible lesions or patient safety concern), archival tissue will be&#xD;
             requested. If neither is available any previous historical information regarding PD-L1&#xD;
             status should be collected via eCRF. Exceptions may be considered after consultation&#xD;
             with and approval by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male or female patients. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to&#xD;
             father a child must be ready and able to use highly effective methods of birth control&#xD;
             per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used&#xD;
             consistently and correctly, for the entire duration of the trial treatment intake and&#xD;
             for 6 months after the end of the trial treatment. A list of contraception methods&#xD;
             meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current or prior treatment with any systemic anti-cancer therapy or any&#xD;
             investigational product (or device) either within 28 days or less than 5 half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is shorter) before start of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Major injuries and/or surgery or bone fracture within 4 weeks of start of treatment,&#xD;
             or planned surgical procedures during the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Significant cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
             unstable angina, history of infarction within past 6 months, congestive heart failure&#xD;
             &gt; New York Heart Association (NYHA) II).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as: blood pressure in rested and relaxed&#xD;
             condition ≥ 140 mmHg, systolic or ≥ 90 mmHg diastolic (with or without medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known inherited predisposition to bleeding or to thrombosis in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of severe hemorrhagic or thromboembolic event in the past 12 months (excluding&#xD;
             central venous catheter thrombosis and peripheral deep vein thrombosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who require full-dose anticoagulation (according to local guidelines). No&#xD;
             Vitamin K antagonist and other anticoagulation allowed; Low-Molecular-Weight-Heparin&#xD;
             (LMWH) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) allowed only for prevention not for curative&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti CTLA-4 treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior treatment with any antiangiogenic agent (e.g. bevacizumab, cediranib,&#xD;
             aflibercept, vandetanib, XL-184, sunitinib, etc.) Further exclusion criteria apply.&#xD;
