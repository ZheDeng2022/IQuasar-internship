  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation has emerged as an important treatment option for patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF). Pulmonary vein antral isolation (PVI) is now considered as the&#xD;
      cornerstone technique of AF ablation and has shown promise in treating paroxysmal atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (PAF). However, there is no unique strategy for ablation of persistent AF (PeAF)&#xD;
      , whether PVI alone is sufficient to prevent patients from recurrence remain controversial.&#xD;
      The PROMPT-AF study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial involving blinded&#xD;
      assessment of outcomes, which is designed to compare arrhythmia-free survival between PVI and&#xD;
      an ablation strategy termed upgraded '2C3L' for ablation of PeAF.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PROMPT-AF study will include 288 patients undergoing their first catheter ablation of&#xD;
      PeAF. All patients will be randomized to either the upgraded '2C3L' arm or PVI arm in a 1:1&#xD;
      fashion. The upgraded '2C3L' technique is a fixed ablation approach consisting of EI-VOM,&#xD;
      bilateral circumferential PVI and three linear ablation lesion sets across the mitral&#xD;
      isthmus, left atrial roof, and cavo-tricuspid isthmus. The follow-up duration is 12 months.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is freedom from any documented atrial tachycardia arrhythmias of &gt; 30&#xD;
      seconds from 3 to 12 months after a single ablation procedure (including a blanking period of&#xD;
      3 months) off antiarrhythmic drugs.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to the upgraded '2C3L' arm will first undergo ethanol infusion in the vein of Marshall (EI-VOM) followed by the '2C3L' ablation step which includes bilateral circumferential PV antral ablation and linear ablations across the left atrial roof, mitral isthmus (MI), and cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI).</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to PVI arm will undergo right PV antrum ablation, followed by the left PVA ablation.

    <description>EI-VOM: 2 to 4 mL of 95% ethanol will be slowly injected over 1 minute into the distal VOM, After 5 minutes, another injection will be performed for the middle and then proximal part of the VOM. In total, 6 to 12 mL of ethanol will be used as the maximum dose. '2C3L' ablation procedure: The roof and posterior segments will be ablated first when performing left PVI, and RF will not be applied for the anterior part of the left PV unless necessary. MI ablation will commence at about 1 cm from the junction of the VOM and coronary veins near the annulus side and extend along the isthmus to the low-voltage area. Ablation will also be performed in the distal CS, the corresponding epicardial site. Next, CTI ablation will be performed starting from the tricuspid valve annulus and proceeding to the inferior cava veins. The procedural endpoint will be isolation of the bilateral PVA and complete conduction block across the three ablation lines.</description>

    <description>The right PV antrum (PVA) will be ablated first, followed by the left PVA. RF should be applied 1 cm proximal to the PV ostia in a wide-area circumferential pattern. Complete PVI will be achieved when all PV potentials within each antrum recorded by the high-density mapping catheter are abolished. If AF or other sustained atrial tachyarrhythmias persist after complete PVI, ablation of the CTI will be left to the operator's judgement. Direct current cardioversion will then be performed to restore sinus rhythm. The endpoint of the circumferential PVA ablation procedure will be achievement of complete entrance and exit block of all PVAs as recorded by the high-density mapping catheter during sinus rhythm or CS pacing and complete linear block if performed.</description>
