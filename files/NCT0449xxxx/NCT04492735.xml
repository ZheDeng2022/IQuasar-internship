  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of indocyanine green will augment the accuracy of identification and resection of both&#xD;
      primary solid malignancies as well as their pulmonary metastases, where applicable We will&#xD;
      conduct a prospective feasibility study of pediatric patients with solid malignancies with or&#xD;
      without lung metastatases who present at the time of initial diagnosis or relapse. These&#xD;
      patients will receive a targeted dye to aid in the resection of these metastases. We plan to&#xD;
      assess ICG as it relates to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnostic accuracy using pathologic correlation as gold standard measure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Short and long term event free and overall survival&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with solid malignancies or metastatic lesions who require clinically&#xD;
      indicated resection will be identified by their Oncologist. The oncologist will inform the&#xD;
      subject/family about the study and ask if they may be interested in participating. If the&#xD;
      subject/family demonstrates potential interest in the study, the Pediatric Surgery Research&#xD;
      team will discuss the risks and benefits of pre-operative ICG administration with the&#xD;
      patients and enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects: All patients diagnosed with solid malignancies as well as those with&#xD;
      metastatic disease distant from the primary tumor will be potentially eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Diagnosis will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In a multimodal fashion including physical exam, radiologic evaluation (ultrasound, MRI,&#xD;
           CT scan, etc), and sometimes biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior to definitive surgical resection of the newly diagnosed malignancy&#xD;
