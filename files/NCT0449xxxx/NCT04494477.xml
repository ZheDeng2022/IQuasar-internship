    <textblock>
      The INclued program was implemented in 16 states across the US. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to measure: Nine months after the end of the program and one year after the workshop, are&#xD;
      IN•clued participants less likely to report engaging in risky sexual behavior in the past&#xD;
      three months compared to control group participants?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IN•clued program for youth consists of a three-hour in-person workshop for youth which&#xD;
      includes lessons about safe sex practices and self-efficacy at healthcare centers, exam room&#xD;
      roleplays, and a discussion on patient rights. Youth receive a Zine, or a magazine-style&#xD;
      booklet, that they may take home. They also receive a list of local healthcare providers that&#xD;
      highlights those that have participated in the IN•clued healthcare provider workshop or have&#xD;
      had training on working with the LGBTQ population. Program youth can also receive text&#xD;
      messages with health tips and reminders to visit a healthcare center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workshops take place with LGBTQ youth groups through schools, community-based organizations,&#xD;
      or conferences. Each segment is led by adult facilitators or trained peer educators with&#xD;
      adult facilitator support. These peer educators are from the Planned Parenthood Teen Council&#xD;
      peer education program. Teen Council is a unique peer education program created in 1989 by&#xD;
      PPGNHI. It is a strong and successful peer education program that trains high school youth to&#xD;
      become experts in delivering inclusive, comprehensive sexual health education to their peers&#xD;
      via group and community presentations. If trained peer educators are used, they implement the&#xD;
      intervention with the guidance and oversight of an adult facilitator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control condition receive a benign intervention, which like IN•clued,&#xD;
      meets in a group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a site or group is defined, facilitators send implementation forms to Philliber. The&#xD;
      evaluation team reviews the information and asks any needed questions which vary by group or&#xD;
      site. The two groups cannot differ in any significant way (e.g., gender, SES, ethnicity, or&#xD;
      special characteristic such as pregnant and parenting participants). All decisions about&#xD;
      final eligibility are made by the research team. If two groups or sites are similar, they are&#xD;
      approved. If they differ in a significant way, they are not eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignment of the groups does not technically occur until the baseline administration&#xD;
      of the survey is completed as participants can be both added and subtracted from the group&#xD;
      list until the time of survey administration. One facilitator at each location is informed of&#xD;
      the outcome of random assignment before or during the administration of the baseline survey.&#xD;
      This is done so random assignment can occur immediately after surveys are conducted as this&#xD;
      is a one-time workshop and participants do not give assent to participate until this time.&#xD;

    <description>The youth control group receives a 10-minute presentation and a list of local sexual healthcare providers, with no indication of which providers have been trained to be more LGBTQ friendly and accepting. This 10-minute presentation is a part of a longer three-hour activity unrelated to sexual health or accessing sexual healthcare. During the three-hour session, the list of approved activities includes but is not limited to:&#xD;
Films by, and for, LGBTQ youth about sexual orientation and gender identity;&#xD;
Community scavenger hunts;&#xD;
Poetry slams;&#xD;
Discussions about relationships; and&#xD;
Activities related to the appreciation of individuals' unique strengths.</description>
