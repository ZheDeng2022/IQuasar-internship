  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a condition that affects women, usually during their reproductive years. In&#xD;
      women with endometriosis, the tissue that lines the uterus starts to grow outside of the&#xD;
      uterus. This can cause pain during their periods or during sex, and constant pain in the&#xD;
      pelvis. Endometriosis can decrease a woman's quality of life and requires long-term treatment&#xD;
      to control the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some women with endometriosis, symptoms can return after they stop treatment. Or, they&#xD;
      may not be able to tolerate the current long-term treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will find out more about the safety of long-term treatment with&#xD;
      dienogest in a large number of Chinese participants. This study will enroll patients from&#xD;
      post-menarche to menopause with clinically or surgically diagnosed endometriosis. All of the&#xD;
      participants will take dienogest based on their doctor's instructions. They will then visit&#xD;
      their doctor's office 3 times over 6 months. During these visits, their doctors will ask them&#xD;
      if they have any health problems and about their quality of life. Their doctors will also do&#xD;
      tests to measure the pain caused by their endometriosis and any other symptoms.&#xD;
