&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Follow up period: APL-1202 is administered at every 3-month interval if no events&#xD;
           occurred in the treatment period and until the occurrence of events or the end of the&#xD;
           entire clinical trial Intravesical Epirubicin hydrochloride will be administered once&#xD;
