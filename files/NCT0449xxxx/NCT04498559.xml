  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine what patients currently know about opioids, including&#xD;
      their role in pain management, side effects, risks of abuse, and proper storage and disposal.&#xD;
      It is critical for patients to be properly informed about opioid usage in treating&#xD;
      postoperative pain, but current gaps in patient knowledge are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help identify knowledge deficiencies and guide future patient education.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will examine possible patient factors that may be associated with&#xD;
      these gaps. Evaluation of patient knowledge will be assessed through interviews conducted&#xD;
      before patients' day of surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Patient's answers to opioid-related questions will be summarized using grounded theory, and a comparative analytic strategy to categories. A PI-provided scoring manual will also be used to quantify the accuracy and level of patients' knowledge about opioids. Reference: Berkwits M, Inui TS. Making use of qualitative research techniques.
