  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurological disability caused by traumatic lesions of the spinal cord is a significant&#xD;
      challenge for medicine and society. These lesions, leading to sublesional central nervous&#xD;
      system dysfunction, include sensorimotor, vesico-sphincter and genito-sexual disorders. To&#xD;
      date, there is no treatment that enables spinal cord function to be restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have been able to demonstrate the recovery of locomotor activity with a&#xD;
      combination of locomotor training, pharmacological intervention and epidural electrical&#xD;
      stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord (EESS) in adult rats with spinal cord transection.&#xD;
      An American team have recently been able to show that EESS, combined with locomotor training,&#xD;
      caused neurological improvement in four paraplegic patients, with electromyographic muscular&#xD;
      activation patterns similar to those observed during walking. In fact, these authors also&#xD;
      showed an improvement, under stimulation, of the VS and GS functions, but with no detailed&#xD;
      documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting with a conceptual and preclinical rationale, and with proof of clinical concept&#xD;
      demonstrated in several reported cases, we propose a clinical trial with an original&#xD;
      cross-over design to validate the hypothesis that EESS combined with training in patients&#xD;
      with incomplete spinal cord injuries would, with a good tolerance profile, allow motor,&#xD;
      vesico-sphincter (VS) and genito-sexual (GS) disorders to be restored in patients with&#xD;
      incomplete spinal cord injuries.&#xD;
