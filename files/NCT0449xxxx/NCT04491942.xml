  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial identifies the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of BAY&#xD;
      1895344 in combination with chemotherapy in treating patients with solid tumors or urothelial&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced). BAY 1895344 may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cisplatin and&#xD;
      gemcitabine are chemotherapy drugs that stop the growth of tumor cells by killing the cells.&#xD;
      Combining BAY 1895344 with chemotherapy treatment (cisplatin, or cisplatin and gemcitabine)&#xD;
      may be effective for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, including urothelial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of cisplatin + ATR kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor BAY1895344 (BAY 1895344) in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of cisplatin + gemcitabine +&#xD;
      BAY 1895344 in patients with advanced solid tumors with an emphasis on urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      (UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      cisplatin + BAY 1895344 and cisplatin + gemcitabine + BAY 1895344.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of BAY 1895344 (in the doublet and triplet&#xD;
      combinations) and gemcitabine (in the triplet) in combination with cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To further evaluate the toxicity of the combination of cisplatin + gemcitabine + BAY&#xD;
      1895344 in patients with UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate preliminary efficacy observed with cisplatin + BAY 1895344 and cisplatin +&#xD;
      gemcitabine + BAY 1895344 in patients with advanced solid tumors, including UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To monitor for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the association between ATM expression by immunohistochemical staining and&#xD;
      responses to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the correlation of biomarkers, including deleterious deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) damage response (DDR) gene alterations and circulating tumor (ct)DNA, with responses to&#xD;
      therapy using whole exome sequencing (WES) and messenger ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA&#xD;
      seq) analysis of archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, as well as blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate drug exposure with response and/or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BAY 1895344. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (DOUBLET COMBINATION): Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on&#xD;
      day 1, and BAY 1895344 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 2 and 9. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (TRIPLET COMBINATION): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on day 1,&#xD;
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and BAY 1895344 PO BID on days 2 and 9.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that&#xD;
             immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during&#xD;
             the first cycle of therapy; patients with stable brain metastases that are&#xD;
             asymptomatic and on a stable dose of steroids are also considered eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of BAY 1895344, cisplatin, and gemcitabine on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown. For this reason and because deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damage response&#xD;
             inhibitors agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to&#xD;
             be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation and for 6 months after completion of&#xD;
             BAY 1895344 administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 6 months after completion of BAY 1895344 administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &lt; 6 weeks by investigator assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior malignancy requiring intervention in the past 3 years, except for&#xD;
             cutaneous malignancies that require resection, such as squamous cell carcinoma, basal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma, or cutaneous melanomas&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant peripheral neuropathy (&lt; grade 2 by Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
             Adverse Events [CTCAE])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensorineural hearing loss (&lt; Grade 2 by CTCAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must NOT have had prior treatment with ATR inhibitor (prior BAY1895344 or other&#xD;
             investigational ATR inhibitors), or current treatment with any other investigational&#xD;
             agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study. Patients who have targeted&#xD;
             therapies (such as PARP inhibitors) within 2 weeks prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to BAY 1895344 or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications that are substrates of CYP3A4 with a narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic window, or strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible, if they&#xD;
             cannot be transferred to alternative medication. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical&#xD;
             reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because BAY 1895344 as a DNA-damage&#xD;
             response inhibitor, cisplatin, and gemcitabine may have the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BAY 1895344&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with BAY 1895344 and for&#xD;
             4 months after end of treatment. These potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study&#xD;
