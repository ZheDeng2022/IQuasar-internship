      This will be a 6-month, widely inclusive, virtual, single-center, open-label pilot trial&#xD;
      utilizing a historical control group. Following informed consent and screening, participants&#xD;
      with ALS will take Theracurmin 1 capsule (90mg) twice daily for 6-months. Treatment with the&#xD;
      Theracurmin and all study outcome measures and labs are being performed exclusively for&#xD;
      research purposes. Collected data includes saliva and stool microbiome sampling, adverse&#xD;
      events, concomitant medications, weight and height, Theracurmin treatment evaluations, and&#xD;
      Thrive Questionnaires. Participants will be asked to register on the website Patientslikeme.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ALSFRS-R score</measure>
    <time_frame>Starting at week 4 and then once every 30 days for 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised) will be determined at all video/telephone visits. ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (five minute) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0-4) used to determine patients' assessments of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. All 12 activities are relevant in ALS. Change in ALSFRS-R scores correlate with change in strength over time, and it is closely associated with quality of life measures and predicted survival. Each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability. Individual item scores are summed to produce a reported score of between 0=worst and 48=best.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ALS Reversals</measure>
    <time_frame>month 6</time_frame>
    <description>To look for an increase in the frequency of ALS reversals, we will count the number of participants who have an ALSFRS-R score that improves by 4 points or more over 6 months. The observed frequency of spontaneous ALS reversals defined in this way is 2-5% (30). We will look for an increase in this frequency to at least 10% (1 in 10).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Saliva Microbiome Sequencing change</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, week 4 and month 6 visits</time_frame>
    <description>The microbiome of study participants will be analyzed in saliva samples at enrollment, week 4 and month 6 visits. We will compare the changes in the saliva microbiome over time in patients with ALS on Theracurmin to the changes observed in untreated healthy controls.Data will be compared within subjects with ALS to assess possible changes over the length of the study and identify microbial correlates of disease progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of adverse events as measured by patient reporting</measure>
    <time_frame>Study duration, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse and serious adverse events will be recorded throughout the study. The PI will determine whether these are related to treatment. Patients will also measure and record their side effects at Month 0-6 Internet Visits on their PLM profile.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Enrollment Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>Enrollment rate will be calculated as the number of participants enrolled per month.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Retention will be assessed by looking at the dropout rate at 6 months (the percentage of surviving enrolled patients who complete the Month 6 Visit).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stool Microbiome Sequencing change</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, week 4 and month 6 visits</time_frame>
    <description>The microbiome of study participants will be analyzed in stool samples at enrollment, week 4 and month 6 visits. Changes will be compared in the stool microbiome over time in patients with ALS on Theracurmin to the changes observed in untreated healthy controls. Metagenomic analysis of deidentified selected fecal sample will be done on patients that positively respond to Theracurmin to achieve strain level identification of microbes positively and negatively associated with improved outcomes. The selected anaerobes that have been linked to ALS severity will be cultured for further genetic sand phenotypic characterization.</description>

    <description>The intervention is twice daily dosage of Theracurmin 90 mg capsules. This same dose was used in a successful trial of patients with mild cognitive impairment. Theracurmin HP capsules containing 90 mg curcumin each that will be taken as one capsule twice daily for 6 months. Each capsule contains 300 mg Theracurmin enhanced bioavailable water-dispersible turmeric rhizome complex providing 30% curcumin (90 mg). The content of Theracurmin HP has been independently certified by NSF International under NSF/ANSI 173.</description>

    <description>We will seek to enroll 50 healthy control participants. We will attempt to enroll one control subject from each enrolled primary participant's home, preferably a spouse or partner of similar age if possible. We plan to use this data to compare the microbiome of control participants to that of the ALS participants at baseline, week 4 and month 6. We will not conduct further follow-up or collect additional samples with the control subjects.</description>
