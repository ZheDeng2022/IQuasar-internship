      The ADAPT system is a software that calculate a virtual 3D reconstruction of the femoral head&#xD;
      without additional radiation. It automatically detects the used implant and its position&#xD;
      relative to the femoral head, helping the surgeon to achieve an optimal proximal screw&#xD;
      positioning in the femoral head. The investigators want to verify if with the addition of the&#xD;
      ADAPT system the investigators can improve screw placement and reduce surgery time and&#xD;
      radiation exposure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial comparing intramedullary nailing of&#xD;
      proximal fracture of the femur (AO classified as 31 A1.3 , 31 A2.1, 31 A2.2 31 A2.3, 31 A3.1,&#xD;
      31 A3.2, 31 A3.3) performed with the ADAPT system (arm-A) and those performed without&#xD;
      (arm-B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADAPT system has been developed with the aim to reduce the rate of complications in&#xD;
      intramedullary nailing and its usefulness has been previously explored only in two&#xD;
      underpowered randomized controlled trials. Thanks to the possibility to track screw placement&#xD;
      in real-time, allowing improved screw placement, the ADAPT system could be a valid tool, in&#xD;
      order to minimize radiation exposure, surgical time, and rate of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients undergoing intramedullary nailing at the Ospedale Regionale di Lugano&#xD;
      satisfying the eligibility criteria reported at section 7.1 will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      randomly allocated (allocation ratio 1:1) to receive preoperatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intramedullary nailing with ADAPT system (arm-A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intramedullary nailing without ADAPT system (arm-B) Patients and physicians evaluating&#xD;
           the results will be blinded to the assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of patients enrolled will be 96 (48 arm-A, 48 arm-B). After surgery, data&#xD;
      about duration of the procedure, intraoperative blood loss, satisfaction of the surgeon and&#xD;
      radiation exposure time will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fracture healing, and rate of complications (cut-through and cut out) will be evaluated&#xD;
      during all the follow-up visits, alongside VAS and a functional evaluation of the injured hip&#xD;
      through the Oxford Hip score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment related adverse events will be reported up to follow-up visit 4, i.e. up to 12&#xD;
      ± 1 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will be involved in the trial for 1 year. The expected time to complete the&#xD;
      trial is 4 years: 3 years for patient enrolment and 1 year to complete the last follow-up&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is the TAD (tip to apex) index at the post-operative X-Ray control prior discharge.&#xD;
The TAD is the tip-apex distance, which is the sum of the distance from the tip of the lag screw to the apex of the femoral head on an anteroposterior radiograph and this distance on a lateral radiograph, after controlling for magnification. The percentage of cut-outs has been correlated directly to both the severity of proximal femoral fractures and the TAD.</description>
