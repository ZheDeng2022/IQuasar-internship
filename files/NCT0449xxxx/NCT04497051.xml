    <textblock>
      Vertebra is one of the most common site of metastatic disease, which may cause severe pain or&#xD;
      neurological deficit. Decompressive surgery or radiation therapy are of limited efficacy and&#xD;
      recurrence is very likely. Debulking surgery usually has better local control and survival&#xD;
      benefit. However, debulking surgery often accompany with massive blood loss, which may cause&#xD;
      hemorrhagic shock or death. It is known that intraoperative blood loss is associated with&#xD;
      tumoral vascularity. However, there is current no objective method to evaluate vascularity&#xD;
      status. On the other hand, preoperative embolization is considered as major method to&#xD;
      decrease blood loss. There is also objective method to evaluate the embolization effect. By&#xD;
      our innovative dual energy computed tomography angiography - digital subtraction angiography&#xD;
      (CT-DSA), the tumoral vascularity status and embolization effect of spinal tumor can be&#xD;
      objectively assessed. We aim to utilize CT-DSA to investigate spinal tumor, in a hope to find&#xD;
      out correlation of vascularity status, embolization method, and surgical outcome, which can&#xD;
      help individual disease status and tailored treatment decision.&#xD;

      Vertebral osseus metastasis, can cause neoplastic spinal cord compression and neurological&#xD;
      deficit. The treatment strategy depend on the pathological type, performance status, and life&#xD;
      expectancy. The goal of treatment is to avoid neurological deterioration, to keep functional&#xD;
      life, and to control bone pain. Treatment strategy involve multidisciplinary approaches&#xD;
      between spinal surgeon, medical and radiation oncologist, and radiologist. When presence of&#xD;
      acute neurological deterioration or intractable pain due to neoplastic compression or&#xD;
      vertebral instability, surgical approach is often warranted. In term of surgical approach,&#xD;
      simple decompression and fixation is often applied, but the long-term control rate is&#xD;
      suboptimal. Aggressive spinal surgery, including extensive debulking surgery or&#xD;
      spondylectomy, has relative longstanding effect to maintain neurological and oncological&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite relative good outcome of aggressive spinal surgery, it is a relative massive&#xD;
      procedure in which life-threatening blood loss commonly occur. To achieve better surgical&#xD;
      outcome and decrease complication, preoperative embolization is suggested to control blood&#xD;
      loss . The procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist to deliver embolic agent&#xD;
      into vascular pedicles of target vertebra, in hope to achieve optimal devascularization of&#xD;
      the tumour. The concept is simple and the similar procedure has been performed thousands of&#xD;
      times in the world. However, its efficacy and utilization are not yet proven by clinical&#xD;
      trials. When and how to perform this procedure largely depends on experience of operating&#xD;
      interventional radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT is an important imaging tool for spinal disease. Because of its rapid acquisition,&#xD;
      adequate resolution, and easy reformatting, it is optimal for intolerable patients.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, osseous structure is extremely radiopaque, evaluation of tumoral enhancement in&#xD;
      vertebrae is not easy. Nevertheless, the enhancement of osseous tumour can be evaluated with&#xD;
      advanced subtraction reformatting technique. The technique is similar to digital subtraction&#xD;
      angiography (DSA) of catheter angiography, and we call it CT-DSA image. As compared with&#xD;
      traditional catheter-based DSA, CT-DSA has following additional advantages: 1)&#xD;
      non-invasiveness; 2) non-selective enhancement of the target; 3) allowing multiplanar&#xD;
      reformatting and additional post-processing and quantification. The tool is very versatile to&#xD;
      investigate the vascularity of the vertebral neoplasm. In our earlier result, we found the&#xD;
      CT-DSA has good correlation with DSA in vascularity assessment, suggestive of its utilization&#xD;
      in pre-operative and pre-embolization evaluation of spinal tumour. It can be used in&#xD;
      semi-quntitative and quantitative fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the efficacy of embolization is determined by surgical outcome, usually with&#xD;
      gold standard of blood loss. However, blood loss is determined by many different factors,&#xD;
      including tumor volume, surgical technique, and other anatomical factors. Using CT-DSA,&#xD;
      evaluation of the embolization effect directly is possible. As the study can be repeated&#xD;
      after embolization, the interval change can be observed with objective measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, using CT-DSA, it is possible to evaluate the vascularity of the osseous tumour&#xD;
      and efficacy of devascularization after embolization before surgery. We can therefore design&#xD;
      study to test efficacy of different intervention strategy, and find out the more beneficial&#xD;
      indication, which can incorporate into clinical workflow and help patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The establish subjective risk classification of debulking surgery in term of tumour&#xD;
           vascularity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To subjectively evaluate efficacy of preoperative embolization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To design appropriate clinical workflow in management of patient with vertebral&#xD;
           malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance Vertebrae is 3rd most common site of metastatic malignancy, and is usually warrant&#xD;
      aggressive spinal surgery. Since preoperative embolization is commonly done in this patient,&#xD;
      it needs subjective tool to assess its efficacy and clear indication. By using CT-DSA, there&#xD;
      is potential to provide tailored strategy of patient management before surgery.&#xD;
