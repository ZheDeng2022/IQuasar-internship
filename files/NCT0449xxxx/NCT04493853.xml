    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of capivasertib plus abiraterone&#xD;
      (+prednisone/prednisolone) plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus placebo plus&#xD;
      abiraterone (+prednisone/prednisolone) plus ADT in participants with mHSPC whose tumours are&#xD;
      characterised by PTEN deficiency. The intention of the study is to demonstrate that in&#xD;
      participants with mHSPC, the combination of capivasertib plus abiraterone&#xD;
      (+prednisone/prednisolone) plus ADT is superior to placebo plus abiraterone&#xD;
      (+prednisone/prednisolone) plus ADT in participants with mHSPC characterised by PTEN&#xD;
      deficiency with respect to radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per 1) Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for soft tissue and/or Prostate Cancer&#xD;
