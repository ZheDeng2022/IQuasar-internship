  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large study that would assess the safety of&#xD;
      carbohydrate drinks (i.e. juice) prior to elective colorectal surgery in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, prior to surgeries involving general anesthetic, patients have been told not&#xD;
      to eat or drink anything after midnight due to the risk of aspiration. More recent research&#xD;
      have shown that it is safe to have clear fluids up to 2 hours before an operation and this is&#xD;
      reflected in the current anesthesia clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is currently not known if it is safe for patients with type 2 diabetes to have a sugar&#xD;
      drink before their surgery since they have trouble processing sugars and a subset of patients&#xD;
      with diabetes are at increased risk to aspiration due to delayed gastric emptying.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fasting prior to the administration of a general anesthetic has been the standard of&#xD;
      peri-operative care for many years. The refrain of &quot;nothing to eat or drink after midnight&quot;&#xD;
      has become synonymous with surgery for both clinicians and the general public. The rationale&#xD;
      behind this practice has been to reduce the risk of regurgitation of gastric contents. In&#xD;
      addition, this instruction is straightforward for patients and ancillary staff, and allows&#xD;
      for easy alteration of the order of cases on the operative list. Despite the widespread&#xD;
      nature of this practice, a 2003 Cochrane review attempted to define the optimum duration of&#xD;
      fasting, type of fasting, and volume of intake permitted and concluded that there was no&#xD;
      evidence to suggest a shortened fluid fast resulted in an increased risk of aspiration,&#xD;
      regurgitation, or morbidity in healthy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative fasting leads to insulin resistance and metabolic stresses. More recently it&#xD;
      has been suggested that a preoperative carbohydrate loading may alleviate some deleterious&#xD;
      effects of this fast. This strategy, combined with a number of others, have been recently&#xD;
      introduced in many Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs, that have led to improved&#xD;
      postoperative pain, faster restoration of GI function, decreased LOS and decreased&#xD;
      complication rate after colon surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes is a disease of impaired glucose tolerance. It is a common condition that&#xD;
      affects over 15% of general surgical patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. It is well&#xD;
      recognized that this is a high-risk surgical population that is at increased risk of&#xD;
      perioperative complications such as anastomotic dehiscence, poor wound healing, and&#xD;
      postoperative ileus which can lead to an increased LOS after surgery. However, there is a&#xD;
      relative dearth of robust evidence regarding preoperative fasting in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes so there is no consensus among professional association guidelines internationally&#xD;
      on recommendations for carbohydrate loading in this population undergoing elective surgery.&#xD;
      Two major concerns have been raised; first the risk of aspiration in diabetic patients with a&#xD;
      significant neuropathy and gastroparesis, and second potential for hyperglycemia and its&#xD;
      deleterious effects.&#xD;
