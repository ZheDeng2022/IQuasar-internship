  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study about improving our diagnostic method for small intestinal bacterial&#xD;
      overgrowth (SIBO). Patients undergoing Standard of Care (SOC) Endoscopically assisted glucose&#xD;
      breath test (EAGBT) will undergo upper endoscopy and glucose breath tests. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators wish to utilize Nuclear Medicine techniques to locate where the glucose&#xD;
      solution that is administered during EAGBT is being consumed by bacteria is in the small&#xD;
      bowel when it detects SIBO.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by bloating, gas, distention,&#xD;
      and diarrhea due to colonization and an excessive amount of bacteria in the small bowel.&#xD;
      Distal SIBO is the presence of excessive amounts of bacteria in the distal jejunum and/or&#xD;
      ileum. Diagnosis of SIBO requires either duodenal aspirate with culture analysis or more&#xD;
      commonly with breath hydrogen/methane testing. Hydrogen breath testing often uses either oral&#xD;
      glucose or lactulose solutions. If bacteria are present in the small bowel they will ferment&#xD;
      glucose or lactulose, producing hydrogen or methane as a byproduct. These gases are absorbed&#xD;
      into the bowel, and then eliminated via pulmonary expiration. By detecting a rise in breath&#xD;
      H2 and CH4 values compared to baseline, SIBO can be diagnosed. However, after oral ingestion,&#xD;
      the majority of the glucose substrate is absorbed in the duodenum and proximal jejunum.&#xD;
      Therefore, Glucose breath test (GBT) is good for the detection of proximal SIBO, but misses&#xD;
      distal SIBO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have recently shown that glucose administration into the distal duodenum&#xD;
      through upper endoscopy has a higher positive yield for SIBO in patients with negative oral&#xD;
      GBT. However, it is unclear if the rise in breath H2 or CH4 is because of glucose&#xD;
      fermentation by bacteria in the distal small bowel or from fermentation by bacteria in the&#xD;
      colon, i.e. false-positive test. Study objective here is to administer a radio-labeled&#xD;
      glucose solution into the duodenum via an endoscopically placed nasoduodenal tube, and then&#xD;
      determine if the rise in breath hydrogen and/or methane correlates with the location of the&#xD;
      isotopic glucose solution in the bowel by simultaneous nuclear imaging. Results of breath&#xD;
      testing will also be compared with duodenal aspirate/cultures taken at the time of endoscopy.&#xD;
      Clinical response to treatment will be assessed on follow up.&#xD;
