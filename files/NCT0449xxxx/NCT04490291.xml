  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective observational study with the primary objective of quantifying a change&#xD;
      in pain scores after 6-12 months of two separate interventions within the study site (pain&#xD;
      team and chiropractic team). Target enrollment was 30 participants for each intervention. The&#xD;
      primary outcome was a change from baseline of the Pain Disability Questionnaire (PDQ), the&#xD;
      study tool. Secondary outcomes were reduction of opioid dose by morphine equivalent daily&#xD;
      dose, and its effect on PDQ scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Data collection After participants were enrolled, they completed a baseline PDQ while waiting&#xD;
      for their appointment. Participants continued to see the intervention group, PCP, and other&#xD;
      medical providers as determined by their health providers independent of this study's&#xD;
      protocol. Another PDQ was collected at an intended 6 - 12 months later. Demographic&#xD;
      information was collected by manual chart review in the electronic medical record NextGen&#xD;
      (NextGen EHR, Nextgen Healthcare, Inc. Irvine, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables collected included age, sex, race, BMI, insurance type, preferred language,&#xD;
      presence of another pain diagnosis (e.g. knee pain), active mental health diagnosis&#xD;
      (including substance abuse), diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes, and morphine equivalent&#xD;
      dose (MED); one post-hoc variable was recorded: timing of follow-up survey in relation to the&#xD;
      2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, defined as before/after March 1, 2020. Intervention&#xD;
      type was analyzed as an independent variable since the study was not designed as a comparison&#xD;
      of interventions. All data was stored in an encrypted Excel database on a password-protected&#xD;
      laptop. Consent forms were stored in a locked cabinet accessible only to the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stata 16.0 (StataCorp, LLC, College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis. PDQ&#xD;
      scores at baseline and follow-up were tested for statistical significance using paired&#xD;
      t-tests. Univariate analysis was performed on individual categorical variables and change in&#xD;
      PDQ using two-sample t-tests. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine&#xD;
      associations of these factors to the outcome. Variables were excluded from regression models&#xD;
      if there was a subgroup size of six or less.&#xD;
