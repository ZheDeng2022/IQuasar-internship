    <textblock>
      The need for improved diagnostic methods in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is widely recognized.&#xD;
      Although Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a longstanding tool for detecting MS lesions,&#xD;
      diagnostic inaccuracies persist. Up to 20% of people diagnosed with MS (1 in 5) are later&#xD;
      found not to have the disease. This is highly consequential, as more than two-thirds of&#xD;
      misdiagnosed patients are unnecessarily exposed to risks from disease-modifying therapies,&#xD;
      which in rare cases can be life-threatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the current standard in MS diagnosis - the McDonald criteria, which combine&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and MRI findings - were developed from studies in people with typical&#xD;
      clinical presentations of MS. This reduces the specificity of these criteria, rendering them&#xD;
      uninformative for the nearly half of MS patients who present to neurologists with atypical or&#xD;
      nonclassical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeliness of MS diagnosis is also key, as diagnostic delay is common in cases of&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting MS and can carry severe and lifelong consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CentrAl Vein Sign in MS (CAVS-MS) study has been designed to assess whether Central Vein&#xD;
      Sign (CVS) criteria can help address some of these unmet diagnostic needs. It will&#xD;
      specifically explore the role of presentation type by enrolling a mixed population of&#xD;
      patients with typical clinical presentations (n = 200) and those with atypical presentations,&#xD;
      including suggestive MRI findings in the absence of neurologic symptoms (n = 200) across&#xD;
      North America.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CentrAl Vein Sign in MS (CAVS-MS) study seeks to answer whether the central vein sign&#xD;
      (CVS) can be used as a sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for a diagnosis of MS. The&#xD;
      study will investigate the CVS in a mixed population of participants with typical and&#xD;
      atypical clinical presentations including radiological presentations without neurological&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CVS is proposed as a diagnostic biomarker with improved sensitivity for a diagnosis of&#xD;
      MS, while retaining diagnostic specificity - all in an-easy-to use diagnostic test that can&#xD;
      be applied in patients with both typical and atypical disease presentation. There is&#xD;
      extensive research demonstrating the ability of the CVS criteria to discriminate MS lesions&#xD;
      from common mimickers, such as vascular disease and migraine. However, the CVS has mainly&#xD;
      been applied in cross- sectional studies. In addition, the majority of these studies have&#xD;
      focused analysis primarily on patients presenting with typical clinical events of&#xD;
      demyelination (i.e. a classic Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS)). This study will evaluate&#xD;
      CVS criteria prospectively in individuals with typical and atypical MS presentations. Aim 1&#xD;
      will examine sensitivity and specificity of CVS criteria in conjunction with, and separate&#xD;
      from, the McDonald Criteria. Aim 2 will examine CVS in a population where McDonald criteria&#xD;
      explicitly cannot be applied. Because the likelihood of MS is lower in this group, the focus&#xD;
      will be on specificity, which is where the unmet need exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although current MS diagnostic criteria are sensitive in most typical cases, the use of the&#xD;
      CVS may hasten diagnosis in patients with low lesion numbers and those without dissemination&#xD;
      in time. In the past, studies that informed revision of the diagnostic criteria used&#xD;
      &quot;clinically definite MS&quot; (defined as two separate clinical events) as the definitive&#xD;
      determination of a diagnosis. In the current treatment era, however, clinically definite MS&#xD;
      is less relevant, since most patients will be diagnosed after a first clinical event&#xD;
      (relapse) and will go on to start treatment prior to even having a second relapse. For this&#xD;
      reason, the 2017 McDonald Criteria is being used as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the proposed&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, in the current study the CVS will be applied in a population where the McDonald&#xD;
      Criteria are not applicable (atypical presentations) and where currently a significant unmet&#xD;
      clinical need exists. Because the studies that informed the diagnostic criteria did not&#xD;
      include patients presenting with atypical syndromes, such patients are not covered in the&#xD;
      McDonald Criteria path, but are frequently given a diagnosis of MS on the basis of MRI&#xD;
      findings. To address this limitation, the presence of CVS as a predictor of development of&#xD;
      future clinical events will be examined, within a 24- month period, that would satisfy the&#xD;
      2017 McDonald Criteria. Thus, the results of this study will have a significant impact on&#xD;
      both improving sensitivity in those presenting with typical presentations and providing a&#xD;
      specific test for MS in those with atypical presentations, thereby avoiding unnecessary costs&#xD;
      associated with misdiagnosis. The investigators will leverage the North American Imaging in&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis Cooperative (NAIMS) to conduct a multicenter study, based on an initial&#xD;
      cross-sectional pilot study using the CVS criteria as a diagnostic biomarker for MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled when presenting to an MS center for diagnostic referral, and they&#xD;
      will undergo follow-up at prespecified intervals for 24 months. Brain MRI will be performed&#xD;
      at baseline and 24 months, with scans scored on the basis of CVS criteria. T2-weighted&#xD;
      fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging will be combined with T2*-weighted&#xD;
      segmented echo-planar imaging to enable simultaneous identification of white matter lesions&#xD;
      and venous structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether use of CVS criteria allows for an earlier&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis of MS in patients who do not meet the McDonald criteria at baseline. The&#xD;
      aim is to show that the CVS is a simple and reliable diagnostic biomarker that will show an&#xD;
      increase in sensitivity while preserving specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining concordance of CVS criteria and the McDonald criteria among patients meeting&#xD;
           McDonald criteria at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining whether use of CVS criteria improves diagnostic specificity for MS in people&#xD;
           presenting with atypical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining whether the CVS predicts development of clinical MS in individuals with&#xD;
           suggestive radiologic findings but no symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will also begin exploratory studies of optimal methods for integrating CVS&#xD;
      findings into MS diagnostic criteria, along with any resulting healthcare-related cost&#xD;
      savings. These initial exploratory analyses will be important to how readily positive&#xD;
      findings about the utility of CVS criteria can impact clinical practice. The ultimate goal is&#xD;
      to have the CVS incorporated into the MS diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
