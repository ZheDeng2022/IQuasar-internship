    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study in healthy participants is to learn more about the safety of&#xD;
      LY3493269 and any side effects that might be associated with it. Blood tests will be&#xD;
      performed to check how much LY3493269 gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the&#xD;
      body to eliminate it. For each participant, the study will last about 10 weeks and may&#xD;
      include 12 visits, including five nights in a row in the clinical research center.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are male or female not of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index within the range of 19.0 to 40.0 kilograms per square meter (kg/mÂ²)&#xD;
             (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are healthy as determined through medical evaluation including&#xD;
             screening medical history, physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the population&#xD;
             or clinical research unit (CRU), or results with acceptable deviations that are judged&#xD;
             to be not clinically significant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have glycated hemoglobin level of less than (&lt;)6.5 percent (%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a supine heart rate (HR) less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) or greater than 100&#xD;
             bpm. If a repeat measurement shows values within the range, the participant can be&#xD;
             included in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a mean supine systolic blood pressure (BP) higher than 160 millimeters of Mercury&#xD;
             (mmHg) and a mean supine diastolic BP higher than 95 mmHg from 2 assessments at&#xD;
             screening (excluding white-coat hypertension); therefore, if a repeated measurement&#xD;
             shows values within the range, the participant can be included in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have undergone any form of bariatric surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or duodenal ulcers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or have multiple&#xD;
             endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis, or elevation in serum lipase and/or&#xD;
             amylase levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease, acute or chronic hepatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been treated with prescription drugs that promote weight loss within 3 months&#xD;
             prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have participated within the past 30 days of screening in a clinical study involving&#xD;
             an investigational product (IP); at least 5 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is&#xD;
             longer, should have passed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG at screening that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study or may&#xD;
             confound ECG (QT) data analysis, such as a QT interval corrected using Fridericia's&#xD;
             formula (QTcF) greater than (&gt;)450 milliseconds (msec) for males and &gt;470 msec for&#xD;
             females, short PR interval (&lt;120 msec), or PR interval &gt;220 msec, second and third&#xD;
             atrioventricular block, intraventricular conduction delay with QRS &gt;120 msec, right&#xD;
             bundle branch block, left bundle branch block or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;1.5&#xD;
             times (X) ULN or total bilirubin level (TBL) &gt;1.5X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have known allergies to LY3493269, related compounds, or any components of the&#xD;
             formulation (including C10), or a history of significant atopy&#xD;
