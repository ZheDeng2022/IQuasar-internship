  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning (ACP) has been widely advocated for persons with early stage dementia&#xD;
      (PWEDs) and persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This proposed study attempts to&#xD;
      promote the uptake of ACP for this population and their family caregivers in the community&#xD;
      and to examine the effects of an ACP programme &quot;Have a Say&quot; for this population. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that participants in the intervention group will be more engaged in ACP and&#xD;
      their dyadic concordance on end-of-life care preference with their family caregivers will be&#xD;
      significantly higher than that in the control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the impacts of an advance care planning (ACP) programme &quot;Have a&#xD;
      Say&quot; for persons with early stage dementia (PWEDs) or mild cognitive impairment and their&#xD;
      family caregivers in the community. A randomized controlled trial with repeated blinded&#xD;
      outcome assessment will be conducted to assess the effects of an ACP programme on dyads of&#xD;
      PWEDs or persons with MCI and their family caregivers recruited from elderly community&#xD;
      centres. Individuals who have a clinical diagnosis of any form of dementia at the early stage&#xD;
      or have a Global Deterioration Score (GDS) 3 or 4 will be eligible to this study.&#xD;
      Participants in the experimental group will receive a 4-session ACP programme. It includes an&#xD;
      educational component, guided reflection and ACP discussion through a series of group-based&#xD;
      activity and dyadic discussion delivered by trained ACP facilitator and guided by an ACP&#xD;
      booklet. Dyads of participants will be provided with information about the trajectory of&#xD;
      dementia, their future healthcare needs and caring options. Their values and care preferences&#xD;
      on future care will be elicited in a consistent manner. They will be supported to have an&#xD;
      individualized ACP discussion. Individuals assigned to the control group will receive&#xD;
      attention-control health talks. The primary study outcome is the ACP engagement level of&#xD;
      PWEDs. Secondary outcome is the dyadic concordance on end-of-life care preference. Adverse&#xD;
      outcomes such as depression and caregivers' burden will also be evaluated. Data collection&#xD;
      will be conducted at baseline, immediately after, one month and three-months after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in advance care planning engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the intervention, 1 month and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The behavior change process in ACP behaviours is measured using a 9-item ACP engagement survey. It covers two sub-scales, self-efficacy and readiness, of ACP engagement. Each item is rated on a 5-point likert scale. The higher score means the higher level of engagement for the ACP behaviour.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dyadic concordance of end-of-life care preferences</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the intervention, 1 month and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The dyadic concordance on end-of-life care preferences is measured by a modified Life Support Preferences Questionnaire (LSPQ). Dyads of participants are invited to answer individually, simultaneously but separately on two hypothetical scenarios, one featured the prospect of developing into advance stage of dementia, and another scenario featured the prospect of developing into an irreversible vegetative stage. PWEDs or persons with MCI are asked to consider themselves in each scenario and indicate their preference for receiving three discrete life-sustaining medical treatments (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation and tube feeding) in each of the two scenarios using a 3 point Likert Scale (want to attempt, refuse or not sure). The dyadic congruence is determined based on whether both of them choose the same option for end-of-life treatments and care goals for the two scenarios.</description>

    <description>The level of depression of PWEDs or persons with MCI is measured by the 19-item Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). It is to evaluate any adverse outcome posed by the intervention on them.</description>

    <description>It is a theory-driven advance care planning programme specifically designed for PWEDs or persons with MCI and their family caregivers. The intervention is underpinned by the Bandura's self-efficacy model. Each dyad of participants will receive a 4-session ACP programme, which consists of educational components, guided reflection, and dyadic ACP discussion, guided by ACP facilitators and an ACP booklet. It is composed of 2 group-based sessions and 2 dyadic discussions. One hour for each session, and once weekly. Dyads of participants will be provided with information about the trajectory of dementia, their future healthcare needs and caring options. Their values and care preferences on future care will be elicited in a consistent manner. They will be supported to have an individualized ACP discussion. By the end of the programme, each dyad of participant will be given an ACP booklet documenting the ACP process.</description>

    <intervention_name>Attention-control health talks</intervention_name>
    <description>Dyads of participants in the control group will receive 4-session health talks. One hour for each session, and once weekly. The contents of the health talks are neither dementia-specific nor related to ACP, and cover general health information for elderly, such as drug safety, home safety, exercise and health, and healthy diet. This is to differentiate the effect of the intervention from the effect of the extra time and attention given to the participants.</description>
