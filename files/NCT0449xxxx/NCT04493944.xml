  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seaweeds have been part of the diet of Asian countries for thousands of years, but&#xD;
      consumption by Quebecers remains unfamiliar. Because of their rich nutrients content and&#xD;
      unique bioactive compounds, seaweeds have a great dietary potential. The overall objective of&#xD;
      the project is to determine the potential for sustainable local exploitation of St. Lawrence&#xD;
      seaweeds by assessing their quality under growing conditions and following processing, and to&#xD;
      use them as a basis for culinary innovations for both industry and consumers. Our specific&#xD;
      objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the impact of environmental factors on the specific profile of biomarkers of&#xD;
           nutritional quality and health potential of harvested or cultivated seaweed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the impact of processing on the profile of biomarkers of nutritional&#xD;
           quality and health potential of harvested and cultivated seaweed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study changes in dietary attitudes and behaviours through a culinary workshop&#xD;
           promoting the acceptance of seaweeds and their appropriation as an ingredient by&#xD;
           consumers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application for ethical approval and this trial registration applies only to Specific&#xD;
      Objective 3.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For recruitment purposes, adults interested in cooking and consuming Quebec seaweeds will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=16 x 3 groups, ingredients, recipes and a&#xD;
      culinary workshop) or a control group (n=16 x 3 groups, ingredients and recipes). Online&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered via the secure platform of INAF (FANI) at the beginning&#xD;
      and the end of the study.&#xD;

    <description>A 3-hour culinary workshop will be led by a chef. The aim of this workshop will be to develop participants' culinary skills related to the preparation and consumption of recipes based on seaweeds, through various practical activities in the kitchen (starter, main course, dessert). An evaluation questionnaire will be completed at the end of the workshop.</description>
