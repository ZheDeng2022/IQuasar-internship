  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most previous clinical trials that addressed the rehabilitation training system for&#xD;
      sarcopenic elderly subjects focused on community-dwelling older adults who were relatively&#xD;
      healthy. There is a notable paucity of high-quality research investigating the effects and&#xD;
      feasibility of the device for hospitalized or institutionalized older people, who are&#xD;
      generally frailer and more severe in functional impairment than those living in the&#xD;
      community. Moreover, most reported the system were of long-term duration, which typically&#xD;
      lasted 3 to 6 months with two sessions per week. It remains unclear whether short-term the&#xD;
      device training would be effective for treating sarcopenia. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      aimed to assess the effectiveness of Motor-Assisted and Active Resistive Upper/Lower&#xD;
      Extremities Rehabilitation Training System for treating sarcopenia in hospitalized older&#xD;
      patients aged 80 years and over.&#xD;

    <description>The Passive, Motor-Assisted and Active Resistive Upper/Lower Extremities Rehabilitation Training System is designed for patients conﬁned to bed at the long-term care facilities hospitals, in early rehabilitation. This system can induce a natural movements of the upper/lower limb with safe motorized passive movement, as well as motor-assisted and active resistive muscle training to stimulate nerves, increase blood circulation of aﬀected tissue, cell metabolism and improve joint mobility, in promoting upper/lower extremities motor recovery.</description>
