    <textblock>
      The best treatment for kidney failure is a kidney transplant, but a transplanted kidney only&#xD;
      works for about 10 to 15 years on average. One of the reasons that a transplanted kidney can&#xD;
      stop working is that the body develops antibodies against it. Antibodies are proteins&#xD;
      produced by the body to fight infections. They play a vital role in dealing with infection&#xD;
      but in some transplant patients they can 'fight' the organ, meaning it could stop working.&#xD;
      This is called acute antibody-mediated rejection (AAMR). A patient experiencing AAMR can be&#xD;
      treated to extend the life of the transplanted kidney, but the chances of the kidney still&#xD;
      working 4 years later are reduced. There is currently a clinical trial for UK kidney&#xD;
      transplant patients who develop AAMR, called TAR:GET-1. Patients participating in TAR:GET-1&#xD;
      will either receive the standard treatment that is currently given in this situation, or the&#xD;
      standard treatment with the addition of rituximab. TAR:GET-1 will answer the question: does&#xD;
      adding rituximab to standard treatment lengthen the life of a kidney transplant? A second,&#xD;
      sub-study is being proposed of the patients enrolled in TAR:GET-1, that will use the existing&#xD;
      blood and biopsy samples already taken during TAR:GET-1 plus an optional extra biopsy of the&#xD;
      kidney transplant, to improve our understanding of how the treatments of AAMR work. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in TAR:GET-1 will have had a blood test and biopsy of the transplanted kidney to&#xD;
      establish the diagnosis of AAMR. They will also have had further blood tests after treatment,&#xD;
      and may also have further biopsies taken if their clinician needs these as part of normal&#xD;
      care. Material left over in these samples can be used to analyse how treatment works. In&#xD;
      addition, patients will be asked if they agree to an extra biopsy of the transplanted kidney&#xD;
      6 months after the treatment begins. These samples will be analysed at a deeper level than&#xD;
      would normally be done, looking at the antibodies and biopsies in detail to answer 2 key&#xD;
      questions: 1) Can the unique characteristics noted in an individual patient's antibodies and&#xD;
      biopsy predict whether a kidney transplant will be lost as a result of AAMR?; 2) Can we tell&#xD;
      treatment is working by looking at the changes in a patient's antibodies and biopsies before&#xD;
      and after treatment? The answers to these questions will help us understand AAMR and how its&#xD;
      treatments work, and potentially improve our ability to select the right treatment for the&#xD;
      right patients.&#xD;

      Design: Prospective observational study of patients enrolled in TAR:GET-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: TAR-GET-1 (starting in 2019) is a multi-centre UK clinical trial that will&#xD;
      compare standard of care (SOC) treatment of Acute Antibody-Mediated Rejection of the Kidney&#xD;
      Transplant (AAMR) to standard of care plus rituximab (SOCR). This trial presents a rare&#xD;
      opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of action of treatments (including rituximab) in&#xD;
      AAMR. The rationale for using rituximab is the depletion of CD20-positive precursors to&#xD;
      antibody-producing cells. However, rituximab has effects on other B cell subtypes and not all&#xD;
      studies have shown antibody level reductions. Furthermore, AAMR is a heterogeneous disease,&#xD;
      as defined by variability in mechanistic markers of AAMR in blood (B cell and antibody&#xD;
      characteristics) and in transplant biopsies (histological features and gene expression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate how treatment with rituximab affects these mechanistic markers, by&#xD;
           comparing SOC to SOCR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To predict treatment benefit early, by analysing the effect of treatment on the&#xD;
           mechanistic markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: In patients enrolled in TAR:GET-1 (n=170), mechanistic markers will be analysed&#xD;
      with established proof of concept (B cell and antibody characteristics, histological and&#xD;
      transcriptional markers in the biopsy) at baseline and on follow-up, making use of clinical&#xD;
      data, surplus diagnostic material from TAR:GET-1, and material from optional extra blood&#xD;
      samples for research taken as part of TAR:GET-1, at 3,6 and 12 months. An optional protocol&#xD;
      biopsy at 6 months post treatment will also be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGET-1 is assessing DSA MFI and target and B lymphocyte numbers at baseline and 3 months&#xD;
      post-treatment. This study will in addition analyse:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum DSA MFI and target at 6 months; complement-activating ability at baseline, 3&#xD;
           months and 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biopsy Banff histological scores at baseline and in post-treatment indication biopsies&#xD;
           and an optional protocol biopsy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biopsy AAMR-related transcript signature, assessed using Nanostring nCounter technology,&#xD;
           at baseline and in post-treatment biopsies indication biopsies and an optional protocol&#xD;
           biopsy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. B lymphocyte numbers at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences pre- and post-treatment will be analysed comparing SOC and SOCR. Mediation&#xD;
      analysis models will be used to decompose total effect of treatment effect on graft loss at 4&#xD;
      years (primary end point) into an indirect effect, which measures how much of the effect acts&#xD;
      through the intermediate variable(s), and a residual direct effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects and Study populations: 170 subjects enrolled in TAR:GET-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: same as primary outcome of TAR:GET-1 (graft loss at 4 years after&#xD;
      initiation of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: All patients enrolled in TAR:GET-1 ; Signed informed consent prior to any&#xD;
      study specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: 8 years (duration is dictated by the need for primary outcome of TAR-GET-1&#xD;
      to be reached)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: Data from this research project will be merged and linked with data from&#xD;
      the TAR:GET-1 clinical trial by the statistician team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data: This will include description of all the biological characteristics&#xD;
      analysed in 2 populations (rituximab + SOC and SOC) at baseline and at all follow-up time&#xD;
      points. Summary statistics (mean, median, SD, range for continuous variables, and frequency&#xD;
      tables for categorical variables) will be reported broken down by treatment, with exploratory&#xD;
      figures (box-and-whisker plots for continuous, and stacked bar-charts for categorical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome analysis: Appropriate measures of differences between treatment groups will be&#xD;
      estimated with point estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values. Depending on the type&#xD;
      of variable (continuous, categorical, time-to-event), regression techniques (linear,&#xD;
      logistic, cox) and transformation of the endpoints will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in characteristics comparing pre- to post-treatment samples at sequential time&#xD;
      points will be analysed comparing the 2 groups of patients (SOCR versus SOC) using r mixed&#xD;
      effect models repeat measurement techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediation analysis, a special case of regression analysis, will be used to document that the&#xD;
      treatment effects a change in the biomarker. Mediation analysis models will be used to&#xD;
      decompose total effect of treatment effect on graft loss into an indirect effect, which&#xD;
      measures how much of the effect acts through the intermediate variable(s), and a residual&#xD;
      direct effect. All the mediation analyses will be based on the Intention-to-Treat principle.&#xD;
      The same form of outcome models will be fitted as for the efficacy analyses, including the&#xD;
      mediator as a covariate. The mediation package within R will be used which was developed&#xD;
      specifically to make valid causal inference in explanatory analyses of the mechanisms of&#xD;
      treatment-induced change in clinical outcomes in randomised clinical trials. All estimates of&#xD;
      treatment differences will be summarised using effect size estimates and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (Dunn 2013). Collaborator for mediation analysis: Prof Ian White, Professor of&#xD;
      Statistical Methods for Medicine, UCL.&#xD;
