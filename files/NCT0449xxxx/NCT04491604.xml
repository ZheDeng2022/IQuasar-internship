  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether administration of topical B-VEC improves wound healing as compared to&#xD;
      placebo, and to evaluate durability, repeat dosing (Primary Endpoint) and further obtain&#xD;
      safety and tolerability data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thirty-one (31) participants with DEB, aged 6 months or older at time of consent are planned&#xD;
      for this Phase III study. The trial duration for each subject is about 6 months, with&#xD;
      administration occurring once weekly. A Safety Follow-up Visit occurring 30 days from the&#xD;
      date of final treatment with the Investigational Product will also occur. Each subject&#xD;
      provides at least one pair of primary target wounds, with one wound from each pair being&#xD;
      treated with B-VEC and the other wound with placebo. In addition to the primary target wound&#xD;
      pair(s), additional wounds (secondary wounds) may be selected to be treated with B-VEC.&#xD;
      Throughout the study, participants will complete questionnaires, have images captured of&#xD;
      their study wounds, undergo physical exams, have vital signs and safety labs monitored.&#xD;
