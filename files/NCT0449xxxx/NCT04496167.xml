    <time_frame>Day 95</time_frame>
    <description>The adapted ASES is a self-administered participant reported outcome measure, divided into 2 sections: a pain subscale and a function subscale. The pain subscale is a single item, numeric rating scale about pain in the affected shoulder on the day of assessment. The 11-point numeric rating scale ranges from 0 (No pain at all) to 10 (Pain as bad as it can be). The function subscale consists of 10 activities of daily living where the participant is asked to indicate on a 4 point ordinal scale their ability to do the activity with the affected arm.</description>

             including but not limited to, employees (temporary, part-time, full-time, etc) or a&#xD;
             family member of the research staff conducting the study, or of the sponsor, or of the&#xD;
             contract research organization, or of the IRB/IEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has concurrent diseases that might interfere with the conduct of the study, confound&#xD;
             the interpretation of the study results, or endanger the participant's well-being,&#xD;
             (eg, evidence of any significant hematological, endocrine, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             respiratory, neurological, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease). If there is a&#xD;
             history of such disease but the condition has been stable for more than 5 year(s) and&#xD;
             is judged by the investigator not to interfere with the participant's participation in&#xD;
             the study, the participant may be included, with the documented approval of the&#xD;
             Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has any other condition(s) that, in the investigator's opinion, might indicate the&#xD;
