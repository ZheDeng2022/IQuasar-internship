  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging population, the prevalence of chronic conditions continues to rise, affecting&#xD;
      1/3 of Canadians. The promotion of physical literacy, defined as &quot;the motivation, confidence,&#xD;
      physical competence and knowledge, to take responsibility for engagement in physical activity&#xD;
      for life&quot;, has emerged as a promising strategy to increase movement for children. However,&#xD;
      little is known about how physical literacy can impact aging adults. A working definition of&#xD;
      physical literacy for adults focusing on mobility, function and self-monitoring provides&#xD;
      opportunity to guide public health programs in addressing the rehabilitation needs of persons&#xD;
      living with multiple chronic conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this three stage mixed methods study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a new physical literacy framework, with the help of health professionals and&#xD;
           end-users that promotes optimal physical functioning for adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop a population-based health intervention using rehabilitation strategies that are&#xD;
           delivered virtually to increase physical literacy for adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 2 qualitative studies will be used to inform the third quantitative intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, an on-line consensus approach with physiotherapy leaders, rehabilitation researchers&#xD;
      and public health experts will be used to identify a new physical literacy framework as it&#xD;
      relates to adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, virtual semi-structured interviews with working adults who are living with 2 or more&#xD;
      chronic conditions will determine how aging adults frame physical literacy in their life,&#xD;
      specifically with the management of chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, working adults with 2 or more chronic conditions will participate in a 5-week&#xD;
      physical literacy program. Multifaceted knowledge translation strategies including; &quot;walk and&#xD;
      talk&quot; with a neighbour or friend, podcasts and on-line mobility challenges will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated the intervention will improve important physical literacy outcomes such as;&#xD;
      physical competence, function, mobility, motivation, awareness, and self-efficacy.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Specific Functional Scale is a patient-reported questionnaire that asks participants to identify up to 5 important activities they are having difficulty with because of their health problem, and to rate their ability to perform those activities on a scale of 0 (unable to perform the activity) to 10 (able to perform the activity like they always have).</description>

    <description>Manty Preclinical Disability Scale: Patient report questionnaire has been created from the work by Many (2007). Self reported mobility is determined by asking participants to rate their ability to walk 2.0 km, walk 0.5 km and climb up 1 flight of stairs on a scale of 1 (able to manage without difficulty) to 5 (unable to manage even with help). To identify persons at an early stage of mobility limitation (preclinical mobility limitation), additional questions were posed to participants who reported no task difficulty. The questions concerned the modification of task performance and the alternatives given were resting in the middle of the performance, using an aid, taking support from handrails, having reduced the frequency of performing the task, having slowed down performance of the task, experiencing tiredness when performing the task, or some other change in carrying out the task.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Health education impact questionnaire (heiQ): A Patient report questionnaire that aims to evaluate eight self-management skills in people with chronic conditions. Consists of 35 items across 7 independent constructs: health-directed activity; positive and active engagement in life; emotional wellbeing; self-monitoring and insight; constructive attitudes and approaches; skill and technique acquisition; social integration and support. Each construct comprises an independent questionnaire. Each construct-specific questionnaire includes 4-6 items rated on a 4-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = agree, 4 = strongly agree). The sum of scores for all items is divided by the number of items; construct scores range between 1 and 4. A higher score indicates better self-management, with the exception of the emotional wellbeing construct for which a lower score means better emotional well being.</description>

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Long From: The IPAQ is a 27-item self report questionnaire that measures physical activity for adults between the ages of 15 and 69 years. The questionnaire looks at the types of activities, the intensity of physical activity and sitting time that people do as part of their daily lives. This is used to estimate total physical activity in MET-min/week and time spent sitting. There are 5 domains of physical activity within the long version of the IPAQ (job related, transportation, house work/house maintenance/caring for family, recreation/sport/leisure time and time spent sitting.&#xD;
Participants are scored as either Low (lowest level of physical activity), Moderate or High physical activity</description>
