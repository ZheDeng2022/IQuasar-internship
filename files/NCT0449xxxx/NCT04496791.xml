  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Devices pass through different development and study phases. At an early&#xD;
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and&#xD;
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then&#xD;
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and&#xD;
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and,&#xD;
      resulting from the pre-validation studies, they get optimized. Prior to product launch, the&#xD;
      Phonak Hearing Systems get reviewed by a final quality control in terms of clinical trials.&#xD;
      This is a validation study, investigating improved algorithms, features, functions and&#xD;
      wearing comfort. This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric&#xD;
      at Sonova AG Headquarters based in Stäfa (Switzerland).&#xD;

      This study will investigate the combination of the features to determine if the audiological&#xD;
      performance and quality of the new successor of the Marvel family shows an improved benefit&#xD;
      over Phonak Audéo Marvel before going into the System Validation. Therefore this study will&#xD;
      be a comparative study. The study will determine if hearing impaired users wearing the&#xD;
      successor hearing aids, have better initial acceptance with the new precalculation, better&#xD;
      sound quality and speech intelligibility, more clarity and loudness comfort in soft and loud&#xD;
      environments compared to Phonak Marvel RIC (Receiver in channel) hearing aids. Another&#xD;
      objective of the study is to compare the listening effort with the two different study&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
