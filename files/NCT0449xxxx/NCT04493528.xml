  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients experience pain and anxiety from traditional needle anesthesia and may avoid&#xD;
      necessary dental treatments. The needle-free liquid jet injection(NFLJI) could solve these&#xD;
      problems. NFLJI delivers drug solutions by creating a micro-thin pressure liquid jet to&#xD;
      penetrate the skin and disperse in the soft tissue. It has many advantages like eliminating&#xD;
      injection pain, needle phobia and needle disposal. However, anesthesia techniques in&#xD;
      dentistry were all developed for needle injection, and they are not very effective for NFLJI.&#xD;
      Moreover, clinical trials of dental anesthesia using NFLJI have shown inconsistent efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to compare the clinical efficacy between NFLJI and needle dental&#xD;
      anesthesia in pilot split-mouth cross-over randomized clinical trials, assess the feasibility&#xD;
      to conduct such trial on a larger scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of the following four groups: 1. Infiltration on a&#xD;
      maxillary lateral incisor,2. Inferior alveolar nerve block, 3.Mental nerve block, 4.&#xD;
      Infraorbital nerve block. Each participant will receive one injection with a needle and&#xD;
      another one with NFLJI randomly at the same appointment. A washout period of 1 hour between&#xD;
      two procedures for participants' to forget the previous experience. Needle injection will be&#xD;
      performed according to clinical standards. NFLJI will be performed according to a guideline&#xD;
      developed in our research group. Participants will stay in the clinic until the anesthesia&#xD;
      effect disappear and be followed for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the efficacy and effect of two anesthesia interventions. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome is the pain and anxiety visual analogue scale before and during injection, taste&#xD;
      preference, and complications. Additionally, patients' overall feelings for two interventions&#xD;
      as well as any barriers to conducting such a trial will be recorded.&#xD;
