  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) can be observed after&#xD;
      cardiosurgical interventions. Taken together, these postoperative neurocognitive dysfunctions&#xD;
      contribute to increased morbidity and mortality and higher economic costs. Preoperative risk&#xD;
      factors of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunctions, such as decreased neuropsychometric&#xD;
      performance or decreased cognitive daily activities, can be interpreted as reduced cognitive&#xD;
      reserve. The aim of this study is to build up cognitive reserves to protect against the&#xD;
      development of POD and POCD through preoperative, home-based, cognitive training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The planned research project is a monocentric, 2-arm randomized controlled intervention study&#xD;
      involving 100 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation.&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to a training group or control group. The intervention involves a&#xD;
      standardized, paper-and-pencil-based cognitive training that will be performed by the&#xD;
      patients at home for approximately 40 minutes per day over a preoperative period of 2-3&#xD;
      weeks. The control group will receive neither cognitive training nor a placebo intervention.&#xD;
      A detailed assessment of psychological functions will be performed approximately 2-3 weeks&#xD;
      before the start of training, at the end of the training, during hospitalization, at&#xD;
      discharge from the acute clinic, and 3 months after surgery. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the interventional effect of preoperative cognitive training on the&#xD;
      incidence of POD during the stay in the acute clinic, the incidence of POCD at the time of&#xD;
      discharge from the acute clinic, and 3 months after surgery. Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      determine the training effect on objective cognitive functions before the surgery and&#xD;
      subjective cognitive functions, as well as health-related quality of life 3 months after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
