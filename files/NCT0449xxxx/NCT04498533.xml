  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis is an overuse syndrome of the forearm, which is associated with pain&#xD;
      and sensitivity in the lateral elbow region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to find out about is there any difference between the effects of&#xD;
      traditional orthotic devices and adhesive taping, in the management of lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;
      Therefore, the forearm counterforce brace, which was widely used in daily clinical practice&#xD;
      for lateral epicondylitis, was compared with kinesio tape, a new technique of adhesive taping&#xD;
      which has become increasingly popular. The study investigated and compared the effects of the&#xD;
      two interventions (the forearm counterforce brace and kinesio tape) on pain severity,&#xD;
      functional status and disability of patients with lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The outcome-assessing investigator (O. Celik) was blinded to the randomization. All study participants were assessed by the blinded investigator (O.Celik). Follow-up measurements were performed immediately after and one month later after treatment. All treatment sessions were applied by the same investigator (S. Sencan), who was not blinded to the study groups.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Pressure Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 week (İmmediately after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The tenderness on the lateral aspect of elbow was evaluated with pain pressure threshold measurements. An algometer device was used to measure pain pressure threshold. Pain pressure threshold measurements were performed at the baseline of the study, immediately after and one month later after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 week (İmmediately after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Affected upper limb function was evaluated with maximal hand grip strength. Grip strength was measured with a hydraulic hand dynamometer. Grip strength was evaluated at the baseline of the study, immediately after and one month later after treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>0 week (Baseline), 3 week (After treatment), 7 week (One month later after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Turkish version of Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire was used in the study. Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire is a 15-item self-reported questionnaire to measure perceived pain and disability in people with tennis elbow.&#xD;
The questionnaire is composed of three subscales: pain, usual activities and specific activities. Each of the items of the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire is scored on a 0-10 scale, where 0 is 'no pain' or 'no difficulty' and 10 is 'worst ever' or 'unable to do'. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, where high scores indicate greater pain and disability.&#xD;
Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire was evaluated at the baseline of the study, immediately after and one month later after treatment.</description>
