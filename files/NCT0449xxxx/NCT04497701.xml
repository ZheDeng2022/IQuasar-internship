  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of infectious complications in hematological malignancies is higher than that&#xD;
      in children with solid tumors, which may be related to the type and dose intensity of&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens used in hematological tumors. The treatment of childhood cancer has&#xD;
      changed in the past few decades: intensive treatment and good supportive treatment can&#xD;
      improve the 5-year survival rate of children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) after chemotherapy in children with hematological&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
