      Safety and Efficacy of Combination Intravenous Pregabalin and Acetaminophen Compared to&#xD;
      Acetaminophen and Placebo in Subjects Undergoing Bunionectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 subjects will be randomized (32 in each active treatment group, 16 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of combination PGB and Ofirmev administered IV vs. placebo for pain&#xD;
      control in subjects undergoing bunionectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo will be the saline solution.&#xD;
