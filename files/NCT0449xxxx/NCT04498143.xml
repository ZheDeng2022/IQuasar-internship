      Participants (aged 13-16) will be randomized to: (1) an online, active control group program&#xD;
      encouraging feelings disclosure (i.e. supportive therapy single session intervention [SSI]),&#xD;
      or (2) an online program targeting nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; i.e. Project &quot;SAVE&quot;-Stop&#xD;
      Adolescent Violence Everywhere-SSI). Investigators will test whether SAVE results in&#xD;
      significantly greater:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reductions in NSSI 3 months post-treatment [primary outcome]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reductions in self-reported likelihood of future NSSI immediately post-treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most mental health problems emerge by age 14, often leading to chronic impairments and&#xD;
      adverse impacts for individuals, families, and societies. Similarly, suicidal thoughts and&#xD;
      behaviors are relatively rare during childhood but increase significantly during the&#xD;
      transition to adolescence. Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs), which include&#xD;
      suicidal thoughts and behaviors and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; intentional self-harm&#xD;
      enacted without suicidal intent), are among the best predictors of future suicidal thoughts&#xD;
      and attempts in the current state of literature on the topic. There is also significant&#xD;
      escalation from suicidal thoughts to suicidal behaviors during this developmental period.&#xD;
      Most youth who transition from suicidal thoughts to suicidal behaviors will do so within 1-2&#xD;
      years after the onset of suicide ideation, which tends to begin in adolescents. Taken&#xD;
      together, adolescence is a key developmental period for effective depression and suicide&#xD;
      intervention and prevention. The goal of these studies is to test Single Session&#xD;
      Interventions (SSIs) (defined below) that are designed to boost coping and resilience in&#xD;
      adolescents. The investigators hope that this research will be valuable in ensuring that&#xD;
      these SSIs are accessible to more adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite significant strides in the development of psychosocial treatments for youth mental&#xD;
      health problems, up to 80% of youth in the United States with mental health needs receive no&#xD;
      services at all. Even when services are accessed, the definition of &quot;treatment&quot; is incredibly&#xD;
      broad, with evidence-based interventions being the exception, not the rule. More typically,&#xD;
      &quot;treatment&quot; may involve a single, unstructured contact with a medical doctor, counselor,&#xD;
      emergency hotline, religious leader, or other health professional (e.g., occupational&#xD;
      therapist), the benefits of which are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This reality poses a critical challenge to the field of clinical intervention science-one&#xD;
      that has been articulated many times before. Eight years ago, Kazdin and Blase (2011) called&#xD;
      for a &quot;rebooting&quot; of psychotherapy research and practice, stating that &quot;mental health&#xD;
      professionals are not likely to reduce the prevalence, incidence, and burden of mental&#xD;
      illness without a major shift in intervention research and clinical practice&quot; via a portfolio&#xD;
      of novel approaches to service delivery. Yet again, Kazdin (2019) asked us to reconsider how&#xD;
      psychotherapy can and should be delivered: He argues that without removing requirements of a&#xD;
      face-to-face format, an 'expert' with years of training, and a physical office, the&#xD;
      need-to-access gap will likely stay stagnant. Indeed, Kazdin (2019) asserts the need to think&#xD;
      about therapeutic action through an entirely new lens, asserting that &quot;interventions may or&#xD;
      may not rely on the psychological treatments that continue to dominate research.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any action-focused path to reducing the need-to-access gap will require moving beyond the&#xD;
      dominant settings, formats, and systems that have constrained intervention delivery to date.&#xD;
      Indeed, as Chorpita (2019) asserts, &quot;it may well be time we move past thinking about&#xD;
      'treatments' as our only form of solutions&quot; (p. 475), with &quot;treatments&quot; referencing the&#xD;
      dominant design of current psychosocial therapies: weekly, clinician-delivered interventions&#xD;
      in brick-and mortar clinical settings, which are too often inaccessible to those they are&#xD;
      designed to serve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief, online interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even among youths who do access services, treatment is often brief: U.S. youths who begin&#xD;
      therapy attend an average of ~4 sessions, and the modal number of sessions attended is one.&#xD;
      This creates a need to quantify and capitalize on what can be accomplished, given appropriate&#xD;
      targeting and structure, in a short period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-session interventions (SSIs) have been found to benefit youth and help reduce&#xD;
      depression symptoms. SSIs are brief and could be easily accessed online, thus, potentially&#xD;
      limiting barriers to accessing treatment. Therefore, SSIs could markedly increase the&#xD;
      capacity to address teen mental illness and SITBs in a cost-effective manner (Barak &amp; Grohol,&#xD;
      2011). Indeed, SSIs can successfully reduce mental health problems: In a meta-analysis of 50&#xD;
      randomized trials including 10,508 youth participants (ages 4-19) SSIs significantly reduced&#xD;
      psychopathology of multiple types (mean g = 0.32), including self-administered SSIs-those&#xD;
      that did not involve a therapist (e.g., online SSIs; mean g = 0.32). To date, two types of&#xD;
      SSIs have been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents and/or young adults.&#xD;
      However, only one of these two SSIs is designed for online administration (the other is&#xD;
      administered by a therapist and therefore more challenging to disseminate). In the present&#xD;
      series of studies, the investigators aim to test the efficacy of SSIs self-administered&#xD;
      online to reduce depression and SITBs in a large sample of teenagers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Current Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to test single session interventions (SSIs) that are designed to&#xD;
      boost coping and resilience in adolescents. Specifically, participants (aged 13-16) will be&#xD;
      randomized to: (1) an online, active control group program encouraging feelings disclosure&#xD;
      (i.e. supportive therapy SSI), or (2) an online program targeting nonsuicidal self-injurious&#xD;
      behavior (i.e. Project &quot;SAVE&quot;-Stop Adolescent Violence Everywhere-SSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test whether participants randomized to the SAVE SSI report:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lower self-reported likelihood of future NSSI immediately post-intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lower self-reported frequency of non-suicidal self-injury (in the past 3 months) at 3&#xD;
           month follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lower self-reported frequency of suicide ideation (in the past 3 months) at 3 month&#xD;
           follow-up&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NSSI Frequency in the Past 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome variable will compare past 3-month NSSI frequency at 3-month follow-up-for participants assigned to the Project SAVE SSI versus supportive therapy SSI (i.e. control condition). Participants will indicate &quot;how many times they have purposely hurt themselves without wanting to die&quot; in the past 3 months in an open-response text box. Notably, in the present study's survey flow, this question is displayed following display logic-such that participants endorsing zero NSSI in the past 3-months (via a previous question) skip to the end of the question block and are not prompted to answer our main frequency outcome question. For these individuals, we will impute a past 3-month frequency value equal to 0 (as they have endorsed zero NSSI in the previous 3 months in the earlier question).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Likelihood of Future NSSI.</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Likelihood of future NSSI will be measured immediately pre- and post-intervention. We will evaluate self-reported likelihood of future non-suicidal self-injury immediately post-intervention-comparing participants in the Project SAVE SSI versus supportive therapy SSI control conditions, and controlling for pre-intervention likelihood score. An item from the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview-R (Fox et al., 2020) will assess participants' beliefs about the likelihood of future non-suicidal self injury on a 5-point Likert Scale (range = 0 to 4; 0 = &quot;not at all&quot;; 4 = &quot;extremely&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Suicide ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare past 3-month SI frequency at 3-month follow-up-for participants assigned to the Project SAVE SSI versus supportive therapy SSI (i.e. control condition). At pre-intervention and 3-month follow-up time points, participants will indicate &quot;how many days did they have thoughts about killing themselves for more than a few minutes&quot; in the past 3 months in an open-response text box. Notably, in the present study's survey flow, this question is displayed following display logic-such that participants endorsing zero history of SI (via a previous question) skip to the end of the question block and are not prompted to answer our frequency outcome question. For these individuals, we will impute a past 3-month frequency value equal to 0 (as they have endorsed zero SI in the previous question). More information about how we will handle very large numbers (i.e. outliers) for this outcome is reported below (see &quot;Outliers and Exclusions&quot; section; &quot;Winsorizing Outliers&quot; subsection).</description>

    <description>SAVE is a ~30-minute, self-administered, web-based program that uses components of cognitive behavior therapy and dialectical behavior therapy designed to decrease self-injurious behaviors in youth. The Project SAVE SSI has 4 general content sections: (1) explaining the science behind how changing your actions (i.e. decreasing self-injurious behaviors) can positively impact your emotions over time; (2) providing scientific evidence and testimonials from other teens that have successfully decreased their self-injurious behaviors and noticed positive change as a result; (3) evidence-based tips for overcoming common obstacles to decreasing self-injurious behaviors in day to day life; and (4) offering an opportunity for youth to share their own thoughts and advice on what they have learned with other teenagers who are facing similar challenges.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be 13 - 16 years old at the time of the baseline survey&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must report comfort reading and writing in English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must endorse no learning disability, visual impairment, or other difficulty that makes&#xD;
             it difficult to answer questions on a computer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have access to a laptop or smartphone with internet access&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must endorse purposefully hurting self without wanting to die within the past month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must endorse either &quot;I do not like myself&quot; or &quot;I hate myself&quot; on CDI-II item 7 in a&#xD;
             screener survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Type 1 exclusions are exclusions that can be automated and do not require consensus among&#xD;
        investigators. A research team member who will not be involved with conducting the primary&#xD;
        study analyses will use type 1 exclusions to determine when participant recruitment is&#xD;
        complete. Recruitment for the present study will end once 500 participants have been&#xD;
        randomized who pass all type 1 exclusions tests (i.e. are still eligible for inclusion&#xD;
        after excluding for type 1 criteria; see our section on sample size for more details).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Type 1 exclusions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not meeting inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who exit the study prior to condition randomization for our listed&#xD;
             analyses (note: the present study will use an intention-to-treat approach, where every&#xD;
             participant who was randomized to a study condition-and who is not excluded for one of&#xD;
             the specific reasons outlined in this section-will be included our our analyses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Type 2 Exclusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        Type 2 exclusions are exclusions that cannot be automated and require consensus among&#xD;
        investigators. Participants excluded for type 2 reasons will be subtracted from the N = 500&#xD;
        total individuals who were randomized and met criteria for inclusion following type 1&#xD;
        exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Here, we will exclude the following participants based on failure to meet the following&#xD;
        quality check criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who respond with either copy/pasted responses from text earlier in the&#xD;
        intervention (e.g. copy and pasting only text from a previous testimonial slide) to any of&#xD;
        free response questions Participants demonstrating an obvious lack of English fluency in&#xD;
        open response questions; these participants will be identified by consensus from all study&#xD;
        team members Participants responding with random text in open response questions; these&#xD;
        participants will be identified by consensus from all study team members Duplicate&#xD;
        responses from the same individual in baseline or follow-up surveys (i.e. more than one&#xD;
        response with an identical IP address). Where duplicate responses for the same individual&#xD;
        are present in the same survey (e.g. more than 1 response for a single individual at&#xD;
        follow-up), we will exclude the response that is less complete, retaining the more complete&#xD;
        of the two responses. If both responses are 100% complete, we will retain the first of the&#xD;
        two responses for that survey. Notably, if an individual completes the baseline survey more&#xD;
        than once-and happens to be randomized to both conditions-we will exclude this individual's&#xD;
        responses from our analysis altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will also exclude for primary analyses (but may run sensitivity analyses including them)&#xD;
        any participants who provide responses of 3 words or fewer to writing prompts that ask for&#xD;
        at least 2 sentences or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These exclusions are based on previous single session intervention research conducted&#xD;
        online&#xD;
&#xD;
        (for one example, see Schleider &amp; Weisz, 2018:&#xD;
