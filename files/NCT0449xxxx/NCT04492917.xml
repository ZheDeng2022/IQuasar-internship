  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compression of the fourth ventricle (CV4), is the more studied cranial technique, commonly&#xD;
      used by Osteopathy in the Cranial Field practitioners. Several evidences attributed to CV4 an&#xD;
      effect on nervous system functions, however, the supporting evidence for CV4 clinical&#xD;
      benefits are promising but still poor. The osteopathic tradition considers the sacrum linked&#xD;
      to the cranium through anatomical and functional connections. The primary aim of this study&#xD;
      is to support preliminary evidence about the CV4 effect on nervous system function. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to analyze a potential neurophysiological connection between the occiput and&#xD;
      sacrum during an osteopathic craniosacral approach.&#xD;

      Forty healthy volunteers will receive a combination of CV4 technique, CV4 sham, sacral&#xD;
      technique (ST) and sacral sham technique (SST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each sessions, split by 4 hours wash out, will start with a 10 min of no treatment (resting&#xD;
      state), followed by two randomized interventions. Alpha EEG will continuously recorded during&#xD;
      each intervention and 10 min after, for a total of approximately 50-60 min per session.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects received a combination of active technique (CV4) and the corresponding sham technique (shamCV4).&#xD;
CV4: the lateral angles of the occipital squama are manually approximated slightly exaggerating the posterior convexity of the occiput and taking the cranium into sustained extension.The technique ended when the osteopath perceived the still point, a condition in which the balanced membranous or ligamentous tension is achieved.&#xD;
ShamCV4: sham intervention was performed placing the hands in the same position of the corresponding active technique, applying a light touch</description>

    <description>All subjects received a combination of active technique (ST) and the corresponding sham technique (shamST).&#xD;
ST: The subject was lying in supine position, while the osteopath positioned the index and middle fingers of the caudal hand on either side of the subject's sacrum. Then establishes a point of balance between the coccyx and the vertex facilitating the sacral extension until the achievement of the still point.&#xD;
