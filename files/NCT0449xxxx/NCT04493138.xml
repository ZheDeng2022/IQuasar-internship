  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of quizartinib when given with&#xD;
      azacitidine and to see how well they work in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with FLT3 or CBL mutations. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Quizartinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Giving azacitidine and quizartinib may help to control myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of quizartinib in&#xD;
      combination with azacytidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall response (ORR) rate to quizartinib in combination with azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival (OS), duration of response, leukemia-free survival (LFS),&#xD;
      relapse-free survival (RFS) and safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of quizartinib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over about 30 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1-5 and quizartinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
