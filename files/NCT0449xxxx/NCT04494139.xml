    <textblock>
      As an important way to translate cardiovascular disease prevention efforts, worksite&#xD;
      interventions can facilitate healthy food choices, health education, and social support. This&#xD;
      proposed project is adapted and scaled-up from the Nepal study, and will measure the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a canteen and a behavioral intervention on cardio-metabolic risk at a&#xD;
      worksite in South Africa. This study will estimate the added benefit of a proven&#xD;
      individual-level dietary intervention over environmental-level changes for preventing&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic risk within the South African context. If the study demonstrates a&#xD;
      significant effect, a scaled-up approach could produce an important reduction in&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease burden through environmental and individual level prevention programs&#xD;
      in South Africa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of the multi-component environmental worksite intervention will be measured&#xD;
      by evaluating the change in number of individuals attaining two or more cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      reduction goals (i.e., reductions in HbA1c, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol and&#xD;
      weight). Secondary outcomes will include the individual changes in the risk factors included&#xD;
      in the primary outcome, as well as in cardiometabolic risk not included in the composite&#xD;
      score (i.e., LDL, HDL, total cholesterol/HLD ratio), in dietary intake, in physical activity,&#xD;
      and in worksite-level food and beverage sales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the effectiveness of a canteen intervention on a composite score based upon&#xD;
           improvement in cardio-metabolic risk factors (0-3) with success defined by HbA1c&#xD;
           decrease ≥0.5%; a systolic blood pressure decrease ≥5 mmHg; and a decrease in plasma&#xD;
           triglycerides ≥10 mg/dl. We will compare the change in the score after six months of the&#xD;
           canteen intervention to the baseline results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention on a composite score based&#xD;
           upon improvement in cardio-metabolic risk factors (0-3) with success defined by HbA1c&#xD;
           decrease ≥0.5%; a systolic blood pressure decrease ≥5 mm Hg. We will compare the change&#xD;
           in the score in behavior intervention group to the baseline results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To measure the effectiveness of a canteen intervention on diabetes risk (By comparing&#xD;
           the change in HbA1c of participants after six months of canteen intervention to the&#xD;
           baseline results).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To measure the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention on diabetes risk (By comparing&#xD;
           the change in HbA1c of participants after six months of behavior plus canteen&#xD;
           intervention to the change over six months during the canteen only intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To measure the combined effect of canteen and behavioral intervention on diabetes risk&#xD;
           (By comparing the change in HbA1c levels of the participants of canteen plus behavioral&#xD;
           intervention to baseline results).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To measure the effectiveness of a canteen intervention on dietary behavior (By comparing&#xD;
           change in the proportion of healthy foods adopted by the participants after six months&#xD;
           of canteen intervention to the change in the proportion of healthy food consumption at&#xD;
           baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To measure the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention on dietary behavior (By&#xD;
           comparing the change in the proportion of healthy foods eaten by the participants after&#xD;
           six months of behavior plus canteen intervention to the change over six months during&#xD;
           the canteen only intervention) Interventions The study will recruit 350 employees at a&#xD;
           worksite in Durban, Kwa Zulu Natal using the worksite characteristic checklist for best&#xD;
           fit to the study. Formative work will be done to determine the best fit for the&#xD;
           implementation of the intervention to the worksite. At baseline, 6 months, 12 months and&#xD;
           18 months, standard questionnaire will be administered to record relevant&#xD;
           characteristics of the participants, physical activity, smoking, stress, alcohol intake&#xD;
           and diet. Food sales data will be abstracted from the administrative database of the&#xD;
           canteen. Blood samples will be collected and analyzed for HbA1c, fasting glucose, and&#xD;
           lipid profile (HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides). Participants height, weight,&#xD;
           waist circumference, hip circumference, and blood pressure will be measured. After 6&#xD;
           months of control period, the participants will receive the canteen intervention. After&#xD;
           six months of the canteen/physical environment intervention, half of the participants&#xD;
           will be randomized to receive a canteen and behavioral intervention; whereas the other&#xD;
           half receives canteen only intervention. The behavioral intervention will be comprised&#xD;
           of a combination of intensive education sessions and goal setting and monitoring based&#xD;
           on a validated worksite curriculum tailored to local needs. The curriculum will include&#xD;
           24 sessions: 16 core weekly sessions during the first four months of the intervention&#xD;
           followed by 8 weekly maintenance sessions (text messages). Each session will be&#xD;
           facilitated by a nutritionist/dietitian and a peer educator; and will last one hour.&#xD;
           Broadly, the curriculum will cover the subject matters of importance of healthy weight,&#xD;
           eating a healthy diet, increasing physical activity, stress management, and challenges&#xD;
           of lifestyle changes. Participants will be encouraged to keep food and activity diaries&#xD;
           throughout the course of the study. During the maintenance period, the focus will be on&#xD;
           overcoming declines in motivation and on maintaining long-term healthy behaviors.&#xD;
           Participants will set at least two lifestyle change goals such as consuming half of the&#xD;
           total grains as whole grains, walking 30 minutes a day, reducing 7% of the body weight,&#xD;
           and similar goals to achieve during the sessions based on their baseline CVD profile.&#xD;
           Participants will be followed up at 6 months (at the end of step 1 intervention), 12&#xD;
           months (at the end of step 2 intervention). During each follow up, fasting blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected and analyzed for HbA1c, fasting glucose, and lipid profile (HDL, LDL,&#xD;
           total cholesterol, triglycerides).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will use chi squared test use to compare (a) Proportion of individual&#xD;
      with score ≥ 2 during canteen only intervention to the proportion of individual with score ≥&#xD;
      2 during the control period; (b) Proportion of individual with score ≥ 2 during canteen and&#xD;
      behavioral intervention to the proportion of individual with score ≥ 2 during canteen only&#xD;
      intervention. Logistic regression for the proportion of individual with score ≥ 2 as outcome&#xD;
      and canteen only vs canteen and behavioural as exposure will be conducted. Secondary analysis&#xD;
      will use paired t-test to compare (a) the change in healthy food intake and HbA1c during&#xD;
      canteen only intervention to the change in healthy food intake and HbA1C during the control&#xD;
      period (b) the change in healthy food intake and HbA1C% during canteen and behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to the change in healthy food intake and HbA1C% during canteen only&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following process outcomes will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Program adoption will be measured by quantifying workers participation through&#xD;
           calculating the percentages of total employees agreeing to screening, and percentages&#xD;
           agreeing to participate in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Program fidelity will be determined by measuring changes in the worksite environment,&#xD;
           and management support for the program. To assess compliance to the recommended dietary&#xD;
           interventions (i.e., provide healthy food options in the canteen, eliminate SSBs) every&#xD;
           month in the intervention period, a member of the study team not affiliated with the&#xD;
           worksite will do a random audit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Program feasibility will be measured by quantifying the changes in sales of healthy and&#xD;
           unhealthy foods and beverages at the canteen from baseline to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Program adoption and acceptability will be assessed through focus group discussions with&#xD;
           employees (lifestyle participants and lifestyle drop outs) managers and non-eligible&#xD;
           participants on worksite environmental changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The value and return on investment of the intervention for employers will be measured by&#xD;
           assessing program cost and cost-effectiveness and changes in staff productivity,&#xD;
           absenteeism, health status, and quality of life.&#xD;
