    <textblock>
      Colorectal Carcinoma (CRC) is the third most frequent diagnosed cancer worldwide, with 1.4&#xD;
      million new cases every year. In an attempt to reduce this number many countries have&#xD;
      implemented a nationwide screening programme targeted at detecting CRC in an early phase&#xD;
      using fecal immunochemical tests (FITs). People with an elevated level of blood in their&#xD;
      stool are offered a colonoscopy, an invasive medical procedure where CRCs and premalignant&#xD;
      lesions (together also referred to as advanced neoplasia) can be detected accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the current screening method using FIT is not optimal. In FIT-based CRC screening&#xD;
      studies, 1 in 4 participants with CRC and 2 in 3 participants with advanced neoplasia receive&#xD;
      a negative FIT result. In contrast, an estimated 1 in 2 FIT-positives have advanced neoplasia&#xD;
      at colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have demonstrated that a risk model that takes into account the FIT result and&#xD;
      other risk factors for CRC could enhance the effectiveness of a FIT-based CRC screening&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the yield of advanced neoplasia in the colon and&#xD;
      rectum of a FIT-based risk model at colonoscopy, compared to that of a FIT-only CRC screening&#xD;
      strategy. Our hypothesis is that a risk-based model yields significantly more advanced&#xD;
      neoplasia at colonoscopy than the FIT by itself, and that it does not affect participation&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess this hypothesis, the investigators have designed a clinical trial in which the&#xD;
      investigators randomize 23,000 asymptomatic individuals between the age of 55 and 75 years&#xD;
      old to either risk-based screening (intervention group) or FIT-only screening (control&#xD;
      group). The intervention group will receive a questionnaire on risk factors of CRC (e.g.&#xD;
      smoking, family history of CRC), and a FIT. The control group will only receive the FIT. The&#xD;
      positivity threshold of the FIT in both groups will be set at 15 micrograms haemoglobin per&#xD;
      gram faeces. The positivity threshold of the risk-based model in the intervention group will&#xD;
      be set at 0.10 (out of a range of 0 to 1), a threshold that is calculated with a goal to&#xD;
      match the positivity rate of the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a result that is above the thresholds of the FIT and/or the risk-based&#xD;
      model will be invited to undergo a colonoscopy according protocol of the Dutch national&#xD;
      screening program. After the study has ended, the investigators will compare both groups to&#xD;
      assess our hypotheses.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent diagnosed&#xD;
      cancer worldwide, with 1.4 million new cases every year. Mortality of CRC is estimated at&#xD;
      around 40%. To reduce the incidence of CRC and to abate the negative consequences associated&#xD;
      with CRC, methods for early detection of (pre)malignant colorectal lesions have extensively&#xD;
      been researched and implemented. Colonoscopy is the reference standard for the detection of&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia, but it requires trained endoscopists, carries a high burden, harbours a&#xD;
      risk for complications in patients, and increases societal costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most screening programs use methods to select screening participants with a high risk of&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia for colonoscopy. One such method is the detection of blood in stool with&#xD;
      faecal immunochemical tests (FITs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple nation-wide screening programs have now been implemented using FIT, including one in&#xD;
      the Netherlands. In the Dutch CRC screening program, using a FIT threshold of 47 µg Hb/g&#xD;
      faeces, the sensitivity of FIT in detecting CRC is 85.5%. The sensitivity of FIT in detecting&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia (AN) is however substantially lower: 38%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIT-based screening also generates a high number of false positives, leading to unnecessary&#xD;
      colonoscopies and distress for those patients. Approximately 1 in 2 FIT-positives has&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia; the first round of the Dutch CRC screening program, using a FIT threshold&#xD;
      of 47 µg Hb/g faeces, reached a positive predictive value of 54%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of clinical risk factors for CRC, such as&#xD;
      male gender, age, family history of CRC, and smoking. In a ZonMW sponsored project (ZonMW&#xD;
      50-50115-96-521) our group has shown that higher age, male sex, a family history with close&#xD;
      relatives in whom CRC was diagnosed, and active smoking were all associated with the presence&#xD;
      of advanced neoplasia (Stegeman et al, Gut, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple CRC risk models have been developed using these risk factors, but most show only&#xD;
      weak discriminatory power. Others have proposed risk models that additionally included&#xD;
      molecular markers, increasing performance and discriminatory power, but these markers can be&#xD;
      cumbersome to collect and can be costly in respect to the relative cheap FIT test. the&#xD;
      investigators propose to combine CRC risk factors with the quantitative FIT result. FIT is a&#xD;
      quantitative test with a variable cut-off level, and individuals with higher values of faecal&#xD;
      haemoglobin are at higher risk of having advanced neoplasia at the cost of a lower&#xD;
      specificity. Therefore, the quantitative result can be used as a weight-factor in a risk&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on information on these risk factors for CRC and the quantitative FIT-result, our&#xD;
      FIT-based risk model for CRC screening calculates the personal risk of having advanced&#xD;
      neoplasia at colonoscopy. Inviting screening participants with elevated risk for colonoscopy,&#xD;
      rather than those whose FIT result exceeds a pre-specified threshold, has the potential to&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness and efficiency of FIT-based CRC screening. However, this requires&#xD;
      participants to complete the questions about risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that integration of FIT score with known risk factors (age, gender,&#xD;
      smoking, and family history of CRC) improves the number of participants in whom advanced&#xD;
      neoplasia is detected, relative to the number of invitees. The investigators will compare a&#xD;
      risk-based approach to screening, as described above, to the conventional FIT-only screening&#xD;
      in a randomized controlled screening trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The study hypothesis is that risk-based CRC screening significantly outperforms&#xD;
      FIT-only CRC screening in terms of the relative number of invitees in whom advanced neoplasia&#xD;
      is detected at colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Question: does risk-based CRC screening result in a higher relative number&#xD;
      of invitees in whom advanced neoplasia is detected at colonoscopy compared to FIT-only CRC&#xD;
      screening?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Does risk-based CRC screening result in a higher standardized screening yield in whom&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia is detected at colonoscopy compared to FIT-only CRC screening? ii) Is the&#xD;
      participation rate of risk-based CRC screening non-inferior compared to FIT-only screening?&#xD;
      iii) Does risk-based CRC screening result in a higher relative number of invitees in whom&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia is detected at colonoscopy compared to FIT-only CRC screening at higher&#xD;
      FIT-positivity thresholds (from 15 µg Hb /g faeces)? iv) Does risk-based CRC screening result&#xD;
      in a higher relative number of invitees in whom proximally located advanced neoplasia is&#xD;
      detected at colonoscopy compared to FIT-only CRC screening?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial in 23,000 randomly&#xD;
      selected men and women (aged 55 to 75 years) eligible for participation in the national CRC&#xD;
      screening programme. All eligible participants will be second time invitees, living within a&#xD;
      25 km radius from the colonoscopy centre Bergman Clinics Amsterdam, which is accredited for&#xD;
      the national population screening program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals are randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to an invitation for either&#xD;
      risk-based CRC screening (intervention group) or FIT-only screening (control group).&#xD;
      Randomization per household will be done before invitation. Study invitations are sent out by&#xD;
      Foundation of Population Screening Mid-West (BoMW) early November 2019 before sending the FIT&#xD;
      sample kit of the national screening program to the study cohort from January 2020 to April&#xD;
      2020. The study invitation is combined with a leaflet containing information on study&#xD;
      participation. It will also contain an informed consent form, and a one-page questionnaire&#xD;
      (if allocated to the intervention arm) with a self-addressed envelope to the research&#xD;
      facility. The informed consent form will bear a unique study identification code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model that the investigators will use in this study for risk-based screening is derived&#xD;
      from a model developed in a primary colonoscopy screening trial (Stegeman et al, Gut, 2014).&#xD;
      The investigators have re-evaluated our multivariable risk model for CRC, with the aim to&#xD;
      simplify it for daily practice. A number of risk factors (such as elements from diet) added&#xD;
      little to the performance of the model, whereas collecting the necessary information proved&#xD;
      rather tedious. The quantitative FIT result, age, sex, family history and smoking behaviour&#xD;
      were the most decisive factors in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This simplified FIT-based risk model had a performance like that of the extended model in the&#xD;
      development dataset. In this study the investigators will calculate the risk of harbouring&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia with our simplified FIT-based risk model, based on the quantitative FIT&#xD;
      result, age, sex, family history and smoking behaviour (see below). The threshold and&#xD;
      expected positivity rate of the risk-based model will be matched to the expected positivity&#xD;
      rate of the FIT-only group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression equation of the updated model:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ln(odds AN) = -4.955073942+0.9196052173*Smoking+0.3364761549* √FIT+0.370575346*family history&#xD;
      of CRC-0.006934851*FIT+0.0228752117*age+0.070972656*gender&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probability of advanced neoplasia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P (AN)=e^((odds AN))/(1+e^((odds AN))) If invitees that are allocated to the intervention&#xD;
      group (i.e. questionnaire and FIT) only return the questionnaire, they do not qualify for a&#xD;
      colonoscopy. When consenting invitees in the intervention group prefer not to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire, FIT tests will be analysed at a cut-off of 15 µg Hb/g faeces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of FIT that will be used is the one used in the Dutch national screening programme:&#xD;
      FOB-Gold (Sentinel, Italy). FIT-analyses and sending of FIT results will be performed&#xD;
      according to the logistics as being used in the national screening. The FIT result and the&#xD;
      result of the questionnaire will be entered in a database, to calculate the participant's&#xD;
      risk. All FIT positives (≥15 µg Hb/g faeces) will be referred for consultation for&#xD;
      colonoscopy at regional endoscopic centres. For the purpose of this study, FIT-negative but&#xD;
      risk-positive participants (i.e. the combination of the results of the questionnaire and the&#xD;
      quantitative FIT result) will also be invited for consultation for colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy will be performed by endoscopists accredited for our national screening programme&#xD;
      and according to national and international quality guidelines. Quality indicators and&#xD;
      endoscopic findings will be systematically recorded in a database, according to the standards&#xD;
      of the national screening programme. Lesions will be immediately removed, if possible, and&#xD;
      otherwise biopsies will be obtained. Histopathological assessment of these tissue samples&#xD;
      will provide a definitive diagnosis. Data on location, size, macroscopic aspect, morphology&#xD;
      and polypectomy will be recorded for all colonic lesions, which will be collected and&#xD;
      evaluated by an accredited GI-pathologist according to the Vienna criteria. Advanced adenomas&#xD;
      are defined as adenomas larger than 10 mm, adenomas with high-grade dysplasia or adenomas&#xD;
      with a villous component of at least 25%. Advice regarding surveillance colonoscopy after&#xD;
      removal of adenomatous polyps, large (≥10 mm) serrated lesions or cancer will be given to the&#xD;
      clients according to the Dutch CBO consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening invitees can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so&#xD;
      without any consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a screening invitee from&#xD;
      the study for urgent medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome The difference in screening yield will be estimated and expressed as an&#xD;
      absolute difference per 1,000 invitees, with 95% confidence intervals. The investigators will&#xD;
      test the null hypothesis of no difference in yield between the intervention and control group&#xD;
      using the chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome The standardized screening yield will be calculated by ranking participants&#xD;
      according to their calculated risk (in risk-based screening) and comparing the yield of&#xD;
      risk-based screening for the number of positives that matches the number of FIT-positives&#xD;
      with FIT-only screening with a chi-square test. Additionally, the investigators will use the&#xD;
      McNemar test statistic to test the null hypothesis of no gain in screening yield in the&#xD;
      intervention group only, where the investigators can compare referrals based on FIT only with&#xD;
      referrals based on FIT and calculated risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation rate will be calculated through the number of participants relative to the&#xD;
      number of invitees in each arm. Differences in participation rate will be assessed using the&#xD;
      chi square test. The difference in screening yield of proximally located advanced neoplasia&#xD;
      between both arms will be estimated and expressed as an absolute difference per 1,000&#xD;
      invitees (with 95% confidence intervals). The null hypothesis of no difference in yield will&#xD;
      be tested using the chi square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance level P-values of lower than 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. All analysis between both arms are based on the intention-to-screen principle,&#xD;
      unless stated otherwise. Statistical analyses will be performed using R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional outcomes Model performance in comparison to the FIT will be assessed with the net&#xD;
      reclassification improvement (NRI). In addition, the yield of the FIT-based risk model and&#xD;
      the FIT will be assessed at a broad range of FIT thresholds and will be estimated and&#xD;
      expressed as the number of detected advanced neoplasia per 1,000 invitees&#xD;
      (intention-to-screen) and per 1,000 colonoscopies (per protocol). Differences in the yield&#xD;
      will be tested using a chi square test. Any missing data that was intended to be used as&#xD;
      input for the risk-model, will be classified as '0'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study will be conducted according to the principles of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki (Version October 2008) and the Population Screening Act (WBO).&#xD;
      Permission to conduct this study has been granted by the Dutch Health Council and the Dutch&#xD;
      Minister of Healthcare.&#xD;
