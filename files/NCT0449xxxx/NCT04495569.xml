  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I bridging clinical trial is to evaluate on the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and ADA of a single intramuscular injection of recombinant anti-rabies&#xD;
      human monoclonal antibody injection (SYN023) alone or combined with rabies vaccine in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. The study primary purpose was to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) between U.S and&#xD;
      China subjects, therefore to lay a foundation for the follow-up clinical trials. The&#xD;
      secondary purpose was to evaluate the PK, PD, Safety and ADA of SYN023 in Chinese Healthy&#xD;
      subjects and compare with that of U.S. subjects.&#xD;
