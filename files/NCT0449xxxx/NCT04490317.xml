    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study enrolls subjects who experience carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate therapeutic effects of various treatments and short&#xD;
      and long-term outcomes in CO poisoned patients. In addition, complications of brain and heart&#xD;
      susceptible to CO are investigated through various ways and the association between&#xD;
      complications and the patient's prognosis is also investigated. All subjects will be&#xD;
      regularly monitored by physicians participating in this study.&#xD;

      This prospective cohort study enrolls subjects who experience CO poisoning. The purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate therapeutic effects of various treatments, including hyperbaric&#xD;
      oxygen therapy (HBO), therapeutic hypothermia (TH), and additional drugs, and short and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes, such as neurocognitive sequelae or mortality, in CO poisoned patients. In&#xD;
      addition, complications of brain and heart susceptible to CO are investigated through a&#xD;
      variety of ways, such as magnetic resonance image (MRI), computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
      ultrasound, and laboratory test, and the association between various complications and the&#xD;
      patient's prognosis is also investigated. All subjects will be regularly monitored by&#xD;
      physicians participating in this study.&#xD;
