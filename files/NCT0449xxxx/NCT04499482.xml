  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation trial in the elderly with obesity to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose of a novel dietary fiber from whole young soy pods (soy) delivered in foods.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tolerability to 10 g, 20 g, and 30 g of soy will be tested. At each dose, eight subjects&#xD;
      will incorporate the foods containing soy into their usual diet for one week. The&#xD;
      tolerability to each dose will be evaluated and fecal short chain fatty acids will be&#xD;
      measured as a biomarker of compliance. Subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria and&#xD;
      express willingness to consume the study foods will be enrolled.&#xD;
