  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a safety and feasibility study to assess the performance of an&#xD;
      artificial pancreas (AP) system using the Zone Model Predictive control (Zone-MPC) and Health&#xD;
      Monitoring System (HMS) algorithms embedded into the iAPS platform for pregnant patients with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes (T1D).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The system will be evaluated on up to 21 pregnant adult subjects with type 1 diabetes age&#xD;
      18-45 years old at three clinical sites (Sansum Diabetes Research Institute, Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      Rochester MN and Mt Sinai Hospital, New York City). Subjects will complete a 48-60 hour&#xD;
      closed-loop (CL) session in a supervised outpatient environment with medical staff present.&#xD;
      During the session, subjects will bolus for all meals and snacks, and will perform their&#xD;
      usual daily activities while being accompanied by study medical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who wish to continue use of the system, they will be offered the option of&#xD;
      continuing use of the system at home in an extension phase, for the rest of their pregnancy.&#xD;
