  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in understanding how cancer develops and spreads have led to effective new&#xD;
      treatments and improved outcomes for patients with melanoma. However, we know that these new&#xD;
      treatments do not work for all patients: some do not respond to them and some initially&#xD;
      respond but then develop resistance. The overall aim of this study will be to collect tumour&#xD;
      biopsies, biomarkers present in the blood, and other biological specimens which can be used&#xD;
      to try to understand why resistance to anti-cancer treatment occurs, and to develop&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers of this resistance in patients with locally advanced and metastatic&#xD;
      malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be open to NHS patients aged 16 and over, who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      advanced melanoma, and who will be receiving treatment for their disease as part of their&#xD;
      routine care. Patients will be asked to provide samples from tumour biopsies before, during&#xD;
      and after treatment. We will also ask for blood samples to look at biomarkers in the blood&#xD;
      and see how these correspond with tumour samples, which will further help us to understand&#xD;
      treatment response. Biomarkers are substances in the body that can be measured and help&#xD;
      indicate how a disease is developing. It is hoped that soon we will be able to monitor cancer&#xD;
      by analysing a patient's blood samples, thus reducing the need for biopsies. As blood tests&#xD;
      could be taken more frequently, signs that patients are becoming resistant to treatments&#xD;
      could be picked up sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well as monitoring biomarkers, we would also like to understand what happens to the&#xD;
      healthy cells surrounding the tumour during treatment. This will improve our understanding of&#xD;
      how cells adapt and respond to treatments, and may eventually lead to the discovery of new&#xD;
      biomarkers to help predict which patients will develop resistance to certain treatments.&#xD;

      This will be a prospective study recruiting patients who have been diagnosed wth advanced&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to give informed consent before any samples are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to donate tissue and other biospecimens (see list below) that are&#xD;
      surplus to clinical requirements if a participant is undergoing any of the following as part&#xD;
      of their routine care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lymph node dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sentinel lymph node biopsy as part of their normal care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  resection of metastatic skin lesions or visceral disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical treatment for Stage IV disease Biospecimens include urine, stool, saliva, hair&#xD;
           follicles, ascitic, pleural, pericardial or cerebrospinal fluid Collection of archival&#xD;
           tumour tissue from previous biopsy/surgery that is surplus to clinical requirements will&#xD;
           also be requested, where available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to consent to having easily accessible lesions biopsied or&#xD;
      resected, which are not required for clinical reasons, but are for research purposes only.&#xD;
      Participants can still be part of the study even if they do not agree to these extra,&#xD;
      optional biopsies. Tissue samples from the surgical specimens and the original primaries will&#xD;
      be examined to look for molecular markers to correlate with circulating tumour molecular&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be requested to grow cell lines from the donated tumour tissue and implant&#xD;
      tumour tissue into mice to characterise the genetic changes seen in both CTCs and biopsies,&#xD;
      in terms of resistance to targeted agents, in the lab setting. Consent to this part of the&#xD;
      study will be optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 50mls blood sample will be requested from participants before any intervention.&#xD;
      Further blood samples (maximum of 50mls each time) will also be requested as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after surgery, on subsequent routine follow up at 3 months, and then 3 monthly&#xD;
           thereafter (i.e. approximately 4 times in a year after the initial pre and post surgical&#xD;
           specimens)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the time of disease recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If on treatment, then usually approximately 3 weeks after starting treatment, and then&#xD;
           every 2 cycles of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at disease progression The samples will be tested for various circulating tumour&#xD;
           biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be asking a small group of patients, approx 20, to consent to weekly blood samples,&#xD;
      for up to 8 weeks, for specific biomarker analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected for each patient, looking at demographics, baseline&#xD;
      haematology and biochemistry blood results, radiological extent of disease, time to disease&#xD;
      progression, clinical and histological features of the primary. Patients will be followed up&#xD;
      for approximately 10 years to assess their outcome.&#xD;
