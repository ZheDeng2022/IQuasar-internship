  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, multicenter, vehicle-controlled, double-masked, randomized study. All&#xD;
      subjects enrolled will have dry eye disease. The study consists of Screening and Baseline&#xD;
      visits to determine eligibility followed by efficacy assessments at Day 14 (Visit 3), 28&#xD;
      (Visit 4) and 84 (Visit 5 / Study Exit). Safety will be assessed at all study visits. All&#xD;
      subjects will be exposed to the Controlled Adverse Environment (CAE®) at the Screening,&#xD;
      Baseline, Day 28 and Day 84 visits. Only subjects who qualify based on inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, will be enrolled in the study and randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio within each site, to&#xD;
      receive AR-15512 0.0014%, AR-15512 0.003% or AR-15512 vehicle to be administered as 1 drop in&#xD;
      each eye twice daily for 84 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, 30 years of age or older at the Screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs of DED at the Screening and Baseline visits assessed by corneal staining and&#xD;
             Schirmer test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms of DED at both Screening and Baseline visits assessed by SANDE questionnaire&#xD;
             and ODS-VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BCVA 20/200 (+0.70 LogMAR) or better in both eyes at both the Screening and Baseline&#xD;
             visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of any ocular disorder or condition (other than DED) in either eye&#xD;

             (e.g. glaucoma, ocular hypertension), which may interfere with vision (e.g., cataract,&#xD;
             macular degeneration) or other disease which the investigator believes may interfere&#xD;
             with study findings or interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ocular surgery within 1 year prior to the Screening visit.&#xD;

             other prescription ophthalmic solution for DED, topical ocular corticosteroid- or&#xD;
             non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory agents, glaucoma medications or other&#xD;
             over-the-counter, herbal, prescription, any topical antibiotics, topical&#xD;

             may be permitted&#xD;

             change in dosage is anticipated during the study. Note: Non-ocular topically applied&#xD;
             corticosteroids (including nasal sprays and inhalers) will be permitted during the&#xD;
             study and the dose is not required to be stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of TrueTear® within 45 days of the Screening visit or anticipated use during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of lid heating therapy or Meibomian gland probing/therapeutic expression within 1&#xD;
             year prior to the Screening visit or anticipated during the study.&#xD;

             change in dosage is anticipated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
