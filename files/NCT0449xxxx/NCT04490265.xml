      Patients with chronic pain and moderate suicide risk (n=60) will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      remote-PST or remote-supportive psychotherapy. We will assess problem-solving deficits&#xD;
      through self-report, objective neuropsychological assessment and caregiver report. We have&#xD;
      used an adaptive design so that if there is strong evidence for target engagement, we will&#xD;
      continue with the trial as a fully powered clinical trial (i.e., the end of the current&#xD;
      proposal will act as the interim assessment) to the determine the efficacy of remote PST for&#xD;
      patients with chronic pain and moderate suicide risk (n=190) to improve suicide outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every day, 120 people die from suicide, that is one person every 15 minutes.1 Suicide&#xD;
      prevention treatments focus on those at highest risk and are primarily delivered as mental&#xD;
      health treatments,2-5 and yet 70% of patients with suicide risk do not attend mental health&#xD;
      treatment. Developing treatment for patients not served by existing suicide prevention&#xD;
      programs will improve access to care and is necessary to stop suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic pain in the US (100 million) have 2.6-times greater risk of suicide and&#xD;
      those on long-term opioid treatment are at even greater risk. Unfortunately, they often do&#xD;
      not receive mental health treatment and thus do not receive suicide prevention interventions.&#xD;
      They do receive frequent healthcare for their pain providing an unmet opportunity to&#xD;
      integrate suicide prevention into their treatment for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem-solving treatment (PST) is an evidence-based approach that is available where&#xD;
      patients want to receive treatment (e.g., primary care) and is efficacious for chronic pain.&#xD;
      Importantly, PST targets problem-solving deficits which are known to increase risk of&#xD;
      suicide, suggesting PST could be leveraged to reduce suicide risk. Deficits in&#xD;
      problem-solving (an executive function of finding solutions to difficult issues) directly&#xD;
      increase suicidal risk because they keep patients with active suicidal ideation from&#xD;
      generating solutions to their problems (e.g., chronic pain), other than through suicide.&#xD;
      Deficits in problem-solving also make it difficult to keep pain from impairing daily&#xD;
      activities and social relationships. This indirectly increases suicide risk because&#xD;
      impairment in daily activities increases feelings of burdensomeness and impairment in social&#xD;
      relationships increases feelings of not belonging. Feelings of burdensomeness and of not&#xD;
      belonging are key theoretical pathways to suicidal behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working with our clinical partners and patients, we developed a 12-week remote delivered PST&#xD;
      for patients with chronic pain and moderate suicidal risk. The treatment addresses deficits&#xD;
      in problem-solving by teaching patients strategies to address problems caused by chronic pain&#xD;
      that increase risk of suicide (e.g., impairment in daily activities leading to feelings of&#xD;
      burdensomeness). Our preliminary data suggests that PST is feasible, acceptable and may be&#xD;
      efficacious. In a national survey we found 56% of patients with chronic pain and suicide risk&#xD;
      were interested in problem-solving treatment. In a clinical pilot we were able to engage&#xD;
      Veterans with chronic pain and suicide risk with 75% completing the treatment. Finally, in a&#xD;
      clinical trial that randomized patients to 12 sessions of PST or 12 sessions of health&#xD;
      education, we found that patients with chronic pain and moderate suicide risk (n=21)&#xD;
      randomized to PST had a reduction in suicidal ideation and problem-solving deficits&#xD;
      (self-report) as compared to health education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the current proposal (R56) is to ensure PST is engaging problem-solving deficits.&#xD;
      Patients with chronic pain and moderate suicide risk (n=60) will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      remote-PST or remote-supportive psychotherapy. We will assess problem-solving deficits&#xD;
      through self-report, objective neuropsychological assessment and caregiver report. We have&#xD;
      used an adaptive design so that if there is strong evidence for target engagement, we will&#xD;
      continue with the trial as a fully powered clinical trial (i.e., the end of the current&#xD;
      proposal will act as the interim assessment) to the determine the efficacy of remote PST for&#xD;
      patients with chronic pain and moderate suicide risk (n=190) to improve suicide outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Estimate the effect of remote-delivered PST on targets. We hypothesize that PST&#xD;
      reduces our primary target, problem-solving deficits as assessed through (H1) self-report,&#xD;
      (H2) objective neuropsychological assessment, (H3) caregiver report, as compared to&#xD;
      supportive psychotherapy. We hypothesize that PST reduces our secondary targets (H1) feelings&#xD;
      of burdensomeness and (H2) feelings of not belonging, as compared to supportive&#xD;
      psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 2: Explore the effect size of PST as compared to supportive psychotherapy on&#xD;
      suicide outcomes (intensity of suicidal ideation, difficulties coping with suicidal ideation)&#xD;
      and chronic pain outcomes ((H4) chronic pain, (H5) pain related disability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous preliminary data suggests that PST is feasible, acceptable and may be&#xD;
      efficacious. The goal of the current proposal (R56) is to confirm PST is engaging&#xD;
      problem-solving deficits (measured through self-report and objective measures). Deliverable:&#xD;
      At the end of the proposed trial, we will have the necessary information (in combination with&#xD;
      our previous preliminary data) to inform a go/no-go decision on converting the current&#xD;
      proposal into a fully powered clinical trial.&#xD;

    <measure>Means End Problem-Solving Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Means End Problem-Solving Task consists of a series of scenarios, with each one identifying the beginning and end of a story. The subject's task is to come up with the middle of the story. Stories are scored according to how many steps to reaching the end the patient identifies. This instrument captures a crucial element of problem-solving: identifying the steps (i.e., means) that will lead to goal attainment (i.e., end). This aspect of problem-solving is directly relevant to patients with pain whose limited set of identified means includes suicide. An increase in effective means generated is expected to drive reduction in suicide ideation. The measure has been used in suicide research and has shown that suicide attempters generate fewer relevant means than both non-suicidal psychiatric controls and non-psychiatric controls. Scores range from 0-1 with higher=better problem-solving.</description>

    <description>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is the gold standard for suicide assessment and measures level and intensity of suicidal ideation, planning and preparation for suicidal behavior, and method and lethality of recent (past week) and past lifetime suicidal behavior. The intensity of ideation subscale (the summed score from five separate items on Part II; subscale range = 2-25) will be the primary dependent variable for the fully powered clinical trial. The intensity of ideation asks about the intensity of ideation in the past 6 months (e.g., the frequency, duration controllability). Higher scores are equal to greater ideation.</description>

    <description>Our PST is 12-weeks and teaches patients strategies to address real-life problems.20 Sessions are once a week for one hour except for the first session, which is two hours. The treatment has four main goals: 1. Safety planning; 2. Problem-orientation-addressing how patients approach problems; 3. Planful problem-solving or a logical approach to address problems; 4. Behavioral activation of daily activities. Patients are provided weekly worksheets on problem-solving and receive weekly assessment of emotional state and suicidal ideation monitoring.</description>

    <description>Our control will be supportive psychotherapy which will focus on discussing weekly stressors in a supportive, non-directive way. Session content is patient-driven, and sessions focus on emphasizing the patients' strengths, following patients' emotional affect, and building a therapeutic alliance. Participants will be asked to generate the topic they would like to discuss for the session and will complete a worksheet between sessions noting emotional events throughout their week (&quot;A time when I felt stressed was …&quot; ) in order to help identify experiences for discussion in session. Participants will be informed that the control condition is supportive and non-directive, and that providers will not engage in problem-solving. Providers will be taught to use reflective listening, clarification, empathy, and validation. The control consists of 12 weekly sessions delivered via telephone or video.</description>
