  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective, open-label, unicentric, phase IV clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is design to find new efficacy biomarkers for IKERVIS® (1mg/mL ciclosporin) eye&#xD;
      drops after 1 and 3 month after initiation of therapy. Additionally, this study intends to&#xD;
      investigate whether IKERVIS® will help patients to better overcome situations of desiccating&#xD;
      stress by exposing them to an adverse controlled environment (ACE) and analyzing both&#xD;
      clinical and molecular parameters.&#xD;
