  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The J(amaican and) U(nited) S(tates) Media? Programme is a culturally-tailored food-focused&#xD;
      media literacy preventive intervention designed to promote healthier eating habits among&#xD;
      remotely acculturating early adolescents and their mothers in Jamaica (i.e., they have&#xD;
      internalized American culture) and are exposed to U.S. food advertising. The JUS Media?&#xD;
      Programme consists of a 2-session face:face weekend workshop for adolescent-mother pairs&#xD;
      supplemented by 8 weeks of SMS/text messages to reinforce workshop themes. Adolescents and&#xD;
      their mothers learn critical thinking skills to combat the unhealthy food messages they&#xD;
      encounter in food advertising, particularly advertising on U.S. cable TV. The efficacy of the&#xD;
      JUS Media? Programme was evaluated with a small experimental study utilizing a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial design among adolescents and mothers in Jamaica.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Western diet is common in the United States and has a lot of salt, sugar, and fat. Modern&#xD;
      globalization has shifted eating habits in many countries toward this unhealthy Western diet.&#xD;
      For example, U.S. cable TV in other countries promotes this Western diet through&#xD;
      advertisements for junk foods and sugary drinks. This is a major concern because experimental&#xD;
      research studies show that seeing food advertising while watching TV leads to eating more&#xD;
      food afterwards. Research studies also show that people who watch a lot of TV tend to think&#xD;
      that junk food is not that harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers now believe that some people living outside the U.S. are drawn to the U.S.&#xD;
      culture and lifestyle and can become &quot;Americanized&quot; through a process called remote&#xD;
      acculturation. These Americanized people in other countries such as Jamaica are mostly&#xD;
      teenagers, but sometimes also adults. Americanized people outside the United States are even&#xD;
      more likely to adopt the unhealthy Western diet even though they have never lived in the&#xD;
      United States. In research the investigators did before getting this grant, they showed that&#xD;
      Americanized youth and mothers in Jamaica watched more hours of U.S. cable daily and also ate&#xD;
      more unhealthy food. This led them to develop a new healthy eating education program for&#xD;
      Americanized families in Jamaica that highlighted the role of U.S. media - the &quot;J(amaican)&#xD;
      U(nited) S(tates) Media? Programme&quot;. The JUS Media? Programme teaches young people and&#xD;
      mothers to question the health messages in food advertising on U.S. cable TV so that they can&#xD;
      be smarter and healthier consumers. For example, the JUS Media? Programme covers the&#xD;
      recommended food guidelines in Jamaica and teaches adolescents and their mothers the&#xD;
      principles of media literacy, such as to think about &quot;who is the source of this message?&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;what do they want you to do?&quot; and &quot;what information is missing?&quot;. Finally, the JUS Media?&#xD;
      Programme teaches participants to use these media literacy principles to challenge unhealthy&#xD;
      food advertisements by creating smart, funny parody versions called subvertisements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project,the investigators evaluated how well the JUS Media? Programme worked for 7th&#xD;
      graders and their mothers in Jamaica. About 30 adolescents and their mothers got a 2-session&#xD;
      workshop, another 30 families got the workshop and text messages, and another 30 families did&#xD;
      not get any part of the program.&#xD;

    <description>24-Hour Recall. Each participant reported detailed information on all foods and beverages consumed in the previous 24 hours via structured interviews with open-ended responses over the phone, and reported dietary intake was coded into coded for the presence (1) or absence (0) of fruits, raw vegetables, cooked vegetables, fats/oils, and sugary foods/beverages (aligning with the major national food groups of the population studied).</description>

    <time_frame>4 measurement points: baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 17-20 weeks (study ended at this final timepoint).</time_frame>
    <description>A stages of change measure of healthy eating (Wright et al., 2015) was adapted to measure participants' adherence to 5 additional food-based dietary guidelines of the Jamaica Ministry of Health. Participants reported their adherence to each dietary guideline using a 1-6 likert type scale ranging from 1 &quot;precontemplation stage (No, and I do not intend to [insert wording from guideline]...in the next 6 months&quot; to 6 &quot;total abstinence (I do not consume...[insert wording from guideline).&quot; Higher scores on this scale represent being closer to one's healthy eating goal.</description>

    <time_frame>4 measurement points: baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 17-20 weeks (study ended at this final timepoint).</time_frame>
    <description>Food-focused media literacy was measured with a 14-item scale (Powell &amp; Gross, 2018). Participants responded on a 4-point likert type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Higher scores on this scale represent higher food-focused media literacy.</description>
