  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disease characterized by increased levels of low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). It is underdiagnosed and undertreated despite&#xD;
      relatively high prevalence and significant association with increased mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients older than 18 years old and have a serum low density LDL-C≥250 mg/dL were identified&#xD;
      from the hospital database. A questionnaire was completed via phone. Patients were classified&#xD;
      as definite, probable and possible familial hypercholesterolemia according to Dutch Lipid&#xD;
      Clinical Network Criteria&#xD;

    <description>Patients with a serum LDL-C≥250 mg/dL were identified from the database of our hospital. Dutch Lipid Clinical Network Criteria was used to classify patients as definite, probable and possible FH. Patients were reached by phone and a questionnaire was applied. The questionnaire consisted of questions related with clinical and physical examination findings defined in theDutch Lipid Clinical Network Criteria. Total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglyceride levels were obtained from the medical records. Patients were asked whether they were using lipid lowering drugs. If they were not using, the cause of this was asked. By this way, we determined the rate of use of lipid lowering drugs in patients with LDL-C≥250 mg/dL and have definite, probable or possible familial hypercholesterolemia</description>
