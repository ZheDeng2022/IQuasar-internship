  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus has been declared a major public health issue. Among the complications of&#xD;
      the disease, retinopathy can have a significant impact on mobility and quality of life for&#xD;
      individuals living with diabetes. As the leading cause of new blindness in adults, diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy has been shown to affect 23% of all Type 1 and 14% of Type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      individuals. Various studies have reported that a number of components in the egg may&#xD;
      contribute to visual function and eye health. Specifically, i) egg yolk naturally contains,&#xD;
      and can be further enriched with the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin. Lutein and zeaxanthin&#xD;
      protect the retina against light induced retinal damage by acting as potent antioxidants that&#xD;
      shield the retina from harmful short-wave radiation. ii) eggs can also be enriched to provide&#xD;
      a vehicle for specific nutrients to promote eye health including omega-3 fatty acid,&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A substantial amount of DHA is uniquely found within the retina.&#xD;
      A DHA deficiency has shown to induce abnormal retina function indicating a constant supply of&#xD;
      this nutrient is necessary for retina health. Currently, the American Diabetes Association&#xD;
      declares that eggs are an excellent choice for people with diabetes, but information lacks on&#xD;
      the status of whole egg consumption in diabetic individuals in relation to their retinal&#xD;
      health. Therefore, the current study aims to determine if the consumption of two lutein and&#xD;
      DHA enriched eggs per day can safely improve the retina function of individuals with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 adult diabetic male and female participants will be recruited to take part in&#xD;
      this double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to include two DHA and lutein enriched eggs or regular eggs into their&#xD;
      usual diet for 6 weeks. At the beginning and end of the trial, a variety of measures will be&#xD;
      analyzed including blood lipid parameters, carotenoid status, anthropometrics, arterial&#xD;
      stiffness, advanced glycated end products, macular pigment optical density and&#xD;
      electroretinography. These measures will aid in determining whether enriched egg consumption&#xD;
      can safely improve retina function, while not adversely effecting body composition and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with diabetes. The results of this study will&#xD;
      contribute to the development of valuable prevention strategies for eye health in individuals&#xD;
      with diabetes, thereby improving their quality of life.&#xD;
