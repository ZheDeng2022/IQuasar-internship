  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee arthroplasty also known as the total knee replacement is an orthopedic surgical&#xD;
      procedure done to resurface the knee that has been severely damaged by arthritis. The optimal&#xD;
      goal of skin closure after the procedure is to promote rapid healing and an acceptable&#xD;
      cosmetic result while minimizing the risk of infection. Skin closure after knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      is done by using either of the two widely used sutures i.e. polypropylene (Prolene) sutures&#xD;
      or the skin staple sutures. The literature is very scarce on knee arthroplasty patients and&#xD;
      the results of the studies conducted have been inconclusive of the studies conducted on the&#xD;
      patients of knee arthroplasty. Moreover, there are no standard guidelines as to which type of&#xD;
      suture should be used. The type of sutures is being selected on the orders and wishes of the&#xD;
      surgeon at the time of skin closure. Prolene sutures are made up of a synthetic steroisomer&#xD;
      known as polypropylene. It is a monofilament non-absorbable, sterile surgical suture. They&#xD;
      are indicated for use in general soft tissue. It Provides permanent tensile strength&#xD;
      retention in tissue, even in the presence of infection. These sutures are exceptionally&#xD;
      smooth for an easy passage through the tissue. Prolene sutures are widely used in&#xD;
      cardiovascular, orthopedics, ophthalmic, and neurological surgical procedures. Another type&#xD;
      of sutures that are used to close the surgical wound are the staple sutures. They are used as&#xD;
      an alternative to the traditional Prolene sutures. They are non-absorbable and usually used&#xD;
      on surgical wounds that are big, complex or hard to close by using Prolene. These are&#xD;
      specialized staples made up of titanium, stainless steel or plastic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have 2 intervention arms. The patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      Prolene sutures for wound closure or staple sutures for wound closure. After the application&#xD;
      of the intervention, routine care would be given to the patients postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there is no difference in the incidence of surgical site&#xD;
      infection in bilateral TKR patients with wound closure by Prolene vs staple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as an open blinded, parallel design, equivalence randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. The patients would be randomized to receive either of the two interventions&#xD;
      i.e. Prolene or Staple sutures.&#xD;

      Study Enrollment Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be a continuous process with screening and enrolling eligible patients&#xD;
      admitted through the clinic electively for primary TKR. Informed consent will be taken from&#xD;
      the patient as per routine protocol before the arthroplasty procedures in the hospital.&#xD;
      Research objectives, methodology, risks, and benefits will be explained in detail. Consent&#xD;
      for the participation in the study will only be taken by the primary investigator at his&#xD;
      clinic or the surgical resident on call preoperatively along with the consent for the&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Randomization Evaluations Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening will involve the routine history taking and physical examination by the doctor&#xD;
      and nursing staff in the clinic. Screening won't involve performing procedures that are not&#xD;
      part of routine management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-study/on-intervention evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening and assessing the eligibility, patients will be randomly allocated by a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to the two intervention groups i.e. prolene or staple using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization sequence by the clinical trials unit (CTU), which they will provide to the PI,&#xD;
      after patients' admission in the hospital. Patients will be followed from the time they reach&#xD;
      the ward after surgery until their hospital discharge, which is usually around 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will be done by the surgical site infection (SSI) nurses from the&#xD;
      infection control department of AKUH. These nurses are well-trained to assess the surgical&#xD;
      site infections in all the surgery patients admitted to the hospital. Training of data&#xD;
      collectors will be done by the PI to ensure the reliability and validity of the study. The&#xD;
      data collectors will be strictly instructed to respect the autonomy of participants. Data&#xD;
      collection will be done by the data collectors under the supervision of the PI and CTU.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be checked for consistency and logical data entries. Data entry will be&#xD;
      done, and counter checked by the PI at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will be coded and kept confidential without the identifiable information of&#xD;
      patients. The confidentiality of the study participants will be maintained throughout the&#xD;
      study period. Data collected will be kept confidential without identifiable information of&#xD;
      patients who are identified by a number assigned. The hard copy forms will be retained in a&#xD;
      secured location with the PI after data entry into computer software and will be kept as per&#xD;
      hospital protocol. The password-protected drives will be used to store data with only the PI&#xD;
      having access to it. The data will be available for AKUH ethical review committee on request&#xD;
      and might be published in a journal without disclosing any identifiable information of&#xD;
      patients. Filled questionnaires will be stored for 5 years after the study is completed as&#xD;
      per the policy of the institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated via open epi software version 3.01. The level of significance&#xD;
      was kept at 5% with a power of 80%. The percentage of exposed (staple sutures) with outcome&#xD;
      (surgical site infection) was 66%. The percentage of non-exposed (Prolene sutures) with&#xD;
      outcome (surgical site infection) was 33%. The estimated risk ratio taken from a study was 2.&#xD;
      After adding the non-response rate of 10% the final sample size came out to be 82 patients&#xD;
      with 41 patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done by using STATA software version 15. The normality&#xD;
      assumption for the quantitative variables would be assessed using the shapiro wilk test. Mean&#xD;
      Â± SD will be computed for all the normally distributed quantitative variables. The median and&#xD;
      interquartile range would be reported for the non-normally distributed quantitative&#xD;
      variables. The categorical variables would be expressed in frequencies and percentages. The&#xD;
      Cox Proportional Hazard regression will be used for the univariate and multivariable&#xD;
      analysis. Univariate analysis will be conducted, and crude risk ratios and their 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be obtained. All significant independent variables at the&#xD;
      univariate stage will be regressed in a multivariable cox proportional hazard regression&#xD;
      using the stepwise method in the multivariable model and the adjusted risk ratios will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
