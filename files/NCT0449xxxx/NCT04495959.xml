  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in men. Most patients with&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer will be cured with surgery or radiation therapy, but up to 35% of&#xD;
      patients will have their prostate cancer return.Current conventional imaging modalities have&#xD;
      limitations particularly at low prostate specific antigen levels. This study proposes to use&#xD;
      Fluorine-18-DCFPyL (18F-DCFPyL) Dynamic Whole Body (DWB) Positron Emission Tomography /&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) scans which targets prostate-specific membrane antigens&#xD;
      (PSMA) to detect where in the body the prostate cancer has recurred.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective registry study to evaluate the diagnostic utility of 18F-DCFPyL DWB&#xD;
      PET/MRI to stage patients with high risk prostate cancer who will subsequently under go&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo a 18F-DCFPyL DWB PET/MRI at the University of British Columbia&#xD;
      (UBC) - Vancouver, Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health where the UBC PET/MRI is&#xD;
      located. Each subject will receive a 18F-DCFPyL PET/MRI DWB scan at the UBC centre, as part&#xD;
      of this research study. Each study subject will receive a bolus intravenous dose of&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL. The subject will be placed on the PET/MRI scanner for a dynamic whole body PET&#xD;
      scan. Then after a brief break off the scanner, they will return to the scanner for the&#xD;
      standard whole body PET/MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET/MRI scan will take approximately 3.5 hours of patient time above and beyond the time&#xD;
      needed for standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical History Questionnaire: Demographic and medical history data will be collected either&#xD;
      in person before the PET scan appointment or by mail or phone, whichever is the most&#xD;
      convenient to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments: All subjects will be contacted by phone the day after the injection of&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL. The subjects will be asked if they experienced any undesirable effects during the&#xD;
      12 hours after the administration of 18F-DCFPyL. The local site attending nuclear medicine&#xD;
      physician will then make an assessment as to whether these effects are likely related to&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed for 5 years following the 18F-DCFPyLPET/CT exam to assess the&#xD;
      presence of recurrence. The evaluation will include a chart review of available imaging,&#xD;
      laboratory tests, and treatment. The data required can be obtained from a review of the&#xD;
      patient's paper and electronic charts, supplemented by telephone contact as needed to&#xD;
      complete the information.&#xD;
