  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetic(PK) profile of pozelimab&#xD;
      produced by the original manufacturing process (Process A) compared to a second manufacturing&#xD;
      process (Process B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of a single SC dose of pozelimab produced by the 2&#xD;
           manufacturing processes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the immunogenicity of pozelimab produced by the 2 manufacturing processes&#xD;
