  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, investigators explored the role of the particles that carry &quot;bad&#xD;
      cholesterol&quot; in the blood (termed LDL) that are known to promote heart disease, in the&#xD;
      promotion of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans. In specific, they investigated how these&#xD;
      particles may induce the activation of an immune pathway in human fat tissue leading to&#xD;
      multiple anomalies that favors T2D. They also explored whether omega-3 fatty acids, which are&#xD;
      the type of fat found in fish oils can counterbalance the negative effects of LDL in fat&#xD;
      tissue, thus providing a natural way to help reduce the risk for T2D in subjects with&#xD;
      elevated blood LDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, 41 subjects who were free of disease or medication affecting metabolism were&#xD;
      enrolled at the Montreal Clinical Research Institute between 2013 and 2019 and were placed on&#xD;
      an intervention with omega-3 fatty acids supplementation for 12 weeks (2.7 g/day, Triple&#xD;
      Strength Omega-3 from Webbers Naturals). Investigators examined the effects of LDL and&#xD;
      omega-3 on risk factors for T2D before and after the intervention in the whole body and&#xD;
      specifically in fat tissue biopsies taken from the hip region. Eighty percent of the subjects&#xD;
      who were enrolled into the study completed the intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes-attributed deaths, mostly type 2 diabetes (T2D), total more than 40,000 per year,&#xD;
      out of which 80% are secondary to cardiovascular disease and stroke. Research from the&#xD;
      investigators' lab and others suggest that elevated atherogenic apoB-lipoproteins may not be&#xD;
      a mere consequence of T2D but also a cause. They reported that high number of&#xD;
      apoB-lipoproteins (apoB) may directly induce subcutaneous white adipose tissue dysfunction&#xD;
      and related risk factors for T2D in humans; however underlying mechanisms were yet unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strong evidence implicates a specific innate immunity complex, the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3&#xD;
      for Nucleotide-binding domain and Leucine-rich repeat Receptor, containing a Pyrin domain 3)&#xD;
      in white adipose tissue dysfunction and associated metabolic anomalies in mice and humans.&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence from the investigators lab and their collaborator (Dr Maya Saleh, at&#xD;
      McGill University) indicated that native apoB-lipoproteins activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in&#xD;
      murine bone marrow derived macrophages. On the other hand, omega-3 fatty acids were reported&#xD;
      to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the hypotheses that were examined in this study were that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects with high plasma apoB have higher NLRP3 inflammasome activity in white adipose&#xD;
           tissue indicated by higher interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Higher white adipose tissue IL-1β secretion was expected to be associated with risk&#xD;
           factors for T2D documented in subjects with high plasma apoB, namely white adipose&#xD;
           tissue dysfunction, systemic inflammation, postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, insulin&#xD;
           resistance and hyperinsulinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Twelve-week supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids (2.7 g/day, eicosapentaenoic acid&#xD;
           (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA), 2:1) induces a greater reduction in white adipose&#xD;
           tissue NLRP3 inflammasome activity and related risk factors for T2D in subjects with&#xD;
           high plasma apoB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subject native LDL (representing &gt; 90% of apoB-lipoproteins) directly prime and/or&#xD;
           activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in subject own white adipose tissue ex vivo, while&#xD;
           EPA/DHA inhibit it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-one subjects (34% men) were enrolled in the study, of whom 33 subjects completed the&#xD;
      12-week omega-3 intervention (drop out/exclusion rate = 20%). Baseline and post-intervention&#xD;
      risk factors for T2D measured in these subjects were; white adipose tissue and systemic NLRP3&#xD;
      inflammasome activity, dietary fat clearance (after a high fat meal), adipose tissue function&#xD;
      (ex vivo after a subcutaneous adipose tissue needle biopsy), and insulin secretion and&#xD;
      sensitivity (by gold-standard Botnia clamp technique).&#xD;
