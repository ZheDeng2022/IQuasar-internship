      This is an open label Phase 1, First in Human trial of TST001, a recombinant humanized&#xD;
      anti-Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) IgG1 monoclonal antibody. It is being tested against advanced&#xD;
      and/or metastatic solid tumors including but not limited to gastric cancer/gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction adenocarcinoma, pancreas cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, lung&#xD;
      cancer and ovarian carcinoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are two parts in the study. Part I is mono-therapy dose escalation and dose expansion&#xD;
      study, and Part II is dose escalation and dose expansion study of combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Mono-therapy dose escalation and dose expansion study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mono-therapy dose escalation regimen: The dose escalation study will be conducted using&#xD;
           3+3 dose escalation method at two dosing regimens, i.e.&quot;once every 2 weeks&#xD;
           (Q2W)&quot;and&quot;once every 3 weeks (Q3W)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mono-therapy dose expansion regimen: When the dose level in Q2W group in the&#xD;
           mono-therapy dose escalation study is escalated to the MTD/MAD/RP2D, two expansion&#xD;
           cohorts will be added at this dose level with about 30 (20-40) subjects with positive&#xD;
           CLDN18.2 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: TST001 RP2 DG/GEJ adenocarcinoma with positive CLDN18.2 expression 20-40 Group B:&#xD;
      TST001 RP2D Non-G/GEJ adenocarcinoma with positive CLDN18.2 expression 20-40&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Dose escalation and dose expansion study of combination medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation and dose expansion study will be conducted in the following two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C - first line: TST001+CAPOX Positive CLDN18.2 expression GEJ C 20-40 Group&#xD;
      D-second-line +: TST001+paclitaxel Positive CLDN18.2 expression G/GEJ 20-40&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will last approximately 3 years from the enrollment to the completion of both Par I&#xD;
      and II studies, sample size approximate 165-210 subjects，with assessments including safety&#xD;
      labs, ECGs, MUGA scans, PKs and PDs and CT/MRI tumor assessments, based on the Q2W and Q3W&#xD;
      dosing schedules.&#xD;
