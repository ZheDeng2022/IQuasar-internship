  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces myocardial ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      injury. This myocardial attack is a well-identified independent prognostic factor of&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality. The quantification of these myocardial lesions by the&#xD;
      postoperative plasma release of troponin has proven its diagnostic and prognostic value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can accurately measure and characterize the size of&#xD;
      myocardial lesions. These lesions are associated with a poor prognosis. MRI can also&#xD;
      characterize myocardial edema secondary to ischemia-reperfusion which has not yet been&#xD;
      studied in the context of CPB. It is therefore necessary, in a mechanistic approach, to&#xD;
      quantify the respective share of necrosis, edema and reperfusion lesions during cardiac&#xD;
      surgery under CPB in order to better understand these phenomena and to propose effective&#xD;
      strategies for the prevention of these myocardial lesions.the relationship between the&#xD;
      postoperative release of troponin and the amount of myocardial necrosis and edema measured by&#xD;
      cardiac MRI will be assessed.The hypothesis is to demonstrate a positive correlation between&#xD;
      imaging and biology in order to better understand the perioperative myocardial lesion&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an interventional study prospective, exploratory, in cardiac imaging, non-comparative&#xD;
      and single-center, including 30 patients.&#xD;
