  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radioactive iodine (RAI) is a radioisotope used to ablate thyroid gland remnant after&#xD;
      thyroidectomy in patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). A whole body&#xD;
      scan (WBS) is performed to not only evaluate for iodine uptake by the native thyroid tissue&#xD;
      but also to observe for uptake in other areas of the body, which could be physiological or&#xD;
      indicative of iodide-avid metastases. Research has shown a correlation between breast cancer&#xD;
      and thyroid cancer. Patients with DTC have been found to have elevated levels of serum&#xD;
      prolactin, which could lead to mammary gland dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with DTC undergoing RAI scanning or therapy, it has been previously observed that&#xD;
      patients prepared by thyroid hormone withdrawal have significantly higher breast uptake on&#xD;
      whole body scan compared to those prepared by rh-TSH. Considering the impact of prolactin on&#xD;
      breast tissue, this study aims to correlate these findings with the lab values and the method&#xD;
      of preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the research question is as follows: does the method of WBS preparation impact&#xD;
      prolactin levels and how does that correlate with breast uptake in patients with DTC&#xD;
      undergoing RAI WBS?&#xD;

      Radioactive iodine (RAI) is a radioisotope used to ablate thyroid gland remnant after&#xD;
      thyroidectomy in patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). A whole body&#xD;
      scan (WBS) is performed to not only evaluate for iodine uptake by the native thyroid tissue&#xD;
      but also to observe for uptake in other areas of the body, which could be physiological or&#xD;
      indicative of iodide-avid metastases. Research has shown a correlation between breast cancer&#xD;
      and thyroid cancer. Patients with DTC have been found to have elevated levels of serum&#xD;
      prolactin, which could lead to mammary gland dysfunction. As such, this study will evaluate&#xD;
      for breast uptake on the RAI WBS. Research has shown that patients with DTC may have uptake&#xD;
      on RAI WBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a concern in the molecular imaging community and oncology community that increased&#xD;
      I-131 retention in breast tissue may increase the risk of future breast malignancy. The&#xD;
      notion that increased serum prolactin concentration increases iodine uptake in breast tissue&#xD;
      comes mostly from case series. A correlation between high prolactin as a result of withdrawal&#xD;
      from thyroid hormone treatment vs stimulation by recombinant human thyrotropin and uptake by&#xD;
      thyroid tissue is the main research question. This research will not be able to answer the&#xD;
      question of whether such breast uptake is associated with the future risk breast malignancy.&#xD;
      The later research question should be undertaken by other researchers in a larger study with&#xD;
      longer follow up. Metastases to the breast from thyroid cancer are rare. Uptake in a discrete&#xD;
      lesion in the breast will need to be investigated. It is unclear whether breast&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma will concentrate iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous retrospective study of 194 patients with DTC and no breast cancer, it was&#xD;
      demonstrated that patients prepared by withdrawal from thyroid hormone had 5-fold higher peak&#xD;
      I-131 uptake in breast tissue on post-therapy scan compared to patients prepared by&#xD;
      recombinant human thyrotropin (rh-TSH). In other research, DTC patients with&#xD;
      hyperprolactinemia have been found to have increased uptake by the mammary gland. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that patients prepared by withdrawal would have increased serum prolactin&#xD;
      compared to patients prepared by rh-TSH who are not made hypothyroid. This study plans to&#xD;
      prospectively evaluate serum prolactin and breast uptake on the RAI WBS and assess the impact&#xD;
      of pre-scan preparation on those variables. This would be the first prospective study of its&#xD;
      kind in this set of patients to look at whether the method of pre-RAI scan preparation might&#xD;
      impact RAI uptake with correlation to prolactin levels.&#xD;
