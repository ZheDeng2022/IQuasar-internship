    <textblock>
      This study is a drug-drug interaction (DDI), pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability&#xD;
      study in adult healthy participants, including Japanese cohort. This study is designed to&#xD;
      assess co-administration of probe substrates with gepotidacin in study cohorts 1 to 3 and&#xD;
      establishing PK and safety in Japanese participants in cohort 4. Food effect will also be&#xD;
      evaluated in cohort 4.&#xD;

             participant with clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference&#xD;
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator feels&#xD;
             and documents that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and&#xD;
             will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional inclusion criteria for Japanese participants (Cohort 4): The participant is&#xD;
