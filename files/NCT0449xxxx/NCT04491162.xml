  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke has severe debilitating neurological consequences for the victim. Within context of&#xD;
      this study, gait disturbance is induced by disabilities in muscle weakness, abnormal muscle&#xD;
      contraction, or postural control. Gait disturbance has an unfavorable effect on functional&#xD;
      independence and prognosis of patients. Due to this reason, recovery in gait ability of&#xD;
      stroke patients is considered as a very important goal in rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) is a task-oriented technique for gait&#xD;
      restoration after stroke. The present study focused on the possibility of BWSTT as a special&#xD;
      program for improving gait ability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a BWSTT intervention useful as a short-term intensive program for chronic&#xD;
      stroke survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is thought to be a serious health problem which can cause severe disabilities. Aspects&#xD;
      of disabilities caused by stroke are various according to the affected region and its&#xD;
      severity. In general, sensory deficits, cognitive problem, motor impairment, visual&#xD;
      perceptual disorders and dysphagia mainly occur among stroke patients. In particular, gait&#xD;
      disturbance is induced by disabilities in muscle weakness, abnormal muscle contraction, or&#xD;
      postural control. This gait disturbance is exhibited as an asymmetric gait pattern, such as a&#xD;
      decrease in paretic side stance phase and non-paretic swing phase, cadence, velocity and&#xD;
      difference in step length and stride length. Therefore, these differences create abnormal&#xD;
      gait patterns in stroke patients. Furthermore, gait disturbance has an unfavorable effect on&#xD;
      functional independence and prognosis of patients. Due to this reason, recovery in gait&#xD;
      ability of stroke patients is considered as a very important goal in rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait performance is an indicator of mobility impairment and disability after stroke. It&#xD;
      predicts mortality, morbidity, and risk of future stroke. Gait speed is responsive to&#xD;
      short-term rehabilitation. An improvement in gait speed of 0.16 m/s can reduce the level of&#xD;
      assistance in patients with subacute stroke and was recommended to be the minimum clinically&#xD;
      significant difference. The control of gait involves the planning and execution from multiple&#xD;
      cortical areas, such as secondary and premotor cortex. Stroke patients often have gait&#xD;
      impairment such as decreased gait speed and asymmetrical gait cycle as a result of cortical&#xD;
      reorganization. Repetitive mass motor task practice had been shown to facilitate&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and brain reorganization in stroke patients, resulting in enhanced motor&#xD;
      recovery after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) is a task-oriented technique for gait&#xD;
      restoration after stroke. BWSTT has the advantage over conventional therapy as it offers&#xD;
      higher intensity, more repetitive and task-oriented practice over the same period of time&#xD;
      when compared to conventional therapy. Several studies have showed that BWSTT was more&#xD;
      effective in gait speed improvement than regular physiotherapy. It has been demonstrated that&#xD;
      BWSTT induces changes in corticomotor excitability which lead to improved balance and gait&#xD;
      performance with chronic stroke. However, other studies have reported that BWSTT was not&#xD;
      superior to conventional gait training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have reported that BWSTT can increase walking endurance in the subacute stage&#xD;
      after stroke, but no improvement was reported in balance and 10 m gait speed. To date, there&#xD;
      are very few studies that have used gait analysis to show how the improvements in gait&#xD;
      parameters come about after BWSTT or conventional therapy. There is still a lack of basic&#xD;
      understanding of gait training on human locomotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite substantial recovery of independent ambulation by survivors following unilateral&#xD;
      stroke, persistent gait abnormalities are observed in a large percentage of these persons. In&#xD;
      these circumstances, a short-term intermittent and intensive rehabilitation program for&#xD;
      chronic stroke survivors is thought to be particularly efficient for shoring up their&#xD;
      independence, and the present study focused on the possibility of BWSTT as a special program&#xD;
      for improving gait ability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      BWSTT intervention useful as a short-term intensive program for chronic stroke survivors.&#xD;

    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance.&#xD;
It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>
