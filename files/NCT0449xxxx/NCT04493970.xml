      This study will help to provide better input to state health and education departments to&#xD;
      improve the processes for CPR education. This will also help the EP council explore the&#xD;
      opportunities to partner with other professional societies and other stake holders that have&#xD;
      interest in this topic. Engagement of private-public partnerships for improving overall CPR&#xD;
      education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schools should incorporate CPR education programs in the schools that will increase the&#xD;
      knowledge, skills and awareness among high school children. It is important to note that, CPR&#xD;
      training of young children, increases the self confidence, esteem, responsibility and&#xD;
      contribution to their community.Moreover, it is clearly shown that, high school children has&#xD;
      the required physical strength, maturity and positive attitude towards performing CPR in&#xD;
      family members, friends and strangers in the community. Although some studies suggest benefit&#xD;
      of periodic retraining, few studies have attempted to collectively identify contributing&#xD;
      factors to comprehension.It is an attempt to identify national distribution of training&#xD;
      efforts and factors implicated in comprehension among high school students.&#xD;
