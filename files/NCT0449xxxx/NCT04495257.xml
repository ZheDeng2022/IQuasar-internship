    <textblock>
      This trial is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of APX005M in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. The study will enroll patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors (melanoma, RCC) to determine the recommended phase II dosing (RP2D) of APX005M in&#xD;
      combination with ipilimumab 1mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg (IPI1 NIVO3) every 3 weeks for four&#xD;
      cycles followed by APX005M in combination with nivolumab 360mg every 3 weeks. APX005M will be&#xD;
      administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg every 3 weeks in Dose Level 1 (DL1) and escalated to 0.3&#xD;
      mg/kg every 3 weeks in Dose Level 2 (DL2) (Table 1). The IPI1 NIVO3 regimen is approved for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APX005M is a humanized IgG1 agonistic monoclonal antibody that binds CD40. Nivolumab is a&#xD;
      humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1. Ipilimumab is a humanized IgG1κ&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody directed against CTLA-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of APX005M in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
           ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended RP2D of APX005M in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
           ipilimumab in patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Determine rate and pattern of AEs in patients treated with APX005M in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab&#xD;

    <description>The safety and tolerability of APX005M in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab will be assessed by monitoring the of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) . This will be defined by both DLTs and any of the following AEs (graded by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v5.0) which occur during the first 9 weeks of ipilimumab + nivolumab + APX005M administration that is not clearly due to a cause other than study medication. DLTs in this study do not include reversible grade 3-4 irAEs, that are acceptable and expected with treatment regimens containing ipilimumab and nivolumab, but do include severe, irreversible, non-endocrine adverse events</description>

    <description>This outcome will determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of APX005M in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The RP2D will be defined as a triplet regimen that does not exceed a grade 3-4 irAE rate of approximately 55% or lead to a significant increase in dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) specific to an ipilimumab + nivolumab containing regimen, particularly those which are severe, irreversible, and non-endocrine related events.</description>

             must be completed at least 1 week prior to study Day 1. Radiation to the brain must be&#xD;
             completed within 4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. There is no time&#xD;
             restriction prior to study Day 1 for patients who have received radiation to bone,&#xD;
             soft tissue or other sites. No radiopharmaceuticals (strontium, samarium) within 8&#xD;
             weeks before first dose of study drug administration.&#xD;

             therapy for advanced disease. Prior immune checkpoint inhibitors as adjuvant therapy&#xD;
             is allowed provided at least 6 months have lapsed from the last dose. Prior targeted&#xD;
             therapy is allowed as long as 2 weeks have passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Use of corticosteroids to control immune related adverse events at enrollment will&#xD;
             not be allowed, and patients who previously required corticosteroids for symptom&#xD;
             control must be off steroids for at least 2 weeks. Low-dose steroid use (≤10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent) as corticosteroid replacement therapy for primary or&#xD;
             secondary adrenal insufficiency is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to prior&#xD;
             treatments with the exceptions such as alopecia listed in Table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. History of grade 3-4 neurologic or cardiac toxicity or life-threatening liver&#xD;
             toxicity poorly responsive to steroids with prior anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy in the&#xD;

&#xD;
             6. Presence of leptomeningeal disease. 7. Has active autoimmune disease unrelated to&#xD;
             use of immune checkpoint inhibitors that has required systemic treatment in the past&#xD;
             year (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with nivolumab, ipilimumab or&#xD;
             APX005M, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this trial.&#xD;

             10. Either a concurrent condition (including medical illness, such as active infection&#xD;
             requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics or the presence of laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities) or history of a prior condition that places the patient at unacceptable&#xD;
             risk if he/she were treated with the study drug or a medical condition that confounds&#xD;
             the ability to interpret data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. Concurrent, active malignancies in addition to those being studied (other than&#xD;
             cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
             12. Active (non-infectious) pneumonitis. 13. Has a known Human Immunodeficiency Virus&#xD;
             (HIV), Hepatitis B (HBV), or Hepatitis C (HCV) acute or chronic infection.&#xD;
