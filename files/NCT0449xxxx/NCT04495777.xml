      Purpose: To determine the prevalence of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in female&#xD;
      healthcare students and to assess its association with oral parafunctions, neck pain and&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Female medical students will be included in the study on a voluntary basis using&#xD;
      stratified sampling method according to the department they were being educated. The presence&#xD;
      and severity of TMD will be assessed with the Fonseca's Anamnestic Index (FAI). The oral&#xD;
      parafunctions will be self-reported with the Oral Behavior Checklist (OBC). The neck pain and&#xD;
      function will be recorded with the Core Outcome Measure Index (COMI). A Chi-square test and&#xD;
      Spearman correlation analysis will used for statistical analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) has a multifactorial etiology related to parafunctional&#xD;
      habits, emotional and psychological factors, trauma, posture, other musculoskeletal, or&#xD;
      rheumatic disorders (1). Symptoms of TMD may include temporomandibular joint pain and clicks,&#xD;
      headache, myofascial pain, decreased mandibular range of motion, masticatory muscle fatigue,&#xD;
      limitation of mouth opening, pain when chewing, tinnitus, neuralgias, and bruxism (1,2). The&#xD;
      severity of symptoms is related to the age and gender of the patients. Women showed a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of TMD symptoms, with proportions varying from two to six women for each man,&#xD;
      usually with ages between 20 and 40 years3. The distribution of age and gender in TMD,&#xD;
      suggests a possible link between its pathogenesis and the female sex hormone, the estrogen,&#xD;
      or between TMD and the mechanisms of pain modulation, as women show more sensitivity to most&#xD;
      of the pain modalities (3,4) Epidemiologic studies showed that TMD prevalence in the students&#xD;
      ranges from 50% to 77% (5-7). Several studies reported that a higher prevalence of TMD ranges&#xD;
      from 47% to 81% in the Turkish student population (8-13). However, in some cases especially&#xD;
      in students, the presence of TMD is asymptomatic. Therefore, the diagnosis of early symptoms&#xD;
      and signs of TMD is crucial in preventing or minimizing TMD signs and symptoms (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parafunctional habits such as bruxism, tooth clenching, gum chewing, biting foreign objects,&#xD;
      and prolonged nail-biting might increase the risk of developing TMD (14). Even there are&#xD;
      several studies examining the association of TMD and oral parafunctions in students (15-17);&#xD;
      still, more studies are need to identify which oral behaviors cause TMD patients and healthy&#xD;
      populations (18). Therefore, understanding the TMD symptoms in association with the oral&#xD;
      parafunctions could provide different perspectives and an efficient treatment program (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there is no study about TMD prevalence in female healthcare students and&#xD;
      its association with oral parafunctions, neck pain, and function. The aims of this&#xD;
      cross-sectional study were: (1) to evaluate the prevalence of TMD in female healthcare&#xD;
      students and (2) to determine the association of TMD severity with oral parafunctional&#xD;
      habits, neck pain and function.&#xD;

    <description>Fonseca Anamnestic Index was developed to assess the severity of temporomandibular disorders, based on its signs and symptoms. It has been proposed as a low cost and easy to apply alternative and has been used in screening for TMD in a non-patient population5. It was created with 10 items with 3 options of answers (specific scores): &quot;yes (10 points)&quot;, &quot;sometimes (5 points)&quot; and &quot;no (0 points)&quot;. The final score of the instrument is determined by the sum of the scores of all items, allowing the following classifications: the absence of signs and symptoms of TMD (0-15 points), mild TMD (20-45 points), moderate TMD (50-65 points), and severe TMD (70-100 points) (19).</description>

    <description>Oral behaviors checklist is a self-report questionnaire for determining the frequency of oral parafunctional behaviors which are any abnormal behavior or functioning of the oral structures and associated muscles in the past one month. Original questionnaire consists of 21items, 2 items for oral behaviors during sleep, and 19 items for oral behaviors during waking hours. In this study the questionnaire was modified and two of the questions were exctracted due to study of Hayek et al25. Each item is scored from 0-4 based on the frequency of activity performed: a score of 0=none of the time; a score of 1=a little of the time; a score of 2=some of the time; a score of 3=most of the time and score of 4=all the time; with a range of 0-76 18.The sum of scoring had the following scheme: none = 0, low = 1-16, and high = 17-76 (20).</description>

    <description>The COMI-neck is a short, self-administered outcome instrument consisting of just seven items to evaluate the five dimensions pain, neck-related function, symptom-specific well-being, general quality of life, and disability (social and work) (21,22). The two pain items use a 0-10 graphic rating scale; all other items use a 5-point adjective scale. For COMI summary score, each of the domain scores is transformed to a 0-10 scale and these are then averaged to give a score ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse status (23).</description>
