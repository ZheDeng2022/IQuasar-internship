      The study included all patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the district hospital&#xD;
      and sent to the angiographic Department for diagnosis and performance of PCI with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of NSTEMI, including myocardial infarction (mi) and unstable angina, determined by clinical&#xD;
      data, ECG signs and laboratory indicators. Data from patients living in the Sergiev Posad&#xD;
      municipal district will be analyzed in order to achieve maximum registration of adverse&#xD;
      events during one year of follow-up.&#xD;

      Objective: to investigate the problem of incomplete myocardial revascularization in&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with acute coronary syndrome without St&#xD;
      segment elevation who were admitted to the angiographic Department of the Sergiev Posad city&#xD;
      hospital in the Moscow region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include all patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the regional&#xD;
      hospital and sent to the angiographic Department for diagnosis and performance of PCI with&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome NSTEMI, including myocardial infarction (mi) and unstable angina,&#xD;
      determined by clinical data, ECG signs and laboratory indicators. Anamnestic, clinical,&#xD;
      biochemical indicators, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbid index that determines the&#xD;
      course of acute coronary syndrome and prognosis (grace), a number of angiographic data,&#xD;
      including the number of affected arteries and variants of the index &quot;syntax score 50&quot; and&#xD;
      modified &quot;syntax score 30&quot;, &quot;syntax score 70&quot; and&quot; syntax score 90&quot; to separate complete and&#xD;
      incomplete revascularization, an integral indicator of the quality of the remaining index&#xD;
      Syntex, the absolute value of which is corrected during data analysis. The data of patients&#xD;
      living in the city of Sergiev Posad will be reviewed in such a way as to minimize the&#xD;
      subsequent year of follow-up, using a telephone survey and the EMIAS electronic system&#xD;

        All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit of the district hospital from&#xD;
        November 2018 to February 2019 and sent to the angiographic Department for diagnosis and&#xD;
        performance of PCI with a diagnosis of NSTEMI, including myocardial infarction (mi) and&#xD;
