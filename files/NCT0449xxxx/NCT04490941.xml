  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy affects over one third of all people with diabetes and is one of the&#xD;
      leading causes of vision loss. The management of diabetes and its complications should&#xD;
      include screening for diabetic retinopathy. A randomised trial is therefore needed of the use&#xD;
      of a simple and widely practicable approach to explore the integration of eye care in&#xD;
      managing diabetes. The trial is designed as a randomised, controlled, superiority trial. The&#xD;
      aim is to explore the effectiveness of ophthalmologist-delivered health education on top of&#xD;
      routine community care on blood glucose and eye-related clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients at risk for diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a highly specific vascular complication of diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      with prevalence strongly related to a number of risk factors including the duration of&#xD;
      diabetes, the level of glycaemic control, etc. Diabetic retinopathy affects over one third of&#xD;
      all people with diabetes and is one of the leading causes of vision loss. It is recommended&#xD;
      that optimising glycaemic control could reduce the risk or slow the progression of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy, and that the management of diabetes and its complications should include&#xD;
      screening for diabetic retinopathy. A randomised trial is therefore needed of the use of a&#xD;
      simple and widely practicable approach to explore the integration of eye care in managing&#xD;
      diabetes. The trial is designed as a randomised, controlled, superiority trial. The aim is to&#xD;
      explore the effectiveness of ophthalmologist-delivered health education on top of routine&#xD;
      community care on blood glucose and eye-related clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients&#xD;
      at risk for diabetic retinopathy. Participants will be randomly assigned to either control or&#xD;
      intervention group with a 1:1 allocation as per computer-generated random numbers. A senior&#xD;
      onsite manager will monitor participant enrolment over the course of the study. An&#xD;
      ophthalmologist-delivered health education will be offered as the intervention in an&#xD;
      individualised, face-to-face counselling session to build awareness on diabetes symptoms,&#xD;
      particularly on diabetic retinopathy, and its risk factors with appropriate management. All&#xD;
      subjects, regardless of the group allocation, will be followed up for 12 months. Baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up profiles will be assessed and collected by clinical personnel blind to group&#xD;
      allocation. The intervention arm will be compared against the control for all primary&#xD;
      analysis. The study was partly supported by the Open Research Funds of the State Key&#xD;
      Laboratory of Ophthalmology. Trial results will be disseminated to key stakeholders and the&#xD;
      general medical community.&#xD;
