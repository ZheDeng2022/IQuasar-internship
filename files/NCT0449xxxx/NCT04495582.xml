  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is conducting follow-up surveillance for the incidence of adverse events&#xD;
      and efficacy of subjects participated in phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CS10BR05) in subjects&#xD;
      with Multiple System Atrophy until 60 months from administering investigational product (IP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system which is&#xD;
      accompanied by signs of autonomic imbalance (orthostatic hypotension, urinary problems and&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction), Parkinson's symptoms (movement decreases and limb tremors) and&#xD;
      cerebellar ataxia symptoms (grogginess and incorrect pronunciation). It shows signs similar&#xD;
      to Parkinson's disease, however, it doesn't show improvement of symptoms by dopaminergic&#xD;
      drugs and occurs at any age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is conducting follow-up surveillance for the incidence of adverse events and&#xD;
      efficacy of subjects participated in phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CS10BR05) in subjects with Multiple&#xD;
      System Atrophy until 60 months from administering investigational product (IP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because it is the following observational study for subjects participated in phase 1 trial,&#xD;
      there is no additional administration of the investigational product in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subjects who participated in phase 1 trial voluntarily consent in writing to take part&#xD;
      in this observational study, the subjects visit the institution according to the protocol&#xD;
      that designed the follow-up visits every 3 months (Visit 1, Visit 2) until 6 months from&#xD;
      administration of investigational product and since then 6 months later (Visit 3), every 12&#xD;
      months (Visit 4~7) to observe the incidence of adverse events and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of evaluating severity of AE divided into subjective, objective in accordance&#xD;
      with the CTCAE (Version 4.0) standards.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse events(AE): After the completion of the CS10BR05-MSA101 phase 1 trial, new adverse events, including tumor are assessed and detailed information is collected at each visit. Whole body PET test is performed for tumor observation at visit 7.&#xD;
Laboratory test: The following laboratory tests are performed at each visit.&#xD;
Hematology test: WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelets count, WBC Diffcount&#xD;
Chemistry test: Na, K, Ca, Cl, BUN, Creatinine, Uric acid, Total bilirubin, Albumin, Total protein, Creatine Kinase, Cystatin-C, ALT, AST, r-GT, ALP, LDH, Glucose, Total cholesterol, Triglyceride&#xD;
Urine test: Protein, Glucose, Urobilinogen, WBC, RBC&#xD;
Measuring vital signs (blood pressure in mmHg, heart rate in bpm, body temperature in Celsius) is performed at each visit.&#xD;
Physical examination is performed at each visit. If clinically significant abnormal findings are recorded in the CRF and collected as AEs.</description>
