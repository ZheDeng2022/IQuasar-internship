  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a hereditary ataxia whose ancestral mutation&#xD;
      occurred in East Asia. The mutation is likely to have migrated during peopling of American&#xD;
      continents from East Asia. We found a specific rare DNA variation associated with SCA10. We&#xD;
      test whether this variation played a key role in the birth and subsequent spreading of SCA10&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a rare ataxic disorder due to a large expansion of&#xD;
      intronic (ATTCT)n repeat in ATXN10. SCA10 afflicts primarily Latin American (LA) populations&#xD;
      of Native American Ancestry; recent discoveries of two East Asian (EA) SCA10 families&#xD;
      suggests an Asian origin. SCA10 families from LA and EA share an ancestral haplotype that&#xD;
      includes the G allele (allele frequency: 2-4% in EA and LA populations but 0% elsewhere) of a&#xD;
      C/G/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at rs41524745&#xD;
      (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs41524547#frequency_tab). Two characteristics suggest that&#xD;
      rs41524745 has a functional role over the expansion: this SNP resides in the sequence&#xD;
      encoding miR4762; and total linkage between the SNP and the SCA10 repeat, although they are&#xD;
      ~35kb apart, a distance sufficient for multiple recombination events within the 15,000-20,000&#xD;
      years since human migration across Bering landmass. We studied DNA samples with G allele at&#xD;
      rs41524547 from the 1000 Genomes repository and our own samples from general populations and&#xD;
      surprisingly found 0-25% of these G(+) samples have SCA10 repeat expansions. Since our&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype data suggest that SCA10 expansions with (ATTCC)n or (ATCCT)n(ATCCC)n&#xD;
      repeat insertion in the 3' end of (ATTCT)n expansion exhibit full penetrance while pure&#xD;
      (ATTCT)n expansion has reduced penetrance, the last one can be more common than previously&#xD;
      expected. Hypotheses: (1) the G allele at rs41524547 predisposes the SCA10 (ATTCT)n repeat&#xD;
      for expansion (Type A expansion), that remains mostly non-penetrant, and (2) the&#xD;
      (ATTCT)n-(ATTCC)n (Type B) or (ATTCT)n(ATCCT)n-(ATCCC)n (Type C) repeat drives the SCA10&#xD;
      pathogenicity. To test the hypothesis, we propose three Aims in close collaborations between&#xD;
      US and Brazilian SCA10 consortia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine the relationship between SCA10 and the G allele at rs41524547.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To confirm that Type B and Type C expansions are pathogenic, but Type A expansions&#xD;
      have significantly reduced pathogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To determine if the G allele at rs41524547 reduces downstream recombination rates,&#xD;
      protects against the toxicity of SCA10 RNA expansions, or promote expanded states of the&#xD;
      SCA10 repeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This effort will enable long term goals to: (1) identify people at risk for SCA10 by&#xD;
      high-throughput screening of general populations for the G allele at rs41524547 in Brazil,&#xD;
      (2) determine the frequency of non-penetrant SCA10 expansion alleles in Brazil, and (3)&#xD;
      develop treatments of SCA10 based on results of this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project requires complimentary expertise in multiple areas, including&#xD;
      coordination of the clinical studies, along with recruitment plans and executions, management&#xD;
      of tissue repository, maintenance and expansion of the clinical database, clinical MR&#xD;
      technology and data analyses, which will be ongoing in both the US and Brazil.&#xD;

    <measure>Examine the disease progression in SCA10 as determined by change in the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia score compared to healthy controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit 1, Follow up visit (12-18 months after visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) was evaluated in two large validation trials performed by the EUROSCA clinical group and was found to be easy to use, reliable and valid. SARA has eight categories with accumulative score ranging from 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most severe ataxia).</description>

    <measure>Examine the disease progression in SCA10 as determined by change in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index score compared to healthy controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit 1, Follow up visit (12-18 months after visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index (SCAFI) is composed of:&#xD;
Timed 8 meter walk at maximum speed (8MW). Times are only given for two successfully completed trials. Discontinue the test if participant cannot complete trial in 3 minutes (more severe ataxia).&#xD;
Timed dexterity test: 9-hole peg test (9HPT). Times are only given for two successfully completed trials for each hand. If participant cannot complete one trial in 5 minutes (more severe ataxia) discontinue 9-hole-peg test.&#xD;
Timed speech test: PATA rate, a measure of speech performance. The participant is asked to repeat &quot;PATA&quot; as quickly and distinctly as possible for 10 seconds until told to stop. As soon as the participant begins speaking, start timer and begin counting the number of PATA repeats. Higher number (less dysarthria), lower number (more dysarthria). Discontinue if PATA articulation is too difficult to distinguish for counting or if participant cannot complete 10 seconds for two consecutive trials.</description>

    <measure>Examine the disease progression in SCA10 as determined by change in Composite Cerebellar Functional Severity Score compared to healthy controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit 1, Follow up visit (12-18 months after visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The Composite Cerebellar Functional Severity (CCFS) score is a quantitative tool to measure cerebellar severity independently from age. It is an assessment in addition to a clinical examination and has demonstrated its usefulness in epidemiological studies, clinical trials, and patient follow-up that only take 5 minutes to be administrated. The CCFS is a combination of the time to perform 2 tasks; a 9-hole pegboard and a click test. It was validated in adults and children. CCFS scores range from 0.50 (normal/no ataxia) to 1.80 (more severe ataxia).</description>

    <measure>Examine the disease progression in SCA10 as determined by change in Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia compared to healthy controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit 1, Follow up visit (12-18 months after visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA) scale is based on the standardized neurological examination, and consists of 18 items that yield a total score ranging from 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most severe ataxia). The NESSCA is a comprehensive measure of disease severity that was shown to be both clinically useful and scientifically valid.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Examine the disease progression in SCA10 as determined by change in Inventory of Non-ataxia Symptoms score compared to healthy controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit 1, Follow up visit (12-18 months after visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The Inventory of Non-ataxia Symptoms (INAS) is a scale utilized in recording the occurrence of accompanying non-ataxia symptoms. In the SARA validation trials, INAS was applied to a large number of SCA patients. For a semiquantitative assessment of non-ataxia signs, the number of non-ataxia signs is counted yielding the INAS count, a dimensionless value with a range from 0 (no ataxia) to 16 (most severe ataxia). To determine the INAS count, only the presence or absence of one of the 16 signs is considered. Statistical evaluation showed good reliability.</description>

    <measure>Examine the disease progression in SCA10 as determined by change in Beck Depression Inventory score compared to healthy controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit 1, Follow up visit (12-18 months after visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. Answers can range from 0 to 3 for each item. The total score will range from 0 (considered normal) to 40 (extreme depression).</description>

    <measure>Examine the disease progression in SCA10 as determined by change in Europe Quality of Life-5 Dimension score compared to healthy controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit 1, Follow up visit (12-18 months after visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The Europe Quality of Life-5 Dimension (Euro Qol-5D or EQ-5D), is a measure developed by the EuroQol Group that generates a single index value for health status with considerable potential for use in health care evaluation.The EQ-5D descriptive system is a preference-based HRQL measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The answers given to ED-5D permit to find 243 unique health states or can be converted into EQ-5D index an utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>
