  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurological-developmental evaluations and developmental outcomes-diagnoses of premature&#xD;
      babies are evaluated according to corrected postnatal age. Based on the limited evidence&#xD;
      available, it can be concluded that complementary feeding may be an appropriate age for most&#xD;
      premature babies who have reached at least the third month, generally corrected. However, for&#xD;
      premature babies born at different gestational weeks, these periods have a relatively&#xD;
      different meaning. A more accurate timeframe can be found in terms of complementary nutrition&#xD;
      by evaluating chronological age and motor development together. More prospective&#xD;
      observational studies are needed in this regard in premature babies. In the literature, there&#xD;
      are not enough studies on the transition time to the most appropriate complementary diet for&#xD;
      premature babies. The investigators planned to do this prospective observational study. In&#xD;
      this study, patient groups will be randomly selected after appropriate matching. Premature&#xD;
      babies participating in the study will be handled in three main groups (six subgroups in&#xD;
      total). The data will be added to the case report forms. In addition to routine follow-ups,&#xD;
      families will be called on the phone monthly, information about their babies' nutrition will&#xD;
      be asked, whether there is a problem, questions of families will be answered, and information&#xD;
      about complementary nutrition will be provided. At the end of the study, all data will be&#xD;
      collected and entered into the SPSS database, which will be created.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The transition to complementary feeding in premature babies (37 weeks and over) is&#xD;
      recommended by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Gastroenterology,&#xD;
      Hepatology and Nutrition Association (ESPHGAN) for 4-6 months. However, a full consensus on&#xD;
      the transition time to complementary feeding has not been achieved for premature babies. It&#xD;
      is controversial whether premature babies (born 37th week of gestation) are corrected for&#xD;
      complementary feeding in the sixth month or chronological sixth month. According to the&#xD;
      known, there are no clinical studies investigating this topic in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological-developmental evaluations and developmental outcomes-diagnoses of premature&#xD;
      babies are evaluated according to corrected postnatal age. Based on the limited evidence&#xD;
      available, it can be concluded that complementary feeding may be an appropriate age for most&#xD;
      premature babies who have reached at least the third month, generally corrected. However, for&#xD;
      premature babies born at different gestational weeks, these periods have a relatively&#xD;
      different meaning. A more accurate timeframe can be found in terms of complementary nutrition&#xD;
      by evaluating chronological age and motor development together. More prospective&#xD;
      observational studies are needed in this regard in premature babies. In the literature, there&#xD;
      are not enough studies on the transition time to the most appropriate complementary diet for&#xD;
      premature babies. The investigators planned to do this prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patient groups will be randomly selected after appropriate matching. Premature&#xD;
      babies participating in the study will be handled in three main groups (six subgroups in&#xD;
      total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the transition to complementary nutrition of the groups included in the study, breast&#xD;
      milk and / or formula food, nutritional supplement (such as breast milk enhancer, protein&#xD;
      supplement) intake will be recorded. The same polyvitamin preparation will be used for all&#xD;
      premature babies. In accordance with the recommendation of the World Health Organization, 2&#xD;
      mg / kg / day standard oral iron prophylaxis will be started to all premature babies starting&#xD;
      from the second chronological month. Immunization will be done in accordance with the&#xD;
      national vaccination program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be added to the case report forms. In addition to routine follow-ups, families&#xD;
      will be called on the phone monthly, information about their babies' nutrition will be asked,&#xD;
      whether there is a problem, questions of families will be answered, and information about&#xD;
      complementary nutrition will be provided. At the end of the study, all data will be collected&#xD;
      and entered into the SPSS database, which will be created.&#xD;
