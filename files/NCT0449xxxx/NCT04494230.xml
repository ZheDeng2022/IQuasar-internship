      Parent Form were filled by the parents of children in the research and control groups for&#xD;
      quality of life. In the study, there are five groups: ADHD, ADHD + Specific learning&#xD;

      In this study, aged 6-10 years, male, right hand dominant, diagnosed with ADHD, accepting to&#xD;
      take part in the study and applying to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department between&#xD;
      October 1, 2018 - October 1, 2019 were included in the research group. A total of 106&#xD;
      children with head trauma or known neurological disease, clinically diagnosed as comorbid tic&#xD;
      disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorder, mood disorder, conduct disorder,&#xD;
      mental retardation, or autism spectrum disorder, or children previously excluded from&#xD;
      physical therapy program were evaluated according to the research method. As for the control&#xD;
      group; 30 boys between 6-10 years of age with no mental symptoms described by their teachers&#xD;
      or parents and showing healthy development were selected by convenience sampling method and&#xD;
      snow ball methodHeight and weight measurements of all the children participated in the study&#xD;
      were performed. The sociodemographic data form prepared by the researchers was completed by&#xD;
      both the research and the control group families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the sample, the Corners' Parent Scale- Revised Short Form (CPS-R:SF) was used to evaluate&#xD;
      the severity of ADHD symptoms (Conners, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hand preferences of all participants in the research and control groups were evaluated&#xD;
      with Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor skills were evaluated with the 2nd Version of Bruininsky-Oseretsky Motor Competence&#xD;
      Test (BOT-2). It is a standard test commonly used by physiotherapists to detect coarse and&#xD;
      fine motor problems in children aged 4-21 years. It has both short and long form. The short&#xD;
      form was used in our study. The short form of BOT-2 consists of 8 subtests: fine motor&#xD;
      precision, fine motor integration, manual dexterity, bilateral coordination, balance, speed&#xD;
      of movement and agility, upper extremity coordination and strength. Not only can the score of&#xD;
      each subtest of the test be calculated separately but it can also be calculated as fine motor&#xD;
      skill, gross motor skill, both fine and gross motor skill and total motor skill score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand skills were evaluated with the 9-Hole Peg Test. The nine-hole Peg Test is a quick,&#xD;
      simple and manual skill test that is particularly sensitive to changes in upper extremity&#xD;
      performance. The test material consists of nine small rods made of standard sizes and nine&#xD;
      perforated boards into which they are placed. In our study, insertion and removal periods for&#xD;
      both dominant and nondominant hands were recorded separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual perception skills were evaluated with 3rd Version of Visual Perception Test without&#xD;
      Motor Ability (MVPT-3). MVPT-3 is a fast, reliable test that tests visual perception without&#xD;
      motor skills in children and adults (ages 4-65). The test consists of 65 questions and the&#xD;
      first 40 questions were developed to test school-age children in terms of visual perception&#xD;
      without motor skills as follows: visual discrimination (1-8), form constancy (9-13), visual&#xD;
      memory-I (14-21), visual closure (22-34), visual differentiation (35-40). Total visual&#xD;
      perception score and scores from each category were calculated separately. Pediatric Quality&#xD;
      of Life Inventory Parent Form were filled by the parents of children in the research and&#xD;
      control groups for quality of life. The scale has separate parent and child forms for the&#xD;
      groups of 5-7 years, 8-12 years and 13-18 years. Scoring of the scale is done in 3 areas.&#xD;
      Firstly, scale total score (STS) is calculated, and secondly, physical health total score&#xD;
      (PHTS) is calculated. Thirdly, psychosocial health total score (PHTS) is calculated, which&#xD;
      consists of calculating item scores evaluating emotional, social and school functionality. In&#xD;
      the study, there are five groups: ADHD, ADHD + Specific learning disorders, ADHD +&#xD;
      Oppositional defiant disorder, ADHD + Anxiety Disorder and children with typical development&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

    <description>the Corners' Parent Scale- Revised Short Form (CPS-R:SF) was used to evaluate the severity of ADHD symptoms. The scale whose Turkish adaptation study was made by Kaner et al. (2006) consists of 27 items. In CPS-R:SF, questions are answered on a 4-point Likert scale and high scores indicate the intensity of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Quality of life were evaluated with Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) aims to measure the overall quality of life in the 2-18 age group. The scale has separate parent and child forms for the groups of 5-7 years, 8-12 years and 13-18 years. Scoring of the scale is done in 3 areas. Firstly, scale total score (STS) is calculated, and secondly, physical health total score (PHTS) is calculated. Thirdly, psychosocial health total score (PHTS) is calculated, which consists of calculating item scores evaluating emotional, social and school functionality. The higher the total score of the scale is, the better the quality of life related to health is perceived</description>
