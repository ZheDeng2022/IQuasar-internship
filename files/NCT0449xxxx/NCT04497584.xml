        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional&#xD;

             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously treated (up to three prior lines of therapy), histologically proven&#xD;
             advanced squamous NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior treatment with EGFR inhibitors, IMIDs (eg, thalidomide, lenalidomide), or&#xD;
             anti-TNF antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No treatment with systemic glucocorticoids within 3 weeks of initiation of study&#xD;
             therapy (topical and inhaled glucocorticoids are permitted).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  CrCl ≥ 45 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For both male and female patients, effective methods of contraception must be used&#xD;
             throughout the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;

          -  Adequate archival tissue (5-10 slides) for correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or other cancer therapy within two weeks prior to starting&#xD;
             study treatment. Subjects must have recovered from prior treatment-related to&#xD;
             toxicities to grade 1 or baseline (excluding alopecia and clinically stable toxicities&#xD;
             requiring ongoing medical management, such as hypothyroidism from prior immune&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitor treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of&#xD;
             the cancer under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic brain metastases or brain metastases requiring escalating doses of&#xD;
             corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions attributed to afatinib or&#xD;
             prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to poorly controlled&#xD;
             diabetes (which may worsen in setting of chronic prednisone therapy), symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
