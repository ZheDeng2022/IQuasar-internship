  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study designed to determine the effects of pharmacotherapy and&#xD;
      a remote behavioral weight loss intervention on weight loss in breast cancer survivors who&#xD;
      are overweight or obese, and the impact of successful weight loss on serum biomarkers and gut&#xD;
      microbiome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the extent to which implementation of a chronic weight loss&#xD;
      medication, Contrave® (Naltrexone/Bupropion), is associated with achieving ≥5% weight loss.&#xD;
      All patients will receive the POWER-remote behavioral weight loss intervention (BWL) and have&#xD;
      a behavioral coach for the duration of the 6 month study. During months 1-3, the behavioral&#xD;
      coach will call weekly. From months 4-6, the behavioral coach will call monthly. At week 9,&#xD;
      those who lose ≥5%, designated fast responders, will continue with BWL alone (FAST-BWL) while&#xD;
      those who lose &lt;5%, designated slow responders, will continue BWL and initiate Contrave&#xD;
      (SLOW-BWL). The SLOW-BWL arm will receive at least 16 weeks of Contrave (as per Federal Drug&#xD;
      Administration [FDA] recommended administration) starting at week 9 and discontinue if ≥5%&#xD;
      weight loss is not achieved at month 6. During month 3, all participants continue to have&#xD;
      weekly calls with the behavioral coach and will be asked about symptoms, which may be related&#xD;
      to initiation of pharmacotherapy; any symptoms are reported to the PI for further evaluation.&#xD;
      In addition to total weight loss, the investigators will evaluate biomarkers associated with&#xD;
      obesity, microbiome and cardiometabolic factors.&#xD;

The SLOW-BWL arm will receive at least 16 weeks of Contrave [as per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended administration] starting at week 9 and discontinue if ≥5% weight loss is not achieved at month 6.</description>
