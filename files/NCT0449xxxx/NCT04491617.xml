  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overprescribing opioids is considered a major contributor to the opioid crisis. Hill et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that within a general surgery practice, over 70% of the prescribed opioid pills&#xD;
      were never taken. Disturbingly, 45% of patients who did not take opioids at all on their day&#xD;
      of discharge were discharged with an opioid prescription (Chen et al). Recent initiatives&#xD;
      have attempted to utilize restrictive opioid prescribing protocols for postoperative pain&#xD;
      management in which patients were prescribed a limited number of opioid tablets (Hallway et&#xD;
      al) or prescribed opioids only if they were used as an inpatient (Mark et al). These&#xD;
      well-conducted studies show that restrictive opioid prescribing policies achieve the goal of&#xD;
      reducing excess opioid exposure without causing undue harm, inconvenience or dissatisfaction&#xD;
      among patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine if a restrictive opioid prescription protocol (in&#xD;
      which patients are not prescribed postoperative opioids unless they request them) is&#xD;
      acceptable to patients after ambulatory and major urogynecologic surgery, compared to&#xD;
      standard opioid prescribing practices. The study investigators believe that physicians can&#xD;
      capitalize on the new ability to electronically prescribe opioids for patients who require&#xD;
      them, to prevent over-prescribing without impacting patient care. The study also intends to&#xD;
      describe postoperative opioid use patterns in the urogynecologic population, including&#xD;
      factors predictive of opioid use and non-use. The results of this research will have a&#xD;
      significant and timely impact by helping to reduce opioid overprescribing and informing&#xD;
      future prescribing guidelines in the field of urogynecology.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To compare patient satisfaction and pain control using two different opioid&#xD;
      prescribing protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators hypothesize that postoperative pain control and satisfaction will be&#xD;
      non-inferior between patients not routinely prescribed opioids after surgery and those&#xD;
      prescribed a standard quantity. Participants will be asked to rate their pain control during&#xD;
      the first 7 postoperative days with validated questionnaires. Participants' satisfaction with&#xD;
      pain control will be evaluated at their postoperative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To examine opioid use patterns after ambulatory and major urogynecologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators hypothesize that most postoperative patients will use few or no&#xD;
      opioids after urogynecologic surgery, regardless of prescribing protocol. All participants&#xD;
      will receive thorough counseling with detailed instructions on non-opioid pain management, as&#xD;
      well as multimodal analgesia via ERAS protocol during the perioperative period. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to log their opioid and non-opioid medication use in the first postoperative&#xD;
      week. The investigators will also assess the number of requests for opioid prescription (in&#xD;
      those randomized to the restrictive protocol) and opioid refills (from patients in the&#xD;
      standard protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To determine patient and perioperative factors associated with opioid use after&#xD;
      urogynecologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators plan to collect and analyze demographic, clinical and psychometric&#xD;
      data on all participants with the goal of predicting analgesic needs and opioid use after&#xD;
      urogynecologic surgery. Results from this study will guide surgeons on how to tailor opioid&#xD;
      prescriptions to the needs of each patient, based off individual patient and perioperative&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;

    <description>Patient satisfaction with postoperative pain control and how pain expectations were met will be assessed with a 5-point Likert scale at the postoperative visit (&quot;Overall, how satisfied were you with your postoperative pain medication?&quot; [ranked 1- Very Dissatisfied to 5- Very Satisfied] and &quot;With regard to your expectations before surgery, did you have the amount of pain you expected, more pain, or less pain?&quot; [ranked 1- Much less pain than I expected to 5- Much more pain than I expected]).</description>

    <measure>Pain level scores during first postoperative week</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to report their pain level for the first 7 days postoperatively. Pain levels will be assessed using questions 1, 2 and 4 from the Modified Surgical Pain Scales (SPS), which measures pain at rest, during normal activities and quantifies unpleasantness of worst pain using an 11-point numeric rating score, with 0 representing 'No pain sensation' and 10 representing 'Most intense pain imaginable'. Higher scores indicate a greater amount of pain. REDCap or paper surveys will be used.</description>
