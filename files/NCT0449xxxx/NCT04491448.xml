  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social risk screening asks patients to provide information on health-related social needs&#xD;
      that are non-medical but affect health. These include housing stability, food security,&#xD;
      reliable medical transportation, consistent utilities service (heat, light, water), and&#xD;
      interpersonal safety. This research will determine the acceptability of such screening in&#xD;
      adult patients who attend a primary care clinic in-person or via a telemedicine visit, the&#xD;
      level of social need in patients, and how to flag such information for care, planning, and&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the acceptability of social risk screening among adult patients seen&#xD;
      in the General Internal Medicine Offices (GIMO) at Montefiore Hospital. The research will&#xD;
      enroll patients using the resident clinic, which provides medical care to lower-income&#xD;
      patients as well as other patients. The study will be limited to new patients or patients&#xD;
      receiving routine follow-up care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability will be assessed by (i) the proportion of patients completing the screen among&#xD;
      those approached; (ii) the proportion of screening questions completed; and (iii) the&#xD;
      proportion of patients willing to complete the screening over the phone (a) by interviewer or&#xD;
      (b) on via website using Qualtrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The representativeness of the sample will be assessed by comparing the participant sample to&#xD;
      aggregate clinic demographic characteristics and deidentified Epic EHR indicators using an&#xD;
      honest broker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey instrument is the CMS Accountable Care Communities instrument. It includes patient&#xD;
      indicators (demography) and appraisals of care (e.g., trust) that will allow assessment of&#xD;
      correlates of social need and acceptability of screening in the clinical setting.&#xD;
