      Purpose: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of online Dialectical&#xD;
      Behavioural Therapy (e-DBT) in the treatment of individuals with symptoms of borderline&#xD;
      personality disorder (BPD). Method: Study participants diagnosed with BPD were offered&#xD;
      treatment options of either online or in-person format of a DBT skills-building program.&#xD;
      During each session, participants were provided with both the material and feedback regarding&#xD;
      their previous week's homework. e-DBT protocol and content was designed to mirror in-person&#xD;
      content. Participants were assessed by using a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and&#xD;
      Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).&#xD;

      Dialectal Behavioural Therapy: Since 1995, the Personality Disorders Service in Kingston,&#xD;
      Ontario, Canada, has developed psychotherapeutic programs that have integrated a range of&#xD;
      modalities for the treatment of individuals presenting with borderline personality disorders.&#xD;
      Currently, a range of therapy groups is offered, including a weekly skills-building group&#xD;
      that is structured to offer the basic DBT curriculum, titled Managing Powerful Emotions&#xD;
      (MPE). This MPE curriculum includes Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, Emotion Regulation, and&#xD;
      Interpersonal Effectiveness. MPE has been offered since 2000 as a first-line treatment for&#xD;
      individuals who are diagnosed with BPD. The Personality Disorders Service offers more&#xD;
      advanced therapy groups for individuals who have completed the MPE and wish to continue&#xD;
      seeking treatment modalities. One of the most intensive therapy programs offered is the&#xD;
      Chrysalis Day Treatment Program (CDTP). To participate in the CDTP, an individual must&#xD;
      progress through two prior phases. In phase one, individuals will participate in a&#xD;
      DBT-informed skill-building group (MPE). Once completed, the individual will progress to&#xD;
      phase two which includes attending a psychotherapy group, incorporating DBT skills-building.&#xD;
      Finally, in phase three, individuals who wish to participate in a more advanced and complex&#xD;
      psychological treatment program, apply to participate in CDTP. The CDTP is an intensive day&#xD;
      treatment program integrating DBT skills-building, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and a range&#xD;
      of other group therapy modalities. This integrated form of psychotherapy is extremely&#xD;
      effective, especially for individuals suffering from more severe and prolonged symptomatology&#xD;
      and trauma histories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Individuals who were referred to the Personality Disorders Service in Kingston,&#xD;
      Ontario, Canada, with a diagnosis of BPD by a psychiatrist or family physician were offered&#xD;
      the opportunity to either select in-person DBT skills-building program groups (MPE) or an&#xD;
      online format of the program (iDBT). Inclusion criteria included participants being between&#xD;
      the ages of 18 and 65 years at study inception, a diagnosis of borderline personality&#xD;
      disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition&#xD;
      (DSM-5) guidelines. Moreover, participants were required to have the competence to consent&#xD;
      and participate, the ability to speak and read English, and have consistent and reliable&#xD;
      access to the internet. Participants were excluded from the study if they were experiencing&#xD;
      acute hypomanic or manic episodes, acute psychosis, severe alcohol or substance use disorder,&#xD;
      or were currently receiving DBT. Individuals who were referred to the program were provided&#xD;
      with an information sheet about the study comparing the effectiveness of online treatment to&#xD;
      in-person treatment, and those who consented were included in the study. The in-person group&#xD;
      served as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement Scales: Each individual participating in the study completed a pre- and&#xD;
      post-program Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale&#xD;
      (DERS) (Weiss, Gratz, &amp; Lavender, 2015). The DERS is a self-report tool designed to obtain an&#xD;
      overall measure of the difficulty respondents have with various aspects of emotion&#xD;
      regulation. The DERS not only provides an overall score of difficulties with emotion&#xD;
      regulation but assesses the following six specific factors related to emotion dysregulation:&#xD;
      non-acceptance (non-acceptance of emotional responses), goals (difficulty engaging in&#xD;
      goal-oriented behaviours), impulse (difficulty controlling impulses), awareness (lack of&#xD;
      emotional awareness), strategies (lack of access to emotion regulation strategies) and&#xD;
      clarity (lack of emotional clarity). It was explained to all participants on the consent form&#xD;
      and also as part of the first session of both the in-person and electronic groups that the&#xD;
      program was created for helping individuals to learn useful skills and strategies for&#xD;
      managing their emotions and behaviours, and that it was not a crisis service. iDBT&#xD;
      participants were informed that their online therapist would read their emails once a week&#xD;
      and thus would not be in a position to respond to crises, such as suicidal impulses or&#xD;
      behaviours. Participants were informed that in the case of an emergency, they were to either&#xD;
      attend their local emergency department, call emergency services, or call their local crisis&#xD;
      line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy Programs: The therapy program had a duration of 15 weeks, with one DBT session per&#xD;
      week. During each online session, participants were individually sent approximately 30-40&#xD;
      PowerPoint slides. These slides included general information on a particular topic, an&#xD;
      overview of skills related to the issue being covered, and homework sheets to be completed&#xD;
      and returned to their therapists. Therapists involved were a psychiatry resident, a&#xD;
      psychologist, and a registered nurse who also facilitated the in-person groups. The content&#xD;
      and format of the online program directly corresponded with that of the in-person group.&#xD;
      Participants in the online program were asked to send their homework sheets back to the&#xD;
      therapists by a specific day each week. The following day, the therapist would email&#xD;
      individualized feedback regarding the homework submitted and send the next week's PowerPoint&#xD;
      slides, information sheets, and homework. To be eligible to receive the next week's&#xD;
      materials, participants were required to send in their homework before the deadline. If the&#xD;
      homework was not returned, a reminder email was sent. If more than two sessions were missed,&#xD;
      participants were excluded from the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations and Confidentiality: Only the therapists involved in the patients'&#xD;
      care had access to the participants' information. The data for variables under study were&#xD;
      entered anonymously into a database separate from the clinical file. This study was approved&#xD;
      by the Research and Ethics Board of Queen's University, Canada.&#xD;
