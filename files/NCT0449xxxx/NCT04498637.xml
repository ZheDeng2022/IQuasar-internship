      Attitudes determine our behaviour to some extent. Health professionals should have a global&#xD;
      perspective of disability. They must provide treatment to people with disability and care for&#xD;
      them, but also should accept them with no judgements or discrimination. The general objective&#xD;
      of this study is to know the attitude towards people with disability of Nursing and&#xD;
      Physiotherapy students in the University of Cadiz. Method: This is a descriptive,&#xD;
      correlational, transversal and synchronous study. A total of 200 students participate in the&#xD;
      study (91 from the Bachelor's Degree in Nursing and 109 from the Bachelor's Degree in&#xD;
      Physiotherapy). The 'Attitudes towards people with disability Scale' was used.&#xD;

    <description>The 'Attitudes towards people with disabilities scale' (G form) is the assessment tool used (Verdugo M., Jenaro C. y Arias B., 1994) to assess the attitude that students from Physiotherapy and Nursing in the University of Cadiz have. This scale allows the analysis of the attitudes towards disability trough a score whose lower values indicate a more negative attitude and higher values indicate more positive attitudes.</description>
