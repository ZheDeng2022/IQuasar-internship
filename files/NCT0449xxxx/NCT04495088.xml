  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, stratified, controlled, open-label study&#xD;
      comparing preoperative FOLFOX versus postoperative risk-adapted chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced rectal cancer and low risk for local failure&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are generally treated with preoperative 5-FU- or&#xD;
      capecitabine-based chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) and total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery in&#xD;
      order to decrease the rate of local failure. In patients with low risk for local failure in&#xD;
      the middle third of the rectum (cT3a/b, N-) as determined with quality controlled MRI, the&#xD;
      German S3 guidelines and the ESMO clinical practice guidelines state that neoadjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy may be omitted. However, distant failure rate is still substantial in the range&#xD;
      of 20-25% in these patients highlighting the need for more effective systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hereby proposed ACO/ARO/AIO-18.2 randomized trial incorporates three novel aspects: (1)&#xD;
      patient selection relies on strict and quality controlled MRI features and therefore&#xD;
      identifies a cohort without imminent need for radiotherapy, (2) the sequence of chemotherapy&#xD;
      and surgery is changed in a way that chemotherapy is administered preoperatively to increase&#xD;
      the rate of patients treated with chemotherapy, and (3) three months of neoadjuvant FOLFOX or&#xD;
      XELOX (instead of up to 6 months adjuvant chemotherapy) are used as a sole perioperative&#xD;
      treatment in order to administer effective doses of the presumably most effective&#xD;
      perioperative treatment at an early time point during the course of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer but low risk for local failure (cT1/2N+ in&#xD;
      all thirds of the rectum, cT3a/b N- in the middle third, and cT3-4 Nany in the upper third)&#xD;
      will be included and randomized between three months of neoadjuvant FOLFOX/XELOX in Arm A and&#xD;
      primary resection of the tumor followed by risk (i.e. stage) adapted chemotherapy in Arm B.&#xD;
