        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study and&#xD;
             communicate with the investigator. Subjects must give written, signed, and dated&#xD;
             informed consent before any study related activity is performed. When appropriate, a&#xD;
             legal representative will sign the informed consent according to local laws and&#xD;
             regulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women must be at least 18 years of age at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have clinical and histological features of NL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have at least one NL lesion measuring at least 1.7 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NL must not affect greater than 10% BSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On excluded therapies, not on a stable dose of a therapy, or incompletely washed out&#xD;
             for a therapy (Table-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to Ruxolitinib formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women (pregnancy is defined as the state of a female&#xD;
             after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential [Post-menopausal or not of child-bearing potential is&#xD;
             defined by: 1 year of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea or Surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at&#xD;
             least 6 weeks ago. Oophorectomy alone must be confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
             assessment to be considered not of child-bearing potential, defined as all women&#xD;
             physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using medically&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception which includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;
                  of contraception).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  Oophorectomy alone requires follow up hormone level assessment for fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other&#xD;
                  forms or hormonal contraception that have complete efficacy (failure &lt;1%). (The&#xD;
                  dose of the contraceptive should be stable for 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active ongoing inflammatory diseases of the skin other than NL that might confound the&#xD;
             evaluation of the benefit of ruxolitinib cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underlying condition (including, but not limited to metabolic, hematologic, renal,&#xD;
             hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, cardiac, infectious or gastrointestinal&#xD;
             conditions) which, in the opinion of the investigator, significantly immunocompromised&#xD;
             the subject and/or places the subject at unacceptable risk for receiving an&#xD;
             immunomodulatory therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic infections during the 2 weeks prior to randomization (common cold&#xD;
             viruses not included) or any infection that reoccurs on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current severe progressive or uncontrolled disease which the investigator renders the&#xD;
             subject unsuitable for the trial or puts the subject at increased risk.&#xD;
