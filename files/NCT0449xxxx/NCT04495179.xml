    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, international, open-label, two-arm, non-randomised study of AZD4635 in&#xD;
      participants with mCRPC. Participants in each arm will be stratified by the presence of&#xD;
      measurable soft tissue metastasis (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST&#xD;
      v1.1]) or bone-only metastasis (per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 [PCWG3 criteria]). There&#xD;
      will be no formal comparisons between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD4635 plus durvalumab (Arm A) will consist of 80 participants with mCRPC previously treated&#xD;
      with one or more approved new hormonal agent(s) (NHAs) and one or more taxanes or&#xD;
      participants who are taxane ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD4635 plus durvalumab plus cabazitaxel (Arm B) will consist of 80 participants mCRPC&#xD;
      previously treated with docetaxel and one prior NHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of November 2020, the Sponsor stopped enrolment in Arm A following decisions at the&#xD;
      program level, not related to any safety issues. Ongoing participants in Arm A may continue&#xD;
      treatment as planned.&#xD;
