    <textblock>
      Children with a neurodevelopmental condition called developmental coordination disorder (DCD)&#xD;
      struggle to learn motor skills and perform daily activities, such as tying shoelaces,&#xD;
      printing, riding a bicycle, or playing sports. Evidence suggests that motor-based&#xD;
      interventions combined with non-invasive brain stimulation to the motor cortex (transcranial&#xD;
      direct-current stimulation, tDCS) has been effective in improving motor skills in children&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders, but few studies have examined&#xD;
      tDCS in chidlren with DCD. The purpose of this randomized, blinded, sham-controlled&#xD;
      interventional trial is to explore the effectiveness of anodal tDCS over M1 combined with a&#xD;
      motor learning task in increasing motor skill learning in children with DCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the most common non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation techniques but applications in pediatric populations are relatively unexplored.&#xD;
      tDCS applies a weak electric current over the scalp to modulate cortical excitability. Anodal&#xD;
      stimulation excites the stimulated brain region. Anodal tDCS applied to the motor cortex&#xD;
      contralateral to the trained hand enhances motor learning across single or multiple day&#xD;
      training sessions (Reis 2009). tDCS has shown promising effects in the developing brain&#xD;
      including the potential to enhance motor skills that may then be transferred to other&#xD;
      untrained skills in typically developing children (Ciechanski 2017). tDCS is safe and&#xD;
      tolerable and a feasible technique with only mild short-term adverse effects (e.g., redness,&#xD;
      tingling, itching, and burning sensation) in children. The adverse effects usually occur at&#xD;
      electrode sites and disappear within a few minutes after stimulation starts (Krishnan 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined with motor-based interventions, tDCS can enhance motor performance in adults (Reis&#xD;
      2009, 2011) and children (Gillick 2014; Grecco 2017; Kirton 2017; Moura 2016). It is&#xD;
      currently being used in combination with other treatments (e.g., behavioural therapy and&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation) in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders (Muszkat&#xD;
      2016), including Autism Spectrum Disorder (Amatachaya 2014) and&#xD;
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Bandeira 2016), as well as motor disorders&#xD;
      such as Cerebral Palsy (Gillick 2014; Grecco 2017; Kirton 2017; Moura 2016). However, the&#xD;
      effect of tDCS on skill motor learning in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder&#xD;
      (DCD) is largely unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCD is a chronic motor disorder of unknown etiology that affects 5-6% of school-aged children&#xD;
      in Canada (APA, 2013). DCD interferes with children's academic achievement and limits their&#xD;
      ability to participate in daily activities (e.g., printing, getting dressed, tying their&#xD;
      shoes, riding a bike, using cutlery), as well as vocational activities, leisure, and play&#xD;
      (APA, 2013).15 Subsequently, children may develop psychosocial difficulties, including low&#xD;
      self-esteem, depression, anxiety, loneliness, problems with peers, and poor participation in&#xD;
      physical and social activities (Zwicker 2013). DCD is a lifelong condition, and 75% of&#xD;
      children with DCD will continue to experience motor difficulties as adults if they don't&#xD;
      receive proper treatment (Kirby 2014). Up to half of children with DCD also have co-occurring&#xD;
      ADHD (Piek 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several brain regions have been implicated in DCD, including the cerebellum, basal ganglia,&#xD;
      parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal lobe (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or DLPFC)&#xD;
      (Biotteau 2016). The primary motor cortex (M1) is located in the dorsal part of the frontal&#xD;
      lobe and is functionally connected to other motor areas. However, the functional connectivity&#xD;
      between M1 and brain regions involved in motor functioning and sensorimotor processing, such&#xD;
      as striatum and angular gyrus, may be decreased in children with DCD (McLeod 2014). Targeting&#xD;
      such specific brain regions in rehabilitation might be effective in improving the motor&#xD;
      outcomes of affected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the most beneficial interventions to improve the motor performance of children&#xD;
      with DCD are task-oriented approaches that focus on learning a particular task rather than on&#xD;
      the body functions required to perform a task (Smits-Engelsman 2013). A number of&#xD;
      task-oriented approaches are commonly used to treat children with DCD (Niemeijer 2007;&#xD;
      Polatajko 2001). The investigators believe that brain stimulation can enhance motor learning&#xD;
      and the effect of task-oriented approaches in children with DCD. To better understand tDCS as&#xD;
      a treatment for children with DCD, as the first step, it is critical to investigate whether&#xD;
      tDCS can enhance motor skill learning in this population. Therefore, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled interventional trial of anodal tDCS over M1&#xD;
      combined with a motor learning task to assess its effectiveness on motor skill learning in&#xD;
      children with DCD. This is a pilot study to determine a sample size for a larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine if transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) enhances motor learning&#xD;
      in children with DCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Compared to children in sham group, children in stimulation group will show&#xD;
      better functional outcomes faster motor learning in each session (online learning) and after&#xD;
      3 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the longevity of tDCS effects on motor learning in children with DCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Children in stimulation group will maintain their motor learning after 6 weeks&#xD;
      compared to the sham group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This study is a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded trial. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to active or sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Children will be recruited from established cohorts of children with DCD who&#xD;
      were assessed at BC Children's Hospital or Sunny Hill Health Centre for Children (Vancouver,&#xD;
      BC) and who meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Sample size was calculated based on a randomized sham-control designed study in&#xD;
      typically-developing children receiving M1 A-tDCS or sham tDCS over 3 consecutive days of&#xD;
      Purdue Pegboard Test training.4 Sample size calculation suggested a total of 14 subjects, 7&#xD;
      subjects per group, would have a power of 95% to detect improvement in Purdue Pegboard Test&#xD;
      (effect size = 2.58) with a type-1 error of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: After screening and recruitment, parents will consent and children will assent to&#xD;
      take part in the study. We will randomize children to active or sham stimulation groups; a&#xD;
      statistician will randomize participants using computer-generated sequential blocks of 4 to&#xD;
      6. Randomization codes will be kept in sealed opaque envelopes until study enrollment. A&#xD;
      research graduate student with training in occupational therapy will be blinded to group&#xD;
      assignments and will assess children using Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT; Tiffin 1968),&#xD;
      Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2 (BOT-2; Bruininks 2005), and Evaluation Tool&#xD;
      of Children's Handwriting (ETCH; Amundson, 1995). Then, children will receive 3 days of tDCS&#xD;
      for 30 minutes each day; during the first 10 minutes, children will complete Purdue Pegboard&#xD;
      Test Training (to assess learning of a motor task), followed by 20 minutes of handwriting&#xD;
      practice using &quot;Printing Like a Pro!&quot;(Montgomery 2017), to assess learning of a functional&#xD;
      motor task). An occupational therapist will re-assess the children at the end of the last day&#xD;
      of training and again 6 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS: Direct current will be delivered using a transcranial electrical stimulator approved by&#xD;
      Health Canada (Soterix Medical Inc., New York, USA) (Soterix Medical, 2016). Stimulation will&#xD;
      be applied to the scalp through two 5×7 cm sponge saline-soaked electrodes: active and&#xD;
      reference. A simple headgear system, including the EASYpads and EASYstraps, will hold the&#xD;
      electrodes in place. In the active stimulation and sham groups, the anode (active electrode)&#xD;
      will be positioned over the left primary motor cortex with the cathode (reference electrode)&#xD;
      over right forehead in supraorbital area. The international 10/20 electroencephalography&#xD;
      electrode system will be used to localize the M1 (Klem 1999). The dominant left motor cortex&#xD;
      will be stimulated because the investigators aim to simultaneously train the dominant hand&#xD;
      for a motor learning task and a functional task. The stimulation will be applied at 1 mA for&#xD;
      30 min. One mA of anodal stimulation may cause brain current densities in children on average&#xD;
      comparable to densities seen in adults exposed to 2 mA current (Kessler 2013) and the&#xD;
      subsequent excitability might last longer than one hour (Moliadze 2015). For active&#xD;
      stimulation groups, the current will be ramped up to 1 mA over 45-60 s, held for 30 min, and&#xD;
      ramped down to 0 mA over 45-60 s. For the sham groups, stimulation will be ramped up and held&#xD;
      for only 60 s before it is slowly ramped down. This procedure, called the Fade-in-Short&#xD;
      Stimulation-Fade out, has shown its reliability as an effective sham technique through making&#xD;
      the same tolerability and transient scalp sensation as active stimulation in both adults&#xD;
      (Ambrus 2012) and children (Ciechanski 2017). In case of any &quot;Serious Adverse Events&quot; (e.g.,&#xD;
      second-degree scalp burn at the site of electrode pad, or clinical seizure) occurring during&#xD;
      the course of study, it will be stopped immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor Learning Task: Over three consecutive days, each child will perform five blocks of&#xD;
      Purdue Pegboard Test: one block before, three blocks during, and one block after tDCS. Each&#xD;
      block consists of three repetitions of Purdue Pegboard Test with the right hand. The children&#xD;
      have to place pins into a pegboard as fast as they can in 30 seconds. It will take up to 10&#xD;
      minutes of brain stimulation time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Motor Task: After the Purdue Pegboard Test, each child will receive&#xD;
      cognitive-based intervention for printing skills for 20 minutes while receiving tDCS.&#xD;
      &quot;Printing Like a Pro!&quot; (Montgomery 2017) -a cognitive approach to teaching printing to&#xD;
      primary school-age children-will be used to teach letters which each child has the most&#xD;
      difficulty printing legibly as identified on a formal assessment of handwriting-ETCH&#xD;
      (manuscript) (Amundson 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purdue Pegboard Test is the primary outcome measure of interest. To measure online learning&#xD;
      within one session and off-line learning across sessions, we will apply Repeated Measure&#xD;
      Analysis of Co-variance (ANCOVA), with an α level of 0.05. To measure effect of intervention&#xD;
      and retention, we will apply a paired t-test and Repeated Measure ANCOVA to the primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. Two-way ANCOVA and independent t-test will also be used to compare groups&#xD;
      (stimulation versus sham). MABC-2 scores and attention level as assessed by Conner's ADHD&#xD;
      Index will be used as covariates to account for individual differences in attention and motor&#xD;
      skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study of its kind to both investigate the effect of brain stimulation in&#xD;
      motor learning in children with DCD and integrate technology to improve functional motor&#xD;
      learning for children with DCD. This study will contribute to planning more effective&#xD;
      interventions for these children to improve both their motor skills and functional outcomes.&#xD;
      Additionally, findings will be of interest to pediatric clinicians (e.g., occupational&#xD;
      therapists) and parents seeking more efficient approaches for these children, as well as&#xD;
      researchers, students, and policy makers in the field of neurorehabilitation.&#xD;
