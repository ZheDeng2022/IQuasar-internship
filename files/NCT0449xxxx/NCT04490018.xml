      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate (serum bactericidal assay using&#xD;
      human complement [hSBA] titer ≥ 1:8) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y following the&#xD;
      administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) compared to a single&#xD;
      dose of Nimenrix® (Group 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the antibody response of meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y measured by hSBA,&#xD;
           before and 1 month following meningococcal vaccination administered alone (Groups 1 and&#xD;
           2) or concomitantly with 9-valent human papilloma virus (9vHPV) and tetanus, diphtheria,&#xD;
           and acellular pertussis - inactivated polio vaccine [adsorbed, reduced antigen(s)&#xD;
           content] (Tdap-IPV) vaccines (Group 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the antibody response of meningococcal serogroup C measured by hSBA and serum&#xD;
           bactericidal assay using baby rabbit complement (rSBA), before vaccination and at Day 31&#xD;
           after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® (Groups 1 and 2) according&#xD;
           to MenC primed status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the antibody response against antigens of 9vHPV and Tdap-IPV vaccines, before and 1&#xD;
           month following vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the safety profile in each group after each and any vaccination&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of study participation for each participant will be approximately 30 to 60 days,&#xD;
      including 2 or 3 visits (1 or 2 vaccination visit) and 1 or 2 telephone calls, depending on&#xD;
      study Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * This is the first dose of 9vHPV, of the 2-dose or 3-dose series according to the local&#xD;
      recommendations and age of the participant. These additional vaccinations for the completion&#xD;
      of 9vHPV schedule will take place outside of the objectives and scope of this study and thus&#xD;
      will not be described in this protocol.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a parallel group prevention study with 2 groups that are observer blind (only the person administering the vaccine is unblinded), and 1 group that is open-label</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The study will be performed in a partially observer-blind fashion:&#xD;
In Groups 1 and 2&#xD;
Investigators and study staff who conduct the safety assessment, participants, parents/legally acceptable representatives, the Sponsor, and laboratory personnel performing the serology testing will be kept blinded to the vaccine received&#xD;
Only the study staff who prepare and administer the vaccine and are not involved with the safety evaluation will know which vaccine is administered In Group 3&#xD;
Everyone involved in the study (ie, Investigator, study staff, the Sponsor, participants, parents/legally acceptable representatives) will know which vaccine is administered. This open-label design for Group 3 is due to the different vaccination schedule for this group than for Groups 1 and 2</masking_description>
