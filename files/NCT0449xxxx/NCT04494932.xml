  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the common complaints after SLAP repair is pain and stiffness. However, the more&#xD;
      recently-described Biceps Tenodesis for SLAP tears improves upon this by addressing the long&#xD;
      head of biceps which is thought to be the pain sources. However, only one small prior RCT has&#xD;
      evaluated this, finding minimal difference. Both procedures are currently considered standard&#xD;
      of care, and are decided upon based on patient and surgeon preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-center randomized controlled trial. The study is comparing SLAP repair&#xD;
      and biceps tenodesis in patients under 30 undergoing surgery for SLAP tears. The purpose of&#xD;
      the proposed study is to evaluate the effect of SLAP repair versus biceps tenodesis in the&#xD;
      management of SLAP tears in patients under 30 years old.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Superior-labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears were first described by Andrews et al. in&#xD;
      1985, and have been reported to be present in up to 26% of shoulder arthroscopies. While the&#xD;
      exact cause of SLAP tears is unknown, they are often related to traumatic events and sports&#xD;
      activity, particularly overhead sports such as baseball. Type II SLAP tears, which are&#xD;
      characterized by superior labral fraying with a detached biceps anchor, are the most common&#xD;
      subtype, based on the classification by Snyder et al. Treatment options include SLAP repair,&#xD;
      biceps tenodesis, biceps tenotomy, and debridement.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Score on Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-op, 24 months post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain possible.&quot; The total score range is 0-10. The higher the score, the higher the pain level experienced.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on American Shoulder &amp; Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-op, 24 months post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES scale consists of two subscales: pain (0-50 points) and function/disability (0-50 points), with a total score range of 0-100 points. The lower the score, the greater the pain and disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinical Shoulder &amp; Elbow (KJOC) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-op, 24 months post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The KJOC Score includes 10 questions with an 11-point Likert scale in the form of blocks to be ticked from 0 to 10. The total score is equal to the sum of the values of the 10 responses. The higher the score, the greater the shoulder function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on Shoulder Instability-Return to Sport after Injury (SIRSI) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-op, 24 months post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The SIRSI includes 12 questions with an 11-point Likert scale in the form of blocks to be ticked from 0 to 10. The total score is equal to the sum of the values of the 12 responses then determined in relation to 100 to obtain a percentage (0-100%). The higher the score (%), the more positive the psychological response.</description>
