      The purpose of this study is to determine if testing preload responsiveness, the normal&#xD;
      physiologic state that means that changes in preload determine changes in cardiac output,&#xD;
      allows an earlier and physiologically safer weaning from mechanical ventilation in critically&#xD;
      ill patients with fluid overload, when compared to a strategy of fluid removal aimed at&#xD;
      obtaining a predetermined negative fluid balance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid overload is a state of global body accumulation of fluids with a deleterious impact in&#xD;
      organ function. This condition is frequently found in critically ill patients after acute&#xD;
      resuscitation. Its adverse impact is well demonstrated on weaning-induced heart failure,&#xD;
      pulmonary and visceral edema, intraabdominal hypertension, etc., which results in longer&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and length of stay, and worse clinical outcomes. Despite these&#xD;
      well-known facts, there are no guidelines on how to implement depletive strategies on this&#xD;
      phase. The usual approach is to set in advance a desired negative fluid balance for the&#xD;
      upcoming days, initiating diuretics or ultrafiltration in preparation for weaning from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, this strategy frequently results in excessive and&#xD;
      detrimental fluid removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more physiologic approach to guide fluid removal is testing preload responsiveness, which&#xD;
      is the normal physiologic state, and means that changes in preload determine changes in&#xD;
      cardiac output, with mild or null increment in filling pressures. In contrast, preload&#xD;
      unresponsiveness corresponds to a state in which preload increases do not increase stroke&#xD;
      volume but produce large increments in filling pressures. This altered state is usually&#xD;
      present in patients with fluid overload. Preload responsiveness can be tested routinely in&#xD;
      the ICU by assessing the interactions between preload and cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now, in usual clinical practice, weaning from mechanical ventilation is accomplished through&#xD;
      a process called the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), which is a standardized test to mimic&#xD;
      the real conditions of breathing without the ventilator, before extubation. One-third of&#xD;
      patients fail the initial SBT, which determines a prolonged or difficult weaning and longer&#xD;
      stay on mechanical ventilation. Importantly, one of the main determinants of this problem is&#xD;
      fluid overload. The pathophysiologic explanation lays in that when switching from positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation to spontaneous breathing, intrathoracic pressure goes from being&#xD;
      steadily positive across the ventilatory cycle to markedly negative, promoting increased&#xD;
      preload and impeding left ventricular ejection, and this phenomenon is associated to preload&#xD;
      unresponsiveness. Interestingly, in most patients with fluid overload, preload responsiveness&#xD;
      can be restored just a few hours after starting fluid removal, while modifying fluid balance&#xD;
      may take several days. Notably, some patients may persist with preload unresponsiveness even&#xD;
      after achieving significant fluid removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that in mechanically ventilated patients with fluid overload,&#xD;
      a fluid removal strategy aimed at attaining a state of preload responsiveness associates with&#xD;
      a decreased incidence of weaning failure from cardiovascular origin, shorter weaning time,&#xD;
      and less depletion-induced hypoperfusion events, metabolic derangements and kidney stress&#xD;
      compared to patients depleted with a fluid removal strategy aimed at obtaining a&#xD;
      predetermined negative fluid balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm this hypothesis, the investigators propose a prospective randomized study on 46&#xD;
      critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with fluid overload, comparing these two&#xD;
      strategies of depletion and their impact on weaning development and other related systemic&#xD;
      functions. Throughout all the protocol, patients will receive general monitoring and&#xD;
      management according to ICU standards, plus protocol-specific monitoring that will be added&#xD;
      since randomization and before and after SBT attempts, for up to 72 h. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators' hypothesis is confirmed, it may generate a change in the paradigm of&#xD;
      managing fluid overload in critically ill patients, since the physiologic endpoint preload&#xD;
      responsiveness may suffice as the valid target and safety parameter to appropriately&#xD;
      discontinue mechanical ventilation, shortening the days on mechanical ventilation, the ICU&#xD;
      length of stay, and many other costs associated, among additional benefits.&#xD;
