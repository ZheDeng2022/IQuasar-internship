      The current study aims to investigate if altering the microbiome though Pendulum Glucose&#xD;
      Control supplementation can have implications aimed at maintaining normal blood glucose&#xD;
      levels that are critical for preventing diabetes and its metabolic complications. The&#xD;
      experimental design consists of two-12 week treatment periods in subjects with prediabetes,&#xD;
      as defined by the National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study period of 12 weeks will be double-blinded, placebo-controlled. The Pendulum&#xD;
      Glucose control and placebo will be in a capsule form and identical in appearance, and&#xD;
      dispensed to each participant according to the randomization schedule in the first 12 weeks.&#xD;
      All subjects will receive the active product (Pendulum Glucose Control) in the second,&#xD;
      subsequent 12 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, Fasting insulin and&#xD;
      Glucose, High sensitivity C Reactive Protein (hsCRP), Chemistry 14, and HbA1c will be&#xD;
      obtained at baseline, and during first and second study period, as well as vital signs of&#xD;
      weight, BP, and waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, CGM (Abbott System Freestyle Libre Pro) data collection will be done three times&#xD;
      during the study as noted in Schedule of Events. Baseline Blinded CGM will be performed for&#xD;
      approximately 14 days prior to starting the intervention with Pendulum Glucose Control.&#xD;
      Second Blinded CGM period for approximately 14 days will occur mid-way through the&#xD;
      intervention (weeks 5 and 6) and a third period of Blinded CGM wear will occur during the&#xD;
      last 2 weeks of the intervention (weeks 11 and 12). During the Baseline, study period one and&#xD;
      period 2 a mixed meal tolerance consisting of 2 Boost Shakes will be given on day 5 of each&#xD;
      sensor wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the study, analysis of the vital signs, laboratory values, CGM data for&#xD;
      average glucose, standard deviation, TIR (time in range), as well as glycemic results of MMT&#xD;
      for each time interval; baseline, study period one, and two.&#xD;
