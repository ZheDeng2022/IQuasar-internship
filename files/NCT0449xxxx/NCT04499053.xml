      This is a phase II trial of durvalumab in combination of platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Patients with stage IV Non-Small-Cell-Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV) infection (cohort 1) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection&#xD;
      (cohort 2) will be eligible. Patients will receive standard platinum-based chemotherapy plus&#xD;
      durvalumab for 4 cycles (every 3 weeks), followed by durvalumab (with or without pemetrexed&#xD;
      for non-squamous NSCLC) maintenance therapy. We hypothesized that Durvalumab in combination&#xD;
      with standard chemotherapy is safe and effective for the treatment of stage IV NSCLC in&#xD;
      patients with HIV, HBV, or HCV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized phase II trial of durvalumab in combination with&#xD;
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Patients with stage IV NSCLC with HIV (cohort 1) or&#xD;
      HBV/HCV (cohort 2) infection will be eligible. Patients will receive standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      plus durvalumab (1500 mg Q3W) every three weeks for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance&#xD;
      treatment with durvalumab (1500 mg Q4W; with or without pemetrexed for non-squamous NSCLC per&#xD;
      the discretion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be enrolled into the trial using an optimal two-stage phase II trial design. If&#xD;
      0 of the 7 achieved a response, no further patients will be enrolled in that cohort. If 1 or&#xD;
      more of the first 7 patients has a response, accrual would continue until a total of 18&#xD;
      patients have been enrolled in that cohort. Objective response will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      evaluated by assessing the incidence of treatment-related grade 3 or higher AEs.&#xD;
      Treatment-related grade 3 or higher AEs will be defined as any grade 3 or higher AEs that&#xD;
      occur during the first 42 days of treatment and are related to the study treatment. AEs will&#xD;
      be evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive 4 cycles of combination treatment: durvalumab (1500 mg every 3 weeks)&#xD;
      in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. The platinum-based doublet&#xD;
      chemotherapies (carboplatin plus paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel vs. pemetrexed plus&#xD;
      carboplatin/cisplatin) are dependent on the tumor histology of the subject (squamous vs.&#xD;
      non-squamous). Only subjects who achieve stable disease or better radiological response after&#xD;
      4 cycles of induction treatment will be eligible to continue study treatment in maintenance.&#xD;
      The choice to treat non-squamous subjects with pemetrexed maintenance after the 4 induction&#xD;
      cycles will be determined by the investigator.&#xD;
