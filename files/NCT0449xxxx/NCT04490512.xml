  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BS-01 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose escalation study&#xD;
      assessing safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of FluBHPVE6E7, changes in the HPV&#xD;
      infection status and cervical cytology, and biodistribution in HPV-16 infected women with&#xD;
      normal cytology, CIN1 or CIN2. The safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels, 7.5 log10&#xD;
      and 9.0 log10 fTCID50/dose of FluBHPVE6E7 are assessed after three subcutaneous&#xD;
      administrations. In addition the safety of 9.0 log10 fTCID50/dose of FluBHPVE6E7 is assessed&#xD;
      after three intradermal or intramuscular administrations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BS-01 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double- blind phase 1 dose-escalation study in&#xD;
      women with normal cytology, CIN1 or CIN2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of FluBHPVE6E7. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are the assessment of the systemic immune responses to immunisations with&#xD;
      FluBHPVE6E7, changes in HPV infection status and cervical cytology, and biodistribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication is administered three times (Day 0, Week 4, Week 12). Study participants are&#xD;
      randomised at a ratio of 3:1 for FluBHPVE6E7 or placebo. The first cohort is treated&#xD;
      subcutaneously at dose level 7.5 log10 fTCID50/dose. The second cohort is treated&#xD;
      subcutaneously at 9.0 log10 fTCID50/dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim safety reviews are performed by a Data Monitoring Committee. After completion of the&#xD;
      dose-escalation and in order to collect additional safety data on the highest safe and&#xD;
      tolerated dose level, additional study participants are enrolled into expansion cohorts&#xD;
      treated three times subcutaneously, intradermally or intramuscularly at 9.0 log10&#xD;
      fTCID50/dose.&#xD;
