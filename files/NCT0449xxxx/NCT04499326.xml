  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether more frequent measurement of patient reported outcome measures&#xD;
      (PROMs) - specifically health related quality of life (HRQL) - can improve the evaluation of&#xD;
      the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation of ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia (VT) in patients with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is designed to have feasibility outcomes which contribute to answering the above.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been implanted with an ICD are at risk of suffering from dangerous&#xD;
      arrhythmias such as VT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can experience clinical events including worsening of any underlying heart failure&#xD;
      regardless of either VT ablation or medical therapy treatment strategy (anti-arrhythmic drugs&#xD;
      (AAD)). VT ablation is a specialist procedure which has been proven in randomised clinical&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) to confer symptomatic relief from VT, reduced hospitalisations and reduced&#xD;
      shocks from ICDs. However, there is no effect on mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequent nature of clinical events in this group of patients may affect their health&#xD;
      status quite dramatically and yet based on current trial evidence, only 3 out of 6 randomised&#xD;
      trials in VT ablation reported PROMs. This can lead to brittle conclusions about the overall&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness profile of a procedure such as VT ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess for the feasibility of more frequent HRQL monitoring and its impact on&#xD;
      whether it is able to better capture the clinical narrative and quality of life changes of&#xD;
      patients with severe heart failure and an ICD. And thus the assessment of both clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost effectiveness of catheter ablation of VT or continuing anti arrhythmic&#xD;
      drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD &amp; SETTING Single centre study at St Bartholomew's Hospital London. Patients will be&#xD;
      identified through established local pathways - there are traditional outpatient specialist&#xD;
      clinics where Consultant Cardiologists receive referrals of patients for consideration of&#xD;
      managing patients with VT, including ablation. In addition, there are joint VT clinics&#xD;
      operated by Consultants as well as by cardiac physiologists. In the outpatient VT clinic, 85&#xD;
      patients were seen in a 10-month window - it is assumed that this scale will allow feasible&#xD;
      identification of patients to be recruited to the both the groups of this study.&#xD;
