  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence,development trajectory and risk&#xD;
      factors of the main peripartum mental health problems as well as explore its adverse&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripartum mental health problems (such as anxiety and depression), affecting more than 20%&#xD;
      of mothers, is one of the most common complications around childbirth and gradually have&#xD;
      become global public health issues. However, little is known about the course of peripartum&#xD;
      mental health problems and possible fluctuations, as well as related risk factors among&#xD;
      Chinese women. In addition, there are no effective prediction and preventive strategies for&#xD;
      postpartum depression. The Peripartum Mental Health Cohort Study in Guangzhou will collect&#xD;
      the epidemiological, clinical information and biological specimens across pregnancy and&#xD;
      childbirth to establish trajectory of peripartum mental health and identify the factors&#xD;
      influencing the fluctuations and build a comprehensive prediction model of postpartum&#xD;
      depression, as well as explore its adverse outcomes. This study would help to determine the&#xD;
      timing of screening and target interventions to improve women's and their offspring's health.&#xD;
