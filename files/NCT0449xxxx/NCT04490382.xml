  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how leg amputee patients can feel sensations with&#xD;
      neuromodulation while they are using a prosthetic leg. &quot;Neuromodulation&quot; is the process by&#xD;
      which the nervous system can be regulated by targeted delivery of a stimulus, such as&#xD;
      electrical stimulation or chemical agents, to specific neurological sites in the body. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators plan to use either electrical stimulation of the spinal cord&#xD;
      (Spinal Cord Stimulation) or electrical stimulation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG&#xD;
      stimulation) as methods for neuromodulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will involve visiting the K-Lab (Human Performance Laboratory) at&#xD;
      Duke's Sports Medicine Institute once prior to trial implant surgery, if feasible, and four&#xD;
      times during the two weeks following the implantation of trial stimulation leads to evaluate&#xD;
      sensations related to touch and position of the prosthetic leg as they are generated by&#xD;
      neuromodulation.&#xD;
