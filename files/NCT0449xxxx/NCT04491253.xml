    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of a social support intervention for self-management of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) in adults. This intervention is based on a medium-range&#xD;
      nursing theory of individual and family self-management. Findings will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      nursing outcomes &quot;self-management: diabetes&quot; and &quot;social support&quot; from the Nursing Outcomes&#xD;
      Classification (NOC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is responsible for 1.6 million deaths a year, becoming one of the world's&#xD;
      21st century health emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DM2 is the most frequent form of diabetes, accounting for 90% of all cases of this chronic&#xD;
      condition. If this trend continues, by 2045 about 693 million people will have diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with chronic diseases have changing perspectives, in addition to suffering physical&#xD;
      alterations, their psychological, emotional and social state is also compromised, presenting&#xD;
      themselves as a need to modify lifestyle to improve prognosis, facing alterations in the&#xD;
      ability to socialize and with death or a great loss. Few studies comprehensively address&#xD;
      these dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature reports that DM2 self-control has a direct effect in improving clinical&#xD;
      results, reducing complications and quality of life. Therefore, the patient must make&#xD;
      multiple decisions every day regarding diet, physical activity, glucose control, and&#xD;
      medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, intervention studies that seek to improve self-management behaviors in people with&#xD;
      DM2 are characterized by emphasizing the transmission of knowledge and establishing&#xD;
      compliance with prescribed treatments, but they do not address social and emotional elements&#xD;
      such as social support. Additionally, most of these interventions do not show the use of&#xD;
      theoretical models that provide explanations of human responses to disease and other&#xD;
      phenomena important to practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using the Nursing Outcomes Classification to assess the effect of social support&#xD;
      interventions are scarce.&#xD;
