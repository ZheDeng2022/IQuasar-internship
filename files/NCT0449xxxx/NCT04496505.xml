    <textblock>
      Study the neuromodulation device in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder and associated&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we use the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Quality of Life Scale&#xD;
      (QQLS), the Rumination Response Scale (RRS), the Brief Irritability Test (BIT), the&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Item Scale (GAD 7), and the Future Orientation Scale (FOS).&#xD;
      This study was designed to mirror real life situations, and thus patients are not asked to&#xD;
      stop their pharmaceutical treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis for this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Daily use of the device will decrease depressive symptoms as measured by HAM-D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses for these study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily use of the device will increase quality of life as measured by the QQLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily use of the device will decrease rumination as measured by the RRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily use of the device will decrease irritability as measured by the BIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily use of the device will increase future orientation as measured by the FOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily use of the device will decrease anxiety as measured by the GAD-7.&#xD;

      Experimental design 1. This study will be a randomized clinical trial to assess the effects&#xD;
      of the device on depression as well as ancillary symptoms of depression. The study will&#xD;
      involve 2 phases: Screening/Baseline and Treatment. In the screening phase patients will be&#xD;
      assessed by clinical psychiatrists for depression using the Diagnostics and Statistics Manuel&#xD;
      5 (DSM-5) criteria. Baseline rates of depression, quality of life, rumination, irritability,&#xD;
      anxiety and future orientation will be gathered prior to treatment. These metrics will be&#xD;
      measured by HAM-D, QQLS, RRS, BIT, GAD-7, and FOS respectively. Patients will then be&#xD;
      randomized to either the treatment group or the control group. Control group patients will be&#xD;
      assigned sham devices by an investigator that is not involved in measurement. On Day 1,&#xD;
      patients will be instructed on the use of the Device and will apply the device for the first&#xD;
      time under clinic supervision; all other uses of the device will be conducted at home. During&#xD;
      the treatment phase, patients will undergo 2 16 minute session of device treatment per day&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. Recommended sessions occur once during the day and once before bed. Metrics&#xD;
      described above will be measured at the end of week 2 (day 14), week 4 (day 28), week 6 (day&#xD;
      42), and week 8 (day 56). Adverse effects will be assessed at each of these junctures.&#xD;
      Patient will return the device on day 56 or at time of discontinuation. Patients who choose&#xD;
      to discontinue the study will have their last recorder measures carried forward. In an effort&#xD;
      to increase external validity patients will not be asked to change their current treatment&#xD;
      plan as outlined by their outpatient psychiatrist. Patients will may continue previously&#xD;
      prescribed medication, but no medication changes will occur during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statistical and Analytical Plans&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Before database lock, a statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be authored as a&#xD;
           separate document and approved by the investigative team. The SAP will provide a more&#xD;
           detailed description of the methods for the analyses described as follows. Any&#xD;
           deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final study&#xD;
           report. All study data will be presented in data listings by subject number and time&#xD;
           point (where applicable). Summary tables will be presented by time point (where&#xD;
           applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis Populations&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A single set of all completed participants will be analyzed for the primary and&#xD;
                secondary outcomes. Additional analyses may be performed on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
                using descriptive techniques to enumerate and characterize any patients found to&#xD;
                have experienced an Adverse Event (AE) during the trial. Any adjustments to the&#xD;
                analysis populations will be based on procedures outlined in the SAP or&#xD;
                modifications to the SAP, and also described in the final study report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disposition of Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Eligible patients who enter and complete each phase of the clinical study will be&#xD;
           enumerated and included for analysis. The number and percentage of patients enrolled,&#xD;
           completed, and discontinued from the study will be summarized to identify any non-random&#xD;
           patterns of attrition and missing data at the item level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Planned Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Data analyses will proceed by first inspecting the psychometric characteristics of&#xD;
           the primary, secondary, and predictive measures collected on each patient within each&#xD;
           timepoint and across timepoints. For each measure, means, medians, and standard&#xD;
           deviation will be calculated accounting for all available cases and then different&#xD;
           assumptions of missingness. Overall, the primary hypotheses are centered on the&#xD;
           demonstration of efficacy of the device, relative to baseline. Disposition for all&#xD;
           enrolled patients will be summarized, and reasons for discontinuation will be tabulated.&#xD;
           Tabular summaries and/or listings will be provided for baseline demographic and clinical&#xD;
           characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Concomitant Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Concomitant medications taken during administration of the treatment will be&#xD;
           summarized and classified by drug class and preferred name using the World Health&#xD;
           Organization (WHO) Drug dictionary in the most current version when the study enrollment&#xD;
           starts. The version of the WHO Drug dictionary will be noted in the final report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Analysis of Efficacy Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The primary endpoints of change from baseline in depression severity as measured by&#xD;
           the HAM-D. To compare the change between groups on their change from pre to post&#xD;
           treatment, a Repeated Measures Anova will be conducted to test a pre-specified contrast&#xD;
           that corresponds to the following null and alternative hypotheses: i. Null:&#xD;
           [(Mean-Treatment-Post - Meant-Treatment-Pre) - (Mean-Sham-Post - Meant-Sham-Pre)] = 0&#xD;
           ii. Alternative: [(Mean-Treatment-Post - Meant-Treatment-Pre) - (Mean-Sham-Post -&#xD;
           Meant-Sham-Pre)] != 0 b. Secondary outcome measures of quality of life, rumination,&#xD;
           future orientation, anxiety and irritability will be studied similarly. Details of&#xD;
           additional measures of efficacy and their analysis will be described prospectively,&#xD;
           prior to final database lock, in the SAP for this study. From each model, means and 95%&#xD;
           confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided for each treatment; and difference in means,&#xD;
           one-sided 95% CIs of the difference, and p values (significance value of 0.05)&#xD;
           determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. If the primary objective meets statistical significance at 0.05, the secondary&#xD;
           objectives will control for type-I error by adjusting p-values using a Hockberg&#xD;
           correction. Both the adjusted and unadjusted p-values will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Analysis of Exposure and Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Exposure (number of treatment sessions) will be summarized by treatment. Adverse&#xD;
           event analyses will be performed using the ITT population. AEs will be coded by primary&#xD;
           system organ class (SOC) and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for&#xD;
           Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), overall and for those&#xD;
           considered to be device-related, will be summarized by number and percent of patients in&#xD;
           each primary SOC and preferred term by treatment. Summaries will also be presented for&#xD;
           relationship to the study device, intensity, seriousness, AEs or Severe Adverse Events&#xD;
           (SAEs) leading to discontinuation, deaths and hospitalizations, as well as&#xD;
           device-specific AESIs. By-subject listings will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Determination of Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To determine sample size, preliminary data was used from Fibromyalgia trial titled,&#xD;
                &quot;A Single Arm Study Evaluating the Efficacy of the device in Patients with Severe&#xD;
                Pain Due to Fibromyalgia&quot;. Results from the PHQ-9 depression scale administered in&#xD;
                this trial will be used to estimate the effect size for the HAM-D depression scale&#xD;
                in order to determine the appropriate sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The Fibromyalgia trial had 2 phases, a screening phase that lasted 7 days in which&#xD;
                no intervention was used and a treatment phase that lasted 15 days in which the&#xD;
                participants used the Device at least twice daily (up to 4 times).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The effect sizes for both phases were calculated as a Cohen's Dz. The treatment&#xD;
                phase had an effect size 0.79 (95% CI 0.25 - 1.33) and the screening phase had an&#xD;
                effect size of 0.47 (95% CI 0.18 - 0.77). The effect size over the entire study was&#xD;
                1.26 (95% CI 0.61 - 1.9). In this trial, the screening phase can be used as an&#xD;
                estimate for the sham/placebo effect that may be observed in future trials. In&#xD;
                addition the observed effect size of 0.79 for the treatment period takes place&#xD;
                after placebo improvements have occurred during the screening phase and are thus&#xD;
                somewhat protected against containing a partial placebo effect. The assumption for&#xD;
                this sample size calculation is that the treatment phase effect size in the current&#xD;
                study may show a 1.26 total effects size and the sham arm may show a 0.47 effect&#xD;
                size, and thus the correct effect size to determine the sample size of the current&#xD;
                trial is the remaining true treatment effect above sham which is (1.26 - 0.47=0.79)&#xD;
                0.79.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. For a parallel arm trial, in order to show statistical significance with an effect&#xD;
                size of 0.79 at an alpha of 0.05, 2-Tailed, at a power of 80% on a between subjects&#xD;
                T-Test the sample size needed would be 27 participants per arm. To account for&#xD;
                potential dropout of participants, the final sample size will be adjusted upward to&#xD;
                40 participants per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. A simulation showing the similarities in results between a T-test and a Repeated&#xD;
                Measures Anova is attached. Thus, the above sample size for a T-test was used for&#xD;
                the Repeated Measures Anova (see attached file #1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Blinding of study a. will provide randomized devices and give study staff a list of&#xD;
           device ID numbers to assign in order. Study investigators will have no knowledge of&#xD;
           which device is a sham device. will keep blinding information on a separate locked&#xD;
           external hard drive that investigators will not have access to. Data attached to each&#xD;
           device ID will sent to 's analytics team for statistical analysis.&#xD;
