    <textblock>
      This is a remote study. No office visits required. The purpose and efficacy endpoint of this&#xD;
      study is to assess whether GERD patients tolerate ISOT-101. In addition, usage of the ReQuest&#xD;
      validated questionnaire to measure GERD symptoms will be explored as well as usage of the&#xD;
      validated SF-36 quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. Each subject serves as his/her own&#xD;
      control. Relative tolerability in subjects both on and off proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) will&#xD;
      be compared. Subjects naive to PPIs, currently taking PPIs and historically on PPIs will be&#xD;
      evaluated with ReQuest and QoL scores. In addition, survey measurements will be taken on a&#xD;
      subset of 10 subjects that are non-responders to PPIs. These will not be included in the&#xD;
      statistical analysis with the above groups. A tertiary endpoint of this study is to assess&#xD;
      any relevant adverse events that occur.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction and Background GERD is found in about one-third of the population of the USA.&#xD;
      About 20 to 45 million people have been diagnosed by a doctor and have been prescribed daily&#xD;
      acid reducing medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are the mainstay of&#xD;
      medical therapy for GERD. PPIs don't cure GERD and many patients take them indefinitely for&#xD;
      adequate symptom control. In addition, clinicians and researchers have identified concerns&#xD;
      with regard to chronic PPI use and the resulting possible adverse effects due to chronic&#xD;
      diminished gastric acid production. The potential adverse effects with reasonable association&#xD;
      to PPIs include osteoporosis, fractures, pneumonia, C. difficile colitis, small intestinal&#xD;
      bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), hypomagnesemia, vitamin B-12 deficiency, and iron deficiency&#xD;
      anemia. The frequent claims of potential PPI adverse effects that appear in public media has&#xD;
      also worried patients. In a recent article, 46% of patients on PPIs want to discontinue them&#xD;
      and 39% unfortunately have tried to do so without medical advice, increasing the risk of GI&#xD;
      bleeding, Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Other patients, such as those at&#xD;
      risk for C. difficile infection, osteoporosis (the elderly), patients with small intestinal&#xD;
      bacterial overgrowth, among others, should not be on PPIs indefinitely. Unfortunately, there&#xD;
      has been no reliable cure or adequate alternative that does not share adverse effects.&#xD;
      ISOThrive has produced a proprietary digestion-resistant carbohydrate, ISOT-101, a specific&#xD;
      formulation of maltosyl-isomalto-oligosaccharides (MIMO), that serves as a prebiotic, feeding&#xD;
      selected bacteria that commonly inhabit the human GI tract. MIMO has an FDA Generally&#xD;
      Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status. Since the dawn of agrarian societies, grains were converted&#xD;
      to bread using a sourdough fermentation process. MIMO molecules are generally found in such&#xD;
      breads. These forms of breads and other sources of MIMO have been inadvertently removed from&#xD;
      the daily diet and so can no longer feed selective bacteria that may have played a protective&#xD;
      role for prior generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale This is a remote study. No office visits required. The purpose and efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint of this study is to assess whether GERD patients tolerate ISOT-101. In addition,&#xD;
      usage of the ReQuest validated questionnaire to measure GERD symptoms will be explored as&#xD;
      well as usage of the validated SF-36 quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. Each subject serves&#xD;
      as his/her own control. Relative tolerability in subjects both on and off proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitors (PPIs) will be compared. Subjects naïve to PPIs, currently taking PPIs and&#xD;
      historically on PPIs will be evaluated with ReQuest and QoL scores. In addition, survey&#xD;
      measurements will be taken on a subset of 10 subjects that are non-responders to PPIs. These&#xD;
      will not be included in the statistical analysis with the above groups. A tertiary endpoint&#xD;
      of this study is to assess any relevant adverse events that occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The test material is ISOT-101. It is an approximately 90% pure&#xD;
      maltosyl-isomalto-oligosacchride (MIMO) prebiotic syrup produced by bacterial&#xD;
      fermentation/bio-conversion of sucrose and maltose. It is taken 1g daily at bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have been previously diagnosed with GERD and will fall into one of the&#xD;
      following four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Symptomatic subjects currently not taking PPI therapy and who are naive to PPIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptomatic subjects currently not taking PPI therapy who were responsive to prior PPI&#xD;
           therapy (either QD or BID) and who have been off PPIs for at least four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Symptomatic subjects currently taking PPI therapy (either QD or BID) who are partial&#xD;
           responders to PPIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 10 symptomatic subjects who have had no benefit from PPIs and have not taken PPIs for at&#xD;
           least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have active GERD symptoms as determined by the ReQuest validated GERD&#xD;
      specific questionnaire. The study has been designed to have each subject serve as their own&#xD;
      control so there will be no placebo arm. Each subject will receive ISOT-101 according to the&#xD;
      protocol. Recruitment for subjects with GERD will be by referrals from GI specialists,&#xD;
      primary care physicians and general advertising. Each candidate will be given information as&#xD;
      to how to contact the study coordinator to enroll in the study. The goal is to assess 110&#xD;
      subjects after the Screening Phase, including the 10 subjects who did not respond to PPIs.&#xD;
      All subjects will be screened per the eligibility criteria delineated in this protocol by the&#xD;
      study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phases have been designed into this study. Phase 1 is the Screening Phase (SP). Phase 2&#xD;
      is the Tolerability Phase (TP). Subjects will be instructed to take a daily GERD symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire, the ReQuest Short Version, daily throughout the study. At five timepoints,&#xD;
      specific scores will be established for comparison and statistical analysis. These timepoints&#xD;
      are: (1) SP7 - baseline on current therapy (if any) without ISOT-101; (2) TP7 - 1 week on&#xD;
      both current therapy (if any) and ISOT-101; (3) TP14 - 2 weeks on both current therapy (if&#xD;
      any) and ISOT-101; (4) TP21 - 3 weeks on both current therapy (if any) and ISOT-101; (5))&#xD;
      TP28 - 4 weeks on both current therapy (if any) and ISOT-101. At each of these timepoints,&#xD;
      subjects will also complete the ReQuest Long Version and the SF-36 Health Survey QoL&#xD;
      validated questionnaires. They need not complete the ReQuest Short Version on days that the&#xD;
      ReQuest Long Version is required. Subjects will report any usage of all GERD medications&#xD;
      (PPI, H-2 antagonists, antacid) throughout their study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment An adequate number of individuals will need to be screened during the Screening&#xD;
      Phase, using disease specific validated questionnaires to yield approximately 110 qualified&#xD;
      subjects to enter and likely complete the Tolerability Phase of the study. Recruitment may&#xD;
      involve primary care physicians and/or gastroenterologists who will make IRB approved study&#xD;
      information available to patients who are symptomatic for GERD. Such patients will include&#xD;
      those partial responders on PPI therapy; those who responded to PPIs, but have previously&#xD;
      stopped their PPI therapy for at least 4 weeks; those who are naive to PPI therapy, and 10&#xD;
      subjects that have had no benefit from PPIs and have not been on PPI therapy for at least 4&#xD;
      weeks. Deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria will not be allowed so as not to&#xD;
      jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability, or subject&#xD;
      safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be required to sign an IRB-approved informed consent or e-consent that&#xD;
      complies with the requirements of both 21 CRF Part 50 and Health Insurance Portability and&#xD;
      Accountability Act (HIPAA) before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is defined for each subject as the date a signed written informed&#xD;
      consent (or e-consent) is provided through Tolerability Phase Day 28. Total participation in&#xD;
      study may last up to 8 weeks. A comparable gender distribution is sought for the final&#xD;
      analysis, therefore, the ratio of male to female (or female to male) subjects completing the&#xD;
      Tolerability Phase will be capped at 60% of the total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications and Washout Periods GERD medications: Subjects currently taking PPI&#xD;
      therapy (either QD or BID) who are partial responders to PPIs may continue taking PPIs&#xD;
      throughout the study as needed. Subjects not taking PPIs prior to being enrolled may also&#xD;
      take PPIs as needed. Antacids or H-2 antagonists may be taken regularly or intermittently as&#xD;
      needed throughout the conduct of this study. All GERD-related medications taken by the&#xD;
      subject should be recorded daily via the daily electronic survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prebiotic and/or probiotic supplements: Enrolled subjects must stop taking all prebiotic&#xD;
      and/or probiotic supplements 2 weeks prior to entering the Screening Phase of the study.&#xD;
      Subjects must refrain from taking prebiotic or probiotic supplements through Tolerability&#xD;
      Phase Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep medications: Enrolled subjects taking medications for sleep disorders must be on a&#xD;
      stable dose at time of consent and continue at said dose through Tolerability Phase Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics: Subjects must not have taken antibiotics within 6 months prior to signing of&#xD;
      consent or at any time during their participation in the study. If antibiotics are prescribed&#xD;
      to the subject during study participation, subject must be withdrawn from study and&#xD;
      discontinue daily ISOT-101 immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study product sachets (used and unused) must be returned to Investigator for product&#xD;
      accountability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Study Flow Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study-related activities will be performed and no subject data will be collected prior to&#xD;
      completion of the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase (SP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enter the SP, subjects must have previously been diagnosed with GERD, be symptomatic on&#xD;
      their current therapy or lack of therapy, and fall into one of the 4 study groups noted in&#xD;
      Section 4.0 above. The SP will last for 7 days. Subjects who do not qualify at any point&#xD;
      during the SP will not be allowed to move into the Tolerability Phase (TP). The TP will last&#xD;
      28 days, beginning with first dose of ISOT-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Day 7 of SP, the average of the daily ReQuest Short Version scores will be used to&#xD;
      establish a baseline score to confirm that the subject is experiencing GERD symptoms. Any&#xD;
      subject who has a ReQuest Short Version (RQ) average score of &gt;= 3.37 (90 percentile) or&#xD;
      ReQuest GI (RQ-GI) average score &gt;=0.95 on the will be eligible to transition to the&#xD;
      Tolerability Phase. The ReQuest Short Version SP1-SP7 average and SF-36 will serve as a&#xD;
      baseline. Investigator will verify eligibility prior to study staff contacting subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility has been verified by the PI, the study coordinator will inform subject and&#xD;
      confirm that subject wishes to continue in the study. Once confirmed, study coordinator will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect any adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review calendar for remainder of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide instructions for daily dosing of ISOT-101&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm mailing address&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arrange for shipment of 30-day supply of ISOT-101 to the subject There may be up to 7&#xD;
           calendar days between SP Day 7 and TP Day 1 depending on length of time to ship/receive&#xD;
           ISOT-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability Phase (TP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take their current GERD therapy as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If on PPI therapy QD or BID, then the PPI is to be taken as the subject customarily has&#xD;
           taken it, prior to beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If on an H-2 antagonist or antacid, then the subject may continue these medications as&#xD;
           needed throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All GERD medications and other medications will be recorded daily via the electronic survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • ISOT-101 will be taken daily at bedtime (one sachet per day). This will be the last thing&#xD;
      swallowed prior to bedtime (no rinsing, and after brushing teeth) As the primary endpoint,&#xD;
      tolerability of ISOT-101 will be assessed. In addition, changes in the ReQuest Short Version&#xD;
      GERD symptom scores (RQ, RQ-GI and RQ-WSO) and SF-36 scores will be assessed for all subjects&#xD;
      as well as for the sub-group of subjects that completed all 4 weeks of the protocol. Changes&#xD;
      in ReQuest symptom scores, or SF-36 scores, between time point 1 and time point 2 will be the&#xD;
      basis of this assessment. Further evaluation will include comparison of ISOT-101 tolerability&#xD;
      in the 4 subject sub-groups using these two time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety endpoint of the study is to ensure that any adverse events that are reported or&#xD;
      observed during the study are appropriately recorded.&#xD;
