  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, social pressure has been exerted towards lowering sugar and sweetness levels&#xD;
      in foods, with the aim of decreasing the sweetness preference of the general population.&#xD;
      However, the resilience/flexibility of sweetness preferences and the impact on energy intake&#xD;
      is a fundamental knowledge gap. Recent, relatively long-term studies limited to no more than&#xD;
      3 months did not find a relationship between sweetness exposure and sweetness preferences.&#xD;
      Therefore, a longer-term systematic investigation is necessary to objectively evaluate&#xD;
      whether sweetness preferences can be altered via varying the sweetness exposure and whether&#xD;
      it can affect other outcomes, such as perceived taste intensity, food intake, body weight,&#xD;
      body composition, glucose homeostasis and sweet liker type. The study sample will consist of&#xD;
      180 subjects. Enrolled participants will be distributed into three intervention groups;&#xD;
      regular dietary sweetness exposure (n=60); low dietary sweetness exposure (n=60); and high&#xD;
      dietary sweetness exposure (n =60). The intervention is semi-controlled for a period of six&#xD;
      months. Preference and perceived taste intensity of a series of familiar and unfamiliar foods&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline (Day 0), during the intervention (Month 1, Month 3, Month 6) and&#xD;
      in the follow-up period (Month 7, Month 10). Furthermore, outcomes such as observed food&#xD;
      choice and intake during a test meal, reported food preferences, reported food cravings,&#xD;
      sweet-liker type, glucose homeostasis, body weight, body composition and biomarkers related&#xD;
      to diabetes and cardiovascular disease will be assessed as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence supporting sweetness preference alterations via variations in dietary sweetness&#xD;
      exposure is limited. Most studies investigating this focused only on specific sweet elements&#xD;
      in the diet, (e.g. beverages; mono- and disaccharides; high-energy dense snacks) instead of&#xD;
      sweetness in the diet as a whole. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence about the relation&#xD;
      between dietary sweetness exposure and weight gain. Therefore, longer term,&#xD;
      sufficiently-powered studies with a 'whole diet' approach are needed to address the question&#xD;
      whether sweet preferences can be altered (suppressed or stimulated) by variations in&#xD;
      sweetness exposure. It is important to answer this question so that dietary recommendations&#xD;
      can be scientifically tailored accordingly. The present study will provide breakthrough&#xD;
      evidence about the flexibility/adaptability of sweetness preferences, in terms of effect&#xD;
      sizes and direction, duration of effects, and impact on dietary intake, glucose homeostasis&#xD;
      and body weight. This information is particularly relevant for product development by food&#xD;
      industries in the context of reformulation strategies, and for governments to base their&#xD;
      dietary guidelines upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to assess the effect of a 6-month low, regular and high&#xD;
      dietary sweetness exposure on sweetness preference in a series of familiar and unfamiliar&#xD;
      foods. Preference will be assessed in both familiar and unfamiliar foods since, preferences&#xD;
      in familiar, commonly eaten foods might by harder to change compared to those for unfamiliar&#xD;
      foods, because there is no consumer-expected sweetness level associated with unfamiliar&#xD;
      foods. The secondary objective is to assess the effect of a 6-month low, regular and high&#xD;
      dietary sweetness exposure on sweetness perception, food choice and intake during a test&#xD;
      meal, dietary taste patterns, taste preferences, food cravings, sweet-liker type, glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis, biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes, body weight and&#xD;
      body composition. Participants will be matched on age, gender, BMI and sweet liker status and&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of the three intervention arms: (1) regular dietary sweetness&#xD;
      exposure (25-30 percent daily energy from sweet foods) (control) (n=60); (2) low dietary&#xD;
      sweetness exposure (10-15 percent daily energy from sweet foods) (n=60); and (3) high dietary&#xD;
      sweetness exposure (40-45 percent daily energy from sweet foods) (n=60). The intervention is&#xD;
      semi-controlled, meaning that 50 percent of the foods will be provided to participants. Foods&#xD;
      are offered ad libitum, on a weekly basis and macronutrient composition of the offered foods&#xD;
      is similar in energy and macronutrient composition, that is fat, protein, carbohydrates and&#xD;
      fibres, but different in sweetness. New methodology of our group enables us to assess&#xD;
      sweetness exposure within a diet, by profiling foods based on six taste clusters (neutral;&#xD;
      salt, umami &amp; fat; sweet and fat; sweet and sour; fat; bitter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preference and perceived taste intensity will be assessed during hedonic and sensory&#xD;
      evaluation of eight foods; three sweet familiar, three sweet unfamiliar and two salty&#xD;
      familiar ones. Foods are solid, semi-solid and liquid. Furthermore, observed food choice and&#xD;
      intake during test meals, reported food preferences, reported food cravings, sweet-liker&#xD;
      type, glucose homeostasis, body weight, body composition and biomarkers related to diabetes&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease will be assessed. Outcomes will be assessed several times; at&#xD;
      baseline (Month 0), during the intervention Month 1, Month 3, Month 6 and in the follow up&#xD;
      period (Month 7, Month 10). Compliance will be assessed with 24-hour urine sample and dietary&#xD;
      assessment methods (24-hour recalls).&#xD;
