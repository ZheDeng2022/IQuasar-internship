    <measure>Prevalence of Genetic Variants Associated with NAFLD</measure>

    <description>Genotyping for known mutations associated with NAFLD will be conducted and the prevalence in the overall population enrolled will be calculated.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver Fat Content Estimated with Fibroscan</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fibroscan will be performed to obtain the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score to estimate liver fat content. Number of participants with a CAP score greater or equal to (&gt;=) 310 decibels per minute (dB/m) (that is, liver fat &gt;= 10 percent [%]) will be estimated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver Fibrosis Estimated with Fibroscan</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fibroscan will be conducted to obtain liver stiffness measurement to estimate liver fibrosis. Number of participants with absent, low or moderate fibrosis (that is, less than or equal to (&lt;=) 9 kilopascals [kPa]) will be estimated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hepatic Fat Fraction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The liver fat fraction will be obtained by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) to estimate the inter-participant variability in liver fat measurement.</description>
