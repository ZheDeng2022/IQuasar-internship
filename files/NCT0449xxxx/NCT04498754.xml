  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, debilitating psychiatric disorder that is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most&#xD;
      individuals with PTSD also have Insomnia Disorder. Sleep quality is also associated with risk&#xD;
      factors for CVD. The objective of this study is to examine how insomnia contributes to CVD&#xD;
      risk among people with PTSD. The investigators will also examine whether this risk can be&#xD;
      decreased with treatment for Insomnia Disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling and costly psychiatric disorder that is&#xD;
      estimated to occur in 20% of individuals who are exposed to a traumatic event and is chronic&#xD;
      in one third of cases. In addition to its negative impact on quality of life, there is&#xD;
      substantial evidence that PTSD (even after controlling for depression and other risk factors)&#xD;
      is associated with a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      However, the mechanisms for the association between PTSD and cardiovascular disease (CVD)&#xD;
      risk are not well understood. Although adverse health behaviors, including cigarette smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol abuse and poor medication adherence are common in PTSD, recent prospective studies&#xD;
      show that they do not account for the magnitude of CVD risk among individuals with PTSD. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to test our central hypothesis by evaluating whether CBT-I results in&#xD;
      improved biomarkers of CVD risk among those with PTSD. Well established biomarkers of CVD&#xD;
      related morbidity and mortality will be used including measures of vascular endothelial&#xD;
      function measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), nighttime blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) dipping measured using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), and&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity as measured by 24-hour urinary catecholamines.&#xD;
      Investigators will also assess lipid profile, which along with BP is a modifiable component&#xD;
      with marked impact on the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score. The&#xD;
      primary sleep parameter of interest is objectively-measured sleep efficiency (through&#xD;
      actigraphy), although self-report insomnia measures and sleep related arousal will also be&#xD;
      measured. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is established that&#xD;
      insomnia is an important and modifiable symptom conveying increased CVD risk in this&#xD;
      population, the development of new and innovative approaches to integrating insomnia&#xD;
      treatment with PTSD-focused interventions can be developed. 150 men and women with comorbid&#xD;
      PTSD and insomnia disorder will be randomly assigned with a 2:1 ratio to 8-week cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy-Insomnia (CBT-I) intervention or a waiting period control condition. Sleep&#xD;
      quality parameters and CVD risk biomarkers will be assessed at pre-randomization baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up. The study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      association between insomnia and CVD risk biomarkers among persons with PTSD, and determine&#xD;
      whether improvements in insomnia symptoms are associated with improvements in CVD risk&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
