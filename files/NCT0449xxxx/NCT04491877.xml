      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profile of each dose of the study product after each and any&#xD;
           administration in all infants and toddlers regardless of baseline neutralizing antibody&#xD;
           serostatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the RSV-A serum neutralizing antibody responses to the study product in&#xD;
           each vaccine group after vaccination in Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) seronegative&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the amount of vaccine virus shed by each participant by baseline&#xD;
           neutralizing antibody serostatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the proportion of vaccinated infants and toddlers in each vaccine group&#xD;
           infected with the vaccine virus after vaccination by baseline neutralizing antibody&#xD;
           serostatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the RSV-A serum neutralizing antibody responses to the study product in&#xD;
           each vaccine group after vaccination in RSV seropositive participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize serum RSV-A anti-F immunoglobulin G antibody responses to the study&#xD;
           product in each vaccine group after vaccination by baseline neutralizing antibody&#xD;
           serostatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize serum RSV-A antibody responses (neutralizing and anti-F immunoglobulin&#xD;
           G) to the study product in each vaccine group after the RSV season by baseline&#xD;
           neutralizing antibody serostatus.&#xD;
