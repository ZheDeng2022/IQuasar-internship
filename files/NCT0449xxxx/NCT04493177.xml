      In order to evaluate the effect of an educational intervention on mothers with gestational&#xD;
      diabetes and their offspring in the first 18 months of life, The intervention will be applied&#xD;
      to mothers with gestational diabetes, and a group of mothers without diabetes, against a&#xD;
      control group with the normal post-partum treatment. Effects on overweight and obesity will&#xD;
      be evaluated in both mothers and offspring.&#xD;

      Effect of an education intervention for the prevention and management of overweight and&#xD;
      obesity during the first 18 months of life of offspring and mother with gestational diabetes&#xD;
      among insured of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: According to ENSANUT 2012, 9.7% of children &lt;5 years already are&#xD;
      overweight or obese. Recently, an increase was reported in the frequency of overweight and&#xD;
      obesity worldwide, beginning at earlier ages, especially in Mexico. The predisposition to&#xD;
      chronic diseases in adults may be programmed in the womb (&quot;fetal programming&quot;). Also, women&#xD;
      that suffer diabetes during pregnancy have a very high risk (6.4 times more) of developing&#xD;
      diabetes in a middle range. The challenge for health personnel dedicated to the care of&#xD;
      mother-child pairs is to achieve glycemic control from conception and to identify all the&#xD;
      maternal-fetal secondary complications. To carry out compliance with adherence to medical&#xD;
      management and/or healthy eating habits would allow us to reduce future overweight, obesity&#xD;
      and the incidence of type 2 diabetes in mother-child pairs. Approaching the mother-child pair&#xD;
      is a great opportunity to study the intervention, which would allow us not only have a new,&#xD;
      useful awareness in the evaluation of educational strategies, but also to apply good&#xD;
      practices of healthy habits for the prevention of obesity and to avoid progression to&#xD;
      diabetes. For the aforementioned reasons, the objective is: to implement and evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of an education intervention for the prevention and management of overweight and&#xD;
      obesity during the first 18 months of life of child and in mothers with and without&#xD;
      gestational diabetes in insured members of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS. Pregnant women will be invited to participate, who receive their&#xD;
      prenatal and/or birth care in the Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad (UMAE) Gineco-Obstretric&#xD;
      Hospital No. 4 (HGO #4) and UMAE HGO #3 of Centro Médico &quot;La Raza&quot; of IMSS. After acceptance&#xD;
      and signing an informed consent to participate in the study, 645 mother-child pairs will be&#xD;
      included, with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which will be diagnosed&#xD;
      according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association; all mothers with be between&#xD;
      18 and 40 years old. There will be 3 groups of binomials: 1) with GDM, 2) without GDM who&#xD;
      will received the education intervention, and 3) without GDM who will receive the&#xD;
      conventional care IMSS offers to mothers and nursing infants, during the first 18 months&#xD;
      post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of canalization before delivery or cesarean, a blood sample (15 mL) will be taken&#xD;
      from the mother for measurement of glucose, glucosylated hemoglobin (A1c) and lipid profile.&#xD;
      After birth, blood (15 mL) will be extracted directly from the umbilical cord for measurement&#xD;
      of the child's glucose and lipid profile. Once the pediatric doctor has carried out&#xD;
      reanimation of the newborn, previously-standardized health staff will take anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements. During the 18 months of follow-up from birth, the mother-child pair will be&#xD;
      given appointments at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months, in which health care personnel&#xD;
      involved in the study (nutritionist, social worker, pediatrician and family doctor) will&#xD;
      perform activities to promote health and prevent disease, directed towards the mother-child&#xD;
      pair and planned within the education intervention strategy based on the First 1000 Days&#xD;
      program, or the conventional care that mothers and nursing infants receive in IMSS, according&#xD;
      to the study group. Weekly, the mothers will be sent, by digital media and social networks,&#xD;
      educational material to promote healthy diet and physical activity; for the child material&#xD;
      will include the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months, at which time promotion&#xD;
      will be of adequate complementary foods, in addition to early stimulation activities;&#xD;
      educational material will be handed out: posters and brochures will serve to reinforce and&#xD;
      remind of the information given during appointments. Also, characteristics of the diet&#xD;
      consumed by mother and child will be recorded monthly, along with the physical activity&#xD;
      performed by the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The education intervention has as objective the acquiring of knowledge, motivation, creation&#xD;
      of an awareness of disease, adoption of healthy diet and physical activity; its components&#xD;
      will be individual sessions, group sessions, electronic messages, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE: The sample size necessary, with a 95% confidence interval and a power of 80%, is&#xD;
      645 mother-child pairs, among which 215 mother-child pairs will be included with mothers who&#xD;
      presented gestational diabetes and will receive the education intervention, and 430 pairs&#xD;
      without gestational diabetes (215 pairs with the education intervention and 215 with&#xD;
      conventional care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Anthropometric and biochemical data will be described using mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation for continuous variables, or percentages for nominal or ordinal variables.&#xD;
      The difference between variables of offspring of mothers with and without GDM, as well as the&#xD;
      difference between groups with and without education intervention, will be analyzed with&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test, Student t test, or chi square, as appropriate. Multivariate analysis&#xD;
      will be performed, using lineal regression in models of repeated measures, to evaluate the&#xD;
      association between 1) child weight-for-age (in Z score), and 2) mother's BMI, and the&#xD;
      education intervention or having presented GDM or no, according to the independent variable,&#xD;
      or the exposure that is being analyzed (effect of GDM or effect of the intervention),&#xD;
      controlling for possible confounding variables. Values of p&lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS: The education intervention was standardized in Boston, Mass, and will be&#xD;
      implemented with the adaptation necessary for our population, in order to evaluate if it is&#xD;
      better than the conventional treatment, for transference to the Family Medicine Units and&#xD;
      second-level hospitals that have Gineco-obstetric services in the IMSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included will be surveys on the opinion of doctors and participants to measure the&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results are: differences associated with the intervention in: a) body mass index and&#xD;
      weight-for-age, respectively, in the mother-child pair; b) speed of growth and growth&#xD;
      percentile score; as well as c) implementation of an education strategy that can be used as&#xD;
      part of the care the mother-child pair receives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DELIVERABLE PRODUCTS: Situational analysis of the mother-child pair, from the clinical point&#xD;
      of view, laboratory studies, databases, plan for implementation of this strategy in IMSS. In&#xD;
      addition, there will be databases that can be used for other analyses. DNA banks are&#xD;
      contemplated, from serum and plasma, for scientific questions derived from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOCIAL IMPACT: This study will offer a model that can be implemented in all hospitals of IMSS&#xD;
      that attend to births and/or cesareans. This will contribute to the timely prevention of&#xD;
      obesity in insured families of IMSS, with an eye towards making it extend both at the&#xD;
      national level for IMSS and for other health institutions. It is hoped that the education&#xD;
      strategy will be a tool that allows a reduction in the frequency of overweight, obesity, and&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus in our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF THE STUDY: 2 years.&#xD;
