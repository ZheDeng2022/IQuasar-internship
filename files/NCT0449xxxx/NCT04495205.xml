  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an era where less than ideal esthetics is not accepted, the request for esthetic&#xD;
      procedures is widely sought after. Melanin, a brown pigment, is the most common natural&#xD;
      pigment contributing to endogenous pigmentation of gingiva. It is a non-hemoglobin-derived&#xD;
      pigment formed by cells called melaonocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental cosmetic procedures including gingival depigmentation among the young generation are&#xD;
      vastly becoming popular due to the public advertising of what the &quot;ideal smile&quot; should be.&#xD;
      This means that brown/ pigmented gingiva is not esthetically accepted by modern standards.&#xD;
      Numerous techniques for depigmentation were developed including surgical abrasion, lasers,&#xD;
      chemicals and thermal techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of post-operative non-eugenol containing periodontal packs acts as a mechanical&#xD;
      barrier for coverage of the denuded area which prevents bleeding and promotes healing by&#xD;
      preventing trauma to the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) is a form of concentrated suspension of growth factors that&#xD;
      promote healing and tissue regeneration. Its use in the medical and dental fields is&#xD;
      expanding during the recent year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gingival depigmentation procedures especially bur abrasion and scalpel surgical techniques&#xD;
      require the use of post-operative periodontal pack. The periodontal pack protects the&#xD;
      surgical site from surface trauma, stops the post-operative bleeding and infection as well as&#xD;
      stabilizing the blood clot and accelerate healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a review article discussed the adverse effects of periodontal pack as it may cause&#xD;
      plaque induced inflammation, patient discomfort due to difficulty in eating and irritation of&#xD;
      the tissues. In the article, there were clinical trials that advocated that wound healing&#xD;
      could occur without the need of periodontal pack if the surgical wound was kept clean alone&#xD;
      indicating that the pack does not affect the wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This gave rise to idea to use a material that has been proven to accelerate wound healing and&#xD;
      decrease the patient discomfort to be placed under the periodontal pack which would be used&#xD;
      only as a protective barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies tested platelet rich concentrates as adjunctive methods under periodontal&#xD;
      packs verses periodontal packs alone after surgical abrasion of gingival depigmentation. They&#xD;
      found that there was a clinical, histological and statistical difference between the groups&#xD;
      favoring the platelet concentrate groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using PRF which is a second generation platelet concentrate first developed by Choukroun et&#xD;
      al in 2001 used as a membrane could provide accelerated wound healing properties which would&#xD;
      accelerate ginigival re-epithelization . Using a periodontal pack is conventionally used&#xD;
      which will provide a mechanical barrier to protect the wound from any stimulus.&#xD;
