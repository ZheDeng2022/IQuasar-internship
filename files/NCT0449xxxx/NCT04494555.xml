  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a repeated measures prospective study and is no greater than a minimal risk study.&#xD;
      All study procedures will be conducted at the Center for the Intrepid (CFI) through&#xD;
      collaborative efforts of the Military Performance Lab at the CFI and the Sanders lab at the&#xD;
      University of Washington. Data collected at the CFI will be coded, compiled, and shared with&#xD;
      the University of Washington investigators.The objective of the research is to test if&#xD;
      microprocessor-adjusting sockets improve Service member performance in Military specific&#xD;
      activities compared to (a) user- operated, motor-driven adjustable sockets (i.e. sockets&#xD;
      users adjust themselves), and (b) static (traditional) sockets. Investigators also test if&#xD;
      microprocessor-adjusting sockets better maintain socket fit and limb fluid volume, and if&#xD;
      self-reported outcomes are more favorable than for user-operated or static sockets. The&#xD;
      hypotheses to be tested include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During intense Military specific tasks, compared to the user-adjusted socket and the static&#xD;
      socket, the microprocessor-adjusting socket will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. minimize translational movement between the residual limb and the prosthetic socket;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. maintain residual limb fluid volume; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. maximize prosthetic socket comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When using the microprocessor-adjusting socket compared to the user-adjusted socket and the&#xD;
      static socket, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cover the greatest distance during a simulated combat patrol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. perform all high intensity Military specific tasks with less pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. perform a simulated combat patrol nearer to uninjured levels of performance; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. rank usability at a level similar to the static socket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fabricate microprocessor-adjusting sockets specific for Service members and Veterans&#xD;
           with goals of returning to high-level physical activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate Military task performance in Service members with transtibial amputation using&#xD;
           &quot;Readiness Assessments,&quot; while wearing three socket configurations:&#xD;
           microprocessor-adjusting, user-adjusting, and static&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Simulated combat patrol in a Virtual Realty Environment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Military version of a Functional Capacity Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterize user preference and usability of different socket configurations&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate the use of microprocessor-adjusting&#xD;
      sockets during &quot;Readiness Assessments&quot; of Military tasks performed by Service members with&#xD;
      transtibial amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the Center For the Intrepid (CFI) for up to 10 visits to complete a&#xD;
      pre-monitoring session (assess residual limb health and gather information regarding limb&#xD;
      fluid volume); socket fitting session(s) (fitting of three sockets- static socket, a&#xD;
      user-adjusted socket, and microprocessor-adjusting socket); and for military readiness&#xD;
      assessments for each of the three socket conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data across the three socket conditions (static socket, user adjusted socket, and&#xD;
      Microprocessor-adjusting sockets) will be tested for normality. When it normality can be&#xD;
      assumed, a single factor repeated measures ANOVA will test between socket conditions.&#xD;
      Mauchly's Test of Sphericity was be used to test if the variance is significantly different&#xD;
      across all of the conditions. If the sphericity condition is violated, a Greenhouse-Geisser&#xD;
      adjustment will be applied. When a significance effect is detected, pairwise comparisons&#xD;
      using a Tukey post-hoc will be performed to determine which conditions are significantly&#xD;
      different. When normality cannot be assumed, a Kruskal-Wallis H test will be used. When a&#xD;
      significance effect is detected, pairwise comparisons using a Mann-Whitney post-hoc while&#xD;
      adjusting the p-value for multiple comparisons will be performed to determine which&#xD;
      conditions are significantly different. Statistical significance will be set to p&lt;0.05&#xD;

    <description>Using measurements of limb-socket displacements from sensors embedded within the socket wall, adaptable sockets make small adjustments to socket size so as to maintain consistent displacements while prosthesis users are active. They do not require the user to stop activity or to touch or modify the prosthesis, and they do not distract users from their objectives.</description>

    <description>For the static socket configuration, both the microprocessor control and user control are disabled, and the panels are positioned in their flush configuration to create the user's as-prescribed socket shape.</description>

    <intervention_name>User adjusted socket</intervention_name>
    <description>Sockets are configured for user control by disabling automated control and enabling push buttons on the side of the socket to adjust socket size. Each button push effects a socket size change of approximately 0.3% volume. An upper button effects a socket size increase, and a lower button a socket size decrease. The buttons are countersunk so reduce risk of accidental pushes, and they do not function unless the user is stationary. An additional button push will not be executed until motor motion from the prior push has been completed. If a button is continuously held then the motor will continue moving until the button is released. Limits are set on cable length to ensure that sockets sizes threatening to the user's residual limb (too tight) are avoided. The push buttons effect inner-loop control that operates completely within the mechanism, achieving high-resolution adjustment of cable length with minimal error.</description>

    <intervention_name>Microprocessor-adjusting sockets</intervention_name>
    <description>A strategy for automatically controlling the size of the socket during walking to compensate for unknown changes in limb volume will be used. The controller is essentially a regulator that continuously measures socket &quot;fit,&quot; and adjusts the socket to maintain a prescribed reference set point. Because the fit is automatically sustained, the prosthesis user is unaware of its operation.</description>
