      This study is a randomized, multi-center, open-label, phase II study of a PD-1 inhibitor&#xD;
      (INCMGA00012) versus observation as consolidation therapy after definitive concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced ESCC who have not progressed following&#xD;
      definitive chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have received definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced ESCC&#xD;
      (cT1b N1-3 M0 or T2-4b N0-3 M0 according to the 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC]&#xD;
      staging system) because of unresectable disease status (such as cervical esophageal cancer&#xD;
      and cTb), medically inoperable status, or patient's refusal of undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must not have progressed following definitive chemoradiotherapy consisting of&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine or taxane plus platinum chemotherapy (including, but not limited to&#xD;
      fluorouracil plus cisplatin, capecitabine plus cisplatin, and paclitaxel plus carboplatin&#xD;
      according to the institute standard of care regimens) concurrent with radiation therapy (a&#xD;
      total dose of at least 50 Gy). One or two cycles of induction chemotherapy before&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy is allowed, but chemotherapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy is not&#xD;
      allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 110 patients who have not progressed following definitive chemoradiotherapy for&#xD;
      locally advanced ESCC will be randomly assigned within 4-8 weeks after completing&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy in a 1:1 ratio to the INCMGA00012 arm or observation arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  INCMGA00012 arm (500 mg iv every 4 weeks for up to 12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observation arm (followed-up every 3 months) Randomization will be stratified by Eastern&#xD;
           Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0-1 vs. 2), clinical response to&#xD;
           definitive chemoradiation (complete response [CR] vs. non-CR), and institute.&#xD;
