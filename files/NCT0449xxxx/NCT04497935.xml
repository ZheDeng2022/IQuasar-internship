  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compare the quality of bowel preparation between two groups of patients, who will undergo two&#xD;
      different preparations: 1. Moviprep + diet; 2. Plenvu + diet&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quality of bowel preparation is essential for the success of a colonoscopy, reducing&#xD;
      colonoscopy duration, and increasing the rate of cecal intubation and of polyp detection.&#xD;
      There are several types of preparations available on the market and, irrespective of the&#xD;
      choice, the split-dose regimen should be followed. A reduced volume preparation makes the&#xD;
      process easier and more tolerable, increasing adhesion. Regarding the diet to be applied&#xD;
      before the examination, there are no advantages to a liquid diet compared to a low fiber&#xD;
      diet, and there is no evidence on the duration of the diet. In addition, a restrictive diet&#xD;
      has an impact on satisfaction and also on adherence to treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receiving 1LPEG who had a colonoscopy in the morning were advised to follow a day-before dosing regimen, where, at 7:00 pm the day before the colonoscopy, they prepared the Dose 1 sachet in 500 mL of water and consumed it over a period of 30 minutes, followed by 500 mL of clear liquids. The second dose was then taken at 11:00 pm by mixing the two Dose 2 sachets in a single glass of 500 mL of water and consuming them over 30 minutes, followed by 500 mL of clear liquids. If the colonoscopy was scheduled for the afternoon, the same dosing instructions were given, but the first dose was taken at 7:00 am on the day of the procedure, and the second dose began at 10:00 am.</description>

    <description>Patients receiving 2LPEG who had a colonoscopy in the morning were asked to follow a similar day-before dosing regimen, where, at 7:00 pm the day before the colonoscopy, the first 1L dose was consumed over a 1-hour period, followed by the second dose at 11:00 pm. For 2LPEG patients with procedures in the afternoon, they took Dose 1 at 7:00 am and Dose 2 at 10:00 am. Any patient receiving 2LPEG was also told to consume 1L of clear liquids during the preparation procedure.</description>
