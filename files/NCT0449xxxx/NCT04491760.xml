  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is uncommon high among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which&#xD;
      increases adverse clinical events and prolongs the hospital stay. Inspiratory muscle training&#xD;
      (IMT) is able to improve inspiratory muscle strength and prevent pneumonia in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery including coronary artery bypass grafting. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      design the study mainly aim to evaluate the 30 days IMT for the change of inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength, and also to observe its potentially effect on reducing pneumonia, in participants&#xD;
      who accepted primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and at a high risk of&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;

    <description>Static maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) will be selected for the estimation of inspiratory muscle strength. A standard measurement using Powerbreathe® K5 and according to &quot;ERS Statement on Respiratory Muscle Testing at Rest and during Exercise&quot; published by European Respiratory Society (ERS) will be taken (Laveneziana, 2019). MIP test will be performed at baseline and at 30 days.</description>

    <measure>Pneumonia</measure>

    <description>The diagnosis of pneumonia is based on guidelines of the American Thoracic Society [American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), 2005]. The events of pneumonia will be followed and recorded by experienced doctors when in hospital. After discharged, participants will be followed by the experienced researches, once pneumonia is considered as possible, guidance will be provided for the participants to complete necessary examines, until 30 days.</description>

    <description>The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) will be carried out with a load of 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) using a threshold inspiratory muscle trainer (c-type, Shengchang medical equipment factory, Yuyao city, China) at the beginning. During the hospital period, the resistance will increase incrementally, based on the rate of perceived exertion scored on the Borg scale (Borg, 1982). If the rate of perceived exertion less than 5, the resistance of the inspiratory threshold trainer will then be increase incrementally by 5%. The load for home-based IMT training will be set as the highest training load in the hospital. All patients will be required in sitting position during training, wearing nose-clips.</description>
