  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During military action there might be situations where civil requirements for blood&#xD;
      transfusion are not obtainable. Numerous warfare experiences suggest that administration of&#xD;
      whole blood to a patient with uncontrollable bleeding/bleeding shock will improve survival in&#xD;
      case of delayed evacuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among Norwegian troops this gives one of two choices:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A soldier donates blood to a wounded fellow soldier&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Personnel in safe distance donates blood and it is transported to the frontline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative b might implicate frequent donations and unused blood must be auto-re-transfused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can 'buddy transfusion' in the field be justified also in medical aspects?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can repeated donations and auto-transfusions of transported whole blood into&#xD;
           personnel(X) be justified also in medical aspects?&#xD;
&#xD;
      (X) Blood typed and screened for HIV, HBV, HCV, Syphilis before assignment&#xD;

      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the research ethics committee of the Regional West Health Trust,&#xD;
      Norway. Twenty-five nonsmoking male soldiers, median age 29 years, from a Navy special forces&#xD;
      unit consented to participate. Mean body mass index was 24.7 kg/m2 (range, 22.6-28.3 kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study and we were not able to find data in the literature providing&#xD;
      information for power calculations regarding the testing we included in the study. The&#xD;
      participants were divided in three different groups for testing. The grouping was based on&#xD;
      availability at the given time points, and there was no selection to any specific group:&#xD;
      Group 1-Bruce protocol treadmill stress test, push-ups, and pull-ups (n = 7); Group&#xD;
      2-50-round pistol shooting test (n = 12); and Group 3-uphill hiking exercise carrying a 20-kg&#xD;
      backpack (n = 6). Each group was tested twice, before and immediately after donation of 450&#xD;
      mL of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The soldiers were allowed to rehydrate during the donation procedure and theywere all offered&#xD;
      a 0.5-L water bottle. The exact volume each participant consumed was not recorded. All 25&#xD;
      soldiers participated in a 60-minute training program aimed at testing whether it is possible&#xD;
      to teach nonmedic soldiers buddy transfusion during a short period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multistage treadmill stress test, push-ups, and pull-ups&#xD;
&#xD;
      VO2 max was estimated in seven soldiers. Bruce protocol was followed, using a multistaged&#xD;
      treadmill test. Each stage lasted for 3 minutes, and in total seven stages were included in&#xD;
      the procedure. For each stage, belt velocity and slope were increased (see Table 1). The&#xD;
      soldiers ran until exhaustion (unable to continue running). Heart rate and lactate were&#xD;
      measured at the end of each stage and at exhaustion when total time on belt (T) was noted.&#xD;
      Lactate was measured in a blood sample from the ear lobule and a portable lactate analyzer&#xD;
      (Lactate Scout, EKF Diagnostics, Barleben, Germany) was used. From the total run time used,&#xD;
      VO2 max was estimated as follows:14 VO2 max = 14.8-(1.379 ¥ T) + (0.451 ¥ T2) - (0.012 ¥ T3).&#xD;
      The pushups were performed as &quot;full push-up&quot; in the prone position, with the back and legs&#xD;
      straight and off the floor. The hands were placed below each shoulder, with arms fully&#xD;
      extended. From this start position, the body was lowered by using the arms until the chest&#xD;
      touched the floor, and then back to the start position. Standard pull-ups were performed as a&#xD;
      dead-hang pull-up, with an overhand grip. Then the body was pulled up until the chin cleared&#xD;
      the bar, and finished by lowering the body until arms and shoulders were fully extended A&#xD;
      baseline test (predonation test) was performed 4 days prior to donation, and the postdonation&#xD;
      test immediately after donating blood. The soldiers performed the procedures until they were&#xD;
      unable to continue. The test endpoint was differences in estimated VO2 max, maximum heart&#xD;
      rate (HRmax), lactate, and number of push-ups and pull-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-round pistol shooting test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve soldiers performed a standard Navy special operational forces protocol rapid shooting&#xD;
      test, using their personalweapon (9 mm).The protocol has five separate tests, each with 10&#xD;
      rounds (6 mnondominant hand, 10 mdominant hand, 10 m 2 + 1, 18 m precision, 25 m precision).&#xD;
      The predonation test was performed 2 days before donation, and the postdonation test&#xD;
      immediately after donating blood. The weather and light conditions were similar on the test&#xD;
      days. The study outcome in this exercise was differences in total hits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uphill hiking exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six soldiers were tested on an uphill exercise carrying a 20-kg backpack. The track had a 28%&#xD;
      slope and 450-m altitude difference; the soldiers were instructed to walk as a group, and no&#xD;
      individual time measurements could therefore be recorded. The soldiers walked up and down&#xD;
      again as quickly as they were able to (no running) before they donated 1 unit of blood. They&#xD;
      thenwere offered water (ad libitum) to rehydrate without any further break before they&#xD;
      repeated the exercise, again walking as quickly as the group managed. The endpoint was the&#xD;
      difference in time used by the team on the uphill part of the track. The soldiers also filled&#xD;
      in a questionnaire to report possible side effects related to the donation and the&#xD;
      postdonation performance.&#xD;
