  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single arm, open-label, prospective study of patient-reported outcomes of&#xD;
      patients with bilateral implantation of the Vivity or Vivity Toric implant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing diffractive extended depth of focus (EDOF) lenses provide two adjacent &quot;zones&quot; of&#xD;
      uncorrected vision (distance and intermediate or intermediate and near) but have a track&#xD;
      record of frequent patient dissatisfaction because of unwanted visual side effects, &quot;spider&#xD;
      webs&quot; or haloes. The Vivity non-diffractive EDOF lens offers this same range ofvision with&#xD;
      contrast sensitivity similar to a monofocal lens, which suggests fewer side effects will be&#xD;
      encountered in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to measure postoperative patient-reported outcomes with this new lens&#xD;
      implant. Previous studies we have conducted on the bilateral ReSTOR 3.0, ReSTOR with&#xD;
      ActiveFocus 2.5 (mixed with 3.0 and alone with mini-monovision) have shown high satisfaction,&#xD;
      spectacle independence, and acceptable glare and halo profiles using a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire instrument developed by MDbackline, Inc. The postoperative portions of this&#xD;
      study will be designed to mirror those previous studies using the same instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive the Vivity or Vivity Toric implant binocularly with a target of&#xD;
      plano sphere.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cataract and otherwise healthy eyes, not exhibiting any significant&#xD;
             ocular morbidity that would be expected to influence outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients implanted with Vivity or Vivity Toric lenses bilaterally within 6 months of&#xD;
             the survey administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose postoperative manifest refraction at the time of the survey is within ±&#xD;
             0.5 D sphere and ≤0.75 D of cylindrical refraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have given consent to participate in the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with visually significant co-morbidities (corneal, retina, optic nerve&#xD;
             disease) that could affect their satisfaction with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with surgical complications either during or after surgery (capsule tears,&#xD;
             iris trauma, decentered IOL, cystoid macular edema, etc.) that would, the judgement of&#xD;
             the investigator, influence the outcome measures of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous refractive surgery within the past 6 months prior to cataract&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with &gt; grade 1 posterior capsule opacity at their last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not meet the refractive endpoints described in the Inclusion Criteria.&#xD;
