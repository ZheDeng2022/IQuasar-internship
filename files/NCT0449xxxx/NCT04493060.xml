  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well niraparib and dostarlimab work in treating patients with&#xD;
      germline or somatic BRCA1/2 and PALB2 mutated pancreatic cancer that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic). Niraparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      dostarlimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving niraparib and dostarlimab may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine antitumor activity as measured by disease control rate at 12 weeks (DCR12) as&#xD;
      assessed using immune-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) in&#xD;
      select homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficient pancreatic cancer patients with HRR&#xD;
      deficiency (defined as mutations in BRCA 1/ 2, or PALB2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess adverse events according to the current National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and other safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the time to next treatment (TTNT), objective response rate (ORR), time to and&#xD;
      duration of response and duration of confirmed stable disease according to iRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess progression-free survival. IV. To assess overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and serum markers of immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profile after therapy with a PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor (i) and a PD-1 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To study mechanisms of resistance in ctDNA profile after therapy with a PARPi and a PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the tumor microenvironment for immune related changes (immune infiltration,&#xD;
      PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TIL]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess genetic profile of the tumor pre- and post-treatment. VI. To determine changes&#xD;
      in the cytokine profile pre- and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Patients also receive&#xD;
      dostarlimab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks (Q3W) for cycles 1-4&#xD;
      and every 6 weeks (Q6W) for subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months&#xD;
      until progressive disease (PD), and then every 6 months for up to 5 years after registration.&#xD;

                  confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure, otherwise the patient&#xD;
                  must be willing to use an adequate barrier method throughout the study, starting&#xD;
                  with the screening visit through 180 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
                  Information must be captured appropriately within the site's source documents.&#xD;
                  Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred&#xD;
                  contraception for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis) that in the investigators opinion would&#xD;
             preclude participation within the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any gastro-intestinal conditions that to the judgement of the investigator would&#xD;
             interfere with the absorption of niraparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, known or suspected unstable auto-immune disease, are excluded from this study.&#xD;
             Exceptions to this criterion are all auto-immune disease that have remained stable&#xD;
             within the past 3 months on corticosteroids (=&lt; prednisone 20 mg or equivalent) prior&#xD;
             to first study treatment are allowed to enroll. Patients with autoimmune diseases that&#xD;
             do not require active immunosuppression are also allowed to enroll&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Paraneoplastic disease as a cause of auto-immune phenomenon will not be&#xD;
                  considered as auto-immune disease and are allowed to enroll&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of serious uncontrolled medical disorder, active infection or mental disorder&#xD;
             that, to the judgement of the investigator, makes it undesirable for the subject to&#xD;
             participate in the study or that would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
             Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent&#xD;
             (within 90 days) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable&#xD;
             spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, or any psychiatric disorder that&#xD;
             prohibits obtaining informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy which required active systemic treatment within 2 years prior to&#xD;
             first study treatment. Exceptions are: successfully treated squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the skin, superficial bladder cancer, and in situ carcinoma of the cervix. Since&#xD;
             patients with BRCA 1/2 or PALB2 can have other tumors, as long as they have been&#xD;
             definitively treated, it would not be considered an exclusion&#xD;
