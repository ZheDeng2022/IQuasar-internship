    <textblock>
      Management of postoperative analgesia following breast surgery extending beyond a simple&#xD;
      lumpectomy can sometimes be a challenge, especially when such surgery is being performed as a&#xD;
      day-case procedure. Patients undergoing mastectomy have a very high possibility of developing&#xD;
      postsurgical pain syndrome, as high as 20% to 50%.There has been some evidence to suggest&#xD;
      regional analgesia techniques reduce the incidence of postsurgical pain in patients&#xD;
      undergoing mastectomy. This underlines the importance of performing regional anaesthetic and&#xD;
      analgesic techniques for postoperative analgesia following breast surgery.There are many&#xD;
      techniques of regional analgesia as thorasic epidural block , paravertebral block , PECS1&#xD;
      block ,PECS2 block , and recently erector spinae plan block.Paravertebral blocks have&#xD;
      superseded thoracic epidurals when it comes to choice of a regional anaesthesia technique to&#xD;
      provide analgesia for breast surgery.The injection of local anaesthetic solution in the&#xD;
      paravertebral space results in a unilateral block, which is sensory, motor, and sympathetic.&#xD;
      The uptake of the local anaesthetic solution is enhanced due to the absence of fascial&#xD;
      sheaths binding the spinal nerves.TPVB produces ipsilateral somatic and sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      blockade due to a direct effect of the local anesthetic on the somatic and sympathetic nerves&#xD;
      in the TPVS, extension into the intercostal space laterally, and the epidural space medially.&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane (US-ESP) block is a novel analgesic technique, in&#xD;
      which local anaesthetic is injected into fascial plane deep to erector spinae muscle. It is&#xD;
      possible to block the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerve depending on the level of&#xD;
      injection and amount of local anaesthetic injected. Erector spinae block (ESP) leads to&#xD;
      effective post-operative analgesia where it is performed at T4-5 level for breast cancer and&#xD;
      thoracic surgery , when performed bilaterally it has been reported to be as effective as&#xD;
      thoracic epidural analgesia.The drug spreads in craniocaudal fashion over several levels as&#xD;
      the erector spinae fascia extends from nuchal fascia cranially to the sacrum caudally. Forero&#xD;
      et al. recently described US-ESP block for thoracic neuropathic pain. This block could be&#xD;
      effective in both acute post-operative thoracic and abdominal surgeries and also neuropathic&#xD;
      pain in these regions.&#xD;
