  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza infection is an important public health priority, with seasonal outbreaks and&#xD;
      pandemics causing considerable global morbidity and mortality. The PK, pharmacodynamics (PD),&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of IV zanamivir have been evaluated in adults, adolescents and infants&#xD;
      more than or equal to (&gt;=)6 months of age with hospitalized influenza in the IV zanamivir&#xD;
      global development program. However, antiviral treatment of neonates and infants under 6&#xD;
      months of age hospitalized with influenza infection remains a medical unmet need. Given the&#xD;
      immaturity of the immune system at this age, there are no licensed influenza vaccines for&#xD;
      children aged less than six months old. As a requirement of the Pediatric Investigation Plan&#xD;
      European Union (EU), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will be conducting this open-label, multi-center,&#xD;
      single arm, post-marketing authorization study to evaluate the PK and also collect safety and&#xD;
      tolerability information of IV zanamivir in hospitalized neonates and infants under 6 months&#xD;
      of age with confirmed complicated influenza infection. The total duration of study&#xD;
      participation for each participant will be up to 24 days, a study treatment period up to 10&#xD;
      days and 14 days post-treatment follow up period. However, for a given participant, the&#xD;
      initial 5-day treatment course may be extended for up to 5 additional days if clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, participant characteristics or virological tests as assessed by the investigator&#xD;
      warrant further treatment.&#xD;
