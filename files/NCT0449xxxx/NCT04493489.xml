  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer (bladder cancer) is the tenth most common cancer in the world, ranking 13th in&#xD;
      the number of deaths. There are about 549000 new cases of bladder cancer worldwide, with&#xD;
      200000 deaths and a higher incidence rate in men than in women. In 2013, the incidence rate&#xD;
      of bladder cancer was high in China, accounting for 2.02% of all new cases. Bladder cancer&#xD;
      has become a major disease threatening people's life and health. Therefore, the exploration&#xD;
      of the mechanism of the occurrence and development of bladder cancer and effective drugs has&#xD;
      been an important focus of bladder cancer research. The current treatment of bladder cancer&#xD;
      is mainly TURBT (transurethral resection of bladder tumour) resection and BCG, chemotherapy&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment, but its recurrence and metastasis still exist, so this study aims to&#xD;
      explore an effective drug treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of propranolol in adjuvant BCG therapy, and whether propranolol can effectively&#xD;
      alleviate the metastasis and recurrence of bladder cancer and improve the survival time after&#xD;
      bladder cancer surgery.&#xD;
