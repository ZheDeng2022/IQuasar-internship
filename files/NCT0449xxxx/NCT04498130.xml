  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the number of cancer survivors grows and expected survival time increases, the health&#xD;
      behaviors of this population are gaining significant attention from the research and public&#xD;
      health community. Adoption or maintenance of healthy lifestyles after cancer has the&#xD;
      potential to reduce both cancer- and non-cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Exercise&#xD;
      adoption and maintenance remains a significant challenge for adults, especially clinical&#xD;
      populations such as cancer survivors who may struggle with comorbidities, symptoms and&#xD;
      side-effects of the disease or medications, and overall compromised health and functioning. A&#xD;
      number of site-based exercise interventions have been conducted to promote physical activity,&#xD;
      often using a theoretical basis to design and execute the intervention. Although these&#xD;
      programs are successful in exposing cancer survivors to regular physical activity, they often&#xD;
      struggle with exercise maintenance after the conclusion of the structured site-based group&#xD;
      exercise sessions. The goal of the proposed project is to enhance physical activity&#xD;
      engagement among adult cancer survivors by designing a home-based program using the&#xD;
      socio-ecological framework and employing constructs from social cognitive theory to guide&#xD;
      participants through the project.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in the intervention arm will answer Likert-format questions relating to their preference, tolerance and usage of the Zoom-based group meetings to promote physical activity levels. The scale will use a 1-5 rating, with 1 being lowest preference/displeased and 10 being the highest preference/very pleased.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire (developed by Rosenberg et al., 2010) will be administered at baseline,12 weeks and 24 weeks to assess participants' time spent sitting. Questions relating to sedentary behavior cover both weekday and weekend sitting time, as well as domain-specific sedentary behaviors (i.e. occupational, transportation, and leisure sitting time).Response options for the amount of time engaged in each behavior include: none, 15 minutes or less, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, or 6 hours or more. For scoring, the time spent in each behavior is converted into hours, and the hours per day for each item are summed separately for weekdays and weekend days. Higher scores indicate higher amounts of daily sitting time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of the exercise manual</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in both groups will answer Likert-format questions relating to their preference, usage and perceived helpfulness of the study-specific exercise manual. The scale will use a 1-10 rating, with 1 being lowest preference/displeased and 10 being the highest preference/very pleased.</description>

    <measure>Change in physical activity engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Godin-Shepard Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire will be administered at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks to assess individuals' reported weekly frequency of engaging in light, moderate and strenuous vigorous-intensity exercise. For each intensity level, participants will report the number of times per week they engaged in an exercise bout &gt;=10 minutes and the average duration of the bouts. For each intensity level, the number of bouts per week will be multiplied by the average duration per bout to reflect participant's average activity level.</description>

    <description>The 12-week theory-based physical activity intervention will involve mailing participants an exercise manual with health and exercise information (i.e. information about exercising safely, modules related to the social cognitive theory, weekly goal setting worksheets, exercise-tracking logs, etc.), a resistance band, and a standard Omron pedometer. Participants will receive a weekly 30-minute Zoom--based group meetings to discuss different strategies to begin and maintain a consistent exercise routine and access to a social media page to facilitate social support and interaction among the group participants. Participants will be able to join the group if they would like, but it will not be required. Participants will be encouraged to connect with each other to promote social support and social modeling. Lastly participants will receive a weekly exercise video to follow along with on their own time and tailored weekly step goals.</description>

    <description>The education group participants will receive the same exercise manual, fitness items, exercise videos, and same weekly tailored step goal as the 12-week intervention group. This group will not have weekly zoom discussions, or be a part of the same social media page as the 12-week intervention group. Instead, the education group will be contacted by research staff once a week via telephone to discuss their manuals and activity for the week, and to ensure they have been safely engaging in exercise. A separate social media page will be created for this group, where pre-existing materials related to physical activity recommendations, benefits, other resources, and more will be shared.</description>
