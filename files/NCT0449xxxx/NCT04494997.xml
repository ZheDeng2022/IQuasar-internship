    <textblock>
      Social Media has significant influence in everyone's life. Social media is considered as one&#xD;
      of the biggest revolution in the information technology. It empowers the users to express and&#xD;
      share their thoughts, opinions, views, and content to the rest of the world. Entire world id&#xD;
      just a click away from the Social Media users. Social media gives an immense opportunity to&#xD;
      grow through right connectivity and collaboration. Healthcare professionals are no exception&#xD;
      for this. Healthcare professionals can make appropriate use of Social media for public&#xD;
      outreach with their content and educate them. Social Media with its tools enables the&#xD;
      professionals to create multimedia content to engage the audiences. It also improves&#xD;
      professional connectivity and better public display of professional skills. These can enhance&#xD;
      the professional growth through public availability and accessibility. Social Media giants in&#xD;
      the recent times were also blamed for data privacy and protection. There are issues of&#xD;
      excessive indulgence into privacy through access of users' locations and contacts. Overt&#xD;
      advertisements and unnecessary tagging to the content by unknown users cannot be ignored. Our&#xD;
      cross sectional study is aimed to understand Dentist' perspective at professional level,&#xD;
      regarding their use, advantages and disadvantages of Social Media.&#xD;
