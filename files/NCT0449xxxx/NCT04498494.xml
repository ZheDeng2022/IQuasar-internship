  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to investigate ECG findings of patients with acute&#xD;
      myocarditis, ECG findings associated with fulminant myocarditis, and the characteristics of&#xD;
      ST-elevation on admission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Acute myocarditis is a severe disease with high mortality rate and various dynamic changes&#xD;
      visible on electrocardiograms (ECGs). The aim were to investigate ECG findings in acute&#xD;
      myocarditis, ECG findings associated with fulminant myocarditis (FM), and the characteristics&#xD;
      of ST elevation at admission. A retrospective analysis of 1814 ECGs was conducted from 274&#xD;
      consecutive patients with acute myocarditis aged ≥13 years, who were hospitalized in two&#xD;
      centres between August 2007 and November 2019. All ECG obtained during the hospital course&#xD;
      were evaluated by 2 electrophysiologists. A chi-square test was used to evaluate and compare&#xD;
      the abnormal ECG findings between the FM and non-FM groups, and multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis was performed to further evaluate ECG findings associated with FM. The&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the duration of cardiac symptoms before admission for&#xD;
      ST elevation at admission.&#xD;

    <description>The diagnosis of acute myocarditis was confirmed by a recent history of gastrointestinal/upper respiratory tract infection and/or complaints of cardiac symptoms and increasing cardiac markers and/or presentation with a new abnormality of the 12-lead ECGcombined with at least one of the following: ⅰ) Active or borderline biopsy according to the Dallas criteria (13); ⅱ) positive infectious origin of ventricular dysfunction; ⅲ) delayed enhancement on cardiac MRI consistent with myocarditis; or ⅳ) serological tests, ECGs, ultrasonic cardiogram (UCG), coronary angiography and ventriculography to exclude acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stress cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, myocarditis secondary to sepsis, valve disease, hyperthyroidism, autoimmune disease and rheumatic fever</description>

    <description>In patients with acute myocarditis, a diagnosis of FM was determined upon identification of one or more of the following: Haemodynamic instability due to cardiogenic shock or arrhythmia; left ventricular dysfunction and low cardiac output syndrome requiring inotropes or mechanical circulatory support; mechanical ventilation; and/or cardiac arrest (CA)</description>
