  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to determine the incidence of dysphagia and vocal fold mobility&#xD;
      impairment (VFMI) in individuals undergoing cardiovascular surgical procedures. It also seeks&#xD;
      to determine the impact of postoperative swallowing impairment on health-related outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing impairment and VFMI are common, yet often overlooked, complications of&#xD;
      cardiovascular surgical procedures. The true incidence of both dysphagia and VFMI in this&#xD;
      patient population is unclear due to a lack of rigorous study using instrumental assessment&#xD;
      techniques and validated outcomes in all patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The&#xD;
      study is therefore aimed to determine the incidence of dysphagia and VFMI in this patient&#xD;
      population and to characterize impairment profiles related to swallowing safety and&#xD;
      efficiency. In addition, the study is also aimed to assess the relative impact of VFMI and&#xD;
      dysphagia on health-related outcomes such as length of hospital stay, pneumonia, sepsis,&#xD;
      reintubation, and discharge status. We will identify risk factors for postoperative dysphagia&#xD;
      and VFMI in cardiovascular patients to build a practical electronic risk-stratification tool.&#xD;
      We also aim to identify sensitive bedside clinical markers of dysphagia in postoperative&#xD;
      cardiovascular patients to develop a bedside screening tool. All participants will undergo&#xD;
      two research visits (one preoperatively and one postoperatively) where they will undergo an&#xD;
      instrumental swallowing test and complete several patient report outcomes and clinical tests.&#xD;
      If they are found to have dysphagia after surgery, they will be offered no-cost follow up&#xD;
      swallow tests at months 1 and 6. Finally, health-related outcomes will be indexed in enrolled&#xD;
      participants to determine the impact of dysphagia.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (Prior to surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a validated measure used by trained blinded clinicians to assign ratings of safety to swallowing bolus trials. The development and use of an 8-point, equal-appearing interval scale (8 being best; 1 being worst) to describe penetration and aspiration events are described. Scores are determined primarily by the depth to which material passes in the airway and by whether or not material entering the airway is expelled. (FEES)</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cardiovascular Surgical Patients Preoperative Exam</arm_group_label>
    <description>All enrolled participants will undergo a baseline Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) before their surgery to determine baseline / preoperative swallowing function. Those with confirmed dysphagia will not be asked to complete the postoperative swallowing exam, given our desire to examine contributing risk factors for dysphagia development and mechanisms within cardiovascular surgical patients. In addition to the instrumental exam, systematic collection of demographic, medical, surgical, and intubation-related candidate predictor variables will be conducted over the entire perioperative period.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cardiovascular Surgical Patients Postoperative Exam</arm_group_label>
    <description>All remaining participants without preoperative dysphagia will be seen for a postoperative exam performed within 48 hours of extubation. Simultaneous imaging using FEES and videofluoroscopy will be performed at the bedside, as well as a battery of clinical tests. Completion of these postoperative tests will indicate study completion for participants without evidence of dysphagia, while participants who demonstrate acute-phase postoperative dysphagia will continue to participate if they desire. During their standard of care one-month follow-up appointment, a third research evaluation will be offered for participants with previously identified postoperative dysphagia. During this exam, the same imaging and clinical tests from the previous research exam will be performed. Finally, participants with persisting dysphagia will be offered the opportunity to continue to be studied for a fourth and final research exam during their standard of care six-month follow up clinic visit.</description>

    <description>This procedure involves inserting a flexible laryngoscope that contains a light source and video camera on the end through the open passage of the nose towards the back of the throat in order to visualize the swallowing mechanism. The participant will be asked to perform some voicing tasks, once completed, a videofluoroscopic swallowing exam will occur at the same time. This is like moving x-ray of the participant swallowing foods and liquids (barium).</description>

    <description>Cough PEF will be performed to index a participant's physiologic airway defense capacity and strength. Testing will occur with the participant seated upright at 90 degrees using an analog peak flow meter with a one-way expiratory valve that prevents a participant from breathing air in from the device to reduce contamination.</description>
