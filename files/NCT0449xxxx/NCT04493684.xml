  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      single- and repeat-dose escalation study including a weekly oral dose (MAD) cohort and a&#xD;
      relative bioavailability (RBA) and food effect (FE) cohort to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and PK of VH3739937 in healthy participants. This is a three part study. Part 1&#xD;
      and Part 2 is designed to gain information on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) properties of GSK3739937 when administered as powder-in-a-bottle (PiB). Part 3 will&#xD;
      evaluate the RBA of the GSK3739937 PiB and GSK3739937 Tablet and the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      PK parameters of the tablet formulation when administered under fasting and fed conditions.&#xD;
