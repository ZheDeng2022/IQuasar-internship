  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Exercise has been proven to effectively reduce incidence of diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. However, there is controversial data from prior studies to inform the&#xD;
      type of exercise training recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study will determine the differences of different type of exercise in&#xD;
      the effects of reducing insulin resistance and visceral adipose tissue for community&#xD;
      residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The four-arm randomized controlled trial will conducted in adults aged 40 to 70&#xD;
      years old in Tainan. A total of at least 177 patients will randomly assign to the group of&#xD;
      aerobic exercise (AE), aerobic exercise combined with resistance exercise (RE), AE combined&#xD;
      with medium intensity interval training, and placebo. The participants in exercise group will&#xD;
      received 12 weeks, 3 times per week program, including twice a week intervention guided by&#xD;
      the intervenors, and once a week exercise guided by the video at home. All the exercise keeps&#xD;
      moderate-intensity by monitoring with 64%-75% of the maximum heart rate. Insulin resistance&#xD;
      status will be checked by HOMA index at baseline and at exercise intervention after 12 weeks&#xD;
      (HOMA index= insulin μU/mL）× glucose（mmol/L）/22.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance to clinical practice: The research findings will help the clinical health works to&#xD;
      know which type of exercise is the best choice in reducing insulin resistance and visceral&#xD;
      adipose tissue in community residents, and can be promoted to the general public to reduce&#xD;
      the prevalence of metabolic syndrome as well as prevent the root causes of ill health.&#xD;
