    <textblock>
      A Quality Improvement Project was undertaken to improve the completion of operative consent&#xD;
      forms within a UK hospital plastic surgery department. Four weekly interventions were made&#xD;
      which were accompanied by four further data collection cycles.&#xD;

      Background Royal College of Surgeons guidelines exist on the importance of full, accurate and&#xD;
      legible completion of consent forms as a key part of the process of gaining informed consent.&#xD;
      In addition to this, consent forms serve as an important medico-legal document to protect&#xD;
      clinicians and patients should problems arise. It is therefore in all parties' interests that&#xD;
      they are correctly completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was noted that consent forms within the Royal London Hospital Plastic Surgery department&#xD;
      were often not correctly completed. A Quality Improvement Project was undertaken to improve&#xD;
      the completion of consent forms within the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Common problem areas on consent forms were identified and QI&#xD;
      methodology was used to design the study including selection of appropriate outcome, process&#xD;
      and balancing measures. Baseline information on completion of: 1) patient details, 2)&#xD;
      consultant details, 3) legibility, 4) use of abbreviations in description of&#xD;
      operation/complications, and 5) patient signatures was collected. Four weekly interventions&#xD;
      were made which were accompanied by four further data collection cycles. A further re-audit&#xD;
      took place 4 months following the completion of the project to establish whether improvements&#xD;
      had been sustained.&#xD;
