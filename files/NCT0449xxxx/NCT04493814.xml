  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an emergent disease worldwide, and soon the&#xD;
      leading cause of hepatic transplant in the USA. Among this high number of patients, the&#xD;
      current challenge is to detect or even predict patients at risk of inflammation (Non&#xD;
      Alcoholic or Steatohepatitis or NASH) and end-stage fibrosis, which are the best predictors&#xD;
      of liver-related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visceral obesity is intimately associated with metabolic disease and adverse health outcomes,&#xD;
      such as diabetes, and NAFLD. It has been demonstrated that visceral adipose tissue-linked&#xD;
      inflammation was a risk factor of stroke, myocardial infarction, and others metabolic-related&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the quantity and percentage of&#xD;
      Visceral Adipose Tissue by Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry and liver stiffness by Fibroscan in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes, and other predictors of fibrosis such as FIB-4 and Fibrotest.&#xD;
      We retrospectively collected the data of all the diabetic patients who had undergone a DEXA&#xD;
      and a Fibroscan between January 1st, 2014 and Decembre 31th, 2019, in the Universitary&#xD;
      Hospital of Nancy, France.&#xD;
