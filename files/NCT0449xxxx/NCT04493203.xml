  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase II trial of nivolumab plus axitinib for patients with unresectable stage III or&#xD;
      IV melanoma who have progressed on prior anti-PD1 therapy with or without concomitant&#xD;
      anti-CTLA4 therapy. Patients will receive treatment with nivolumab 480 mg intravenously every&#xD;
      4 weeks and axitinib 5 mg twice daily by mouth. Patients may continue both agents for up to&#xD;
      two years if they do not experience disease progression or dose-limiting toxicities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial hypothesizes that decreasing hypoxia in the TME will re-sensitize melanoma tumors&#xD;
      to anti-PD1 therapy. Axitinib has already been safely combined with anti-PD1 therapy and was&#xD;
      overall well-tolerated. With nivolumab plus axitinib taken together, based on previously&#xD;
      published work and data from our laboratories, it is hypothesized that axitinib can&#xD;
      metabolically remodel the TME to render it more sensitive to ICB, specifically by reducing&#xD;
      intra-tumoral hypoxia, increasing T cell infiltration, and increasing polyfunctional T cells.&#xD;
      It will determined if treatment with nivolumab plus axitinib will prolong both&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival.&#xD;

    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) will be estimated by the percentage of patients who achieve Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as best response by RECIST v1.1 criteria (with exact 95% CI). Per RECIST v1.1, Complete Response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial Response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

    <description>Frequency of patients experiencing Serious Adverse Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study treatment using a Bayesian monitoring scheme to continuously monitor the rate of severe adverse events (SAE). SAEs are defined as grade 3 and higher toxicity events that are attributable to the study combination therapy. Toxicity events will evaluated by NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0).</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>

    <description>Progression-free survival is the time measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression), whichever occurs first, with progression defined by RECIST v 1.1. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions</description>

    <description>Axitinib (AG013736; trade name Inlyta) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Its primary mechanism of action is thought to be vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1-3, c-KIT and PDGFR inhibition, this, in turn, enables it to inhibit angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels by tumours)</description>
