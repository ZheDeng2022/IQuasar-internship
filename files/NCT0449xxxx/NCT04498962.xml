    <measure>Duke treadmill score (DTS) at the end of week 8 compared with baseline on submaximal exercise Modified Bruce Protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is suitable for Chronic Stable Angina group. The Duke Treadmill Score was introduced in 1991 as a set of treadmill exercise findings that predict individual risk for death on the basis of a weighted combination of exercise duration, ST-segment depression, and the presence and nature of angina during testing. The score is calculated by subtracting 5 times the ST depression (in millimeters) and 4 times the angina score (no angina = 0, nonlimiting angina = 1, and test-limiting angina = 2) from minutes of exercise duration on the Modified Bruce protocol</description>

    <description>It is suitable for Chronic Stable Angina group. The Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) is a self-administered, disease-specific measure for patients with Cornary Artery Disease that is valid, reproducible, and sensitive to clinical change.&#xD;
The SAQ quantifies patients' physical limitations caused by angina, the frequency of and recent changes in their symptoms, their satisfaction with treatment, and the degree to which they perceive their disease to affect their quality of life. Each scale is transformed to a score of 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better function (eg, less physical limitation, less angina, and better quality of life).</description>
