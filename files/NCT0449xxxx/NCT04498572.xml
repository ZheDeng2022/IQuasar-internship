      The effectiveness of dry needling of the Gluteus Medius muscle in combination with active&#xD;
      exercises will be examined compared with sham needling with active exercises in low back pain&#xD;
      (LBP) patients.&#xD;

      Objectives: To examine if dry needling in combination with active physiotherapy is more&#xD;
      effective in reducing pain and increase activity of daily living, range of motion and muscle&#xD;
      strength in patients with chronic low back pain compared to sham dry needling in combination&#xD;
      with active physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: the study will include individuals with non-specific LBP over 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be divided randomly into two research groups, both will receive physiotherapy&#xD;
      including mobility, strengthening and stretching exercises. Intervention group, additionally&#xD;
      to exercises, will receive dry needling to the Gluteus Medius muscle by inserting a needle to&#xD;
      a trigger point until a visible involuntary twitch in the muscle appears. Sham needling will&#xD;
      be applied by needling with pre-cut and smoothed needles that will not penetrate the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive two treatments per week and up to six treatments overall, evaluation&#xD;
      will be performed before and after the series of treatments.&#xD;
