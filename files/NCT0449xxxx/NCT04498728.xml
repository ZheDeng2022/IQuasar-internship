      This repository will consist of clinically derived data and images of patients with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease from the time of birth until they have reached one of the following&#xD;
      outcomes: transition to outpatient care that has not resulted in readmission in 30 days after&#xD;
      hospital discharge, death, weaned off supplementary feeding tubes, or clinic visits&#xD;
      demonstrating clinical stability with their primary cardiologist, or full bi-ventricular&#xD;
      cardiac surgery palliation with improvement in hemodynamic stability. This information will&#xD;
      be collected for clinical evaluation and diagnostic purposes and will continue to be stored&#xD;
      for potential future research application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40,000 infants are born each year with congenital heart disease (CHD), a&#xD;
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infancy. Progress in surgical, transcatheter, and&#xD;
      medical management of newborn CHD has significantly reduced mortality. The CHAMP app&#xD;
      (separate IRB # 15030113) has helped to transition high-risk infants with single ventricle&#xD;
      congenital heart disease out of the hospital and to second stage cardiac surgery at&#xD;
      Children's Mercy Hospital and across the United States with improved survival. Remote&#xD;
      monitoring technology and telemedicine is a critical tool to aid clinical care for high risk&#xD;
      children with congenital heart disease but has been limited to the single ventricle&#xD;
      population in most cases. The benefits of this tool as a standard of care for other children&#xD;
      transitioning home may include decreased readmissions, improved weight gain, and remote&#xD;
      monitoring for reduced throughput in the emergency room, hospital, and clinic settings. To&#xD;
      improve outcomes beyond mortality and into morbidity with other high-risk patients with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease, future studies must assess morbidities and quality of outcomes with&#xD;
      the application of remote home monitoring with applications like the CHAMP app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are discharging from the hospital after complex congenital heart disease&#xD;
      surgery and cardiac catheterization are at high risk of events. Adverse outcomes in the year&#xD;
      after discharge are of similar magnitude to mortality in hospital and are not only with&#xD;
      infants with single ventricle heart disease but may include infants and children that were&#xD;
      hospitalized more than 30 days, readmitted to intensive care unit more than once, smaller&#xD;
      size for age, younger age at surgery, shunt dependent for pulmonary blood flow, congenital&#xD;
      heart disease with complexities such as neurological conditions and supplemental enteral&#xD;
      feedings gastrostomy. Over a 6-year period, 6.7% (514/7976) children experienced adverse&#xD;
      events including mortality in a report from England after initial discharge from cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. In a review of our similar patients from Children's Mercy we have noted a 5.8%&#xD;
      mortality in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is additional focus on expanding transition care in the pediatric cardiac population&#xD;
      beyond 30 days after discharge as traditionally followed by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons&#xD;
      as a marker of well-state (traditionally 8.3%) and onto 90 days (21% of additional&#xD;
      readmissions) to 1 year after discharge. Children had unplanned hospital readmissions during&#xD;
      the first year after cardiac surgery that were between 31 and 90 days after discharge that&#xD;
      could have possibly been prevented with the aid of remote technology in additional to&#xD;
      ambulatory care by a specialized advanced practice nurse. Higher rates of readmissions were&#xD;
      seen with those in lower socioeconomic areas (through zip codes), living closer to the&#xD;
      hospital (potentially a marker of access to care and rurality), higher STAT category, longer&#xD;
      intubation, and longer ICU length of stay were all markers for higher risk of later&#xD;
      readmission after 31 days of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining the advancements with CHAMP app with the expert care teams with advanced practice&#xD;
      nurses, a new standard of care for an expanded group of high-risk infants and children&#xD;
      transitioning home after cardiac surgery and in-hospital care can be established. The&#xD;
      research and ability to improve the understanding of how this process can be applied to an&#xD;
      expanded population that has been identified as high risk is key for implementation and&#xD;
      sustainability of a high risk transition care program.&#xD;
