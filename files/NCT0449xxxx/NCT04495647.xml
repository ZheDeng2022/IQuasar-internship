  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise in general and resistance training (RT) in particular have demonstrated positive&#xD;
      effects on physical functioning and frailty. However, frail older people with functional&#xD;
      impairments are among the least physically active and may have problems reaching high&#xD;
      intensity levels. The use of special vests with integrated electrodes allows the simultaneous&#xD;
      innervation of all large muscle groups by external electrical stimulation, inducing a&#xD;
      high-intensity RT at low subjective effort level. This whole-body electromyostimulation&#xD;
      (WB-EMS) may be a feasible option inducing training stimuli for functionally impaired frail&#xD;
      older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at investigating the feasibility and safety of WB-EMS in frail older people&#xD;
      with functional limitations. To explore the effects of age and functional status, young and&#xD;
      robust old reference groups will serve as comparators.&#xD;

    <description>Whole-Body Electromyostimulation (WB-EMS): Simultaneous, individually adjustable stimulation of 12 muscle groups using an interval approach with a duty cycle of 6s impulse/4s rest, bipolar electric current (impulse -frequency 85Hz, -width 350μs, rectangular pattern) will be applied.&#xD;
After a 4-week conditioning period, 1.5x 20 min/week WB-EMS will be conducted for 4 weeks (total training duration 8 weeks). Easy to perform functional exercises focusing on balance, transfer ability, stepping and lower extremity strength/power will be done during WB-EMS. Exercise intensity will be individually prescribed and adjusted by rate of perceived exertion (RPE-Borg CR10 scale 4 (moderate) to 7 (hard)).&#xD;
WB-EMS will be fully supervised one on one.&#xD;
All three arms will receive the same intervention.</description>
