  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-site, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      designed to elucidate mechanism(s) of action for symptomatic benefits observed in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD) patients treating twice daily time-varying caloric vestibular stimulation&#xD;
      treatment using a solid-state device. Study participants will self-administer treatments in&#xD;
      the home setting over a period of 12 weeks. Changes in cerebral blood flow perfusion,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular reactivity and functional connectivity between the pre-treatment baseline and&#xD;
      the end of the treatment period will be monitored and will be compared to changes in&#xD;
      validated standardized clinical measures of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. The&#xD;
      durability of effects will be evaluated at a post-treatment assessment conducted five weeks&#xD;
      after treatment cessation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial will explore the effects of&#xD;
      time-varying caloric vestibular stimulation (tvCVS) treatments on changes in biomarkers of&#xD;
      neurovascular status (i.e. cerebral blood flow perfusion and cerebrovascular reactivity) as&#xD;
      well as their relationship to clinical endpoints. Participants will be randomly allocated in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio using block randomization by the clinical site. Participants will be trained in&#xD;
      the clinic to self-administer device treatment and then will continue to self-administer the&#xD;
      ~19-minute treatments twice daily for 12 weeks in the home. Individual stimulation sessions&#xD;
      will be spaced a minimum of 1 hour apart. Outcome measures will be administered at the&#xD;
      baseline, the end of the 12-week treatment period and at 5 weeks post-treatment. Study&#xD;
      participants will continue to take their approved Parkinson's disease (PD) medications&#xD;
      throughout the study and will maintain patterns of usage throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous evidence for efficacy demonstrated therapeutic gains as an adjuvant for standard of&#xD;
      care treatment. Consistent with these observations, all outcome measures will be evaluated&#xD;
      when study participants are in the on-medication state and at the same time relative to the&#xD;
      last dose of anti-Parkinsonian medication across all assessments. Clinical measures will be&#xD;
      captured at the baseline, at the end of treatment period, and again five weeks after&#xD;
      cessation of treatment. Most of the planned clinical measures including the Movement Disorder&#xD;
      Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts I, II, and IV, the&#xD;
      Non-Motor Symptom Scale for PD (NMSS), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the&#xD;
      Parkinson's Anxiety Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and&#xD;
      the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue are suitable for virtual&#xD;
      collection. Case report forms (CRFs) for the patient reported outcomes will be provided to&#xD;
      study participants via standard mail. At the end of each virtual visit, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete these forms and bring them to the clinic the next day when they come for&#xD;
      their in-clinic visit. In the case where an in-clinic visit may not be possible, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to show completed forms to the coordinator via the telemedicine platform to&#xD;
      confirm completeness, and forms will be collected at the next in-person visit or can be&#xD;
      mailed in by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full MDS- UPDRS part III and the Timed Up and Go will be administered in the clinic.&#xD;
      However, a modified MDS-UPDRS part III (excluding items related to rigidity or postural&#xD;
      instability) will also be administered through the telemedicine platform. This measure will&#xD;
      serve as backup for cases where participants may be unable to come into the clinic for&#xD;
      regularly scheduled assessment (e.g. due to COVID-19 containment measures).&#xD;
