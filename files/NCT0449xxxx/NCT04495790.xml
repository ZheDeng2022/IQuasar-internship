  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to describe disease-free survival (DFS) in early stage cancer patients and&#xD;
      three-year overall survival (OS) outcomes in advanced stage cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      Advanced Integrative Oncology (AIO) treatment in a prospective consecutive case series&#xD;
      outcomes study. We will collect data and study outcomes for patients with cancer who receive&#xD;
      care at AIMS Institute.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that between 50 and 80% of cancer patients in the United States (US)&#xD;
      supplement their conventional medical treatment regimen with some form of complementary or&#xD;
      alternative medicine (CAM) therapy or practice. A smaller percentage of these patients&#xD;
      receive medical treatment from naturopathic doctors (NDs) who are board certified in&#xD;
      naturopathic oncology (Fellows of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology, FABNO) or have&#xD;
      equivalent experience in caring for cancer patients. This level of care is being defined here&#xD;
      as Advanced Integrative Oncology (AIO). AIO clinics provide comprehensive science- and&#xD;
      experience-based naturopathic medical oncology integrated with the individual patient's&#xD;
      conventional medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there have been some studies of alternative and complementary medicine use by both&#xD;
      adult and pediatric cancer patients, little is known about the effectiveness of naturopathic&#xD;
      medicine provided to patients with cancer in an integrative setting. Increasing numbers of&#xD;
      parents of children seek out naturopathic physicians and other integrative oncologists for&#xD;
      evidence-based complementary integrative therapy that is coordinated with the child's&#xD;
      standard oncology treatment plan. The AIMS Institute provides nutritional and botanical&#xD;
      medicine care to children with leukemia, brain cancer, and osteosarcoma. Despite the&#xD;
      widespread use of integrative oncology by children with cancer, little is known about the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these therapies in pediatric cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is scientific evidence supporting specific treatments that are commonly used,&#xD;
      systematic study of their effectiveness, especially when used in combination as commonly&#xD;
      recommended, is sparse. We believe that an early step in the evaluation of clinical outcomes&#xD;
      associated with CAM is to take a health services approach and seek to answer the question:&#xD;
      &quot;Does exposure to AIO services improve the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer?&quot;&#xD;

        are eligible to participate in this study. Participants will be informed and educated about&#xD;
        the prospective outcomes study by clinical staff as part of patient registration and the&#xD;
        clinical intake process. Patients may be referred to AIMS Institute by cancer care centers,&#xD;
        oncologists and other health care providers, or patients may be self-referred.&#xD;
