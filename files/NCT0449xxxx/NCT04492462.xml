  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look to determine two different types of physical therapy regimens in&#xD;
      patients who undergo anterior total hip replacement. We will compare the results of two&#xD;
      groups. The first group, the &quot;Formal Physical Therapy&quot; group, will undergo standard physical&#xD;
      therapy following their surgery. They will see a physical therapist in a physical therapy&#xD;
      office after their surgery. Here, the therapist will work with the patient to strengthen&#xD;
      muscles and improve their walking. The second group, the &quot;Self-directed Physical Therapy&quot;&#xD;
      group, will undergo physical therapy in the comfort of their own home using common household&#xD;
      items (chairs, steps, etc). These patients will be given a list of exercises and stretches to&#xD;
      perform on their own. It is our goal to prove that formal physical therapy is not needed&#xD;
      after anterior hip replacements.&#xD;

    <measure>Change inHarris Hip Score (HHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed 1,3,6, and 12 months after total hip replacement to assess change at each time point following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>elf-administered health survey that assesses pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion of the hip through 10 questions. HHS measures dysfunction, so a higher score indicates a better, higher functional outcome. Less than 70 is poor result, 70-80 ia fair result, 80-90 is good result, 90-100 is excellent result</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed 1,3,6, and 12 months after total hip replacement to assess change at each time point following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be assessed the amount of time it takes for them rise from a standard arm chair, walk 10 feet on the floor at normal pace, and then return and site down in same standard arm chair. Duration to complete task will be recorded in seconds</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed 1,3,6, and 12 months after total hip replacement to assess change at each time point following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will rate their pain on a scale form 0-10 at a given time point with 0 being no pain and 10 being unbearable pain. The higher the number, the more pain</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) form</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed 1,3,6, and 12 months after total hip replacement to assess change at each time point following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Self-administered health survey that assesses pain, stiffness, and function of arthritis of the hip or knee. WOMAC form assesses activities of daily living, functional mobility, gait, general health, pain, and quality of life. WOMAC questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4). A total score of 0 to 96 is possible, with a lower score indicating less pain or disability.</description>
