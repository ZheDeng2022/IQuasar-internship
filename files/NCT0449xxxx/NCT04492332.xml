    <textblock>
      Bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS) is associated with intracranial hypertension (IH).&#xD;
      However, not every BTSS patients presented with IH. The risk factors of IH in BTSS patients&#xD;
      remained obscure. Vertebral venous collaterals (VVC) were often found in patients with&#xD;
      bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS). The purpose of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      physiological role of VVC in BTSS patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS) is characterized by narrowing of bilateral&#xD;
      transverse sinus which resulted in obstruction of venous reflux. The majority of BTSS&#xD;
      patients exhibited with intracranial hypertension (IH) which manifested as a triad of&#xD;
      headaches, tinnitus and papilledema. Stenting improved the symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) and reduced the elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). It is&#xD;
      suggested that BTSS is one of the etiologies of IH. Since an alternative pattern of venous&#xD;
      reflux was observed in patients with occluded superior sagittal sinus, it is postulated that&#xD;
      altered pattern of venous reflux also exists in the presence of BTSS. The drainage of&#xD;
      cerebral veins consists of two major pathways: transverse sinus-sigmoid sinus-internal&#xD;
      jugular vein and vertebral venous plexus. Vertebral venous plexus is an extensive&#xD;
      paravertebral system that provides direct venous communication between peritoneum and cranial&#xD;
      cavity. The presence of vertebral venous collaterals (VVC) was reported in 108 consecutive&#xD;
      patients. However, whether VVC is of physiological significance in BTSS patients remained&#xD;
      unknown. This study was aimed to investigate the physiological role of VVC and whether it is&#xD;
      involved in the regulation of IH and related clinical symptoms in BTSS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, it is presumed that serum uric acid (UA) may affect the formation of vertebral&#xD;
      venous collaterals (VVC) and intracranial pressure (ICP). It is reported that UA inhibits the&#xD;
      endothelial NO biological activity. High concentrations of uric acid (UA) suppresses&#xD;
      circulating VEGF in Wistar rats and VEGF secretion in human endothelial cells. It is presumed&#xD;
      that serum UA may affect the formation of VVC and ICP. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether serum UA serves as an influencing factor of VVC and an indicator of IH in&#xD;
      BTSS patients.&#xD;

    <description>BTSS was confirmed by two of magnetic resonance venography (MRV), computed tomography venography (CTV) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The index of TSS (ITSS) score was a useful tool for the assessment of BTSS severity. The degree of stenosis was graded from 0 to 4 based on the following scale: 0 = normal; 1 = stenosis up to 1/3; 2 = stenosis between 1/3 and 2/3; 3 = stenosis &gt;2/3; and 4 = hypoplasia. ITSS was calculated as degree of right TSS × degree of left TSS. Vertebral venous collaterals (VVC) were found.</description>
