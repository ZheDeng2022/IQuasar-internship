  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare maintenance therapy approaches in people with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) that has responded well to a first round of treatment. The&#xD;
      researchers will compare giving the usual maintenance therapy (lenalidomide) with giving&#xD;
      daratumumab as maintenance therapy, and they will look at which drug gives participants a&#xD;
      better health-related quality of life during treatment. The researchers will measure&#xD;
      participants' quality of life using various questionnaires. This study will help researchers&#xD;
      find out whether this different approach of giving daratumumab as maintenance therapy is&#xD;
      better, the same as, or worse than the usual approach.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential* must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;

             days as required by Revlimid REMS®) and must either commit to continued abstinence&#xD;

             lenalidomide for the month prior and have the standard 7 days off before they start&#xD;
             maintenance then a single pregnancy test within 24 hours is acceptable. If a patient&#xD;
             has been off lenalidomide for &gt;14 days prior to initiating maintenance then they will&#xD;
             require 2 urine tests as described above.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not&#xD;

             potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time during&#xD;
             the preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as&#xD;
             required in the Revlimid REMS® program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a female of&#xD;
             childbearing potential even if they have had a successful vasectomy. See Appendix B:&#xD;

             control during treatment and for at least 3 months after cessation of daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding females. Because there is a potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenalidomide,&#xD;
             lactating females must agree not to breastfeed while taking lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Risk for adverse events to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             daratumumab is unknown, as such lactating females must agree not to breastfeed while&#xD;
