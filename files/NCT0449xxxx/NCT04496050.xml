  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) has been used in the medical treatment of ductal dependent critical&#xD;
      congenital heart disease in neonates. Apnea/ bradycardia, hypotension, hypokalemia, feeding&#xD;
      difficulties, fever, jitteriness are the most important side effects of PGE1. Also gastric&#xD;
      outlet has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to determine effect of PGE1 treatment on pyloric wall thickness in newborn period.&#xD;
      In this study, the side effect of increase of pylorus muscle wall thickness will be monitored&#xD;
      with weekly ultrasonography. No intervention in the treatment, medical decisions and&#xD;
      follow-up of these patients will be made. After reaching the sufficient number of cases (20&#xD;
      cases), increases in the pyloric wall thickness dimensions will be compared with statistical&#xD;
      analysis. The number of cases was determined in accordance with the rate of hospitalization&#xD;
      in our unit during the determined period (18 months).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intravenous prostaglandin E1 infusion is referred to as ductus dependent diseases, in&#xD;
      systemic (aortic blood flow) circulation (eg critical aortic coarctation, intermittent arcus&#xD;
      aorta, hypoplastic left heart, transposition of great artery), or lung blood flow through&#xD;
      patent ductus arteriosus ( For example, pulmonary valve atresia, tricuspid valve atresia,&#xD;
      hypoplastic right heart) is a life-saving drug used to ensure that the duct remains open&#xD;
      until a full, partial or temporary surgical correction or intervention is made. In the&#xD;
      antenatal period, the placenta is a good source of prostaglandins. However, with the&#xD;
      disappearance of the placental circulation after birth, many mechanisms ensure that the&#xD;
      patent ductus arteriosus closes first functional and then anatomically. Due to these&#xD;
      mechanisms occurring in the early days of life, babies who have ductus-dependent congenital&#xD;
      heart diseases show themselves with severe clinical signs and symptoms such as cyanosis and&#xD;
      circulatory disorders in this early neonatal period, when ductus begins to close when&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment are not performed. Echocardiography should be performed by the&#xD;
      pediatric cardiology specialist as soon as possible after delivery to babies diagnosed in the&#xD;
      antenatal period, and if a ductus-dependent congenital heart disease diagnosis is confirmed,&#xD;
      PGE1 infusion should be started immediately, and the patient should be consulted with a&#xD;
      pediatric cardiovascular surgery specialist and a surgical intervention plan should be&#xD;
      provided as soon as possible.Due to these mechanisms occurring in the early days of life,&#xD;
      babies who have ductus-dependent congenital heart diseases show themselves with severe&#xD;
      clinical signs and symptoms such as cyanosis and circulatory disorders in this early neonatal&#xD;
      period, when ductus begins to close when diagnosis and treatment are not performed.&#xD;
      Echocardiography should be performed by the pediatric cardiology specialist as soon as&#xD;
      possible after delivery to babies diagnosed in the antenatal period, and if a&#xD;
      ductus-dependent congenital heart disease diagnosis is confirmed, PGE1 infusion should be&#xD;
      started immediately, and the patient should be consulted with a pediatric cardiovascular&#xD;
      surgery specialist and a surgical intervention plan should be provided as soon as possible.&#xD;
      Prostaglandin E1 infusion is given as a continuous intravenous infusion. PGE1 has some side&#xD;
      effects. The most common side effects are apnea, hyperthermia, and vasodilatation on the&#xD;
      skin, they occur around 10-14% and are usually dose-related side effects. In addition,&#xD;
      bradycardia, hypotension, convulsion, tachycardia, diarrhea, sepsis, necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, respiratory depression, arrhythmia,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, gastric regurgitation, bleeding, anuria, hematuria and&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia are more rare effects. The frequency and severity of these side effects usually&#xD;
      depend on the dose of the drug and the time used. Many of these side effects disappear or&#xD;
      decrease significantly when the medication is stopped or the dose is reduced. An important&#xD;
      complication that can be seen with long-term use is cortical hyperostosis in long bones.&#xD;
      Among the very rare side effects of the drug Prostaglandin E1 are hyperplasia of the gastric&#xD;
      mucosa and the development of pyloric stenosis.Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis develops as a&#xD;
      result of hypertrophy of circular pyloric muscles in the newborn period. Ultrasonography&#xD;
      (USG) is the primary diagnosis and imaging method, because it does not contain radiation, it&#xD;
      has replaced contrast studies. In ultrasonography, the thickness of the pyloric muscle from&#xD;
      the mucosa to the serosa is more than 2-3 mm and the length of the pyloric canal is over 16&#xD;
      mm. In the literature, there is no study on the effect of PGE1 increasing the pyloric wall&#xD;
      thickness in newborns, there is a case report from our hospital in this regard. In this&#xD;
      study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the drug on pyloric wall thickness prospectively&#xD;
      with weekly ultrasonography measurements in infants given PGE1 infusion due to congenital&#xD;
      heart disease. Ultrasonography measurements will be made at the bedside (with the&#xD;
      ultrasonography device of our unit) by an experienced pediatric radiologist in pediatric&#xD;
      cases. No intervention in the treatment, medical decisions and follow-up of patients will be&#xD;
      made. Neonatal babies who were born in Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine Ihsan&#xD;
      Dogramaci Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and who were receiving&#xD;
      prostaglandin E1 infusion due to PDA-dependent congenital heart disease will be included in&#xD;
      the study. Infants who do not have consent to participate, babies with chromosomal disease&#xD;
      and hereditary metabolic disease will not be included in the study. In addition, babies who&#xD;
      have an exitus in the first week of life and whose ultrasonography measurements cannot be&#xD;
      obtained, and babies whose prostaglandin E1 infusion is discontinued by taking the second&#xD;
      ultrasonographic measurement in the first week of life will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have to receive Prostaglandin E1 treatment due to congenital heart disease&#xD;
           followed in the neonatal department of our hospital will be included in the study after&#xD;
           their consent and approval with their families without recording their identity&#xD;
           information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pyloric thicknesses will be measured by a pediatric radiologist once a week (at least&#xD;
           twice) during the period when patients use PGE1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After reaching the sufficient number of cases (20 cases), increases in the pyloric wall&#xD;
           thickness dimensions will be compared with statistical analysis. The number of cases was&#xD;
           determined in accordance with the rate of hospitalization in our unit during the&#xD;
           determined period (18 months). In this way, since the studies are in the form of a case&#xD;
           report and the original article cannot be found in the literature, the observed power of&#xD;
           the study will be calculated after the study is completed.&#xD;
