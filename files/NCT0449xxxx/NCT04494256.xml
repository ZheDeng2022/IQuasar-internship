  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB105 in participants&#xD;
      with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or poly-CAG expansion (polyQ)-ALS. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BIIB105 in serum of participants&#xD;
      with ALS or poly-CAG expansion (polyQ)-ALS.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treatment with another investigational drug (including investigational drugs for ALS&#xD;
             through compassionate use programs) or biological agent within 1 month or 5 half-lives&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treatment with an antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy that cannot safely be&#xD;
