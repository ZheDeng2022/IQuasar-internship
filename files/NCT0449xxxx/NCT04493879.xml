      The study aimed to study the effect of Bioptron light therapy (BLT) on oral mucositis after&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer,Oral mucositis (OM) is a common&#xD;
      and severe acute side-effect of many oncologic treatments, especially in patients treated for&#xD;
      head and neck cancer. It affects quality of life and require supportive care and proper&#xD;
      treatment plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study had been conducted on thirty cancer patients (head &amp;neck) receiving chemotherapy &amp;&#xD;
      radiotherapy (males and females) with oral mucositis with ulceration and pain(grade 2 and&#xD;
      more), their age ranged from 35 to 55 years, capable of understanding the study assessment&#xD;
      method and willing to complete the current study, they were free from any immunodeficiency&#xD;
      disorders or diseases that could impair the healing process and impact the results as&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomly allocated from patients from the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute, Cairo University. Group A (BLT group): This group consisted of 15 patients&#xD;
      receiving BLT for about 10 minutes every day for thirty days in addition to routine oral&#xD;
      mucositis medical care (Analgesics, anti-inflammatory treatment and antimicrobial treatment&#xD;
      for any new mouth infections), Group B (Control group): This group consisted of 15 patients&#xD;
      receiving daily routine oral mucositis medical care(Analgesics, anti-inflammatory treatment&#xD;
      and antimicrobial treatment for any new mouth infections) for thirty days The methods of&#xD;
      evaluation in the current study were the WHO oral mucositis scale (OMS) and the Common&#xD;
      toxicity criteria scale (CTCS). At the same time, the treatment equipment was the polarized&#xD;
      light therapy device Bioptron Compact III (PAG-860 manufactured in Switzerland) Assessment by&#xD;
      WHO oral mucositis scale and (OMS) and (CTCS) were used before treatment and after treatment&#xD;
      to measure improvement in oral mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of WHO oral mucositis scale (OMS) and the Common toxicity criteria scale (CTCS)&#xD;
      were assessed first at the beginning of the study and one month after the end of the study;&#xD;
      calculation of mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for each group was done by&#xD;
      descriptive statistics, means comparison between the two groups pre and post-application and&#xD;
      within each group was made using The t-test. With a level of significance Alpha point of 0.05&#xD;
