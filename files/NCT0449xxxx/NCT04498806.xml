    <textblock>
      The investigators objective of this research is to compare activity monitor results with&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) question-based outcome measures for degenerative cervical myelopathy&#xD;
      patients before and after treatment with decompression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding of the relationship between activity monitor data and question-based outcome&#xD;
      measures in the context of degenerative cervical myelopathy will improve our understanding of&#xD;
      the disease and limit the effort to diagnose and monitor it.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of spinal dysfunction across&#xD;
      the world and a major cause of disability. DCM describes a group of conditions that&#xD;
      progressively impinge on the spinal cord resulting in functional impairment and a reduced&#xD;
      quality of life. Degenerative diseases of the spine increase in prevalence with increases in&#xD;
      age. A cadaver study of 469 adults found cervical stenosis of at least one level in 19.2% of&#xD;
      adults, 24.5% in those older than 50 and 27% of those older than 70 years. By 2050 the global&#xD;
      population over 60 years of age is expected to approach 2 billion. DCM is certainly a&#xD;
      prevalent disease in the elderly and will only become more common. For these reasons DCM must&#xD;
      be addressed thoroughly in research to improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of afflicted patients often include neck pain, numbness/clumsiness in the hands,&#xD;
      weakness, upper and lower extremity motor deficits, balance and gait impairment, among&#xD;
      others. Non-surgical treatment has limited efficacy, while early surgical treatment is&#xD;
      recommended to halt progression, initiate recovery and improve symptoms. Surgical treatment&#xD;
      is widely agreed upon, yet measurement of surgical outcomes can be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, assessment of outcomes has been performed subjectively using&#xD;
      questionnaires/functional assessments. These question-based outcome measures are popular due&#xD;
      to practicality and ease of administration. Examples that have been used in Degenerative&#xD;
      Cervical Myelopathy (DCM) include Neck Disability Index (NDI), Myelopathy Disability Index&#xD;
      (MDI), Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA), European Myelopathy Score (EMS), Nurick Score,&#xD;
      Ranawat Score, Odom's criteria and Short Form-36 survey (SF-36). This introduces&#xD;
      incompatibility when comparing studies using different questionnaires. In addition to the&#xD;
      lack of consensus in a standard questionnaire, there are inherent biases in the use of&#xD;
      self-reported measures. Self-reported questionnaires and objective disability measures do not&#xD;
      always agree, particularly when recent setbacks distort a patients' perception of total&#xD;
      improvement. Personal evaluation is subject to inherent bias with a disconnect between&#xD;
      perception of disability and actual objective performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait disturbance may be the most be the most prominent physical finding in DCM, and walking&#xD;
      tests have been established as effective, objective measures in DCM pre and post-operatively.&#xD;
      A patient's activity level at home provides valuable data on recovery and surgical efficacy,&#xD;
      yet prior to wearable technology required self-reported data. Accelerometers have been used&#xD;
      to remedy this problem by measuring activity trends in a quantifiable manner, without relying&#xD;
      on the subjective response of the patient. They have recently been implemented in orthopedic&#xD;
      research. Investigators have compared self-rated disability with objective accelerometer data&#xD;
      in patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and found self-rated disability did&#xD;
      not always reflect objective data. Some investigators used these methods to objectively&#xD;
      measure function after surgical intervention, lumbar spinal stenosis decompression. Results&#xD;
      are promising and require further investigation into the application of this new tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary accelerometers offer longitudinal objective measurement of walking and the ability&#xD;
      to look at trends in activity levels. Eventually walking measures could be used to monitor&#xD;
      patients with mild myelopathy for progression and possibly even be part of a remote screening&#xD;
      tool (i.e. a phone tracks walking distance, speed, number of falls per month and prompts for&#xD;
      monthly or quarterly handwriting samples). We aim to apply similar concepts of prior&#xD;
      investigations to compare accelerometer and question-based outcome data on DCM patients&#xD;
      before and after undergoing surgical intervention, to determine the most practical and&#xD;
      accurate method for outcome measurement. By incorporating activity monitor data and looking&#xD;
      at relationships between the different measures, we will be able to better understand the&#xD;
      disease and limit the effort required to diagnose and monitor it.&#xD;
