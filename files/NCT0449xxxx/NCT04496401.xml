  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators believe that the pharmacological properties of Envarsus®, well studied in&#xD;
      kidney transplantation, may be also suitable after simultaneous kidney and pancreas&#xD;
      transplantation than Prograf. Indeed, Envarsus® has demonstrated a clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      safety in a complete clinical development plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of tacrolimus prolonged-release&#xD;
      (hereafter referred to as 'ENVARSUS®') in diabetics who have undergone kidney and pancreas&#xD;
      transplantation, and compare it to the pharmacokinetic profile of standard twice-daily&#xD;
      tacrolimus. The study will be conducted in 25 patients hospitalized at Nantes University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 25 patients hospitalized at Nantes University Hospital.&#xD;
      Tacrolimus will be started on the day of surgery (or on the day after) according to Nantes&#xD;
      local standard doses and practices. After a stable trough level is achieved (on postoperative&#xD;
      day 7-17) the first PK profile will be measured. Subsequently, the switch to ENVARSUS® will&#xD;
      be performed (initial dose of 0.17 mg/kg/day) on a single morning oral dosage regimen. A&#xD;
      second PK profile will be measured, between 7 to 14 days after initiation of ENVARSUS®. All&#xD;
      these PK measurements will take place during the post-operative recovery in the hospital&#xD;
      (typically 2-3 weeks). All patients will receive Thymoglobulin or Alemtuzumab induction,&#xD;
      Myfortic or Cellcept (or generics), with or without prednisone according to local practices.&#xD;
      Anti-infectious prophylaxis will be given according to Nantes local practices.&#xD;
