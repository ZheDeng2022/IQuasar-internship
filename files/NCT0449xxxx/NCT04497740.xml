  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chances of survival in premature babies, especially in babies born under 28 weeks, have&#xD;
      increased in recent years, and comorbidities also increase. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD),&#xD;
      one of the premature problems, is one of them. After a while, babies with heavy BPD are&#xD;
      discharged with the support of a home-type mechanical ventilator by opening a tracheostomy.&#xD;
      Tracheostomy procedure is performed by specialist doctors of otolaryngology under general&#xD;
      anesthesia in the operating room conditions in newborns. Complications of this procedure such&#xD;
      as bleeding, skin necrosis, decanulation, trachea laceration and infection in the early&#xD;
      period can be seen. In the long term, in addition to complications such as formation of&#xD;
      tracheal granulation tissue, ulceration, laceration due to the procedure, babies with&#xD;
      tracheostomy may develop nutrition and speech problems and neurodevelopmental problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there is no comprehensive clinical follow-up study involving early and&#xD;
      late clinical results related to newborns undergoing tracheostomy. In this study, early and&#xD;
      late follow-up results (indications, anthropometric measurements, mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
      oxygen deposition times, complications, tracheostomy closure times, tracheostomy closure&#xD;
      times, neurodevelopmental patients in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Hacettepe&#xD;
      University Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital. results, accompanying other comorbidities,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the advances in science and technology in recent years, the rate of survival of&#xD;
      high-risk newborns has increased in neonatal intensive care units. Some of these babies are&#xD;
      left in the neonatal intensive care unit for a long time, and because of the need for&#xD;
      respiratory support, tracheostomy is opened and discharged with home mechanical ventilator&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially babies with severe BPD cannot be extubated and they may be exposed to trauma of&#xD;
      long-term intubation. Subglottic stenosis is the most common result of this trauma. Some of&#xD;
      the babies with severe BPD are discharged by the otolaryngology specialist doctor before&#xD;
      discharge, to prevent both long-term intubation complications, airway obstruction or tracheal&#xD;
      stenosis and adaptation to the home mechanical ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to babies with BPD, tracheostomy is opened to babies in the early period due to&#xD;
      various developmental tracheal anomalies in our unit. Some of these are congenital tracheal&#xD;
      stenosis, congenital laryngeal atresia, laryngeal web.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following process, the growth of the baby, the development of the lungs and auxiliary&#xD;
      respiratory muscles and the need for mechanical ventilator support are eliminated and the&#xD;
      patient can wean from the ventilator support. In addition, the tracheostomy procedure secures&#xD;
      the patient's airway and allows it to be fed easily by mouth and the comfort of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the tracheostomy requirement of the patient disappears (mechanical ventilator, when&#xD;
      oxygen is not needed), tracheostomy closure can be performed to ensure the patient has normal&#xD;
      larynx functions (sounding, speech, airway protection reflexes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there is no comprehensive clinical follow-up study involving early and&#xD;
      late clinical results related to newborns undergoing tracheostomy. In this study, early and&#xD;
      late follow-up results (indications, anthropometric measurements, mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
      oxygen deposition times, complications, tracheostomy closure times, tracheostomy closure&#xD;
      times, neurodevelopmental patients in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Hacettepe&#xD;
      University Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital results, accompanying other comorbidities,&#xD;
      etc.). This study is planned as a retrospective study. Participants planned to determine the&#xD;
      results of the study whether these babies should be careful in the follow-up and to take&#xD;
      precautions in order to lead a better and healthier life, and what participants can do in&#xD;
      order to provide these babies and their families with better health care support.&#xD;
