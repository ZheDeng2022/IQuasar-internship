      This single-center, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous&#xD;
      heparin anticoagulation compared to the standard of care systemic intravenous anticoagulation&#xD;
      during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory failure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been increasing used over the past decade as&#xD;
      supportive therapy in patients with respiratory failure, in order to avoid life-threatening&#xD;
      hypoxemia, in cases otherwise refractory to conventional treatment. Veno-venous ECMO (VV&#xD;
      ECMO) removes carbon dioxide and significantly improves oxygenation in patients with severe&#xD;
      lung failure. System anticoagulation is provided for patients undergoing ECMO therapy to&#xD;
      prevent clot formation in the ECMO circuit cannulas, circuit tubing, centrifugal pump, and/or&#xD;
      oxygenator. Heparin is the standard anticoagulant for ECMO therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although technological advancements and increasing clinical experience have made the use of&#xD;
      VV ECMO safer, bleeding and thrombosis are common complications accounting for the majority&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality in ECMO-treated patients.The optimal anticoagulation management&#xD;
      for patients on VV ECMO is not known. Thrombotic episodes, characterized mainly by&#xD;
      circuit-related clotting, have become more manageable with improvements in ECMO circuit&#xD;
      technology and heparin-coated lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) guidelines describe bleeding as the most&#xD;
      common complication during extracorporeal life support. Bleeding has been reported to occur&#xD;
      in as many as 30% of patients receiving ECMO therapy, and depending on the site of the&#xD;
      hemorrhagic complication, can be fatal. Bleeding may occur from mucous membranes, the uterus&#xD;
      in women in childbearing years, the GI tract, or bleeding into the head or brain parenchyma.&#xD;
      Intra-cranial hemorrhage is the most serious and usually extensive and fatal&#xD;
      complication.Intra-cranial hemorrhage was identified in more than 40% of non-survivors&#xD;
      treated with ECMO during the H1N1 flu outbreak of 2009. Other less serious complications&#xD;
      associated with anticoagulation are anemia and the risks associated with transfusions. Review&#xD;
      of our own institutional ECMO experience revealed 10 cases of VV ECMO during which&#xD;
      anticoagulation had to be held for clinical reasons, all without subsequent increases in&#xD;
      thrombotic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying the safest approach to anticoagulation is essential to the future management of&#xD;
      patients on ECMO support. In this prospective randomized clinical trial, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous heparin anticoagulation compared&#xD;
      to the standard of care systemic intravenous anticoagulation in subjects requiring&#xD;
      veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory failure.&#xD;
