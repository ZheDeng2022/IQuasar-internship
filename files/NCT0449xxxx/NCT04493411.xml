  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to prospectively determine the sensitivity, specificity, and&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of whole-body MRI (WBMRI) with Dual-Echo T2-weighted acquisition for&#xD;
      Enhanced Conspicuity of Tumors (DETECT) for the detection of multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo WBMRI and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      for research purposes at four time points: baseline, prior to bone marrow transplant (BMT),&#xD;
      prior to maintenance therapy, and post BMT. The results of these imaging procedures will be&#xD;
      compared to standard of care whole body x-ray and bone marrow biopsy results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) will be evaluated for detection and assessment&#xD;
      of therapy response in multiple myeloma (MM) using a novel acquisition scheme. WBMRI with&#xD;
      diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has demonstrated promising preliminary results for detection&#xD;
      and response monitoring in MM. While DWI generates high lesion-to-background contrast and&#xD;
      excellent lesion conspicuity, it suffers from compromised image quality due to geometric&#xD;
      distortion, particularly at 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a platform which is&#xD;
      increasingly used in clinical practice. This disadvantage, along with high costs and patient&#xD;
      dissatisfaction associated with long scan times, have limited wide spread adoption of WBMRI&#xD;
      with DWI in the clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these challenges, the investigators have developed an alternative WBMRI&#xD;
      technique: Dual-Echo T2-weighted acquisition for Enhanced Conspicuity of Tumors (DETECT) for&#xD;
      improved tumor visualization by simultaneously suppressing the confounding signals of fat and&#xD;
      fluid throughout the body.&#xD;

    <description>Effectiveness of WBMRI DETECT for the detection of lesions in MM patients will be compared to WBMRI Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI). A combination of clinical MRI, whole body x-ray, FDG PET, and bone marrow biopsy will be used as the reference standard.&#xD;
The number of lesions identified on WBMRI-DETECT will be compared to the number of lesions identified on WBMRI-DWI. The sensitivity and specificity of WBMRI-DETECT and WBMRI-DWI will be calculated using the reference standard.</description>

    <description>Effectiveness of WBMRI for assessing therapy response will be compared to the current standard of care using FDG PET and bone marrow biopsy as the validation standard.&#xD;
The percentage increase in fat fraction measured using WBMRI-DETECT and the percentage increase in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured using WBMRI-DWI will be used to assess the effectiveness of WBMRI in measuring therapy response. The percentage change in SUVmax measured on PET/CT will be used as the reference standard.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pathologically confirmed myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For cross-sectional study, no additional required treatment schedule. For longitudinal&#xD;
             study: Patients scheduled to undergo bone marrow biopsy (BMB) and induction therapy&#xD;
             (or have gone through 1-2 cycles of induction therapy), followed by either bone marrow&#xD;
             transplantation (BMT) or consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to undergo a urine pregnancy screening to&#xD;
             prevent imaging of pregnant patients. A female of child-bearing potential is any woman&#xD;
             (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining&#xD;
             celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: 1) Has not undergone a&#xD;
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) Has not been naturally postmenopausal&#xD;
             for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding&#xD;
             12 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of&#xD;
             the cancer under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing; since pregnancy is a contraindication to&#xD;
             administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents. Furthermore, there is a potential&#xD;
             for congenital abnormalities and the potential to harm nursing infants, associated&#xD;
             with FDG-PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindication to MRI per Radiology Department's routine protocol, e.g.&#xD;
             MRI-incompatible objects, including but not limited to medical devices and other&#xD;
             foreign bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known severe allergic reaction to Gadolinium-based contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrollable claustrophobia, severe lower back pain, and&#xD;
             uncontrollable tremors, to the point that it would render them unable to tolerate an&#xD;
