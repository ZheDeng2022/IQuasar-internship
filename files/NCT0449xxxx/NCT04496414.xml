      Research Purpose: This study aimed to continue to evaluate safety information from subjects&#xD;
      implanted with a catheter (trade name: Bactiseal) produced by Codman &amp; Shurtleff, Inc. of the&#xD;
      United States. Device safety would be assessed based on all the adverse events that occurred&#xD;
      within one year after the subjects implanted the catheter.&#xD;

      This study aimed to continue to evaluate safety information from subjects implanted with a&#xD;
      catheter (trade name: Bactiseal) produced by Codman &amp; Shurtleff, Inc. of the United States.&#xD;
      Device safety would be assessed based on all the adverse events that occurred within one year&#xD;
      after the subjects implanted the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to be single arm, multi-center, and retrospective. A total of 50&#xD;
      patients would be retrospectively enrolled. Information would be collected on adverse events&#xD;
      of subjects enrolled within one year after the implantation of the Bactiseal Catheter from&#xD;
      August 07, 2018 to January 31, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information would be collected from subjects' medical records or hospitals'&#xD;
      databases (if any):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General condition of the subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraoperative condition and catheter implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Information on the shunt product&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adverse events of subjects within one year after the operation and classification of the&#xD;
           adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Relevant examinations in case of postoperative infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Other adverse event-related information (except anticipated adverse events)&#xD;

             to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject had an indication suitable to use Bactiseal Catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject received a hydrocephalus shunt at least one year ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  According to the comprehensive judgment of an investigator, a subject had an infection&#xD;
             of the implant site when the shunt was implanted, such as ventriculitis, meningitis,&#xD;
             peritonitis, and local implant skin infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject was simultaneously implanted with another shunt system different from&#xD;
