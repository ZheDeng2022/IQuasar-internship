  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ROMTech is focused on transforming the healthcare market by delivering lower extremity&#xD;
      rehabilitation systems that are effective, efficient for patient use, cost-effective, and&#xD;
      provide better patient outcomes while simultaneously decreasing rehabilitation and overall&#xD;
      recovery times.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The patented technology of the ROMTech PortableConnect can improve the rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol for lower extremities in shorter time periods. The focus of this study is to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the ROMTech PortableConncect device only rehabilitation program&#xD;
      following total knee arthroplasty to an active comparator group of continuous passive motion&#xD;
      with a standard of care combination HHPT and OPPT rehabilitation program. The technology used&#xD;
      to develop the ROMTech PortableConnect device has been reported in a pilot study to tend to&#xD;
      be highly effective in decreasing the recovery time of patients post TKA, as discussed in the&#xD;
      findings from the pilot study with the ROMTech Pro Cycle. The expedited recovery resulting&#xD;
      from use of the ROMTech rehabilitation technology is noted to be contributed to the ability&#xD;
      of the ROMTech technology to achieve a more rapid range of motion in this patient population.&#xD;
