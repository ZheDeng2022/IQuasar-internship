&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation, liver directed therapy (including bland, chemo- or radioembolization,&#xD;
             or ablation), or hepatic resection are permitted if ≥4 weeks from start of therapy.&#xD;
             Extra-hepatic palliative radiation is permitted if completed ≥2 weeks prior to first&#xD;
             dose of study therapy and the patient has recovered to ≤ grade 1 toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have radiographically measurable disease (RECIST1.1) in at least one&#xD;
             site not previously treated or with progression after radiation or liver directed&#xD;

             cabozantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;

             without corticosteroid treatment at the time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have undergone a major surgery (e.g., GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain&#xD;

             transfusion or hospitalization for at least 6 months prior to study entry are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have a psychiatric illness, other significant medical illness, or social&#xD;
             situation (such as involuntary incarceration) which, in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             would limit compliance or ability to comply with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding since cabozantinib may harm the fetus or&#xD;
             child.&#xD;

             duration of study participation, and for 4 months following completion of study&#xD;
             therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated, or compulsorily detained for&#xD;
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g. infectious disease) illness would&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant treatment with strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 is not allowed.&#xD;
             Patients must discontinue the drug(s) at least 14 days prior to first study dose on&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, direct thrombin&#xD;
             and factor Xa inhibitors), or platelet inhibitors (e.g. clopidogrel) is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 500&#xD;
