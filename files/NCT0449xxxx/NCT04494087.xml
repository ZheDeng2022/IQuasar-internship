  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of electronic media in informed consent giving has become increasingly important in&#xD;
      recent years. Due to the easy access to information via electronical media, patients are&#xD;
      primed in a heterogeneous manner concerning expectations and wishes regarding surgical&#xD;
      interventions. Inherent to its nature elective interventions are critically questioned as&#xD;
      there is time for information gathering and reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators set out to investigate the effect of an educational video as&#xD;
      a supporting element in the process of informed consent giving for one the most frequently&#xD;
      performed interventions in general surgery, namely inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multi-center setup, eligible patients for primary inguinal hernia repair will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The intervention video provides basic principles of&#xD;
      endoscopic extraperitoneal hernia repair. The second video is similar in length and design&#xD;
      and displays general aspects of day surgery in the two study centres. The third group's link&#xD;
      will lead to the digital version of the informed consent. Primary outcomes will consist of 1)&#xD;
      score in a multiple choice test assessing gain of knowledge regarding hernia repair, 2)&#xD;
      difference in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and 3) patient satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire (ICF, Picker Institute, Germany) as assessed 1-2 days after the first&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;

    <description>Quiz with questions regarding background, indication, implementation, complications and postoperative course of the total extraperitoneal inguinal h ernioplasty (TEP) procedure. The questions asked check relevant aspects for the patient with regard to the planned operation. The structure of the multiple-choice quiz takes the &quot;single best option&quot; out of 12 questions. Maximum value of the test is 12 (12/12, highest score-best outcome), the lowest 0 (0/12, lowest score-worst outcome).&#xD;
The questions are clearly posed and the correct answer is based on current guidelines for the management of inguinal hernia, which have been published by the European Hernia Society (EHS), American Hernia Society (AHS), International Endo Hernia Society (IEHS) and the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery and Other Interventional Techniques (EAES) as a consensus document by &quot;HerniaSurge&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed 1-2 days after group allocation/exposure</time_frame>
    <description>To test the effect of the intervention on anxiety before surgery, an anxiety score is determined using the Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).&#xD;
The inventory is based on a 4-point Likert scale and consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis.&#xD;
Scores range from 20 to 80 with higher scores indicating greater anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Individual Clinician Feedback (ICF)</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed 30 days postoperatively at follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with regard to doctor-patient communication is recorded by the validated ICF questionnaire.&#xD;
The ICF questionnaire (Picker Institute) comprises 38 items concerning the patient's experience of the examination atmosphere, the comprehensibility of the physician's statements, the participation in decisions, the course of the conversation as well as socio-demographic characteristics of the patient. The items are assessed on an 11-point Likert scale from 0 to 10, with 0 as the most critical and 10 as the most positive experience.</description>

    <measure>Numerical rating scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed 3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effect on chronic pain, the pain is assessed by telephone using the NRS score approximately 3 months after the operation.&#xD;
The numerical rating scale (NRS) requires the patient to rate his or her pain on a scale from 0 to 10, in which 0 is no pain (best outcome) and 10 the worst pain imaginable (worst outcome).</description>

    <description>The video of the intervention group will provide a short (&lt; 5 min) summary explaining the basic principles of endoscopic extraperitoneal hernia repair, its possible complications and the postoperative course. After carefully watching the video, participants should be able to correctly answer to a multiple-choice test consisting of 12 questions related to the aforementioned topics.</description>

    <description>This video is a general documentation of the &quot;typical&quot; day of surgery in the day clinic. The information is essentially limited to the pictorial representation of the individual wards which the patient will pass through during the operation (arrival at the clinic, admission, transport to the operating theatre, recovery room, discharge).&#xD;
The video explicitly does not transport any information that could be helpful for answering the quiz questions or for medical understanding of the operation itself.</description>

The digital version of the informed consent form allows the patient to read the information again. The third group thus corresponds to the standard of care.</description>
