  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Superficial lesions on and around the ear are uncommon with many differential diagnoses and&#xD;
      different characteristic histopathologic features. The purpose of this study was to describe&#xD;
      a series of peri-auricular superficial lesions and characterize the distinctive types of&#xD;
      these lesions.&#xD;

      Data included in this descriptive retrospective study were collected from records of 70&#xD;
      patients with superficial lesions around the auricle, i.e., periauricular (preauricular,&#xD;
      auricular, and postauricular) during the period extending between 2017 and 2019, who were&#xD;
      primarily diagnosed and operated. Data were retrieved, reviewed, and analyzed. The primary&#xD;
      analysis outcome measures were patient history (age, gender, complaint, medical advice&#xD;
      clinic, and associated medical diseases), lesions examination (site, laterality, clinical&#xD;
      presentation, and the number of lesions). Also, the needed investigations for diagnosis, type&#xD;
      of intervention, postoperative patient satisfaction were evaluated. Evaluation of the&#xD;
      patients' follow up was done.&#xD;
