  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Many studies suggest physical activity reduces risk of dementia and improves&#xD;
      global cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using&#xD;
      commercial wearable technology to measure daily steps is feasible in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The purpose of this pilot study was to explore whether 12 weeks of increased&#xD;
      physical activity improved cognitive function in individuals with MCI. A wearable activity&#xD;
      tracker was used to measure participants' daily steps as a quantifiable measure of daily&#xD;
      activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This was a one-group pretest-posttest study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Established memory clinic patients within a neurology department in Northern&#xD;
      California during 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 17 enrolled and 14 included for data analysis. There were 7 females and 7 males&#xD;
      whose mean age was 76.21 (SD 2.69). 12 participants were White, which reflected the clinic&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants were asked to wear an activity tracker for approximately 12 hours&#xD;
      a day for 12 weeks and to increase their physical activity as much as possible. They were&#xD;
      provided twice a month telephone support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to measure pretest-posttest&#xD;
      cognitive function. Timed Up and Go (TUG) was used to assess fall risk at enrollment.&#xD;
      Cumulative step count for the study period was measured with an activity tracker.&#xD;

    <description>participants would wear an activity tracker and increase physical activity as much as possible within their comfort level. Participants will be tested for pretest MoCA for cognitive function and TUG for fall risk. After 12 weeks, participants will be tested for posttest MoCA to find any cognitive function change.</description>
