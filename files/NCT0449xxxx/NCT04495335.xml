  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: The aim of the present study was to address the following questions: does&#xD;
      photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) improve implant stability and affect microbiota around&#xD;
      dental implants in the early stage of osseointegration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: Implants will randomly be divided into two groups and implants will be&#xD;
      placed in the test group treating with Gallium-aluminum-arsenate (GaA1As) diode laser with&#xD;
      photobiomodulation therapy immediately after surgery and for 15 days. In the control group,&#xD;
      implants are not irradiated. The primary stability of the implants will measure by the&#xD;
      Resonance frequency analysis (RFA) after insertion and the secondary stability values will&#xD;
      record at 30th, 60th, and 90th days after surgery as implant stability quotient (ISQ). Plaque&#xD;
      samples will collect for microbiological analyzes at the first 24 hours after implant surgery&#xD;
      and six days after 90 days at six sterile endodontic paper points.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The same surgical procedure will be operated in the test and control groups by the same&#xD;
      surgeon. Full-thickness flaps were raised and dental implant osteotomy preparation will be&#xD;
      completed according to the manufacturers' instructions. Laser treatment will be completed&#xD;
      using Gallium-Aluminum-Arsenide diode laser. The photobiomodulation application will v-be&#xD;
      completed by laser energy immediately and three times a week for just 15 days after surgery.&#xD;
      The control group will consist of laser application without energy delivery to the tissue.&#xD;
      Immediately after implant placement, the third generation stability resonance frequency (RF)&#xD;
      analyzer will be applied for direct measurement of implant stability and the value will be&#xD;
      recorded. The microbiological plaque samples will be collected at specific times, according&#xD;
      to the following schedule; at the first 24-hour and 90 days after implant surgery. All&#xD;
      bacterial DNA specimen will be analyzed with qPCR technique to evaluate Aggregatibacter&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) ,&#xD;
      Tannerella forsythia (Tf ) and total amount of bacteria.&#xD;
