      WATCH-TMVR (Watchman for Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Transcatheter Mitral&#xD;
      Valve) Clinical Trial have the main objective to assess the feasibility of combining&#xD;
      clinically indicated MitraClip TMVR and Watchman LAAO in one setting.Mayo Clinic will be the&#xD;
      data coordinating center for this trial, which will include up to 3 sites.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Left atrial appendage closure using the Watchman device procedure is approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have an indication for oral anticoagulation&#xD;
      to reduce stroke risk but who also have a rational to seek an alternative to long-term&#xD;
      anticoagulation (e.g., recurrent bleeding, fall risk). Transcatheter mitral valve repair with&#xD;
      the MitraClip device is approved by the FDA for patients with severe degenerative mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation who are deemed to be at high-risk for valve surgery and patients with severe&#xD;
      secondary MR despite optimal medical therapy. It is also anticipated that the device will&#xD;
      soon be approved for patients with severe symptomatic functional mitral regurgitation based&#xD;
      on the results of the COAPT trials. Atrial fibrillation is common in patients referred for&#xD;
      TMVr. A recent study from the Mayo Clinic documented that up to 50% of patients undergoing&#xD;
      TMVr might qualify for LAA based on their risk assessment. Both procedures are performed via&#xD;
      a large bore femoral venous access, and utilize transseptal puncture, general anesthesia, and&#xD;
      transesophageal echo guidance. Hence, combining the two procedures in one session might&#xD;
      provide incremental benefit to those patients by avoiding the risk of repeated large-bore&#xD;
      access, transseptal puncture, and general anesthesia. A limited number of case reports&#xD;
      illustrated the safety and feasibility of a combined TMVr with LAAO when clinically&#xD;
      indicated. Experience with combined TMVr/LAAO in the United States is limited, mostly due to&#xD;
      the lack of supportive data and concerns about the incremental cost of the Watchman device&#xD;
      that might not be covered by the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) per current guidelines.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective multicenter registry of 25 patients who are planned to undergo TMVr with MitraClip and also have an indication for LAAO with the commercially available WATCHMAN device. All patients will undergo TMVr first under general anesthesia and transesophageal echo (TEE) guidance. At the conclusion of the TMVr procedure, the patient will undergo LAAO with the Watchman device using the same transseptal access the was obtained to perform the TMVr. Patients will receive oral anticoagulation with warfarin (or a direct anticoagulant) and subsequent antiplatelet therapy as per standard of care and outlined in protocol for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, patients will have TEE done as per standard of care in addition to office visit and complete clinical and neurological evaluation. Continuation or discontinuation of oral anticoagulation will depend on the 45-day TEE findings. The anticipated duration of the Clinical Investigation will be 12 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The MitraClip device is a percutaneous edge-to-edge repair device that is intended to approximate the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets in patients with severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation with suitable anatomy. Device versions/types: MitraClip NTr, MitraClip XTr. The WATCHMAN device is a self-expanding left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) device with a porous covering on the proximal face. Device sizes: 21 mm, 24 mm, 27 mm, 30 mm, 33 mm.</description>
