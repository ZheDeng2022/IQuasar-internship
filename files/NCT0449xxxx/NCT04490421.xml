  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer is a highly malignant tumor, and its first-line treatment has not&#xD;
      broken through platinum-containing dual-drug chemotherapy in the past 30 years. Because small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer has the characteristics of easy resistance after first-line chemotherapy,&#xD;
      increased difficulty in treatment after resistance, and poor efficacy of second-line&#xD;
      treatment, how to formulate a plan that can control tumor progression to the greatest extent&#xD;
      has become a hot issue in recent research. Recently, immunotherapy and targeted therapy have&#xD;
      made breakthrough progress in small cell lung cancer, but its efficacy still needs to be&#xD;
      further improved. As immune combined chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy first&#xD;
      achieved good results in other tumors, this study aims to explore a longer disease-free&#xD;
      survival time and higher overall survival rate of patients with small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      through immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy. Program to&#xD;
      bring new hope to patients. At the same time, this study will evaluate the safety of the&#xD;
      program, explore the prognostic indicators that may exist in the treatment, and provide new&#xD;
      inspiration for subsequent patient selection.&#xD;
