      The purpose of this study is to study the process of bone regeneration around a metal device&#xD;
      in the femoral neck canal using a synthetic bone substitute Cerament bone void filler (BVF)&#xD;
      and bisphosphonate (Zometa) locally or systemically that affects bone metabolism.&#xD;
      Furthermore, fracture healing and implant migration will be investigated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis associated fragility fractures in the elderly are a societal and financial&#xD;
      burden in the western world and this burden has also started to affect developing nations.&#xD;
      With the aging of the world's population, the age quake, hip fractures are expected to reach&#xD;
      2.6 million by the year 2025, and between 4.5 to 6.3 million by the year 2050. The mortality&#xD;
      rate at 30 days after sustaining a hip fracture is up to 10%, and at one year 35% after the&#xD;
      fracture. It is further known that almost half of the survivors are unable to reach their&#xD;
      previous functional levels, partly related to the surgical treatment and fixation failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One fifth of all fragility fractures is in the hip with an almost equal ratio in in the&#xD;
      cervical and trochanteric regions. Hip arthroplasty and internal fixation are the two most&#xD;
      common treatment options for cervical and trochanteric femoral fractures. Healthier patients&#xD;
      with long life expectancy have better functional recovery and lower mortality when internal&#xD;
      fixation is used. However, dynamic hip screws (DHS) and intramedullary nails and screws are&#xD;
      associated with high failure rates, particularly in unstable trochanteric fractures.&#xD;
      Osteosynthesis cutout, with penetration of the cervical screw through the femoral head,&#xD;
      preceded by a neck-shaft varus tilting, is the most common reason of failure, reported in up&#xD;
      to 10% in trochanteric fractures, and in about 5% of neck fractures. In addition,&#xD;
      reoperations have been reported to be as high as 30%, where treatment of dislocated femoral&#xD;
      neck fracture with internal fixation fails and subsequently gets revised with total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty (THA). It is well established that salvage THA following hip fractures has&#xD;
      significantly higher risk of complications compared to primary THA. The tip-apex distance has&#xD;
      been defined as a strong predictor of screw cutout, while recent studies question its&#xD;
      relevance. The bone quality, i.e. the degree of osteoporosis, on the other hand is associated&#xD;
      with failures.[4] Despite the increase in clinical awareness; adoption of secondary&#xD;
      prevention using bisphosphonates is still low, partly due to low patient adherence. Besides,&#xD;
      even if included in a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry surveillance program, there is a&#xD;
      delayed response to bisphosphonate treatment, which has been deemed critical, during the&#xD;
      first one and half years. Augmentation increasing mechanical strength of cancellous bone in&#xD;
      osteoporotic hip fractures may lower the burden of revision, which may outweigh the related&#xD;
      additional cost. Before the operation, deciding in whom to augment is a challenge A pilot&#xD;
      study by Sirka et al. indicated that local delivery of a bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid&#xD;
      (ZA), using the calcium sulphate/hydroxyapatite(CaS/HA) biomaterial enhanced bone formation&#xD;
      in the femoral neck canal of severely osteoporotic rats. Moreover, recently, Raina et al.&#xD;
      confirmed the findings also in a screw implant-integration model in rats. Whether these&#xD;
      studies will show a similar potential in the clinical scenarios is a matter of speculation;&#xD;
      however, they do provide novel methods for augmenting bone quality in osteoporosis as well as&#xD;
      improving screw fixation. It is however important to mention that local delivery of ZA has a&#xD;
      profound effect on cancellous bone regeneration in healthy as well as osteoporotic while the&#xD;
      effect on cortical bone is minimal. A finite element modeling study by Kok et al. used&#xD;
      computer simulations to predict the effect of CaS/HA augmentation in the form of injections&#xD;
      into the human femoral heads/femoral neck canal and indicated enhanced mechanical properties&#xD;
      by up to 25% which were dependent on volume and location of the injection. In a limited&#xD;
      one-year follow up study, the use of an injectable ceramic applied in the trochanteric&#xD;
      fracture bone void has been shown to lead to adequate fracture healing with minimal DHS screw&#xD;
      migration Preliminary data from biomechanical studies in osteoporotic sawbones and donated&#xD;
      human osteoporotic femoral heads indicates that using a biphasic apatite/sulphate material&#xD;
      for reinforcing a fragile bone will result in an increase strength of the fixation of a&#xD;
      fracture device inserted in the proximal femoral canal.(in house on file It is reasonable to&#xD;
      argue that patients with high fracture and low mortality risks would benefit from an&#xD;
      augmentation procedure far more than the ones with low fracture and high mortality risks. In&#xD;
      a recent study, by combining the well-established fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) and&#xD;
      the Sernbo score to form a fracture and mortality risk evaluation (FAME) Index, one fifth of&#xD;
      the patients could be identified as a cohort, with high risk of subsequent fracture but low&#xD;
      risk of mortality. This group could theoretically benefit from cancellous bone augmentation&#xD;
      during internal fixation of a fragility hip fracture. By utilizing a simple form, the FAME&#xD;
      Index was successfully applied in the acute setting before the operation, during history&#xD;
      taking by well-informed medical staff in less than 10 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>CERAMENTâ¢|BONE VOID FILLER is a synthetic, injectable, osteoconductive bone void filler. CERAMENTâ¢I is biphasic, consisting of 60% calcium sulfate and 40% hydroxyapatite mixed with the radio-opacity enhancing component CERAMENTâ¢|C-TRU (iohexol 300 mg iodine/ml), which allows bone in-growth after curing. The high injectability of CERAMENTâ¢ allows transcortical administration and ensures good intraosseous spread. In this trial, CERAMENT BVF paste will be injected by a sterilized metal needle (2-3 mm diameter and 15 cm length) through the hollow dynamic hip screw.</description>
