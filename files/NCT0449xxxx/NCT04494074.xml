  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best strategy for managing fever in patients with septic shock remains unknown. In a&#xD;
      pilot study, the investigators showed that fever control at normothermia allowed a better&#xD;
      control of shock and evolution of organ failures. In this second trial the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled, superiority trial in which two&#xD;
      strategies will be compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Respect of fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fever control at normothermia using external cooling The primary end point will be d-60&#xD;
           mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a common syndrome responsible for multiple organ failure. Septic shock, defined as&#xD;
      sepsis with hyperlactatemia and cardiovascular failure requiring vasopressor infusion despite&#xD;
      adequate fluid resuscitation has an extremely high mortality rate. Fever is a frequent&#xD;
      disease process during sepsis. Fever increases oxygen consumption and can worsen imbalance&#xD;
      between oxygen supply and oxygen requirements. Fever increases inflammation but reduces viral&#xD;
      and bacterial growth. The beneficial effects of active fever control on inflammation have&#xD;
      been mainly shown in a context of lung injury. Pneumonia represents the first cause of septic&#xD;
      shock in developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study (SEPSISCOOL I), we showed that fever treatment using external cooling&#xD;
      significantly increased the resolution of shock, improved organ functions and decreased d-14&#xD;
      mortality. Although reduced, hospital mortality was not significantly different. This study&#xD;
      was underpowered to allow conclusion on mortality. A more pronounced beneficial effect was&#xD;
      observed among the most severely ill patients with elevated serum lactate level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fever treatment is commonly applied in septic patients but its impact on survival remains&#xD;
      undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare two strategies of fever management in febrile&#xD;
      (body temperature &gt; 38.3°C) septic shock patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and sedation. These patients will be randomly allocated in two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fever respect&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fever control by external cooling to obtain normothermia during 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      A covariate-adaptive randomization will be used to ensure the comparability of the two groups&#xD;
      at each stage of the study. We will use an adaptive multistage population-enrichment design&#xD;
      with a pre-specified subgroup of patients with ARDS identified at randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Safety and Data Monitoring Committee will review data on serious adverse&#xD;
      events. The decision of study stop for potential harmful effect of one strategy will be let&#xD;
      at the entire responsibility of the committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One interim analysis will be performed by independent observers after enrolment of half of&#xD;
      the population. The assumption that fever treatment is more effective in patients with ARDS&#xD;
      will be confirmed or not. According to pre-defined rules based on the conditional power&#xD;
      calculated in the two subgroups, the trial will be stopped for futility, continued as planned&#xD;
      or continued by enrolling only patients with ARDS.&#xD;
