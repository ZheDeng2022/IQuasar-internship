  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The carpal tunnel release (CTR) is now performed almost exclusively under regional anesthesia&#xD;
      (RA) in France. RA requires the use of a pneumatic tourniquet to limit blood flow to the&#xD;
      operated extremity and create a bloodless surgical field for a clear visualization of the&#xD;
      anatomic structures by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple approaches to block the brachial plexus can be considered. The most common technique&#xD;
      is the axillary block (BAX) that provides complete anesthesia for the patient's arm and&#xD;
      forearm. This technique offers anesthesia not only for the surgical area but also for the&#xD;
      root of the arm where the pneumatic tourniquet is placed. However this technique have limits:&#xD;
      the persistence of a motor block in the arm and the forearm that is not compatible with a&#xD;
      quick hospital discharge (short term ambulatory hospitalization) and the need for assistance&#xD;
      with dressing and eating after surgery. More distal anesthetic techniques are proposed such&#xD;
      as the troncular blocks (TRONC) that avoid motor block of the arm and offer an earlier&#xD;
      recovery and autonomy for the patient. However, they lead to a poor tolerance to the&#xD;
      tourniquet due to its application on a non-anesthetized area.The pain related to the pressure&#xD;
      of the tourniquet can occur within the first few minutes of its inflation, get worse over&#xD;
      time and persist for several minutes after its deflation. Therefore, TRONC procedure is less&#xD;
      often performed compared to the BAX for major surgeries but it remains appropriate for CTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wide Awake Local Anesthesia No Tourniquet (WALANT) technique is widely used in Canada and&#xD;
      has been proposed for hand and wirst minor surgeries. WALANT uses a combination of a local&#xD;
      anesthetic (LA) and epinephrine to induce anesthesia and hemostasis in the area of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure in order to allow surgeries to be done without the use of tourniquet.&#xD;
      Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor agent that reduces blood flow at surgical site. This&#xD;
      bloodless effect is visualized on the skin by a pale color. Thus, WALANT can provide a&#xD;
      chemical tourniquet and eliminate the pain from a traditional arm tourniquet. However, this&#xD;
      technique is performed with a short-acting LA and does not offer any postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of TRONC using long-acting LA with the WALANT technique could combine the&#xD;
      comfort of a surgery without tourniquet to a long-acting analgesia and thus could provide a&#xD;
      superior overall comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this prospective, multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel-group&#xD;
      controlled trial is to evaluate the interest of WALANT technique on patient comfort during&#xD;
      CTR performed with TRONC, compared to the tourniquet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label study assessing the interest of&#xD;
      the association of the WALANT local infiltration technique with analgesic troncular blocks&#xD;
      (TRONC) at the wrist, for the endoscopic CTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CONTROL group (usual technique) : TRONC (using a long-acting LA : Ropivacaine) +&#xD;
           Tourniquet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WALANT group (experimental technique) : TRONC (using a long-acting LA : Ropivacaine) +&#xD;
           WALANT ( using a short-term LA : Lidocaine + epinephrine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA procedures will be systematically performed under ultrasound guidance, 45 min befor&#xD;
      surgery. Before each procedure, a skin disinfection will be carried out using an alcoholic&#xD;
      iodine solution. The needle approach will be in-plane (IP) or out-of-plane (OOP). Efficiency&#xD;
      will be assessed before transfer to the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Troncular blocks (TRONC) Patients will be installed in supine position, the arm at 90°&#xD;
           of abduction and in external rotation. The probe will be positioned to have an axial&#xD;
           view of the nerves at the wrist. The initial identification of the median (nM) and ulnar&#xD;
           (nU) nerves will be systematically done before each TRONC. The nM will be located on the&#xD;
           anterior forearm. The nU will be visualized in contact with the ulnar artery in the&#xD;
           forearm. The operator will inject 3 to 7 mL of Ropivacaine 3.75 mg/ml per nerve. An&#xD;
           infiltration of 2 ml of Ropivacaine 3.75 mg/ml will be performed laterally above the&#xD;
           flexion fold of the wrist in order to block the branches of the lateral cutaneous nerve&#xD;
           of the forearm, the terminal sensory branch of the musculocutaneous nerve (nMC). A 22&#xD;
           Gauge x 50 mm needle will be used for TRONC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WALANT infiltration (&quot;WALANT&quot; group) An infiltration of the subcutaneous area in front&#xD;
           of the transverse ligament will be performed between the thenar and hypothenar&#xD;
           eminences, from the flexion fold of the wrist over a length of 5 cm. The path of the nM&#xD;
           in the palm of the hand will be checked before each procedure. 3 to 7 ml of 1% lidocaine&#xD;
           (10 mg/ml) combined with 0.005 mg/ml epinephrine and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (1 ml per&#xD;
           10 ml of lidocaine) will be injected. The addition of sodium bicarbonate will reduce the&#xD;
           pain due to lidocaine injection. A 24 Gauge x 50 mm needle will be used for WALANT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usage of pneumatic Tourniquet A pneumatic tourniquet will be placed at the root of the&#xD;
           arm in all patients. A cuff with size and shape adapted to the patient will be used. The&#xD;
           tourniquet will be inflated in all patients of &quot;CONTROL&quot; group, and if necessary,&#xD;
           corresponding to the failure of the WALANT technique, in patients of &quot;WALANT&quot; group. The&#xD;
           inflation pressure will be determined according to the patient's systolic blood pressure&#xD;
           (SBP). It will be inflated 75 to 100 mmHg above SBP&#xD;
