  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-center retrospective study, the investigators will include all patients&#xD;
      admitted to Parkland Hospital who underwent surgical fixation of thoracolumbar fractures&#xD;
      between the years 2000 and 2017. The study investigators will gather demographic,&#xD;
      radiographic, and operative information. Patients will be matched according to demographic&#xD;
      information in a case-control style. The primary outcome of the study will be comparing the&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic outcomes of two surgical techniques in order to establish the best&#xD;
      treatment approach for this disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracolumbar (TL) fractures occur in 8-15% of blunt trauma patients cared for in major&#xD;
      trauma centers. These fractures can be devastating and commonly occur in patients who endure&#xD;
      high-energy trauma (e.g. motor vehicle accidents). TL fractures occur mainly between T10 and&#xD;
      L2. The &quot;3 Column Model&quot; attempts to identify criteria that can predict instability of TL&#xD;
      fractures. This model divides the spine into anterior, middle, and posterior areas. Stability&#xD;
      is dependent on the integrity of two out of three of the columns. Major spine injuries are&#xD;
      those that involve mechanical or neurologic instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four major types of injury include compression, burst, seat-belt, and&#xD;
      fracture-dislocation. Compression fractures account for 50-70% of all TL fractures and&#xD;
      usually consist of compression failure of the anterior column. Burst fractures comprise&#xD;
      approximately 14% of all TL injuries. These injuries usually involve compression of both the&#xD;
      anterior and posterior column. Seat-belt fractures (aka flexion-distraction fractures)&#xD;
      account for 10% of TL injuries and occur most commonly in patients who are wearing only the&#xD;
      lap belt (i.e. no chest belt) during motor vehicle trauma. These injuries typically involve&#xD;
      compression of the anterior column with distraction failure of both the middle and posterior&#xD;
      columns. Finally, the fracture-dislocation type fracture occurs with massive direct trauma to&#xD;
      the back, causing failure of all three columns and translational injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with TL fractures may present with TL spine pain, midline TL spine tenderness, TL&#xD;
      spine bony deformity, or neurologic deficit. Oftentimes these patients were in high-velocity&#xD;
      traumatic scenarios, including falls from heights, crush injuries, motor vehicle crashes with&#xD;
      ejection, unenclosed vehicles (ex. motorcycles), or automobile versus pedestrian accidents.&#xD;
      Diagnosis is confirmed via computed tomography (CT) imaging or plain radiographs. CT imaging&#xD;
      is typically more accurate than plain radiographs but can be poor in certain subtypes of&#xD;
      injury. MRI can be utilized to assess the integrity of the ligaments and surrounding soft&#xD;
      tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no universally accepted system for classifying the severity of TL&#xD;
      fractures. One proposed system is the Thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score&#xD;
      (TLICS). Points are awarded based on radiographic findings, neurologic status, and the&#xD;
      integrity of posterior ligamentous complex. The final numeric score is used to guide&#xD;
      treatment, with higher scores indicating need for surgery. Neurologic deficit favors surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no clear consensus on the best treatment approach for TL fractures. For situations&#xD;
      where conservative management is decided (i.e. surgery is not required or is&#xD;
      contraindicated), patients are treated with recumbency and delayed ambulation in orthosis&#xD;
      with serial radiographs to determine need for further intervention. The surgical management&#xD;
      for more severe/unstable fractures usually involves posterior instrumentation with&#xD;
      percutaneous or open pedicle screw fixation.3 While the traditional open pedicle screw&#xD;
      fixation technique has demonstrated good radiologic and clinical outcomes, a minimally&#xD;
      invasive percutaneous approach has been increasingly used in recent years. The minimally&#xD;
      invasive technique potentially carries the advantage of less operative blood loss, shorter&#xD;
      operative time, smaller incisions, potentially less postoperative pain, and overall shorter&#xD;
      hospital stay. There are a few studies published in the literature, but more studies are&#xD;
      needed to establish the treatment modality that is the most efficacious and safe for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the University of Texas Southwestern (Parkland Hospital), the investigators evaluate and&#xD;
      treat a large population of patients with TL fractures. Previous trials in the literature&#xD;
      comparing open and percutaneous fixation of TL fractures have been series of ~100-200&#xD;
      patients. These studies have shown variable results, with many concluding similar outcome&#xD;
      results for the two surgical techniques. The purpose of this study is to compare a larger&#xD;
      number of patients (~500) who have undergone either surgical approach to determine the best&#xD;
      technique in terms of clinical and radiographic outcomes. The investigators believe this&#xD;
      study will provide neurosurgeons with invaluable information about the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      different treatment modalities for TL fractures in this patient population.&#xD;
