    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective non-randomised open label multicenter phase two study in male&#xD;
      long-term survivors of malignant lymphoma including Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and Diffuse Large&#xD;
      B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). The study aims to assess whether low levels of testosterone in the&#xD;
      blood of patients cured for aggressive lymphoma, can be effectively treated with Testosterone&#xD;
      gel, and if treatment with testosterone can improve their general quality of life. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that patients will develop sexual dysfunction and poor quality of&#xD;
      life when suffering from untreated reduced level of testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer treatment is increasingly effective and the overall survival higher, which makes&#xD;
      issues like sexuality and long-term quality of life more and more important to address in&#xD;
      cured cancer patients. Patient sexuality and quality of life is measured by three&#xD;
      questionnaires, and serum testosterone level, during one year of treatment with Testogel. The&#xD;
      intention is to show that future follow-up visits should include focus on sexuality and serum&#xD;
      testosterone, so relevant patients can be identified and treated for their hormonedeficiency&#xD;
      without delay. The expected follow-up program include questionnaires and blood samples, which&#xD;
      are easily implemented and without great cost.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin Lymphoma are two aggressive lymphomas often treated&#xD;
      with doxorubicin containing chemotherapy. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline and is known to be&#xD;
      toxic to both Leydig Cells of the testes and hormone-producing cells of the hypothalamus.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients treated with this drug are at risk of developing hypogonadism. Standard&#xD;
      follow-up programs do not include analysis of hormone levels or treatment of hypogonadism.&#xD;
      With this study the aim is to investigate the effect and toxicity of treatment with exogenous&#xD;
      testosterone in male long-term survivors of malignant lymphoma, to clarify whether it is&#xD;
      relevant to include serum testosterone and potentially testosterone replacement therapy in&#xD;
      standard follow-up programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: A significant proportion of long-term male survivors of HL and DLBCL have&#xD;
      impaired quality of life (QoL) due to sexual dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: A significant proportion of long-term male survivors of HL and DLBCL have&#xD;
      reduced levels of testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: A significant relationship between QoL, sexual dysfunction and testosterone&#xD;
      levels exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Substitution with testosterone in carefully selected subgroups will improve&#xD;
      sexual function and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: Treatment with testosterone in this setting is safe with acceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess efficacy and safety of treatment with testosterone replacement therapy on&#xD;
      hypogonadism in lymphoma patients, blood tests and questionnaires are completed throughout&#xD;
      one year of treatment. To assess patient sexuality and quality of life, 3 questionnaires are&#xD;
      included; the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of&#xD;
      Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ C30) for general quality of life, EORTC Sexual Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire 22 (SHQ-22) for sexual health and International index of erectile function with&#xD;
      5 questions (IIEF-5) for sexual function.&#xD;
