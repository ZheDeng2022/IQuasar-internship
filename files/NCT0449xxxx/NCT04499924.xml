  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if tucatinib with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel&#xD;
      works better than ramucirumab and paclitaxel to treat HER2-positive (HER2+) cancer of the gut&#xD;
      (stomach or gastroesophageal cancer). This study will also look at what side effects happen&#xD;
      when participants take this combination of drugs. A side effect is anything the drug does&#xD;
      other than treating cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be given in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase 2 part of the trial, participants and their doctors will know what drugs are&#xD;
      being given (open-label). In the Phase 3 part, the study is &quot;blinded.&quot; This means that&#xD;
      participants, their doctor, and the study sponsor will not know which drugs are being given.&#xD;
