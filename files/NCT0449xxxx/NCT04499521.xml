  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a new, low cost packing system (&quot;BrachyGel VHPS&quot;) is being tested as a packing&#xD;
      option during brachytherapy along with standard options to make sure that it keeps the&#xD;
      unrelated organs away from radiation at least as well as the standard options, and to better&#xD;
      understand the safety and patient discomfort associated with BrachyGel VHPS and the standard&#xD;
      packing options.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of vaginal brachytherapy, the organs that do not need to receive radiation (unrelated&#xD;
      organs) are moved out of the way of the radiation with a &quot;packing system&quot;. The usual low cost&#xD;
      and available standard of care packing systems to move these unrelated organs out of the way&#xD;
      can sometimes be uncomfortable for the patient, may not move all of the unrelated organs all&#xD;
      the way out of the radiation's path, and rely on the doctor to place them correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you participate, you will receive 5 fractions of brachytherapy according to standard&#xD;
      clinical care. For three of the fractions, a standard packing option will be used and for two&#xD;
      of them BrachyGel VHPS will be used. For the first fraction both groups will have the same&#xD;
      packing option but participants will be randomized to either have BrachyGel during fractions&#xD;
      2 and 4 or during fractions 3 and 5. You'll be asked to complete a questionnaire after&#xD;
      fractions 2-5 to get your feedback on any discomfort you have during or after brachytherapy&#xD;
      from the packing system.&#xD;
