  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The function of the autonomic nervous system can be assessed using baroreflex sensitivity&#xD;
      (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV). Decreased HRV has been shown to be predictive of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in diverse medical conditions such as acute myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, autoimmune diseases, sepsis and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The function of the autonomic nervous system has not yet been investigated in a &quot;pure&#xD;
      hypovolemia&quot; model. The aim of the current study is therefore to investigate and describe the&#xD;
      function of the autonomic nervous system prior to, during and after reduction of blood volume&#xD;
      in healthy blood donors.&#xD;
