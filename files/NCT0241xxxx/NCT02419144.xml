  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test an intervention designed to change oral health norms and reduce&#xD;
      disparities in oral health among vulnerable adults residing in publicly funded senior housing&#xD;
      in Central Connecticut. The intervention model is based on Fishbein modified theory of&#xD;
      reasoned action operationalized through Adapted Motivational Interviewing and Practice to&#xD;
      Mastery. The intervention includes two components: 1) a face to face administration of the&#xD;
      Adapted Motivational Interviewing and Practice to Mastery, a participatory counseling model,&#xD;
      and 2) a targeted building level campaign consisting of three half-day oral health events&#xD;
      with skills development through practice to mastery to parallel the individual intervention,&#xD;
      all based on the study's conceptual model. The study uses a modified fractional factorial&#xD;
      design to evaluate the face to face and campaign components separately and in different&#xD;
      additive sequences. Six buildings will be paired in three dyads. The buildings in each dyad&#xD;
      will be randomized to either having the Adapted Motivational Interviewing and Practice to&#xD;
      Mastery intervention first followed by campaigns or to having the campaigns first followed by&#xD;
      Adapted Motivational Interviewing and Practice to Mastery. Seventy-five residents will be&#xD;
      recruited in each building for a total of 450 participants. There will be four assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. T0 will include a survey, oral hygiene skills assessment and clinical assessment of the&#xD;
           Gingival Index and Plaque Score. The survey will provide data on the conceptual domains&#xD;
           that are the target of the tailored intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. T1 will follow the AMI-PM or CA+PM (depending on condition) and will include the survey,&#xD;
           oral hygiene skills assessment and clinical assessment of the Gingival Index and Plaque&#xD;
           Score. This assessment will occur 1-2 months after the initial intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. T2 will follow the AMI-PM or CA+PM and will include the survey, oral hygiene skills&#xD;
           assessment and clinical assessment of the Gingival Index and Plaque Score. This&#xD;
           assessment will occur 6 months after the initial intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. T3 will include oral hygiene skills assessment and clinical assessment of the Gingival&#xD;
           Index and Plaque Score. This will occur 15-18 months after study entry. We will use&#xD;
           general linear mixed models (GLMM) or general estimating equations (GEE), respectively,&#xD;
           to fit a model with intervention and period effects using the MIXED procedure in SAS.&#xD;

    <description>We will use a plaque scoring scheme developed by O'Leary (O'Leary, Drake, Naylor, 1972). This index consists of dichotomous presence or absence scores for plaque on each tooth surface. The supragingival bacterial plaque will be assessed with the use of erythrosine disclosing solution in six surfaces of each tooth. The non-toxic vegetable-based solution will be applied to the teeth by the examining hygienist. The number of surfaces stained red will be calculated over the total number of surfaces and the plaque score will be expressed as a percentage of surfaces with plaque as a ratio. We used this measure in the pilot study and demonstrated significant reductions in plaque after the intervention.</description>

    <description>The Gingival Index (GI) (Loe &amp; Silness, 1963) will be used to assess the gingival status related to six surfaces of each tooth. Each surface is scored for gingival inflammation: 0=no visual signs of inflammation; 1=slight change in color and texture of the gingiva but no bleeding; 2=visual sign of inflammation and bleeding upon swiping; 3=overt inflammation and spontaneous bleeding. The index is calculated by summing each surface GI and dividing by the total number of surfaces (mean value). Individual scores are summed to obtain a mean.</description>

    <description>The intervention we are proposing is a tailored bi-level intervention with two components, an individual level component (component A) with tailored messages based on performance on clinical assessment results, ADLs and cognitive domains in the survey delivered through adapted motivational interviewing with practice to mastery (AMI-PM); , and a building level campaign (component B) for those enrolled in the study (but open to all building residents that includes building tailored messages based on cognitive domains and skills reinforcement through Practice to Mastery.</description>
