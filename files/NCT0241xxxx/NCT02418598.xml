  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy of intra-putaminal infusion of&#xD;
      AAV-hAADC-2 (adeno-associated virus encoding human aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase) by&#xD;
      stereotaxic surgery in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be hospitalized and conducted the baseline examination on Day -10. The target&#xD;
      putamen for AAV-hAADC-2 infusion is identified on MRI image that has been taken prior to the&#xD;
      operation, and then subjects will be bilaterally infused with a total volume of 200 / 600 µL&#xD;
      at a total of 4 sites (2 sites in left putamen, 2 sites in right putamen; 50 / 150 µL per&#xD;
      site) at a flow rate of 3 µL per minute on Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the infusion is complete, the cannula devices will be removed, and the surgical&#xD;
      incision will be seamed in accordance with usual trephination. After that, cranial CT scan&#xD;
      will be performed so as to confirm whether there are complications such as the occurrence of&#xD;
      intracranial bleeding or not. Subjects stay in a hospital for 14 days after infusion of&#xD;
      AAV-hAADC-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be evaluated the safety and efficacy of all&#xD;
      subjects at 6 months later assessment in low dose cohort. If there are no events relevant to&#xD;
      the discontinuance criteria or moderate to severe adverse events with casual relationship,&#xD;
      &quot;Definitely related&quot; or &quot;Possibly related&quot;, to AAV-hAADC-2 in this cohort, the study moves to&#xD;
      high dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of 6 months after the infusion, investigator assesses the treatment effect of&#xD;
      AAV-hAADC-2 on the basis of subject diaries, clinical assessment and levodopa requirement&#xD;
      dosage. At the same time, investigator assesses a relationship between the dose of&#xD;
      AAV-hAADC-2 infused and the amount of intra-putaminal expression by FMT-PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator also assesses the safety for 5 years after the baseline examination.&#xD;
      Long-term follow up study is additionally conducted for 10 years in reference to guideline of&#xD;
      FDA.&#xD;
