      The trial will assess the addition of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to standard&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy (SACT) in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive either standard treatment alone (SACT) or standard&#xD;
      treatment with conventional radiotherapy (RT) and SABR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARON is a confirmatory phase III study examining the efficacy and safety of stereotactic&#xD;
      ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and conventional radiotherapy (RT) alongside standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment for this group of patients is systemic anti-cancer therapy. The choice of&#xD;
      SACT is determined by the treating clinician and will be supplied from hospital commercial&#xD;
      stock, and prepared and administered according to institutional guidelines. There is&#xD;
      sufficient evidence regarding the safety of SABR, its effect on local control and a possible&#xD;
      impact on overall survival. This trial will further examine overall survival, progression&#xD;
      free survival and local control, as well as toxicity, feasibility, patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      and health resource use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a feasibility analysis performed after 50 patients have been randomised. This&#xD;
      will assess the practicality of achieving recruitment targets, logistics of delivering the&#xD;
      experimental treatment and the potential for contamination (as patients may seek SABR outside&#xD;
      of the trial if randomised to the non SABR arm). There will also be a parallel thoracic SABR&#xD;
      safety and feasibility study after recruitment and treatment of 20 patients with thoracic&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre randomised phase III study based on patients with oligometastatic&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm: systemic anti-cancer therapy alone (SACT) Experimental Arm: SACT plus radical RT&#xD;
      to primary and SABR and/or SRS to metastases&#xD;

        Registration Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient â‰¥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Staging with FDG PET-CT whole body scan and MRI brain within 45 days prior to&#xD;
             registration (but prior to commencement of first cycle of SACT). [Note: Brain CT with&#xD;
             IV contrast can be performed instead (within 45 days prior to registration). However,&#xD;
             if brain metastases are evident on the brain CT then a brain MRI must be performed&#xD;
             prior to randomisation, i.e. the Brain CT is sufficient for registration into the&#xD;
             trial but not for randomisation if it is positive for brain metastases, in which case&#xD;
             a brain MRI must be performed]&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status 0 to 1 (prior to commencement of first cycle of SACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient presenting with primary disease +/- lymph nodes and synchronous&#xD;
             oligometastatic disease (1-5 lesions in up to a maximum of 3 organs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is deemed fit to receive four cycles of systemic anti-cancer therapy,&#xD;
             according to local guidelines and assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient is deemed fit to receive radical RT (either conventional RT or SABR) to&#xD;
             primary disease +/- lymph node and SABR/SRS to 1-5 metastases according to local&#xD;
             guidelines and assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Primary tumour +/- lymph node suitable for radical RT (either conventional RT or&#xD;
             SABR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. 1-5 metastatic lesions in up to a maximum of 3 organs, assessable according to RECIST&#xD;
             v1.1 and all of which are suitable for SABR/SRS (only one site of metastasis or&#xD;
             primary tumour needs to be measurable according to RECIST v1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. If brain metastasis present, the NHS commissioning guidelines need to be met for&#xD;
             intracranial SRS (â‰¤20 cc) (or equivalent for Wales, Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland in&#xD;
             line with standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Lymph nodes included in the N1-3 categories of the IASLC 2009 staging criteria are&#xD;
             treated in the conventional radiotherapy volume and are not counted as metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. Lymph nodes not included in the N1-3 categories of the IASLC 2009 staging&#xD;
             criteria, e.g. pelvic lymph nodes, are counted as metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iv. For bone metastases pre-SABR stabilisation should be considered as clinically&#xD;
             appropriate. This does not exclude the patient from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Acceptable lung function for radical lung radiotherapy as assessed according to local&#xD;
             policy. Note: Potential thoracic sub-study patients will need to complete pulmonary&#xD;
             function tests pre-randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. No relevant co-morbidities, including UIP pulmonary fibrosis and connective tissue&#xD;
             disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion Information Patients with lung cancer and an additional malignant&#xD;
        nodule are difficult to categorise, and the current stage classification rules are unclear.&#xD;
        Such patients should be evaluated by the local multidisciplinary team to determine whether&#xD;
        the additional lesion represents a second primary lung cancer or an additional tumour&#xD;
        nodule corresponding to the dominant cancer. The SARON TMG will accept local MDM decisions&#xD;
        on this and will centrally review all baseline imaging retrospectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        Registration Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has had palliative radiotherapy to any tumour site prior to registration or&#xD;
             requires palliative radiotherapy prior to randomisation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients currently receiving VEGF inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. One or more metastases previously treated with alternative ablative treatment.Note:&#xD;
             Surgical ablation (partial or total excision biopsy) is permitted for palliative or&#xD;
             diagnostic purposes (e.g. for molecular analysis). Treatment for any residual&#xD;
             disease/tumour bed will be at the discretion of treating clinician/MDT.&#xD;
             Resected/ablated metastases will count towards the total number of metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has received any previous treatment for this NSCLC malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who present with brain metastasis only and no sites of extra cranial&#xD;
             metastatic disease i.e. the presence of more than 4 brain metastases is an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Metastasis in sites where normal radiotherapy OAR constraints cannot be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Brain metastasis within the brainstem.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who have more than five sites of metastases in up to 3 organs prior to trial&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. History of prior malignant tumour likely to interfere with the protocol treatment,&#xD;
             (patients without evidence of disease for at least 1 year or a non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             tumour or early cervical cancer are eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Stage III disease with extensive nodal disease not treatable in radical radiotherapy&#xD;
             field.&#xD;

        Eligibility Criteria for Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Following cycle 2 of induction SACT, patients must meet the following eligibility criteria&#xD;
        for randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No confirmed disease progression on post-cycle 2 CT scan (according to RECIST v1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with up to 5 metastases at the time of registration but less than 5&#xD;
                  visible after induction SACT are still eligible for randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with no visible metastases following 2 cycles of induction of SACT are&#xD;
                  eligible for randomisation. If randomised to the Investigational Arm, these&#xD;
                  patients will receive RT upon relapse of metastases (patients who experience&#xD;
                  progression with new metastases are not eligible for randomisation or for trial&#xD;
                  treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with complete response of the lung primary +/- lymph nodes following 2&#xD;
                  cycles of induction SACT are eligible for randomisation. Patients randomised to&#xD;
                  the Investigational Arm, should receive conventional RT to the pre-SACT involved&#xD;
                  nodal stations and to any scar residuum at the primary site.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who progress following 2 cycles of induction of SACT cannot be&#xD;
                  randomised. Only overall survival data will be collected for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continued suitability for trial treatment as deemed by the treating clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continues to meet all registration eligibility criteria, as detailed in section 6.4.1&#xD;
             (with the exception of ECOG status).&#xD;
