      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SABR (Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy) is one of the standard treatment options besides&#xD;
      surgical resection for limited lung metastases (oligometastases) from colorectal cancer. High&#xD;
      efficacy in terms of local control of metastatic lesions treated has been shown.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the precise effect of SABR upon progression-free- and overall survival in these&#xD;
      patients is unknown. To further evaluate and develop local treatment options in metastatic&#xD;
      disease, more information is necessary regarding the impact upon - and the pattern of -&#xD;
      disease progression of local treatment options such as SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect upon progression free survival and upon tumorload relative to&#xD;
      baseline, both at one year after randomisation of immediate SABR versus delayed SABR (a&#xD;
      scan-and-personalise policy). Secondarily, patterns of progression, patient-reported symptoms&#xD;
      and quality of life will be monitored.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WHO-Performance status (WHO-PS) 0 - 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with 1 to 3 lung metastases between 8 mm and 3 cm each, from colorectal&#xD;
             cancer. Resection has been considered at a multidisciplinary conference but was not&#xD;
             recommended or has been refused by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possibility to define target lesions that fulfil the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No lesion larger than 3 cm;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Not more than 3 metastases ≥ 8 mm in total (lesions smaller than 8 mm in diameter&#xD;
                  are NOT counted and will NOT be irradiated);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior radiotherapy (SABR or other) within about 2 cm from target lesions (i.e., the&#xD;
             distance between prior planning-target-volume (PTV) to actual intended PTV is more&#xD;
             than 2 cm AND dose distribution of former radiation permits SABR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary tumour has been completely removed surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastases outside target organs (e.g. liver metastases or other) are radically&#xD;
             treated locally (resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA),&#xD;
             stereotactic radiotherapy, or other). Earlier resected or ablated (SABR, RFA, MWA)&#xD;
             metastases to lung, liver, or other organ form no exclusion criterion. Brain&#xD;
             metastases should be completely resected or treated with stereotactic radiosurgery.&#xD;
             Bone metastases should be resected or treated with high dose radiotherapy (equivalent&#xD;
             of &gt; 40 Gy) and be asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at reproductive potential must agree to practice an effective contraceptive&#xD;
             method. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proficiency in the Dutch language so that quality-of-life questionnaires can be&#xD;
             completed in Dutch and absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or&#xD;
             geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and&#xD;
             follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before&#xD;
             registration in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before patient randomisation, informed consent must be given according to&#xD;
             International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration&#xD;
             of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) of the European Union (EU) in accordance with&#xD;
             good clinical practice (GCP), and national/local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinical symptoms possibly or certainly caused by index lungmetastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical inability to undergo stereotactic radiotherapy (e.g., serious shoulder&#xD;
             stiffness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any uncontrolled malignancy other than index colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other malignancy within recent two years, even if completely under control (under&#xD;
             control = no evidence of disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to comply with any of the inclusion criteria&#xD;
