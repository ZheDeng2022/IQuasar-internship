    <textblock>
      The integrity of structural connectivity supporting cortical regions in the left brain&#xD;
      hemisphere is hypothesized to enable treatment-induced naming recovery in persons with&#xD;
      language difficulties after a stroke (aphasia). The investigators will map whole brain&#xD;
      connectivity (i.e., the brain connectome) to investigate the role of cortical connectivity in&#xD;
      impairment (Aim 1) and recovery (Aim 2) in patients with aphasia undergoing treatment. This&#xD;
      information will be used to construct personalized markers of anomia treatment outcome (Aim&#xD;
      3), which may serve as a guide for speech-language pathologists and neurologists when facing&#xD;
      patient management decisions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aphasia, an impairment of language processing, is one of the most common consequences of&#xD;
      strokes affecting the dominant brain hemisphere4. Patients with aphasia are usually incapable&#xD;
      of working, and their interactions with family and friends are often severely affected. The&#xD;
      hallmark deficit of aphasia is the inability to name objects or people (anomia)12. The&#xD;
      severity of anomia is closely related to a poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many patients with aphasia exhibit some language recovery in the first days to weeks&#xD;
      after the stroke, 30-40% persist with long lasting naming impairments4. Fortunately, speech&#xD;
      therapy can be very effective to improve naming for some patients with chronic aphasia5-8.&#xD;
      However, it is well recognized among clinicians that speech therapy can be ineffective for&#xD;
      other patients, making it difficult to predict how and why some patients benefit from naming&#xD;
      treatment, while others show little or no improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators propose to evaluate whether naming impairment and naming recovery are&#xD;
      related to the extent of structural damage to the cortical language network. Importantly, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate damage as the combined effect of cortical necrosis and cortical&#xD;
      disconnection. The investigators hypothesize that assessing anomia as being either due to&#xD;
      gray matter necrosis or due to cortical disconnection constitutes a false dichotomy since&#xD;
      most chronic patients exhibit gray and white matter damage. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      propose that disconnection of seemingly spared cortical areas has up till now been&#xD;
      underappreciated in patients with stroke due to limitations in brain connectivity assessment&#xD;
      tools. By examining only areas of cortical necrosis without considering disconnected areas,&#xD;
      one may underestimate the magnitude of language network damage. A better understanding of the&#xD;
      effects from both cortical damage and disconnection on anomia and its recovery could lead to&#xD;
      an improved clinical management of aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will employ the innovative concept of the brain connectome, i.e., the&#xD;
      individualized map of neural connections in the brain, to evaluate whether naming recovery is&#xD;
      supported by preserved gray matter and preserved connectivity involving key language areas in&#xD;
      the left hemisphere. The investigators propose that left frontal and left temporal&#xD;
      connectivity mapped based on the individual's connectome is an important explanatory variable&#xD;
      towards naming impairment and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that this research is significant for the three main reasons.&#xD;
      First, it can have a direct clinical impact by providing a better understanding of which&#xD;
      patients can benefit from therapy. Second, it can unveil the neurobiological mechanisms&#xD;
      supporting language recovery, improving our understanding of brain plasticity related to&#xD;
      language rehabilitation. Finally, if disconnection contributes to language impairment, our&#xD;
      methods can be developed to test specific theories of language organization in the brain. The&#xD;
      significance of these aspects is explained in detail below.&#xD;

        No new patients will be recruited for the current project. We will rely solely on data&#xD;
        collection in the tDCS-Trial (U01 DC011739, period 7/1/2012-6/31/2017). All information&#xD;
        used in our experiments will be available as a result of the standardized set of tests that&#xD;
        patients undergo in the trial.&#xD;
