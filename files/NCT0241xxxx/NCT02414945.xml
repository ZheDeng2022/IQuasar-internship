  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I and II clinical study for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (a&#xD;
      type of cancer affecting the lining of the lung). Patients will receive an infusion (given by&#xD;
      vein) of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). TILs are a type of white blood&#xD;
      cells that recognizes tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to break down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the cell infusion, patients will receive a two drugs cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      fludarabine to prepare the body to receive the TILs. After cell infusion, patients will&#xD;
      receive low-dose interleukin-2 therapy. This study will see how safe and useful this regimen&#xD;
      is in treating malignant pleural mesothelioma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational infusion product consists of autologous, in vitro-expanded&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The target number of cells for infusion is between 1 x&#xD;
      1010 and 1.6 x 1011. The cells are given intravenously over a 20-30 minute infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to infusion of TILs, patients will receive a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (60 mg/kg/day x 2 days intravenously) and fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day x 5 days intravenously).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the cell infusion, patients will receive low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy (125,000&#xD;
      IU/kg/day subcutaneously for 2 weeks with a 2 day break between each week. The goal for the&#xD;
      total number of doses is 9-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because confusion is a possible side effect of IL-2 administration, a Durable Power of&#xD;
      Attorney will be signed by the patient to identify a surrogate to make decisions if a patient&#xD;
      becomes unable to make decisions.&#xD;
