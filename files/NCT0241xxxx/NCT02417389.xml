&#xD;
      Introduction Cinacalcet is an orally active second-generation calcimimetic drug. Cinacalcet&#xD;
      increases the sensitivity of calcium receptors located on the surface of parathyroid cells,&#xD;
      thus inhibiting parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion (which is increased in&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism). Cinacalcet has been approved by FDA and EMEA for the use in dialyzed&#xD;
      patients affected by chronic renal failure with uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism,&#xD;
      on the basis of three 6-month double-blind placebo-controlled studies on more than 1,100&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTH secretion and parathyroid cell proliferation are regulated by the serum levels of ionized&#xD;
      calcium (Ca++). The mechanism is based on the binding of the Ca++ ion to a G-protein coupled&#xD;
      membrane receptor (GPCR), called Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaR). With low circulating levels&#xD;
      of Ca++ or with an alteration of the calcium-receptor binding, higher amounts of PTH are&#xD;
      secreted, hyperparathyroidism develops, and in the long term systemic alterations (bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) reduction, increased fracture risk, hypercalciuria, renal stones,&#xD;
      hypertension, etc.) appear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substances with calcimimetic action, such as Cinacalcet, have been recently developed. Until&#xD;
      now, Cinacalcet has been mainly used in hyperparathyroidism secondary to renal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this condition, Cinacalcet has been proven effective in reducing the circulating PTH to&#xD;
      acceptable levels, obtaining the normalization of serum Ca++ and phosphate levels in about&#xD;
      50% of cases. Moreover, the drug is usually well tolerated. Side effects (essentially nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting) are reported in about 30% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot studies have confirmed the efficacy of Cinacalcet in maintaining a normal calcemia in&#xD;
      the long term also in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) due to adenoma or&#xD;
      carcinoma of one parathyroid gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the investigators proposed to use of Cinacalcet in cases of PHP, in which&#xD;
      surgical intervention was not possible, and its use in combination with oral alendronate in&#xD;
      the presence of osteopenia/osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy and safety of long-term Cinacalcet treatment in patients with&#xD;
           PHP, who are not operable, or in whom the localization of the parathyroid adenoma has&#xD;
           not been possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of a combined therapy with Cinacalcet and alendronate in&#xD;
           controlling the bone loss induced by PHP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective, single-arm, 24-month study, organized in two phases. During Phase&#xD;
      1, all patients were treated with Cinacalcet alone for 12 months. During Phase 2, all&#xD;
      patients were treated with Cinacalcet (as before) plus oral alendronate (70 mg once weekly)&#xD;
      for another 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) rules, and was&#xD;
      approved by the Ethical Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was organized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 months for patient enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 months for the study (Phase 1 plus Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 months for the analysis of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolment was started after the approval of the protocol and the commitment of the&#xD;
      manufacturing Company to supply the Cinacalcet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population 22 patients with PHP, who are not operable, or in whom the localization of&#xD;
      the parathyroid adenoma has not been possible, and with reduced bone density (T-score â‰¤ -2 at&#xD;
      spine or hip) were included in the study. All patients were post-menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were included in the study, according to the pre-defined inclusion criteria (all 5&#xD;
      criteria must be met) and exclusion criteria (none of these criteria must be met).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of PHP: serum intact PTH level higher than 65 ng/ml on at least two determinations&#xD;
      during the 12 months before the start of the study (after exclusion of severe hypovitaminosis&#xD;
      D), and serum calcium higher than 10.4 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were studied in advance with parathyroid ecography or neck CT, and scintigraphy&#xD;
      with Sestamibi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrolment, the following exams were done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. evaluation of phosphate and calcium metabolism (blood: intact parathyroid hormone, total&#xD;
           calcium, ionized calcium, phosphate, creatinine, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D&#xD;
           1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, C-terminal telopeptide;&#xD;
           urine: calciuria 24-hours, phosphaturia 24-hours, N-terminal telopeptide, creatinine&#xD;
           clearance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. bone density evaluation (DXA scan: radius, lumbar spine, proximal femur, and total body)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. general evaluation (liver function, blood cell count, renal function (serum creatinine&#xD;
           and creatinine clearance)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and follow-up The initial treatment regimen was 30 mg of Cinacalcet twice a day, at&#xD;
      12-hour intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up was done as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 weeks after starting Cinacalcet, the plasma levels of total calcium and intact PTH&#xD;
           were measured. If the calcemia was still above 10.6 mg/dl, the Cinacalcet dose was&#xD;
           doubled (60 mg twice a day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 weeks after starting Cinacalcet, the following biochemical parameters were measured:&#xD;
           blood: PTH, total calcium, ionized calcium, phosphate, creatinine, liver function, blood&#xD;
           cell count; urine: calciuria 24-hours, phosphaturia 24-hours, N-terminal telopeptide,&#xD;
           creatinine clearance. If calcemia was still above 10.6 mg/dl, the Cinacalcet dose was&#xD;
           increased 90 mg twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  every 8 weeks, the following biochemical parameters were measured: blood: PTH, calcium,&#xD;
           ionized calcium, phosphate, creatinine, liver function, blood cell count; urine:&#xD;
           calciuria 24-hours, phosphaturia 24-hours, N-terminal telopeptide, creatinine clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after 12 months of Cinacalcet therapy, the DXA scan was repeated, and oral alendronate&#xD;
           at the dose of 70 mg weekly will be added&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the end of the 24th month of therapy, all the exams done at the time of enrolment&#xD;
           were repeated During the study, if serum total calcium levels decreased below 8.4 mg/dl,&#xD;
           the Cinacalcet daily dose was halved. If serum total calcium levels were still below 8.4&#xD;
           mg/dl with the minimum dose of Cinacalcet (30 mg once a day), Cinacalcet was stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these cases, serum calcemia was measured again at 1-week intervals, and the Cinacalcet&#xD;
      treatment was resumed accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients' data were collected in a specially designed CRF (case report form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects and adverse reactions were appropriately recorded in the CRF. The severity of&#xD;
      the side effects or adverse reactions were evaluated in order to decide whether the involved&#xD;
      drug(s) should be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AE) were recorded in a dedicated section of the CRF, in accordance with the&#xD;
      standard rules of clinical trials. The adverse events were classified, as usual, as serious&#xD;
      AE (SAE) or non-serious AE (AE). For each AE severity and causality were recorded. SAEs were&#xD;
      immediately reported to the drug manufacturer (Amgen). Appropriate clinical decisions&#xD;
      (immediate and follow-up) were made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the available literature, side effects of Cinacalcet were generally mild.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of severe side effects or SAE, treatment was to be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods All DXA scans and laboratory tests were performed at the Istituto Auxologico Italiano&#xD;
      IRCCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone mass was measured with a dual X-ray (DXA) Hologic Discovery densitometer at distal&#xD;
      radius, lumbar spine, hip and on total body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum and urinary calcium and phosphorus were measured with standard methods. Serum bone&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) were measured by EIA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Quidel,&#xD;
      San Diego, USA); serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTx) by immunoluminescent method (Roche&#xD;
      Diagnostic, Monza, Italy); urinary N-terminal telopeptide of procollagen type I (NTx) by EIA&#xD;
      (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ostex Intern. Inc., Seattle, USA). Serum intact&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) was measured by immunoluminescent method (Roche Diagnostic, Monza,&#xD;
      Italy); 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) by RIA (radioimmunological assay, DiaSorin Inc,&#xD;
      Stillwater, USA); 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2 D) by radio receptor assay (Nichols&#xD;
      Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the sample size, the following points were considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study was focused on a well-characterized, homogeneous group of patients affected by&#xD;
           PHP without the possibility of surgical removal of the adenoma, and also affected by&#xD;
           osteopenia/osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. These patients had already been followed at our Center for several years, so the risk of&#xD;
           drop-out re was very low (estimated 10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Considering the characteristics of the study (single-arm), a confidence level of 95%, a&#xD;
           5% significance, a drop-out rate of 10%, the 2.5% change in BMD, a sample size of 16&#xD;
           patients was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the patients coming to our attention, the investigators estimated to be able&#xD;
      to enroll 20 patients meeting the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were expressed as the mean plus or minus SD. All the variables were analyzed to evaluate&#xD;
      their normality (Shapiro-Wilk test), in order to choose the appropriate statistical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the comparison of the means, after evaluating the validity assumptions, the&#xD;
      Student's t test and one-way ANOVA were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05, two-sided. At the end of the study, the&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events was analyzed with descriptive statistics.&#xD;
