      We would like to propose that it may be possible to use a solitary dose of Elonva&#xD;
      (corifollitrophin alpha) as the sole gonadotrophin (FSH) stimulant for the vast majority of&#xD;
      women undergoing IVF, assuming that it is possible that &quot;coasting&quot; (withholding short acting&#xD;
      rFSH) from day 8 of the stimulation until trigger/ oocyte retrieval will still result in a&#xD;
      significant number of mature oocytes being produced and an acceptable pregnancy rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elonva (corifollitrophin alfa) has been shown to be a very effective rFSH stimulant for&#xD;
      Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation (COH) in the setting of IVF treatment. Its long duration&#xD;
      of action (7 days) results in a significant reduction in the number of COH stimulation&#xD;
      injections (average of 3 injections v 9 injections in the traditional &quot;short acting&quot; r FSH&#xD;
      COH), with 30% of patients requiring only a single Elonva injection for their COH (Engage&#xD;
      study, Devroey et al 2009). It is assumed that a reduction in the number of required COH&#xD;
      injections will have the advantages of improved patient acceptability and better compliance&#xD;
      due to a reduction in room for error. Despite these advantages the clinical uptake of Elonva&#xD;
      has been slow due to 2 principal concerns among clinicians:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A tendency for Elonva COH to result in a higher ovarian response with increased risk of&#xD;
           Ovarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). While this risk of OHSS was not statistically&#xD;
           significant in the pivotal Engage study, there was still a numerically greater chance of&#xD;
           OHSS and a greater chance of the IVF cycle being cancelled due to OHSS risk in the&#xD;
           Elonva arm compared to the traditional Puregon arm. Since women at high risk of OHSS&#xD;
           were excluded from the Engage study, clinicians perceive that the risk of OHSS is likely&#xD;
           to be significantly greater in the more heterogeneous general clinical population.&#xD;
           Whether this is a correct assumption is still up for debate, but it is a perceived issue&#xD;
           with the existing Elonva protocol that must be addressed if Elonva is to become used&#xD;
           widely as a COH stimulant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. According to the Engage and Ensure studies, the majority (70%) of women using Elonva&#xD;
           require &quot;top up&quot;short acting Puregon rFSH, with an average of 2 doses being required&#xD;
           before the patients reach the criteria for triggering and oocyte retrieval. As a result&#xD;
           clinics are required to teach two different injection protocols, increasing the time&#xD;
           required to educate the patient and possibly increasing the risk of confusion. The&#xD;
           ability to deliver a solitary COH stimulant without the need for any &quot;top up&quot; Puregon&#xD;
           would be a major advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale We would like to propose that it may be possible to use a solitary dose of Elonva&#xD;
      as the sole COS rFSH stimulant for the vast majority of women undergoing IVF, assuming that&#xD;
      it is possible that &quot;coasting&quot; (withholding short acting rFSH) from day 8 of the stimulation&#xD;
      until trigger/ oocyte retrieval will still result in a significant number of mature oocytes&#xD;
      being produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of OHSS it is common practice to withhold any further rFSH stimulant towards&#xD;
      the end of the COS process. It is generally accepted that medium size follicles of 14 mm or&#xD;
      greater will continue to develop to maturity in the absence of rFSH stimulation, while&#xD;
      smaller follicles will regress. This has the therapeutic advantage of reducing estradiol&#xD;
      levels and OHSS risk in women at high risk of OHSS. With this coasting physiology in mind, we&#xD;
      propose that provided a single injection of Elonva can result in a significant number of&#xD;
      follicles being 14 mm or greater by day 8 of stimulation, further rFSH will not be required.&#xD;
      Results from the Engage study (Doody et al 2011) reveal that by day 8 of stimulation on&#xD;
      average there were 5.1 follicles of 15 mm or greater. Therefore even if no further &quot;top up&quot;&#xD;
      rFSH was given from day 8, one could expect to get at least 5 mature oocytes from an oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval triggered by hCG in the next 2 days. While 5 mature oocytes is significantly less&#xD;
      than what was produced by the traditional Elonva protocol using additional rFSH (average 10.8&#xD;
      in the Engage study, 10.7 in the Ensure study), this could be perceived as a significant&#xD;
      advantage since it will likely result in a significant reduction in OHSS risk, a perceived&#xD;
      problem with the traditional Elonva protocol. If we assume a 70% fertilization rate and that&#xD;
      approximately half of all embryos are of good quality by day 4/5 of culture, the production&#xD;
      of &gt; 3 mature oocytes should ensure the generation of at least one good quality embryo for&#xD;
      transfer with a good chance of pregnancy. This type of low impact stimulation is likely to be&#xD;
      very popular in Europe and Australia where clinicians already accept the benefits of mild&#xD;
      COS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, if we are able to provide evidence in this pilot study that a single injection of&#xD;
      Elonva can result in the majority of women reaching oocyte retrieval with the production of&#xD;
      at least 3 mature oocytes, while giving good fresh embryo transfer pregnancy rates and no&#xD;
      OHSS, the coasting Elonva protocol may become a significant clinical protocol for low impact&#xD;
      COS in the future.&#xD;
