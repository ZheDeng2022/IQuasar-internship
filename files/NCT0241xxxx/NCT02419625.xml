  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis E virus is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with genome of approximately&#xD;
      7.2kb in length. The HEV genome is capped at the 5' end followed by a small untranslated&#xD;
      region of 27 nucleotides and polyadenalated at the 3' end preceded by another UTR of 65&#xD;
      nucleotides . HEV has three open reading frames: ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 that encode structural&#xD;
      and non- structural proteins. ORF1 is the largest one, approximately 5,000 nt in length,&#xD;
      located at the 5 ' end and encodes important proteins for the replication process&#xD;
      (methyltransferase, papain-like cysteine protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA&#xD;
      polymerase). A noncoding, hypervariable region within ORF1 displays substantial genetic&#xD;
      diversity; this region seems to modulate the efficiency of HEV replication. Notably, the&#xD;
      differences in the genome size among different HEV strains are confined mainly to this region&#xD;
      .ORF2 is located at the 3' end, encodes structural capsid proteins of 660 amino acids and&#xD;
      contains three potential glycosylation sites. The ORF2 protein contains multiple immunogenic&#xD;
      sites and neutralizing antibodies are directed against it al., .The essential region in the&#xD;
      protein for immunogenicity is 452aa-617aa and the neutralizing epitopes have recently been&#xD;
      shown to be conformational .ORF3 is located between the other two reading frames and encodes&#xD;
      a small phosphoprotein of 123 amino acids. Its exact function has not been yet determined,&#xD;
      however, multiple functions have been proposed. It is thought to interact with cellular&#xD;
      mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase and other extracellular kinases, promoting cell&#xD;
      survival through activation of intracellular signaling pathways .Moreover, the binding of the&#xD;
      ORF3 encoded protein to host-specific proteins seems to influence the pathogenesis of HEV&#xD;
      infections .A schematic drawing of the HEV genome is described in Figure 1 .&#xD;

      General aim To identify the overall and subgroup-specific HEV sero-prevalence in Israel and&#xD;
      examine associations between HEV seropositivity and putative risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the sero-prevalence of Israeli healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the sero-prevalence of HEV infections in Israeli healthy population by age,&#xD;
           gender, ethnicity, religion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To present the seroprevalence in five specific groups (farmers and swine veterinaries,&#xD;
           unexplained acute hepatitis, immunosuppressed transplant recipients, immunosuppressed&#xD;
           HIV patients) and identify if these specific population groups are at high risk of HEV&#xD;
           sero-prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify risk factors associated with an increased risk of HEV sero-prevalence in&#xD;
           immunosuppressed transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify risk factors associated with an increased risk of HEV sero-prevalence in&#xD;
           farmers and swine veterinaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the molecular characteristic of HEV in Israel and investigate the&#xD;
           similarities to previously published HEV sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the incidence of HEV seroconversion/ infection in transplant recipients.&#xD;
           (sero-negative pre-transplanted patients will be tested consistently for HEV Ab's and&#xD;
           HEV RNA after transplantation)&#xD;
