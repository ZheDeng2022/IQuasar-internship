  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who have been diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)&#xD;
      and have been treated with adjuvant imatinib for 3 years after surgery will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive imatinib (Gleevec) for 2 more years (Arm A) or to stop&#xD;
      imatinib (Arm B). The study participants are required to have histologically verified GIST&#xD;
      with a high risk of GIST recurrence despite removal of all macroscopic GIST tissue at surgery&#xD;
      and 3 years of adjuvant imatinib. The high risk of GIST recurrence is defined as one of the&#xD;
      following: gastric GIST with mitotic count &gt;10/50 high power fields (HPFs) of the microscope,&#xD;
      non-gastric GIST with mitotic count &gt;5/50 HPFs, or tumor rupture. Study participants&#xD;
      allocated to Arm A will receive imatinib 400 mg/day for 24 months after the date of&#xD;
      randomization. All study participants will be followed up using blood tests and computerized&#xD;
      tomography (or MRI) of the abdomen. The computerized tomography examinations will be&#xD;
      performed at 6 month intervals. A total of 300 patients will be entered to the study. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that adjuvant imatinib given for a total of 5 years may prevent some of&#xD;
      the GISTs to recur as compared to patients who receive adjuvant imatinib for 3 years, and&#xD;
      there may be a difference in the rate of GIST recurrence between the two groups.&#xD;
