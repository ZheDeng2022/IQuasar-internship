  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This four-year, prospective, longitudinal study will evaluate and validate a patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome measure, clinician-reported outcome measures, and imaging techniques in assessing&#xD;
      characteristics, trajectory, and progression of lymphedema and fibrosis (LEF) in oral cavity&#xD;
      and oropharyngeal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial studies patient-and-clinician-reported measures as well as standard&#xD;
      imaging methods to see how accurate they are in identifying and evaluating lymphedema&#xD;
      (swelling) or fibrosis (tough or tight tissue) in the head and neck region of patients&#xD;
      receiving treatment for newly diagnosed stage II-IV oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
      Lymphedema and fibrosis (LEF) can lead to physical symptoms, such as trouble swallowing and&#xD;
      chewing, as well as psychological and emotional symptoms, such as negative body image and&#xD;
      avoiding social interactions. Finding an accurate test to identify and evaluate LEF may allow&#xD;
      doctors to treat LEF more quickly and control symptoms more effectively, and thus provide&#xD;
      patients with a better quality of life.&#xD;

      The goal of this proposed study is to establish a valid, clinically useful measurement&#xD;
      battery for head and neck LEF by achieving these specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the reliability and validity of the patient-reported outcome measure&#xD;
      (LSIDS-H&amp;N) for assessing LEF-related symptoms in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer&#xD;
      patients across the trajectory of treatment, recovery, and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the reliability and validity of the clinician-reported outcome measures&#xD;
      (HN-LEF Grading Criteria and Modified Patterson Scale) for assessing external and internal&#xD;
      LEF in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients across the trajectory of treatment,&#xD;
      recovery, and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the reliability and validity of imaging techniques (CT scan and&#xD;
      ultrasonography) in identifying site-specific LEF in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer&#xD;
      patients across the trajectory of treatment, recovery, and survival.&#xD;

    <description>PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURE: Validity of LSIDS-H&amp;N will be assessed using 6 forms (e.g., Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey (v2.0); Neck Disability Index; and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).&#xD;
CLINICIAN-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES: External LEF will be assessed using HN-LEF Grading Criteria, CTCAE (v4.03), and digital photos of the head and neck. Internal LEF will be scored using Modified Patterson Scale through an endoscopic exam. Both external/internal measures are re-assessed for intrarater and interrater reliability.&#xD;
OBJECTIVE/TECHNICAL MEASURES: Patients undergo CT scans and ultrasound exams with results re-scored for intrarater and interrater reliability.</description>
