      The purpose of this study is to create a data repository of patients who have undergone&#xD;
      spinal arthrodesis procedures supplemented with the Implanet Jazz System. This device is&#xD;
      designed to provide a stable interface between spinal constructs and the rods; it can be&#xD;
      secured around vertebral structures (such as the lamina, transverse or spinous processes)&#xD;
      from T1 to L5 and is intended to provide temporary stabilization as a bone anchor during the&#xD;
      development of a solid bony fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are candidates for hybrid thoracolumbar fixation with the Implanet Jazz System&#xD;
      during arthrodesis surgery will be asked to participate in this protocol. Clinical data will&#xD;
      be collected as indicated at 6 weeks, as well as 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 48, and 60 months post&#xD;
      surgery in the database. Data collected will include demographic and surgical information,&#xD;
      physiological data, neurological assessments and patient reported outcomes. This&#xD;
      comprehensive database will allow for gathering of relevant information for potential future&#xD;
      research use.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are candidates for spinal arthrodesis surgery (thoracic and/or lumbar)&#xD;
             supplemented by the Implanet Jazz System are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients under the age of 18 are excluded because the investigators do not routinely&#xD;
             perform spinal arthrodesis surgery on these patients.&#xD;
