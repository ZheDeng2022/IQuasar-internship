    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab with&#xD;
      or without CBP/beta-catenin antagonist PRI-724 (PRI-724) works in treating patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may&#xD;
      block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. PRI-724 may help stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking the specific signaling pathway that cancer cells need to&#xD;
      grow and spread. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab works&#xD;
      better with or without PRI-724 in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer treated with modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin 6&#xD;
      (mFOLFOX6)/bevacizumab and PRI-724 vs. mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Overall survival, defined as period from time of randomization to death. II. Response&#xD;
      rate. III. Determine the incidence and severity of adverse events of PRI-724 administered as&#xD;
      a 7-day continuous infusion in patients treated with mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab and PRI-724.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of genes involved in the&#xD;
      Wnt pathway (i.e. survivin) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in&#xD;
      patients treated with mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab and PRI-724 vs. mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab alone both in&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor biopsy specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine if CTC survivin and stem cell marker expression is consistent and congruent with&#xD;
      expression in tumor specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine if a correlation exists between Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog&#xD;
      (KRAS)/ B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutation status and intratumoral&#xD;
      gene expression of the following Wnt related biomarkers: survivin, vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),&#xD;
      S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4), EPH receptor B2 (EphB2), connexin43, cyclinD1 in&#xD;
      patients treated with mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab and PRI-724 vs. mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the mutational spectrum in colon cancer tissues. III. Determine single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles in normal and colon cancer tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine and describe tumor heterogeneity in colon cancer tissue prior to and during&#xD;
      treatment with PRI-724.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine gene expression signatures, micro RNA (miRNA) signatures, and deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) methylation signatures as potential predictive and prognostic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive CBP/beta-catenin antagonist PRI-724 intravenously (IV) continuously&#xD;
      on days 1-7, bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, oxaliplatin&#xD;
      IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day 8. Courses repeat every 14 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil as in&#xD;
      Arm I. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
