  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to correlate the intensity and the duration of a mechanical strain,&#xD;
      applied over the skin of a bedridden paraplegics, with the microvascularization parameters&#xD;
      (oxygen saturation, blood flow and blood volume) and the early inflammatory mechanism. We&#xD;
      want to detect the early stage of irreversible damage for each patient. To achieve this goal,&#xD;
      we measure some specifics data over a group of 48 paraplegics admitted in the hospital for a&#xD;
      pressure ulcer surgical treatment. The patients are randomly distributed in 4 groups. First&#xD;
      the interface pressure between the patient body and the air mattress is recorded continuously&#xD;
      for 3 hours (= the repositioning patient frequency): we have the pressure over each point of&#xD;
      the patient body in contact with the mattress on this time lap. Then, we will measure the&#xD;
      microvascularization parameters, using an O2C medical device over a trochanter on a specific&#xD;
      anatomical area which will be thereafter biopsied. Finally, depending on the group in which&#xD;
      they were randomly distributed, the patient will undergo a muscle biopsy on his or her&#xD;
      trochanter at 0h, 1h, 2h or 3h after they lie down on the air mattress. This way, we will be&#xD;
      able to determine the effect of the mechanical strain duration on the physiologic parameters.&#xD;
      The following day, the patient is undergoing his or her surgery for removing the necrotic&#xD;
      area of the bedsore. At the same time, we will recover some of the sample near the bedsore&#xD;
      which would serve as a maximum inflammatory response. Then a second muscle biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed on an innervated area to be able to determine a basal concentration of biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period for this study will be 3 years. All the patients are followed for 24&#xD;
      hours then they will be followed by medical staff in their bedsore resection setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data gained for this study will hopefully help the scientific world to achieve a better&#xD;
      understanding of the pressure ulcer aetiology. They will also be helpful to achieve a&#xD;
      mobilization of the patient specific of his or her inherent characteristics with a high&#xD;
      sensitivity level. This way we will have a more efficient bedsore prevention.&#xD;
