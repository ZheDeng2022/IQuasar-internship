      Objectives: To assess whether embryo transfer guided by three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS)&#xD;
      produces a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate than embryo transfer guided by&#xD;
      two-dimensional ultrasound (2DUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 3DUS guided embryo transfer will produce a significantly higher clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rate compared with 2DUS guided embryo transfer. Design and subjects: Prospective&#xD;
      randomised control trial (RCT) at the Prince of Wales Hospital. Inclusion criteria include&#xD;
      women undergoing embryo transfer in fresh and frozen cycles. Exclusion criteria include women&#xD;
      aged &gt;42 years and women whose endometrial cavity cannot be visualised adequately via US.&#xD;
      Power calculations indicate that 232 patients per arm are required to demonstrate an increase&#xD;
      of 12% in clinical pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments: US examinations will be performed using a General Electric(GE) Voluson&#xD;
      series US machine with a standard 3D transvaginal probe. For embryo transfer, the Cooks&#xD;
      Guardia Access EchoTip catheter will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: 3D versus 2DUS for guidance during embryo transfer. Main outcome measures:&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy. Secondary outcome measures: implantation rate, multiple pregnancy,&#xD;
      miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy and live birth rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Data processing and analysis will be performed using the Statistical Packages&#xD;
      of Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS, Inc). Descriptive and comparative statistical methods&#xD;
      will be used to analyse the primary outcomes. P-values of &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The study arm undergoing 3DUS guided embryo transfer are expected to have&#xD;
      an improved clinical pregnancy rate compared with the control arm undergoing 2DUS guided&#xD;
      embryo transfer.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role and use of 2DUS in gynaecology is undisputed as it forms an integral part of&#xD;
      diagnosing pathologies of the uterus, tubes and ovaries. In reproductive medicine, it is of&#xD;
      particular significance as it is additionally the most widespread tool available to monitor&#xD;
      endometrial thickness, follicular status and growth, allow guided retrieval of oocytes from&#xD;
      the ovary and also guided transfer of fertilised embryos into the uterus [1]. These are&#xD;
      undoubtedly some of the most critical procedures/steps of ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of 3DUS has brought somewhat of a breakthrough in the field as now 3D volumes&#xD;
      of images can be acquired and analysed live or retrospectively. From a practical perspective,&#xD;
      the scanning procedure does not differ from the routine 2D US and the acquisition of a 3D&#xD;
      volume requires only a few seconds. Analysis of these volumes allows reconstruction of planes&#xD;
      which are not always possible with 2DUS (such as the 3D coronal plane of the uterus). As a&#xD;
      result, 3DUS is now considered to be the most accurate non-invasive modality to diagnose&#xD;
      uterine anomalies [2, 3]. Furthermore, 3DUS allows accurate volume calculations of structures&#xD;
      such as the endometrium and follicles. These new possibilities, coupled with advanced&#xD;
      software now also allows for automated measurements of these variables, which may improve&#xD;
      accuracy, reduce interobserver variability and increase efficiency of an ART unit [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several publications now in the literature support that 3DUS may play a major role in ART in&#xD;
      the future [5-8]. Areas which 3D US may provide additional information are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of ovarian blood flow, follicular volume and growth [9]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of endometrial and subendometrial blood flow and volume [10, 11]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of precise catheter placement during embryo transfers [12] The latter is&#xD;
           perhaps the area which has been the least investigated so far, despite embryo transfer&#xD;
           being arguably the step of highest importance throughout the entire ART process. Two&#xD;
           preliminary studies have shown that 3DUS guided embryo transfer significantly improves&#xD;
           catheter placement compared with 2DUS [13] and can allow for correction of up to 20% of&#xD;
           mal-positioned catheters where 2DUS alone has been used [14]. The largest series to&#xD;
           date, has demonstrated that by use of 3DUS, the placement of embryos can be performed in&#xD;
           the so called maximum implantation potential point, which is where the trajectories of&#xD;
           the fallopian tubes meet in the centre of the uterine cavity, where the endometrial&#xD;
           thickness and blood flow is thought to be greatest [12]. However, to our knowledge,&#xD;
           there has been no randomised controlled trial (RCT) in the literature to systematically&#xD;
           test 3DUS versus 2DUS guided embryo transfer with respect to pregnancy outcomes. If 3DUS&#xD;
           guided embryo transfer is confirmed to produce a higher pregnancy rate than 2DUS guided&#xD;
           embryo transfer, it will have significant impact on the daily clinical practice of ART&#xD;
           units worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To determine if 3DUS guided embryo transfer should routinely replace 2DUS guided embryo&#xD;
      transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 3DUS guided embryo transfer produces a higher clinical pregnancy rate compared&#xD;
      with 2DUS guided embryo transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN OF INVESTIGATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment Women with infertility will be recruited from the Assisted Reproductive&#xD;
      Technology Unit of the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecological, Prince of Wales Hospital.&#xD;
      They will be given information leaflets at the beginning of their treatment cycle, and&#xD;
      further counselled on the day of oocyte retrieval or on the day of commencement of&#xD;
      progesterone therapy. This will allow sufficient time to consider participation in the trial&#xD;
      and confirm their consent on the day of embryo transfer. The investigators anticipate that&#xD;
      over 80% of subjects undergoing embryo transfer will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women undergoing embryo transfer in either fresh or frozen cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women whose endometrial cavity can be visualised adequately via US Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women aged &gt;42 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women whose endometrial cavity cannot be visualised adequately via US, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large fibroids Adenomyosis BMI&gt;35 Significant uterine retroflexion/retroversion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation The largest published series to date using 3DUS guided embryo transfers&#xD;
      demonstrates a clinical pregnancy rate of 37% for women with an average age of 38 [12]. Our&#xD;
      unit in 2013 achieved a clinical pregnancy rate of 25% for women in a similar age group.&#xD;
      Assuming that 3DUS guided embryo transfer will enable our unit to increase the clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rate from 25% to 37 % (an increase of 12%), a power calculation using alpha of&#xD;
      0.05, beta of 0.2 and power of 0.80, indicates that 232 patients per arm are required. To&#xD;
      account for a small amount of drop-outs 480 subjects in total will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 232 women per arm will be recruited as part of this prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. The inclusion criteria will be patients with reproductive failure undergoing IVF/ICSI&#xD;
      embryo transfer. The exclusion criteria will be (i) women aged &gt;42 years; (ii) women whose&#xD;
      endometrial cavity cannot be visualised adequately via US, such as large fibroids,&#xD;
      adenomyosis; (iii) BMI&gt;35, and (iv) significant uterine retroflexion/retroversion. At the&#xD;
      time of embryo transfer, patients will be assigned to either of two groups: a) the 2DUS group&#xD;
      where they will have their embryo transferred under the guidance of 2DUS, or b) the 3DUS&#xD;
      group, where they will have their embryo transferred under the guidance of 3DUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Patients will be randomised into the 3D or 2DUS groups with a 1 to 1 ratio&#xD;
      using a computer-generated randomisation list with blocks of 10 in sealed envelopes&#xD;
      pre-prepared by an impartial research nurse, to ensure equal distribution of subject&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The use of 2DUS guidance for embryo transfer is universally standard practice. All&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations will be performed using the GE Voluson series ultrasound machines,&#xD;
      with a standard 3D transvaginal probe (model RIC5-9-D; 6.6 MHz central image frequency). The&#xD;
      examination with 3DUS will be identical to the routine 2D examination including an&#xD;
      acquisition of a 3D volume which takes a few seconds. The 3D facility is engaged by switching&#xD;
      into the &quot;3D&quot; mode. A mobile sector appears and the operator identifies the &quot;region of&#xD;
      interest.&quot; The acquisition is then commenced and the transducer crystal then rotates through&#xD;
      approximately 90° for less than 10 seconds. The images are shown instantly to the operator&#xD;
      and can be stored digitally onto the hard disc attached to ultrasonography machine for&#xD;
      subsequent analysis. For the purpose of homogeneity and to reduce operator bias, the&#xD;
      principal applicant (SS) will perform all 3DUS examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of homogeneity and to reduce operator bias, the principal investigator (SS)&#xD;
      will perform all 3DUS examinations. In the 3D group, the catheter position will be corrected&#xD;
      according to the coronal plane view of the uterus on 3DUS, aiming for the maximum&#xD;
      implantation potential point, along the midline of the uterine cavity, as previously&#xD;
      described in the literature [12]. In the 2D group, the catheter position will be guided in&#xD;
      the longitudinal plane by 2DUS, according to current clinical practice. The patients will be&#xD;
      blinded to which technique is used during the embryo transfer, but will be shown a 2D/3D&#xD;
      image of the embryo flash after the transfer is complete and after the catheter has been&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The primary outcome measure will be the clinical pregnancy rate, defined as&#xD;
      the presence of at least one gestational sac at 6 weeks gestation. The secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will include implantation rate, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy,&#xD;
      and live birth rates. Miscarriage will be defined as biochemical if there is no US evidence&#xD;
      of pregnancy and clinical if there is US evidence of pregnancy. Live birth will be considered&#xD;
      as a baby born live after 24 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and analysis The researchers will ensure the confidentiality of sensitive&#xD;
      data by minimizing the number of personnel who handles subject data. The computer data will&#xD;
      be encrypted as required to maximize security. All paper documents will be locked in filing&#xD;
      cabinets, and only authorized personnel could access this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing for statistical analysis will be performed using the Statistical Packages of&#xD;
      Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS, Inc). Data will be presented by percentage, mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation, median and range where appropriate. Comparisons between groups will be&#xD;
      carried out by Student T test for continuous variables, ANOVA for mean value comparisons,&#xD;
      Chi-square/Fisher's exact test for categorical data. Stepwise logistic regression analysis&#xD;
      may be performed as part of systematic analysis for primary outcomes. P-values of &lt;0.05 will&#xD;
      be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and interim analysis As the study is perceived to be safe and poses no additional&#xD;
      hazard, a Data Monitoring Committee and interim analysis is not considered necessary, in&#xD;
      accordance with the most current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations US is a safe and non-invasive examination. There are no known adverse&#xD;
      effects of routine ultrasound to the mother or the embryo. No extra pain or discomfort is&#xD;
      associated with the 3DUS versus 2DUS and the time difference in performing the exam is&#xD;
      minimal. Application for ethics approval has already been submitted in December 2014 and is&#xD;
      pending final approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent All subjects will be given detailed written explanation of the study and sufficient&#xD;
      time to consider their participation. A written consent form will be signed by the patient&#xD;
      and retained in our confidential records.&#xD;
