    <textblock>
      Short-term and chronic exposure to ambient levels of particulate matter (PM) is associated&#xD;
      with increased morbidity and mortality related to respiratory and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Proposed biological pathways imply that particle-induced inflammation plays a role in&#xD;
      activating the vascular endothelium and altering vascular function. Accumulating evidence&#xD;
      suggests that outdoor air pollution has a significant impact on central nervous system health&#xD;
      and disease and living in conditions with elevated air pollution has been linked to decreased&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only recently was shown that reductions in ambient levels of PM2.5 were associated with&#xD;
      improvements in life expectancy. However, studies of the beneficial effects of improved&#xD;
      indoor air quality on healthy humans are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project the investigators intend to study the effects of rooms with clean air in&#xD;
      the elderly with the emphasis on cardiovascular and cognitive function. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesise that by means of air cleaning, controlled and reduced exposure has a positive&#xD;
      effect on cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate variability, macro-&#xD;
      and microcirculation and on neurobehavioral function. The investigators substantiate these&#xD;
      outcomes with potential mechanisms of action at the transcript and epigenetic level as with&#xD;
      hematological parameters, markers of inflammation, lipid and protein oxidation products and&#xD;
      mitochondrial DNA damage. To achieve these goals there is a specific need to study the&#xD;
      elderly, as they appear to have elevated susceptibility and have the largest attributable&#xD;
      risk related to indoor PM, as they spend more time indoors. Suited concepts for study&#xD;
      location are elderly homes (&quot;service flats&quot;) and retirement homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;ELiFA&quot;-cohort stands for Elderly Living in Filtered Air consisting of an intervention&#xD;
      study during 2-week periods of a pre-purification (baseline), active purification and a post&#xD;
      purification period.&#xD;

      1. Study Population and Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           Persons living in ''service flats'' or retirement homes are healthy elderly who&#xD;
           respectively live semi-independently or dependently. The elderly homes will be located&#xD;
           in Flanders, Belgium. Persons are included if they are 65 years or older, not bedridden,&#xD;
           non- smoker and able to give informed consent. This selection is made on the basis of&#xD;
           the mental state of candidate participants, this primary selection is based on the&#xD;
           advice of the directors or head nurses of the elderly homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A documented minimental state examination (MMSE) will be performed and the participation&#xD;
           of the candidates will depend on a priori determined criteria (score 23) and the ability&#xD;
           of the possible participant to perform the NES tests (cognitive test), done a priori of&#xD;
           enrolment. The project design is an intervention study of in total 6 weeks, starting&#xD;
           with a baseline pre-purification period, a 2-week active purification period and a&#xD;
           2-week post purification period. Each participant is his/her own control, excluding&#xD;
           confounding by factors that are stable within an individual over time but vary between&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The device (GENANO tubes, GENANO Benelux; Heusen-Zolder, België) is placed in the living&#xD;
           room of each apartment during the study period. These kinds of air purification devices&#xD;
           are used in medical settings (cleanrooms, medical practice) and give us the opportunity&#xD;
           to create a well-controlled experimental real life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultra fine particle (UFP) (Aerasense, Philips), PM10-2.5 and total suspended&#xD;
           particulates (TSP) (Aerocet, MetOne) are monitored. Blood and urine are sampled every&#xD;
           week in the morning at the same hour per participant to avoid problems due to diurnal&#xD;
           variation. The participants will be asked to fill in a questionnaire. For the duration&#xD;
           of the study, the investigators ask the participants to keep their windows closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary Endpoints The primary endpoints focus on changes in the cardiovascular en&#xD;
           neurobiological function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Cardiovascular function. The cardiovascular measurements are conducted&#xD;
           non-invasively and are wide ranging in order to comprehensively study these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.1. Microvasculature: After pupillary dilation, digital images of both the retinas&#xD;
           are obtained using a digital retinal camera (Canon CR-2 Digital Retinal Camera).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.2. Macro vasculature: The distensibility and intermedia thickness of the carotid&#xD;
           artery are measured by echo-graphical imaging with the esaote MY LAB ™ ONE mobil device.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.3.Heart rate variability: With a mobile ECG sensor (Biopatch, Zephyr) the heart rate&#xD;
           variability (HRV) is continuously monitored for several 24h periods during the 3 phases&#xD;
           of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.4. Blood pressure: Using Stabil-O-Graph devices the blood pressure is determined 5&#xD;
           consecutive times for every time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Cognitive function The investigators assess the neurobehavioral function with the&#xD;
           Neurobehavioral Evaluation System (NES-3). Neurobehavioral Evaluation System (NES) is a&#xD;
           computerised battery of tests developed to study the neurological effects of an exposure&#xD;
           to environmental agents. The investigators use the digit span test, the continuous&#xD;
           performance and the Stroop test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Secondary Endpoints The investigators delineate these outcomes with secondary endpoints&#xD;
           to find potential mechanisms of action at the transcript and epigenetic level as with on&#xD;
           haematological parameters, markers of inflammation and lipid and protein oxidation&#xD;
           products and mitochondrial DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Transcriptomics and Epigenetics The investigators study underlying mechanisms either by&#xD;
      full transcriptome analysis and gene specific transcription patterns as well as by specific&#xD;
      hypothesis driven microRNA studies. Epigenetic profiles are studied by gene specific&#xD;
      methylation sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Haematological measurements, markers of inflammation, and oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators measure hemoglobin, red blood cells, fibrinogen, platelets, coagulation&#xD;
      factors (II + VII + X), IL-6 and urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Mitochondrial DNA damage The investigators measure the mitochondrial DNA content&#xD;
      relative to nuclear DNA by means of qPCR, which is a measure of DNA damage and can give an&#xD;
      indication of the need to repair mitochondrial DNA damage. As this parameter is an early&#xD;
      sensor of DNA-damage these samples will be collected from the whole blood tubes.&#xD;
