  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obstructive or neurogenic lower urinary tract disease will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. Upon agreement they will undergo an assessment of bladder function&#xD;
      (questionnaires) and bladder biopsies at 2 time-points. Bladder biopsies will be evaluated&#xD;
      for molecular changes in the laboratory and compared to the functional findings.By uncovering&#xD;
      the molecular similarities and differences between BLUTD and NLUTD, the investigators will&#xD;
      elucidate some of the causative factors in the development of these disorders and highlight&#xD;
      the impact of myogenic and neurogenic components postulated to be involved. The project&#xD;
      involves close collaboration between clinical and basic research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) has multiple causes including bladder outlet&#xD;
      obstruction (BOO) as a result of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and neurological diseases&#xD;
      including spinal cord injury (SCI). Manifestations of LUTD include storage symptoms such as&#xD;
      increased daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency and urinary incontinence and voiding symptoms&#xD;
      such as slow stream, hesitancy and incomplete emptying. The consequences of both BOO-induced&#xD;
      (BLUTD) and neurogenic LUTD (NLUTD), leading to functional entities including the low&#xD;
      compliance high pressure bladder as well as the acontractile high volume low pressure&#xD;
      bladder, are believed to share some pathogenetic mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous project, the investigators have established micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) and&#xD;
      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression profiles of several urodynamically defined&#xD;
      states of BLUTD. In this follow-up project, the investigators propose to extend these&#xD;
      studies, undertaking a comparative miRNA and RNA profiling of BLUTD and NLUTD, and&#xD;
      investigate the dynamic alteration of microRNA expression in different functional&#xD;
      manifestations of disease. The investigators propose to validate primary gene targets of&#xD;
      miRNAs differentially expressed in urodynamically defined states of BLUTD and identify&#xD;
      signaling pathways, activated during the progression from hypertrophy to decompensation.&#xD;
      Monitoring the reversal of changes in miRNA expression after relief of obstruction and&#xD;
      restoration of normal bladder function will help delineate the key BOO-induced miRNAs with&#xD;
      regulatory potential. Similarly, the dynamics of miRNA alteration, observed in SCI patients&#xD;
      during the development and management of NLUTD should reveal the role of miRNA in gene&#xD;
      expression regulation during neurogenic-induced organ remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By uncovering the molecular similarities and differences between BLUTD and NLUTD, the&#xD;
      investigators will elucidate some of the causative factors in the development of these&#xD;
      disorders and highlight the impact of myogenic and neurogenic components postulated to be&#xD;
      involved. The project involves close collaboration between clinical and basic research, and&#xD;
      combines the analysis of human biopsy material with in vitro cell-based assays, creating a&#xD;
      comprehensive platform for the dissection of molecular mechanisms of LUTD. This project will&#xD;
      keep the momentum of the investigators' previous research and contribute to the basic and&#xD;
      applied studies into bladder remodeling. It is a logical continuation of their on-going&#xD;
      studies of the role of miRNAs in LUT disorders but represents a novel direction of research&#xD;
      and has high diagnostic and therapeutic potential.&#xD;
