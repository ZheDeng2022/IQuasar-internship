      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people with movement disorders are in another NIH protocol. They will have electrodes&#xD;
      placed in deep brain areas. They may do tasks before, during, and after surgery. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about how brain cells and networks work while people learn and remember.&#xD;
      They want to use the data from the other NIH study to do this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To share data from before and during deep brain stimulation surgery. The data will be used&#xD;
      in a study of how the brain learns and remembers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 18 years old who are in protocol 11-N-0211 and have certain movement&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As part of protocol 11-N-0211, data on participants brainwave activity is collected. In&#xD;
           this protocol, they will have that data stored and shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will access imaging data from deep brain stimulation surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will access other medical records.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to share neural data collected before and during deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation surgery with the University of Pennsylvania to identify biomarkers of successful&#xD;
      learning and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to twenty (20) adult subjects who are participating in NIH protocol 11-N-0211 Deep Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation Surgery for Movement Disorders who provide written informed consent for sharing&#xD;
      and the additional use of their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol only involves providing consent to share learning and memory data collected&#xD;
      under Protocol 11-N-0211. There are no separate or additional participant procedures involved&#xD;
      in this protocol.&#xD;
