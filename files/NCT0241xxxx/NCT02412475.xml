  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful treatment for children and young adults with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      continues to be a significant challenge. Despite relative improvements in survival for&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed AML, an estimated 40-60% will relapse with the majority&#xD;
      eventually dying of their relapsed disease. Attaining a subsequent remission in patients who&#xD;
      relapse is the initial critical step toward achieving a potential cure. As chemotherapy&#xD;
      resistance is one of the primary drivers of poor treatment response and subsequent relapse in&#xD;
      AML, identifying methods to reverse this resistance are desperately needed. This clinical&#xD;
      trial is aimed at improving the remission re-Induction rates for children and adults with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory AML through epigenetic modifying agents that have the ability to&#xD;
      reverse chemotherapy resistance. Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and&#xD;
      Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), are two epigenetic modifying drugs that&#xD;
      act on the methylation of proximal promoter regions of genes and on proteins involved in the&#xD;
      wrapping of DNA around histones, respectively. Both processes play a critical role in&#xD;
      regulating gene expression, and frequently these genes are involved in chemotherapy&#xD;
      resistance. These agents are FDA-approved for treatment in adult hematologic malignancies,&#xD;
      making this an opportune time to begin testing these novel therapies in pediatric leukemia&#xD;
      trials. This study will investigate chemotherapy priming of relapsed/refractory AML using&#xD;
      Decitabine and Vorinostat given for 5 days prior to standard re-Induction with Fludarabine,&#xD;
      Cytarabine and G-CSF for children and adults.&#xD;

      Phase 1 Study Number of Patients: 12 to 24 evaluable subjects will be required to enroll&#xD;
      subjects in all 4 dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of decitabine when used in this&#xD;
           combination with vorinostat, fludarabine, high dose cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG) for&#xD;
           children and young adults with relapsed or refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability to safely deliver the combination of decitabine and vorinostat&#xD;
           followed by fludarabine, high dose cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG) in pediatric and young&#xD;
           adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives o To establish the extent of hypomethylation of peripheral blood (PB)&#xD;
      and bone marrow (BM) pre- and post- decitabine and vorinostat treatment by: LINE-1&#xD;
      methylation assay as a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation. Direct Comprehensive DNA&#xD;
      methylation analysis Gene expression profiling to assess genetic changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression pre- and&#xD;
           post-treatment with decitabine and vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the correlation between biological changes and clinical response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Study Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study entry is open to patients regardless of gender or ethnic background. While there will&#xD;
      be every effort to seek out and include females and minority patients, the patient population&#xD;
      is expected to be no different than that of other acute leukemia studies at the Medical&#xD;
      College of Wisconsin.&#xD;
