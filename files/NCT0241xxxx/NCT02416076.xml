  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled, randomized and treated. Enrolled participants will&#xD;
      receive one, split-face Ulthera速 treatment on the face and neck using a Ulthera System&#xD;
      standard transducer on one side of the face and a Ulthera System prototype simulines&#xD;
      transducers on the other side of the face. Follow-up visits will occur at 90 and 180 days&#xD;
      post-treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and&#xD;
      at each follow-up visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, split-face, randomized pilot trial to determine the&#xD;
      clinical feasibility of the Ulthera System prototype simulines transducers, that is,&#xD;
      transducers which deliver two lines of treatment simultaneously (at once), in comparison to&#xD;
      the standard transducers which deliver a single treatment line, by collecting average pain&#xD;
      scores in the treated regions, as well as efficacy and treatment efficiency data. There will&#xD;
      be 3 study arms with each arm having 2 treatment groups. Enrolled participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two study arms, and one of two treatment groups within each study arm.to&#xD;
      determine which side of the face will be treated with Ulthera System standard transducers and&#xD;
      Ulthera System prototype simulines transducers and the energy level for treatment.&#xD;
      Participants will receive one dual-depth treatment at 4.5 millimeter (mm) and 3.0mm depths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical feasibility will be assessed based on comfort level of standard transducers versus&#xD;
      simulines transducers by comparing average pain scores obtained during study treatment.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be determined based on qualitative masked assessment of post-treatment&#xD;
      photographs compared to pre-treatment photographs and quantitative eyebrow lift measurements.&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction questionnaires will be obtained.&#xD;
