      In this experiment, the investigators will test the effectiveness of a two week 20x incentive&#xD;
      multiplier on the investigators' corporate partner's users who are (a) not notified about the&#xD;
      incentives in advance, and (b) notified about the incentives and their purpose. The&#xD;
      investigators will test which group shows the largest boost in walking during the two week&#xD;
      intervention and the most lasting behavior change.&#xD;

      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experiment, the investigators will test the effectiveness of a two week 20x incentive&#xD;
      multiplier on AchieveMint users who are (a) not notified about the incentives in advance, and&#xD;
      (b) notified about the incentives and their purpose. The investigators will test which group&#xD;
      shows the largest boost in walking during the two week intervention and the most lasting&#xD;
      behavior change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental conditions will vary the type and amount of information about incentives as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 1 - Uninformed: Users will receive 20x their usual incentives for two weeks,&#xD;
           but will receive no emails informing them about the incentive program. (They may find&#xD;
           out about incentives through the Achievemint platform.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 2 - Informed about Incentives and Purpose: Users will receive 20x their usual&#xD;
           incentives for two weeks, and they will receive emails informing them about the&#xD;
           incentives (one announcement before the incentives begin, and one email every two days&#xD;
           reminding them about the overall incentive program). These emails will contain&#xD;
           information about the incentives and the purpose of the incentives. Condition 2 will&#xD;
           most closely resemble the &quot;constant&quot; condition in the previous experiment. Roughly the&#xD;
           same initial announcement email will go out. The reminder emails sent every two days,&#xD;
           however, will include more information about the overall program incentives to maximize&#xD;
           the number of participants who learn about the incentive program at some point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mock-ups of the email announcements and reminders are shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incentives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' incentives will consist of multipliers for points offered via Achievemint.&#xD;
      Since the investigators found in the investigators' last experiment that the constant&#xD;
      incentives were the most successful, the investigators will offer these incentives to all&#xD;
      treated participants: 20x multipliers for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other details of the experiment will be the same as the previous experiment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of incentives: the investigators will offer incentives for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-intervention observation: the investigators will observe all treatment groups for&#xD;
           at least 30 days after the intervention.&#xD;
