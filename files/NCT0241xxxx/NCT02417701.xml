    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well sapanisertib works in treating patients with lung cancer&#xD;
      that is stage IV or has come back (recurrent) and has a mutation in the NFE2L2, KEAP-1, or&#xD;
      KRAS gene. Damage to these genes may cause the cancer to grow. Sapanisertib may stop this&#xD;
      from happening by blocking enzymes.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the overall response rate of the TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor sapanisertib (MLN0128&#xD;
      [TAK-228]) in stage IV squamous cell lung cancers or KRAS mutant lung cancers harboring&#xD;
      NFE2L2 or KEAP1 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the median progression free survival of patients in each cohort. II. To&#xD;
      explore the feasibility of performing reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA) in paired&#xD;
      snap-frozen core biopsies from patients in this study prior to MLN0128 (TAK-228) dosing and&#xD;
      during week 2 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the effectiveness of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in suppressing activation of mTOR and&#xD;
      PI3K signaling through the exploratory RPPA analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
