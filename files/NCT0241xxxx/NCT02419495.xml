      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor when given together&#xD;
      with several different standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimens in treating patients&#xD;
      with malignancies that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or&#xD;
      controlled with treatment (advanced). Selinexor may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Studying selinexor with different standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      or immunotherapy regimens may help doctors learn the side effects and best dose of selinexor&#xD;
      that can be given with different types of treatments in one study.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety and tolerability of selinexor when given in combination with&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine disease control rate, objective tumor response rate, and progression free&#xD;
      survival of selinexor administered with standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the correlation of translational biomarkers. II. To compare serial assessment&#xD;
      of mutation status in biopsies obtained at baseline and progression after clinical response&#xD;
      to combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the efficacy of olanzapine as incorporated in the National Comprehensive&#xD;
      Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and&#xD;
      cachexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selinexor. Patients are assigned to 1 of 15&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles, patients can&#xD;
      continue single agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive selinexor PO twice weekly (e.g. Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday&#xD;
      or Wednesday/Friday or Thursday/Saturday or Friday/Sunday) on days 1-14. Patients then&#xD;
      receive selinexor PO on days 1, 3, 8 and 10 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 8.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. After 8 cycles, of combination treatment, patients can continue single agent&#xD;
      selinexor until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and eribulin IV over 1 hour on days&#xD;
      1 and 8. Combination treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles, patients can continue single agent&#xD;
      selinexor until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15, doxorubicin IV over 90 minutes and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles, patients can&#xD;
      continue single agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM E: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
      and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles&#xD;
      depending on cancer type (6 cycles for non-small cell lung cancer, up to 8 cycles for ovarian&#xD;
      cancer and other histological malignancies) in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After 6 to 8 cycles, patients can continue single agent selinexor&#xD;
      until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM F: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
      and pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles, patients can&#xD;
      continue single agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM G: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 cycles, patients can continue single agent selinexor until&#xD;
      disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM H: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, irinotecan hydrochloride IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes, fluorouracil continuous IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on days 1&#xD;
      and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles, patients can continue single agent selinexor until&#xD;
      disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8 and 15 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over&#xD;
      90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 cycles, patients can continue single&#xD;
      agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)&#xD;

      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM M: Patients receive selinexor PO twice weekly (e.g. Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday&#xD;
      or Wednesday/Friday or Thursday/Saturday or Friday/Sunday) and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes&#xD;

      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARMS N AND O: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15, nivolumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1, and ipilimumab PO QD on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.&#xD;

      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue to receive selinexor and chemotherapy after confirmed progressive&#xD;
      disease in the absence of clinical deterioration and if the investigator considers that the&#xD;
      patient continues to receive benefit from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year.&#xD;
