      Purpose: Compare continuous adductor canal block (CACB) to Combined Spinal Epidural (CSE) for&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty in terms of mobility, post-operative pain, and analgesic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CACB will provide better mobility than CSE post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background/Scientific Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with varying degrees of pain post operatively&#xD;
      ranging from mild to severe despite the use of comprehensive multimodal analgesic regimens1.&#xD;
      Optimizing pain relief is vital for functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty2.&#xD;
      Peripheral nerve blocks have been commonly used to improve pain relief and reduce opioid&#xD;
      requirements. The addition of nerve blocks involving the femoral nerve have been shown to&#xD;
      provide superior pain control3 and shortened hospital stay compared to epidural or&#xD;
      intravenous patient controlled analgesia alone1. However, femoral nerve blocks can result in&#xD;
      quadriceps weakness leading to functional impairment and an increased risk of falling post&#xD;
      operatively4. Unlike Femoral Nerve Blocks (FNB), adductor canal blocks (ACB) are&#xD;
      predominantly sensory blocks which preserve quadriceps muscle strength and ambulation ability&#xD;
      better than FNBs, while providing equivalent pain relief5-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent randomized studies have also shown ACB to be superior to placebo in the setting of&#xD;
      spinal and general intraoperative anesthesia in terms of ambulation, pain control, and opioid&#xD;
      consumption10-12. In a recent retrospective cohort study, the addition of ACB to local&#xD;
      infiltration analgesia (LIA) was associated with further improvement in early ambulation&#xD;
      benchmarks and a higher rate of home discharge compared with only LIA9. While CACB and CSE&#xD;
      are used as part of routine care at Rush University Medical Center and around the country,&#xD;
      there have been no studies directly comparing CACB to CSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Department funded, single center, prospective, randomized, parallel outcome&#xD;
      based clinical trial. 300 subjects scheduled to undergo primary unilateral TKA will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive CSE, CACB + General, or CACB + Spinal as per routine care. Subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled for no more than 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis: Sample size calculations were based on the primary aim, of CACB plus Spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia versus standard care (combined spinal epidural, CSE) improving ambulation distance&#xD;
      at postoperative day 1 (POD1). Based on results from a pilot study we found that the CSE&#xD;
      group had at POD1 a mean distance traveled of 159 feet with a standard deviation (SD) of 111&#xD;
      feet, while the CACB + Spinal anesthesia subjects walked over twice the distance on average&#xD;
      with a similar SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be conservative we expect both the CACB + Spinal anesthesia and CACB + General Anesthesia&#xD;
      groups to walk at least 35% farther on average, or at least equal to CSE group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a one-way, 3-level AVOVA with the primary contrast of CABC + Spinal versus CSE at a&#xD;
      35% greater ambulation difference, for 90% power, with Î± of 5%, requires a sample size of 84&#xD;
      subjects per group. Increasing the sample size to 100 will provide for a 16% dropout rate.&#xD;
      Total of 300 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Intraoperative Anesthesia with standard post-operative Continuous Adductor Canal&#xD;
           Block (0.2% ropivacaine running at 6-8mL/hr) with standard post-operative analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Spinal Intraoperative Anesthesia with standard post-operative Continuous Adductor Canal&#xD;
           Block (0.2% ropivacaine running at 6-8mL/hr) with standard post-operative analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Spinal Intraoperative Anesthesia with standard Epidural (0.1% bupivacaine with fentanyl&#xD;
           5 mcg/mL running at 6mL/hr with 1mL q15 bolus) with standard post-operative analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics/Patient Specifics: Age, Sex, ASA score, Weight, Height, Operative Time, BMI,&#xD;
      Walker, Cane, Unassisted Ambulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks/Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined spinal epidural anesthesia, general anesthesia, and continuous adductor canal blocks&#xD;
      are part of routine anesthesia care at Rush University Medical Center and around the country.&#xD;
      Post-operative analgesia regiments are standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of general anesthesia include sore throat, nausea/vomiting, potential tooth damage,&#xD;
      vocal cord injury, mental confusion, awareness, stroke, death. Risks of regional anesthesia&#xD;
      (spinal) include bleeding (spinal hematoma), infection (meningitis), nerve damage, headache,&#xD;
      hypotension, difficulty urinating, and seizures. There is no difference between epidural&#xD;
      catheter and adductor canal catheter in terms of risks, other than the adductor canal&#xD;
      catheter carries no risk of headache. These risks are present regardless of the study since&#xD;
      either general or spinal anesthesia is used in all total knee arthroplasty procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only risk involved in participating in the study is the potential for breach of&#xD;
      confidentiality and/or privacy. Below is a description of the procedure for maintaining&#xD;
      confidentiality. There is no direct benefit to the participants in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Maintaining Confidentiality A breach of confidentiality and/or privacy is a&#xD;
      risk of this study. To prevent this, all collected data will be stored electronically in&#xD;
      password-protected files to protect patient identity and information. All information will be&#xD;
      collected and reviewed by the research team only. Data will be maintained on a&#xD;
      password-protected computer that will be accessible only to the study team. No patient&#xD;
      identifiers will be maintained in the database.&#xD;
