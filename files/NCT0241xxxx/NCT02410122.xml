    <textblock>
      While a fair amount of clinical data on Stargardt disease type 1 (STGD1) have been published,&#xD;
      very little is known about Stargardt disease type 4 (STGD4). The ProgStar 04 study is an&#xD;
      important opportunity to leverage the infrastructure, clinical trials sites, methods, and&#xD;
      central reading center of the ProgStar program to investigate the progression of STGD4 and&#xD;
      will help to establish patient cohorts worldwide for future clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PROM1 gene codes a protein called Prominin 1 (PROM1; also known as CD133 and AC133), most&#xD;
      known for its original use as a human stem cell-specific marker. In the retina, PROM1 is&#xD;
      involved in the formation and organization of disks within the outer segment (OS) of the&#xD;
      photoreceptors. It is within this particular region that most of the electrochemical signals&#xD;
      in response to light are generated (visual cycle-phototransduction). In STGD4, mutations in&#xD;
      the PROM1 gene result in a defective isoform of the PROM1 protein that becomes trapped in the&#xD;
      myoid region of the photoreceptors and cannot migrate to the OS site where disks are formed.&#xD;
      Ultimately, the absence of PROM1 in the OS affects the growth and organization of the disks,&#xD;
      which leads to disk malfunction and to vision problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many advances in genetic science have helped to recognize this variant of STGD, a&#xD;
      comprehensive description of the natural history, including the variability in cone and rod&#xD;
      dysfunction, of this STGD variant is not available. While there is no known treatment for&#xD;
      STGD at this time, the preparation for future therapeutic approaches and for planning&#xD;
      clinical trials must include an understanding of the disease itself, its variability, its&#xD;
      progression and its correlation with visual loss. Moreover, clinical trials that aim to slow&#xD;
      down the progression and/or to restore vision require validated outcome measures to prove&#xD;
      treatment efficacy. However, such outcomes have not been established for STGD overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the characterization of STGD4-specific clinical manifestations, progression and&#xD;
      prognosis as well as identification of outcome measures for clinical trials are critical to&#xD;
      develop new clinical trials for STGD4. Hence, ProgStar 4 is developed as a prospective&#xD;
      longitudinal observational study of patients with mutations in the PROM1 gene and a phenotype&#xD;
      consistent with STGD.&#xD;
