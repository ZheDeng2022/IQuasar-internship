  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether giving a Vitamin D supplement to vitamin D&#xD;
      deficient obese children and adolescents will decrease the risk of getting diabetes (Disease&#xD;
      in which the person has high blood sugar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of vitamin D deficiency in U.S. children and teenagers has grown dramatically over&#xD;
      the past 30 years. There are some reports suggesting that vitamin D supplementation in adults&#xD;
      with pre diabetes (blood glucose higher than normal) and vitamin D treatment will prevent&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;

      Participation will involve 3 visits (6 weeks apart) to the Clinical and Translational Science&#xD;
      Institute (CTSI), which should happen 2-3 weeks after you have consented to participate in&#xD;
      this study. The total duration of the study and the time you/your child will spend in the&#xD;
      CTSI will be 2.5 hours for each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of adolescents/children will enroll in this study:20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 A doctor will perform a complete physical examination. The child will have his/her&#xD;
      weight and height measured .Blood pressure and vital signs will check each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 2 hours spent in the hospital, 1/2 hour is allocated to getting measurements, weight,&#xD;
      and vitals and putting in an intravenous line and drawing fasting labs. The oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test will take about 2 hours. To test for insulin sensitivity (Risk marker of&#xD;
      Diabetes), oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) will be done. OGTT is used to diagnose Diabetes&#xD;
      and Pre Diabetes. The child will first have blood samples drawn, and then will drink oral&#xD;
      glucose soda. Blood samples will be obtained over 2 hours. A total of 5-7 teaspoons, which is&#xD;
      25-35 cc of blood will be taken during this test. Of this 15 cc will be drawn during the&#xD;
      OGTT. A doctor or nurse will be monitoring the child throughout the test. If he/she develops&#xD;
      low blood sugar, they will be treated appropriately with glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples obtained at the start of the OGTT will be used to measure various markers of&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, vitamin D level and marker of bone health as vitamin D deficiency can&#xD;
      causebone loss. This blood will be stored in the CTSI core laboratory in the CTSI for&#xD;
      duration of this study. The blood samples will be stored without child's name or any other&#xD;
      identifying information on them. The samples will be destroyed once the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the OGTT done, your child will receive a one time high dose of vitamin D (group A) or&#xD;
      placebo (capsule containing no medication) (Group B). This way of treating of low vitamin D&#xD;
      levels with one time high dose of vitamin D is safe and has been studied in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child has 50/50 chance to be in either group. Neither he/she nor you will know if he/she&#xD;
      is getting Vit D or placebo. At week 7, your child needs to return to CTSI for 2nd study for&#xD;
      physical check-up, blood test and urine test using the same method as the 1st visit. The&#xD;
      urine testing will be done to test for urinary calcium as this could be a sign of vitamin D&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 2nd study done, your child will be reassigned to alternate treatment group and will&#xD;
      receive either vitamin D or placebo. That means that if he/she was getting a placebo at the&#xD;
      first visit then he/she will get a real Vit D this time. If he/she was getting vit D at the&#xD;
      first visit, he/she will get a placebo at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 12 after completion of the 2nd course of medication, you and your child will have to&#xD;
      come back for the final blood and urine study using the same method as the first and 2nd&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this your child will have an oral glucose tolerance test, blood and urine tests. The urine&#xD;
      testing will be done to test for urinary calcium as this could be a sign of vitamin D&#xD;
      toxicity. If your child has high urine calcium he/she will not be allowed to participate in&#xD;
      the study We guarantee that your child will receive the treatment for lack of vitamin D&#xD;
      either the first half or latter half of the study. However, you will not know what medication&#xD;
      your child will receive during the entire study. We will set an appointment to see us in&#xD;
      2weeks at the Endocrine clinic; however, it will be not part of the study. We will go over&#xD;
      the results of the study at that time and will see if any further treatment with Vitamin D is&#xD;
      required for your adolescent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You and your child will have to come back to CTSI at the end of week 12 for post-therapy&#xD;
      study. After a minimum 10-hour fast, participants will come to the CTSI, during which your&#xD;
      child will have his/her weight and height measured. Blood Pressure will be measured. Post&#xD;
      vitamin D therapy OGTT. Vitamin D level and markers for bone health will again be measured&#xD;
      using same method as day 1. Urine will be collected for urinary calcium level, using same&#xD;
      method as day 1.&#xD;
