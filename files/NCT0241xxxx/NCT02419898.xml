    <textblock>
      The aim of this feasibility study is to test recruitment of participants into Phase 1 of the&#xD;
      study and then the re-recruitment and retention of participants in Phase 2 of the study. The&#xD;
      investigators will also be assessing the acceptability of recruitment strategy and data&#xD;
      collection to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of pre-pregnancy factors (biophysical, genetic, socioeconomic, behavioural and&#xD;
      psychological) on obstetric, cardiovascular, socioeconomic, behavioural and psychological&#xD;
      outcomes will all be examined.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to recruit 300 women. The investigators anticipate that a subset of&#xD;
      recruits will become pregnant during the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study with two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: A detailed characterisation of nulliparous women who have an address in&#xD;
           Oxfordshire or work in Oxfordshire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: Detailed assessment of events during and immediately after a first viable&#xD;
           pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Phase 1 visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation is explained by a research nurse/midwife, any questions are answered and&#xD;
           women, who agree, sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A questionnaire covering medical and family history, socioeconomic information,&#xD;
           behavioural factors and psychological measures will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline anthropometry - height, weight, hip/ waist ratio, USS measurement of fat (thigh&#xD;
           and abdomen), bioimpedence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular - pulse and BP (peripheral / central), arterial stiffness,&#xD;
           echocardiogram, carotid imaging and endothelial function (endo-check) tests are&#xD;
           completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting venous blood sample (maximum 40 mls) including whole blood for maternal DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivette&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a participant has become pregnant she is eligible to enter phase 2 of the study. Phase 2&#xD;
      involves 6 further visits at 7, 11-13, 18-20, 28, 34 weeks gestation and 3 months&#xD;
      post-delivery. During these visits repeated measurements of the above investigations will be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there will be a fetal ultrasound at 7 and 28 weeks and questionnaires at 7, 28&#xD;
      and 3 months post-delivery. An acceptability questionnaire will also be given to participants&#xD;
      following completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the feasibility study will be the date of the final phase 2 visit of the last&#xD;
      participant becoming pregnant during the feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By collecting the above data the investigators anticipate recording and reporting&#xD;
      longitudinal data in relation to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Incidence of obstetric complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, pregnancy induced hypertension,&#xD;
      antenatal and postnatal depression and preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Longitudinal variation in cardiovascular parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in longitudinal measures of blood pressure, carotid intima media thickness, pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity, cardiac structure and function and endothelial function from pre-conception&#xD;
      until 34 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Longitudinal changes in socioeconomic factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      By use of a questionnaire at pre-conception, 7 weeks gestation and 28 weeks gestation we will&#xD;
      record employment and relationship status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Longitudinal changes in behavioural factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      By use of a questionnaire at pre-conception, 7 weeks gestation and 28 weeks gestation the&#xD;
      investigators will record diet, weight control and perception, exercise, smoking, alcohol use&#xD;
      and drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Longitudinal changes in psychological factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      By use of a questionnaire at pre-conception, 7 weeks gestation and 28 weeks gestation the&#xD;
      investigators will record levels of anxiety, depression and quality of life and perceived&#xD;
      health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Longitudinal changes in the health status of participant and their family&#xD;
&#xD;
      By use of a questionnaire at pre-conception the investigators will record the participants'&#xD;
      medical and family history, reproductive and sexual history and pain perception. At 7 weeks&#xD;
      gestation and 28 weeks gestation the questionnaire will enquire about any changes or&#xD;
      additions to the participants' medical and family history as well as reproductive and sexual&#xD;
      health and pain perception.&#xD;
