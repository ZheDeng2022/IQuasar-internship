      Phase I trial to evaluate the safety of escalating dose levels of conjugated&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial that is designed to evaluate the safety of escalating dose levels of&#xD;
      conjugated panitumumab-IRDye800 used in subjects with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (HNSCC) that undergo surgery with curative intent. Safety data from this trial will be&#xD;
      studied to assist in the selection of dose levels of panitumumab-IRDye800 for future&#xD;
      research. It is hoped that this study will also help in finding better methods for&#xD;
      identifying cancer intraoperatively for a more complete surgical resection.&#xD;
