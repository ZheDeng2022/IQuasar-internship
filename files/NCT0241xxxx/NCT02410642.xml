    <textblock>
      NAG is a protein excreted in urine in cases of tubular damage, and is considered a biomarker&#xD;
      of kidney injury. Elevated urinary NAG is seen after cardiac surgery, but the clinical&#xD;
      significance, pattern of excretion and links to perioperative factors are poorly described.&#xD;
      We plan a study of the pattern of NAG-excretion during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass, and explore possible associated variables.&#xD;

      The standard biomarker of AKI, serum creatinine, has poor specificity and sensitivity in the&#xD;
      early phases of renal injury. Since the therapeutic window is likely to be in the earlier&#xD;
      stages before renal injury is manifest, there is a need for novel diagnostic methods. In the&#xD;
      recent years, several new biomarkers of kidney injury have been introduced. To date, none has&#xD;
      proven outstanding regarding precision in early detection of AKI. NAG&#xD;
      (N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase) is a lysosomal enzyme with high molecular weight. Due to its&#xD;
      size, NAG does not normally pass the glomerulus apparatus, but urine levels are elevated&#xD;
      after tubulus damage. NAG excretion in urine is seen in AKI after cardiac surgery, exposure&#xD;
      to nephrotoxic agents and after renal transplantation. However, its role in clinical&#xD;
      decision-making is yet to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to study the excretion pattern of urinary NAG during and after cardiac surgery with&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Association with perioperative variables will be explored.&#xD;
